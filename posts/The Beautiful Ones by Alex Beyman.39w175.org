** It seems to that, while it certainly wasn't what they were expecting, it's a lot better than it could have been. Unless they're dealing with some 4d geometry and they accidentally just mined into the other side of the same store, they've just doubled their supplies and space. Pretty valuable. Depending on whether or not its enough to attract honest work (and whether the rock is easier or harder to mine than concrete, and whether or not the PriceCos go on forever), they might be to hit a stride where they can expend less than all of the resources of one PriceCo to reach into another fully stocked one, and thus have a net positive.

An odd existence, but probably better than the doom that they were apparently guaranteed otherwise.

*** Still kind of a surprise to see my stuff turn up on other subs, but not a bad one.

If it wasn't obvious, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Calhoun#Mouse_experiments][this]] is the irl experiment that I based the story on. Some of the characters were intended to embody behavioral aberrations which manifested in the later stages of it.

**** Let's see, there's an absolutely unbearable weeaboo, a euphoric atheist, a hair-dyed SJW, a vegan veterinarian, a religious conservative libertarian no-gummint survivalist (although he doesn't agree to rationing, what kind of survivalist is he?!). And then there are two relatively normal people, a no-nonsense old dude and a spiffy if somewhat emotional entrepreneur chef.

If I had to guess, I would say these people were selected by their overall conformity to internet stereotypes. :P

Oh Jeffrey, Japanese doesn't have a plural form. You poor boy.

One thing I find strange and pretty typical to these sorts of scenarios are that things like Hell are serious hypotheses for their situation, and they're complaining about first-world problems like vegan meals, walking, and being thirsty WHEN THERE'S A FUCKING WATER FOUNTAIN RIGHT THERE, GODDAMMIT MELISSA.

Nice story!

The intended implication was that they were themselves products of the behavioral sink happening in society today. An alt ending I considered was to have them emerge into a major city only for it to dawn on them that they'd not genuinely escaped.

******** So from an in-universe perspective, what value was there in starting with such extreme characters? Assuming the journal is truthful (which I doubt a word is), they're trying to get people to not give up or wipe out. Why start that game on hard mode? Even a genuinely random selection of humans from the planet (let alone a single continent) would have a better chance at success than such a group.

I like the idea of your alt ending far better, as it addresses the biggest theme/question of the setting. The where-are-we/is-it-all-real bit is the engine, but the cultural disparity is at the heart of the piece's discussion. The ending gives zero resolution or acknowledgement of that.

**** May I critique? Neither Melissa nor Jeffery felt like real people but rather parodies, while the MC and the other women felt more nuanced. I would either time them down or the others up.

I mean they act in real life like people do when being intentionally over the top online.

** Great story.

The thing I found most confusing was the discovery of the records in the office. So many red flags there that would alarm me if I found them:

1. The crazy large 'attempt' count.
2. Coupled with (1), the duration of each experiment.
3. Why the hell would records be stored IN the experiment.
4. Assuming the records were placed there deliberately, you have to assume other groups found and removed them. Which means they were replaced by the overseers deliberately.

I assumed they were a diversion until the, uh, contents of the utilidor were discovered.

That raised even more questions. Why weren't the contents cleaned up? Oversight, deliberate, or falsified?

My assumption ended up being that this was a simulation. Loved the ending though, great point to quit.

** This reads like some sort of combination sanity/stubbornness test. One of the characters actually mentions close-quarters psychological testing experiments early on.

This also feels in many ways like 'Under the Dome' by Stephen King.

The existence of the records is not an accident. The shadow-people can disappear, there's no need for them to keep records physically present where the humans can find them unless they are intended to be discovered.

The new store at the end of the tunnel is an interesting twist though, but in story terms what does it mean?

I see two completely opposite potentials here. Either something very good or very bad.

Good: Benevolent actors are controlling the experiment. Is this an alien race trying to preserve humanity at some far future date after we've gone extinct, based on archeological remains and randomly grabbing humans out of time?

Bad: They have tunneled back into the original store. The experiment is malevolent in some way. They are assessing humanity's weaknesses.

Sure, there are lots of other interpretations possible, but there definitely seems to be some sort of experimentation occurring, and the notes about past experiments are odd.

Then again, perhaps the notes were written by a very bored writer from a prior experiment...

*** My personal assumption was that the participants were probably software of some kind. It's the only way I could readily resolve the apparent longevity of the experiments, the multiple attempts, and the apparent lack of care exhibited by the controllers. The controllers aren't particularly evil or good from their own perspective, they're just bored and trying to make a stable microsociety that lasts longer than a couple generations.

To me, the whole thing stinks of a science-fair project concerning minimal crew-sizes for generational starships. If I woke up inside this scenario, I would probably start to wonder if I was an off-the-shelf AI asset at some point.

**** This does seem to fit the details of the story reasonably well, but I'm having difficulty imagining why one would subject AI to this sort of experiment.

I mean, an AI good enough to think it is human? Why not make AI that don't think they are human, and who are more rational? For that matter, why not create AI that think they are human, but give them a mostly homogeneous background?

I suppose the experimenters might be using AI as a way to study human mental processes, without harming real humans. But if they understand human mental processes well enough to duplicate them... My head hurts :P

***** See the bit about "minimal crew sizes for generational starships" and "science fair". I just assumed that the characters were all human-based or human-derived AI running on the equivalent of the Sims.

In fact, if this story were to become popular enough, I could see it being a favored scenario in a Dwarf Fortress or Sims-like game.

********* I don't quite see what makes AI different. More specifically, if your premise (that a system understood well enough to be suitably modelled on a computer is understood enough to make a simulation of it unnecessary) is false for simple systems (e.g. phase transitions of the Ising model in three dimensions, or in polydisperse hard spheres), my prior is on that premise being false for AI.

You could say "yes but that's not a small sample size". Fine, take 5 bodies in gravitational interaction.

********** If you were to use an AI to model a human well enough that the AI doesn't even know it is an AI, you are building tools more complex than what you are studying.

To use your five bodies in gravitational interaction example, it would be like actually building a computer that fully models the five bodies, including having the mass and all other characteristics of the five bodies. Would you build a solar-system-sized computer to model the solar system?

** Fun story. The characters were certainly extreme, but not unbelievably so- these people certainly exist somewhere in America right now. All of them being on a train together would have been silly, but 'blatantly selected to be dumped together' is acceptable. All in all a great read.

My two biggest criticisms:

1. Andrew the Rationalist seems far less fractured and extreme than the rest; as Rationalist promotion it's great, but the character feels glaringly lacking in faults compared to his (mostly) extreme compatriots. Being a stickler for maps is not the same as Crazy Christian Redneck, Hyper-SJW, Otaku, etc. I'd like to see Andrew's faults being at least nearly as dangerous to group success as the rest.

2. There's no resolution to the big question of why these people were chosen. Not just any people, /these/ people. Why such extreme characters? If the goal is to get humans to establish a stable population, why start with such a giant handicap? What practical value or knowledge can that produce? Obvlously the handlers are at zero risk of discovery (what are the odds they'd be detectable by simple light tricks, dumb enough to walk into Andrew's trap, and just so happen to leave their past records in plain sight /In English/? The latter bit means that a. the files are completely untrustable, or 2. these are modern american/british controllers with hyper-advanced technology and a near infinite amount of time and resources. Very convenient.

But overall, loved the story. Definitely going to seek out more of the author's work, if possible!
