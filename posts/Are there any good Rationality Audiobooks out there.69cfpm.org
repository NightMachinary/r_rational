Besides HPMoR. Not sure if audiobook is the correct term but you get what I mean. I'm not big on reading.


** [[/u/raymestalez][u/raymestalez]] made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5us4xo/meta_rational_audiobooks/ddx4ufb/][a list a couple months ago of some.]]

In addition to what they listed, there's also a [[http://audiotwig.dauber.kim/][Twig]] audiobook, which is another book by Wildbow (writer of Worm).

Edit: [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1096][Also various shorter things from the same people that made the HPMOR audiobook,]] and a [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705][Metropolitan Man]] audiobook, which I realized weren't included in that list because I listed them in a different comment on that thread. I probably should have just linked that entire post, shouldn't I?

** The [[http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/We-Are-Legion-We-Are-Bob-Audiobook/B01L082HJ2/][Bobiverse]] series is pretty rational. It's about a kind of Tony Stark/Mark Watney type character who has his mind uploaded to a self-replicating Von Neuman probe sent out to explore the universe.

The character's hyper-competence may be taken to a slightly unrealistic extreme, but the books are otherwise pretty intelligently written, and definitely a fun read.

*** Seconding this, Bobiverse is definitely best described as The Martian but bigger.

*** I'm listening to it now, and the voice actor not knowing how to pronounce Archimedes is really starting to annoy me. Other than that, it's great.
