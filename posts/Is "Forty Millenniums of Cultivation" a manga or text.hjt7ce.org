I find both a text version and a manga online. So what is it?


** The manhua is a bit of a mess, especially the official translation. The novel has its issues too, but is definitely the definitive edition. The novel is the original and much further along.

*** Just reached ch 141 of the manhua and the English translation is pretty bad. Is the novel worth it? Also is the novel a web novel or a released novel like Light Novels?

**** It's a web novel. On the one hand, the novel is excellent, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/][for reasons well put here]]. On the other hand, the early English translations are not fluent, the story starts out weak, it can have atrocious pacing at time, and it's not completely immune to the tropes from the genre it tries to reconstruct.

When the story is good, it can be very strong. Thoughtful villains, trope awareness, sophisticated worldbuilding, machiavellian plots, genuinely clever tricks, thinking out loud, utilitarianist themes, economics. [[https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10156763190259228][It has Eliezer's recommendation.]] Just don't expect this to mean you'll necessarily enjoy it. It depends on your tollerance of the negatives.

** Why does it have to be only one or the other? It is a CN, likely with a manhwa adaption.

**** Chinese Novel. As opposed to KNs (Korean) and LNs (Japanese Light Novels)

** It's primarily a chinese webnovel, being translated into English on a daily basis. The manga adaptation is a long way away from approaching where the webnovel translation is currently at.

Instead of reading on webnovel.com, if that's where you found it, I recommend sites like [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/][WuxiaWorld]] or [[https://novelfull.com/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation.html][NovelFull]]. From everything I've heard, webnovel's administration is pretty scummy, so I have no compunctions with reading on an alternative site.
