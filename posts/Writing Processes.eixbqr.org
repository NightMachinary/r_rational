I wrote a[[http://www.thekingdomsofevil.com/?p=8218][little summary]]of the writing tools I learned last year by reading the essays and interviews of my favorite authors: Louis McMaster Bujold, Terry Pratchett, Greg Egan, and (thanks to this subreddit!) Sam Hughes. I haven't implemented everything yet, but the processes I have implemented made my writing orders of magnitude better.

  This helped me clarify my reaction to subversion in fiction and literary deconstruction. I can't stand them.

Would you care to elaborate on how the quote helped you achieve the insights above? I'm not familiar with these terms so I had to Google them first, but it seems subversion could be present in sci-fi that's exploring /unfamiliar/ concepts. My searches for literary deconstruction kept leading to Derrida's philosophy so I'm still struggling to relate literary deconstruction to sci-fi used only to crank out metaphors for familiar things.

*** (edited down to a less obnoxious length)

Thank you for the question. I may well be using the wrong words, and maybe you'll help me find the right ones.

The thing I can't stand is a quality in fiction where the author makes decisions so as to convert the reader to an ideology.

In the Greg Egan interview with the "microscope" quote, he talked about his decision to make the "female" aliens in his Orthogonal series fall into four pieces and die during reproduction. If he was the sort of author I can't stand, Egan would have made this decision in aid of a social thesis. The story would actually be a message in a symbolic code (I think this is called "subversion"). The reader, then, would be expected to slot "human woman" into the "female alien" symbol in the book to decrypt the author's message (I think this is called "deconstruction"). Or it may be that the reader is expected to subconsciously absorb the author's message, and find themselves converted to a new ideology without knowing it.

Please tell me whether I got the vocabulary right :)

In that "microscope" interview, he made the decision about alien reproductive biology because it would give his characters a problem they could solve with science. You might say that Egan was just substituting one ideology for another (feminism for posthumanism, I suppose?), but he wasn't. Egan writes honestly. He doesn't delude me about the solutions his characters come up with. He gives me a place I can safely visit, people I can be, whose problems I can learn from. That's what I want to read and write.

**** Let me try to again from a different angle.

What I can't stand is when the author wrote the book thinking "THIS'll show 'em!" People who disagree with the author are portrayed as stupid, evil, or insane. People in the author's group aren't wrong about anything important, they have no vulnerability, everything about them is attractive. It's clear who the good people and bad people are, and the message is strong that you, the reader, should be more like the good people.

I can't think of a good word for this kind of writing. "In-group" writing? "Judgmental" writing?

Bad writing. I think all authors do this to some extent, or start by doing this, but a good writer does it well enough that their strawmen bad guys appear to develop believable ideologies, points of view, and reasons, and so it stops setting the reader's teeth on edge.

***** Yeah, it seems like it's just bad writing to me. If you're not creating believable characters or you're not having them express their ideologies in understandable or relatable ways then you're not writing well.

Thanks for the replies!

****** Thank /you/! I feel like this conversation is getting somewhere.

I think that what I describe is bad, yes, but it's a very specific kind of bad. My wife suggests the word "posturing."

***** While I understand where you're coming from here, I don't think it's fair to try to use TvTropes as a standard to which definitions should be held.
