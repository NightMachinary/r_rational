Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I'm playing a level one Druid (of the natural laws) in Pathfinder. This is my first campaign, so I'm not too familiar wth the magic limits and science lore. I want to test out the limits of my level zero spells. GM said he approves of science and munchkinry attempts.

I would like some help in devising an experiment line up.

Rules:

I can cast a level zero spell once every six seconds, an unlimited number of times per day. I have seven days until the next adventure.

Spells I'm interested in and tests to do:

Purify food and water - "Purifies one cubic foot of food and water"

1. does purifying water get rid of visible particulates?
2. If (1)=no, how do I know water is pure? Are objects tagged with information about their state rather than having molecular properties?
3. If (1)=yes, are particulates taken out of water, or transmuted into water? Test volume and/or mass.
4. Test varying dirty water to mud. At what point does mud stop being water?
5. If (3)=transmuted, what happens to lead in water? Does mass or volume stay constant after purification?
6. If (1)=yes and (4) gives favorable results, what liquids can I purify? Some cultures consume blood, can I purify blood? a. blood inside something living? Would that cure disease or kill creature?

Mending - "Makes minor repairs on an object"

1. Can I repair a deliberately broken object? If no, I can't test further.
2. Will a whittled object be "repaired" to a block of wood?
3. Will a broken off piece or errant cut off a whittled object be repaired to the point of the original carving?
4. Does mend fill holes with new material?
5. If (4) =yes, can I mend a gold coin/ trinket to create more gold?
6. Can mend repair living things? Test rosewood armor/ green tree branches and work up to small cuts.

Light - "Object shines like a torch"

1. test size restrictions on object. Grain of sand? Boulder? Entire house?
2. Define "object." a. wet packed sand? Can it be broken apart and used as glitterdust? b. can part of an object shine? (Not sure if useful knowledge)
3. line of sight required? (Might be able to use as a lesser Faerie Fire to cancel concealment for team mates if I spot something first)

Create water - "Creates two gallons of water per level"

1. Pressure cannon? a. Air displacement if I create water in a sealed empty jar? b. water in pressurized bubbles on rocks or trees as land mines?\\

I have other spells available but these seemed like the most promising.

My goals as a character are to 1: understand the laws of nature, and 2: get battle techniques.

My goals as a player are to 1: get battle techniques, 2: understand the laws of magic and munchkin the hell out of them, and 3: RP entertaining enough stuff to get XP.

Edit: formatting post I made from phone to look ok on computer.

*** I'm thinking use 'mending' to smooth out glass or crystal to make high quailty lenses, or make them and remove the imperfections.

Then get your torch spells and make a laser. Average torch is 80 watts? Industrial cutting lasers are 1500 watts, that's just under 19 uses of the light spell.

My first though was feathers for a small and lightweight light source but you could use the spell on the crystals/lenses themselves. See how many you can get in a row.

I order to make the laser, I would need some way to make the light cohere. That would require sophisticated mirrors, I think. I could still focus the light to make a death ray (like the Mithbusters did.)

Going off of the feathers and needing 19 close packed torches, I could get a bit of loose-weave cloth and Light every thread as it's own torch. That way I could easily pack a bunch of torches in a small area for a higher powered torch.

***** I'm glad you like it.

Another thing to look into is if mending can be used to unseal something that has forcibly been broken/jammed shut. Especially if you can create water inside sealed objects.

The idea of using 'mending' to trigger a pressurised trap tickles me.

Then there's security applications; internal mechanisms in doors with a small component designed to 'break' every time the door is closed.

Or possibility for automation; If you break a piece of string holding a hinge open, would 'mending' the string force the hinge open again?

If you had string on both sides, would mending the string on one side forcibly break the other to allow the mending?

If so a magically toggled switch would have a tonne of useful applications.

Can you mend melting ice? What implications does that have for the thermal energy of the water?

If particulates from purified food/water are not transmuted, then where do they go? Are they annihilated? If so, you can experiment with creating vacuums. If they are moved out of the water, can you adapt that movement to generate usable power?

There are so many other ways to generate arbitrary amounts of power in Pathfinder/D&D. For example, the Light spell makes an object "shine like a torch." That's just flat energy with no need to be sneaky.

Now that you bring it up, I wonder how much thermal energy Light generates? It makes things shine like a torch, but do they shine in the infrared like a torch?

If it uses existing material that opens a whole new series of questions as well.

Like could you cut in half a bunch of gold coins and use it to spend on things, and then mend the broken pieces of gold to just immediately steal the gold back from out of the merchant's coffers.

Or you do something similar with a trigger. Have a sliver of metal or wood that blocks the activation of a trap. Mend the original object and the sliver of metal/wood disappears allowing the trap to activate.

Does mending display other objects? Like could you shiv someone with a piece of broken off wire, and men the wire while its inside of them and have new wire basically grow inside the person and displace all their internal organs?

*** Make new discoveries.

There are very probably techniques that become widely known in Narrow Field A which turn out very useful in Narrow Field B for some A and B - someone trained in A who then wanders into B can then apply this technique and find something new. Since your MC has been strolling through the library running his fingers along the spines of the books (or maybe not, that many in such rapid succession might overwhelm him) he's in a perfect position to apply such techniques repeatedly in many different fields, and gain a reputation as a scientific polymath.

What counts as a book? Can he read a piece of paper at a touch? A file? A sealed letter? If so, he can spy on any company by accepting a job in a mailroom, or spy on virtually everybody in the area with limited success by taking a job as a courier or a postman.

How does his power interact with an eBook reader?

**** Thanks for the thought-out response. Cross-domain applications did occur to me later, I just have to make it believable (since I'm not a cross-domain super-intelligence myself), without coming off as overpowered invention-X.

To clarify the other points:

Only paper (words printed on cellulose based matter) count as books. Ebooks & online articles don't count. Arbitrary, I know, but I didn't want him rising to world-breaking levels too soon. There is a fatigue cost. While assimilation is instantaneous, he feels as fatigued as cramming a real book. Too many books and he can faint. So he can't assimilate the library in half-a-day. Maybe in a few weeks or months. Yes, he CAN use it spy on sealed or closed documents. I had vague ideas of the intelligence agencies trying to recruit such a character for his spying abilities/threat. A job in a mailroom or as a courier is an excellent plot point. I didn't think of THAT. Thanks!

EDIT: Come to think of it, the courier/spy idea has so much potential for social drama!!! He learns all the sad/dirty secrets of his neighbors with unanticipated emotional impact, as he feels compelled to help them with his new found "polymath" powers . Ooooh... I am thrilled.

Well, /most/ cross-domain applications will start out as fairly esoteric and theoretical - he can write a paper on it, and maybe even figure out some of the application, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he can build a device to take advantage of it. The most likely result is that whenever he introduces himself to a scientist, the scientist will say something along the lines of "Oh, were you the one who wrote [paper in my field]? A most interesting read. Very innovative. You could go far as a [my field]ist. I see you've been dabbling in a few other fields too - if I may make the recommendation, you should probably drop the other fields and concentrate on [my field]."

Any "Invention X" type inventions should preferably be introduced early, and either explicitly kick off the plot or be no more than a slight, incremental improvement over what's already possible.

#+begin_quote

Okay, that's fair enough - ebooks and so on are significantly different in physical structure.

New question - what happens if someone keeps poking him with new books while he sleeps? Can he be kept permanently unconscious in such a way? Can he consciously turn off his power, or can someone who knows of his power check for his disguised presence by asking everyone in the room to touch a two-metre-thick 'book' filled with random letters and seeing who faints?

Okay I know this thread is a week old and the new thread is up already but it's only got one thing and this power interests me.

You said they understand the book if they understand the core concepts. Also that it's about as mentally taxing as having actually read the book.

So, what if a guy (like an antagonistic counterintelligence agent) floats out some communications they know will be intercepted with dummy information in a relatively complex cipher?

Now, maybe Bookworm doesn't know much about ciphers at first, but that's easy to get around with his power.

Then use the same cipher, preferably a rotating or changing one with several steps or stages to get to the final result that takes a lot of time to do even when you know the rules, and bind up a copy of The Odyssey or War and Peace or whatever.

Would the complexity of the code and the intermediary step of having to "translate" everything increase the mental fatigue?

*** One cool perk would be the ability to quickly learn any languages that have a translation dictionary.

A high paying job that might help him fund more involved efforts would be to become a good corporate lawyer by finding loopholes in large legal or regulatory volumes.

With these powers the first thing he should do is go to a library, and just move up and down every isle touching every book.

After he has the low hanging fruit he should prioritize finding books that would take someone a long time to read and slowly understand. Any complex mathematics books would be great.

With any spare money he gains he should be paying people to publish books of material that is only available online. (he might want to find out he minimum requirements for what counts as a book, so that he can absorb it. If a kindle or some kind of electronic device can count he could rather quickly start assimilating the majority of human knowledge.

With the accumulated knowledge of human experience, he can begin writing some top quality pop songs. As his songs become more popular he will eventually be able to arrange a meeting with Taylor Swift to help her on her new album. Finally his goals will have been achieved, and he can do whatever he wants afterwards.

But if I can bend things that aren't supposed to be bent - if I shake someone's hand, can I twist their bones into uncomfortable shapes? Or suddenly override their mouth and have them say what I want them to say (as long as I maintain contact)?

** You have the ability to split the timeline in two, where at the moment of the divergence one timeline is considered prime and the other branching, and each version of you knows which is which. The you in the prime timeline can create more branch timelines, and the you in the branch timeline can collapse the branch timeline. This means there is one prime timeline and an arbitrary number of branch timelines, and none of you can know for certain how many branch timelines exist. The prime you is not notified when a branch you collapses their timeline, and a branch you is not notified when a new branch is made.

This lack of easy communication is because the only information that can be transferred between timelines is /emotional states/. Any you in either type of timeline can sense the collective emotional state of every you (yourself included), and each you contributes to the collective. The more intense an emotion, the greater an effect it has on the collective, so a sharp spike of fear in one you might make the collective emotional state feel like fear even if there are ten you's contributing.

From a starting position of prime you and no branches, how do you most efficiently utilize your ability to gain knowledge and power in the prime timeline? Keep in mind that the you's in branch timelines may be hesitant to collapse their timeline, and you have no way to force them to.

*** Wait does collapsing a branch timeline just merge their consciousness back with the prime (presumably carrying back memories) or what? I mean if not then I can't imagine anyone who's not suicidal would ever have any branch collapses.

Anyway if collapsing branches brings memories back to the prime then things are a hell of a lot easier, but if not then you will have to limit the number of branches to have any hope of communicating effectively over the background noise.\\
The best communication technique would be to just use series of emotion states as a particular code to send information, with messages being prefaced with the code of that branch (and nobody communicating while someone else is sending a message) the message would be repeated until the prime gave the understood signal.\\
You would all collect a bunch of videos, pictures or even just thoughts that could easily be used to elicit particular emotional. Then you would deliberately evoke particular emotions in certain orders (if you're really good at quickly switching emotions then you could even encode meaning into the timing) to send something like really slow morse code (it would have more bits, but it would also take a while to send anything).

If collapsing branch timelines means oblivion for those branch forks then you have to work out the communication system before you create any splits and your actions will be far more limited.

If you can just collapse your branch without killing yourself then you can do all kinds of risky things in order to obtain information, then just collapse the timeline escaping any consequences and merging back with the prime. If not then you're limited by the fact that none of the branches will want to do anything too unpleasant or dangerous.

**** Collapsing the branch timeline would not save the memories of the branch you, which leads to the inherent risk that if you create a branch timeline, even if you can decipher its messages, the you there may decide they don't want to die, making future communication blurry.

The main way I see around that is convincing yourself that you don't get enough time to diverge meaningfully from the original, and thus collapsing your timeline isn't a 'death' even as it is a 'duty'. That would allow you to do quick information-gathering splits without winding up with branch timelines you can't do anything about.

#+end_quote

That seems like a bit of an understatement, I'd go further to say if you aren't suicidal there's zero chance of any branch you's collapsing their timeline.\\
The whole "if there's a copy close enough to the original in existence then it's not death" would only work if you (and thus the copy) was gullible enough to believe that. Since memories don't transfer it's blatantly obvious that your subjective experience ends when you destroy the timeline, and there's no distinct causal connection between forks when someone dies so whatever neural processes were generating /your/ experiences are just gone. Still even if you actually thought about it you might still be able to get things to work if you care more about whether some iteration of you fulfills your goals and didn't care about how that affects your personal anticipated future experience.\\
Another issue with caring about other iterations of yourself as much as your own life, is that if there's a multiverse then there's infinite versions of your, so that logic dictates death means nothing. Plus it raises the question of why you should care more about these particular copies of you than all the others.

Given available information it seems like honestly the best ways of using this are to create a small enough number of branches as to still be able to clearly pick out communication over noise, then have different iterations do different things. For instance once you diverge some versions of you are going to stumble upon interesting things which they will know the others will find entertaining or useful. You may split up studying somewhat and then transmit certain condensed versions of the info that will let you learn it faster than otherwise.\\
Still the clunky communication method is a serious limitation, so you would probably want to figure out some method of training that will let you more easily switch emotions, and induce stronger emotions at will (because that means you can tolerate more noise, thus you can make more branches).

Oh wait, holy shit I can't believe I totally missed the implications of this power.. jesus christ you can do so much more.

Ok so first find some groups that give out prizes for demonstrations of supernatural abilities, then prove your abilities and become extremely rich and famous from being the only known person with powers.\\
A demonstration that comes to mind is having the versions of the testers in both world use encryption methods (that could never be broken without computer assistance) to send messages back and forth through you, and further they could probably use that to send information that only the testers could know so they know you haven't just figured out some amazing codebreaking trick.\\
Once you do that then your abilities can actually be massively useful on a global scale, because they'd be so useful you can probably get some agency to make some kind of transcranial stimulation device in order to massively improve transmission.

Ok so here's some things you could help the world with:

- Policy experiments, both iterations of a government agree to try two or more different policies (or they do it by chance due to divergences between timelines) then they can compare the results and there will be no serious dispute over the results.
- Research, different timelines take turns conducting research, and share the results. This means all the timelines can get the effects of spending much more on research than any individual timeline does.\\
- Prediction, due to random butterfly effect divergences different timeline will have different events occur, or happen at differing times. So if one timeline has a terrorist attack, architectural failure, etc then other timelines can potentially learn from that and act on it without having to experience a disaster themselves.\\
- Existential risk aversion, different timelines would agree to slightly stagger certain decisions (or things would happen at different time just due to divergence) so if one timeline has a nuclear war others can potentially avert it. Same thing goes for bioweapons and all risks except GAI. With GAI the risk is no less because if the GAI figures out the existence of this communication (which it certainly would if it got any info about the world) then it can almost certainly hijak my mind and use that to get all other timelines to create it.\\
- Processing splitting, pretty similar to splitting research across timelines but different timelines split up computational work. This may not be of much use pre singularity, but it would be of massive use to a GAI friendly or not so it would probably alter your mind so the information bandwidth is increased arbitrarily. Then GAI can split up processing between a massive number of iterations of it.\\
- Violate thermodynamics, it seems like with the right maxwell's demon style setup (using timelines that just split so they're similar enough for this to work, or it figures out how to transmit info on quantum states uncollapsed through the communication) you could get many timelines create many version of these type of setups. Then you can get the results (which let you extract energy) of many systems, while only spending the energy to get information about one particular system, thus violating the landauer limit.

******* Yeah once I stopped using the cached thoughts I would use for most CYOA's, I realized this is nearly exactly the same as a setting I made wherein you could open up portals to parallel worlds that would be exactly identical until they started diverging soon after opening the portal, except this is communication only and has a very crappy communication system.

Still the things I had thought of in that setting, like splitting research costs work the same (though other things like having different worlds produce different TV shows and either airing both of them or having both timeline's air the one with better ratings doesn't work with this crude of transmission).

Anyway you should expect tech to advance quicker with this power, and for the world to be better in a number of ways as a result of the things I mentioned in my answer.

*** Create branch timelines, try to seek out pleasure and happy experiences as much as possible while attempting to avoid pain and suffering.

I'm not suicidal, though I might be if I was suffering enough pain. Pleasure seeking can be shared across timelines, so I can increase the happiness of all timelines by just trying to plug in as much pleasure to the overall mental state as possible.

I'd also try and create as many branch timelines as possible. I prefer existence to non-existence, so its reasonable to assume that all the potential mes will also have the same preference.

If I was smarter and thought there was something I could figure out by sending only a few yes/no signals a night in the form of pain/pleasure signals than maybe I'd do that, but nothing comes to mind.

** Congratulations, you've been selected to beta test the new Deluxe reincarnation package! Henceforth, when you die, you will retain your consciousness as well as your soul into your new life.

RULES:

- Your consciousness includes your memories, beliefs, values, continuity of subjective experience, and so forth.\\
- The deal does not specify what is meant by your "soul", but it's implied that it's not new, and that reincarnation has already been occuring naturally; this is just an upgrade to what would've happened anyway.\\
- For our purposes, "death" refers to the cessation of all coördinated biological functions. If you become a vegetable, you can't reincarnate until someone pulls the plug.\\
- There's a magical no-cloning theory at play. Once you reincarnate, any information left in your old brain is irrevokably scrambled.\\
- No one's brainstates are overwritten; your new body is selected at conception, and your consciousness is gradually transfered to your new brain as it develops.\\
- Only bodies of the same species are eligible candidates. This is determined based on the body you're leaving, not your "original" body, so you don't have to worry about the human species evolving into incompatibility.\\
- Your biological development is not affected. Good luck doing anything useful for at least a couple years.\\
- Of course, the transfer can't happen any faster than light speed.\\
- Your new body is selected so as to minimize this travel time.\\
- In ordinary circumstances, this just means the next available body, but may in extreme cases involve waiting briefly for one to show up closer.\\
- The above only applies if the body's appearance could in principle be predicted based on the current state of the universe. No shenanigans with prime numbers and petri dishes at the ready.\\
- You're not the only one with this ability; an unspecified but small fraction of humanity is participating in the trial along with you.\\
- If all goes well, this will be rolled out for all of humanity, either as the standard form of reincarnation or as a perk for good karma.

** A representative of an alien race comes to you and informs you that, as part of a test of mankind's capabilities, you will be transported to an alien planet, and will be tasked with escaping from that planet. You have one year to assemble a team, at which point you will all be teleported to this new planet.

*RULES:*

- You're not allowed to bring anything with you, just your team. You arrive naked and carrying nothing, and will have to work your way up from very simple tools.
- It's heavily implied that the survival of the species is on the line, so you more or less have your pick of anyone you want to join your crew.
- Because of the gravity of the situation, things like state secrets aren't an issue; you have access to any classified information which you can give a reasonable justification for needing.
- However, because you can't bring anything, the information you take with is limited by how much you and your team can collectively memorize.
- The destination planet has been selected as one that can easily support human life. It has a mostly temperate climate, and most of the flora and fauna are edible, but exactly which ones you'll need to figure out for yourself.
- There's no hard time limit, but escaping quickly will result in a higher score, and therefore a higher chance of survival.
- There's no strict cap on your group's size, but a group that succeeds with fewer people in the same amount of time gets a higher score. In addition, there are the typical difficulties with scale as the size of your group increases.
- Simply getting out of the atmosphere, or even into orbit, doesn't count; you need to escape the planet's gravity well.
- Furthermore, you have to be alive when this happens, and your aim is to get as large a percentage of the team off the planet as possible.
- In the event that this becomes a multigenerational effort, "the team" will be considered to consist of the entire human population of the planet. You're free to reproduce like mad in an attempt to up your labor force, but keep in mind that this would also mean you need to transport that many more people off of the planet.
- The aliens are watching, and don't take kindly to cheaters and wise guys. If, for example, you genocide everyone but the pilot just before launch and try to argue that 100% of your team escaped, humanity will be immediately disqualified, with whatever consequences that entails.

How would you plan your escape? Whom would you add to your team, what information would you endeavor to collect, and what steps would you take upon arriving on the alien planet in order to eventually get off? You have the benefit of modern science and engineering, but don't start with modern equipment.

*EASY MODE:*

Disregard the memorization requirement. The aliens provide you with a read-only archive of the Internet as of the day you left Earth. This isn't intended as a "tool" /per se/, but rather as a catalog of humanity's accumulated knowledge. As such, Google Calculator won't work, but a lookup table will.

*HARD MODE:*

Your team arrives scattered randomly across the land of the planet. You need to find each other first before you can get much done.

** You are given a cardboard box and told that one week from now, the box and all of its contents will be transported 500 years into the past.

*RULES:*

- The box is a cardboard cube, roughly half a meter on each side.

- The box is moved in time, but not moved much in space. The time travel mechanism has a minimal level of intelligence, so everything is relative to Earth, and it will try to put the box somewhere where it will fit and can be supported. If the box's exact location would put it inside a solid object, it materializes somewhere nearby.

- The box can only appear where no one is looking.

- As such, you can choose where the box appears, but only if you can travel there (or have the box transported there) in the present. It would be advisable, therefore, to keep the weight to something you can lift.

- You can put anything into the box which you can get access to within the time limit.

- The box needs to be able to closed in order to go back in time. If you dump a huge stack of books into the box such that the lid cannot close, nothing happens at the end of the week.

What do you put in the box, and where do you put it, to have the greatest positive impact on the course of history?
