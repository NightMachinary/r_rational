** Freeing a king from mental compulsion only to find out that he's been under mental compulsion his whole life is an amazing idea that I've never seen done before - and which I wish had been given a better treatment here.

** It seems likely that the various Milo pseudo-relatives will cease to believe that they are his relatives, as I can't think of another reason for the first segment. But what purpose would that serve? Milo seems set to meet Bellatrix fairly soon, and after that he'll probably return to the HP!World, and I can't see the army siding with Bellatrix now her control is broken. Anyone have any ideas?

** I like the chapter. Interesting, are Philosopher's Stones from DnD compatible with HP ones?

*** D&D Philo stones are one use. You can make a potion of /True Ressurection/ by crushing it up and mixing it with an existing healing potion, or transmute 1000 lbs of lead into 1000lbs of gold.

The ratio in our world is about 20,300:1 Gold:Lead value, so that nets you a mere $20,000,000 US per stone. I can't help but feel that 'bring back the dead, time limit : 200 years' is worth more than that, especially since there are many ways to get more gold, but not a lot to get /true ressurection/.

** It's very funny and very entertaining. I just wish the individual snippets weren't so short. But I certainly can't complain about how quickly he's putting the chapters out.
