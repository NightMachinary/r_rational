*Non-cognitivism:* Moral statements don't express propositions and can neither be true nor false. "Murder is wrong" means something like "Boo murder!".

*Error theory:* Moral statements have a truth-value, but attempt to describe features of the world that don't exist. "Murder is wrong" and "Murder is right" are both false statements because moral rightness and wrongness aren't features that exist.

*Subjectivism:* Some moral statements are true, but not universally, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by non-universal opinions or prescriptions, and there is no non-attitudinal determinant of rightness and wrongness. "Murder is wrong" means something like "My culture has judged murder to be wrong" or "I've judged murder to be wrong".

*Substantive realism:* Some moral statements are true, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by mind-independent moral properties. "Murder is wrong" means that murder has an objective mind-independent property of wrongness that we discover by empirical investigation, intuition, or some other method.

*Constructivism:* Some moral statements are true, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by whether an agent would accept it if they were undergoing a process of rational deliberation. "Murder is wrong" can mean something like "Societal agreement to the rule 'do not murder' is instrumentally rational".

I guess I've never really thought in depth about meta-ethical views. I had an opportunity to think about how I thought today.

I'm not a utilitarian because I genuinely feel like helping everyone (I mean, I do, a little bit) but because it's the practical equivalent of getting someone to pick "cooperate" in the prisoner's dilemma because it's superior in the long run, since they know other people would act similarly.

Quesiton 4: "What sex were you assigned at birth?" is a stupid question.

You were not assigned a sex at birth. There was no choice. You developed with XX or XY chromosomes.

Now, GENDER is something that we can argue all day about, and people do fall on a spectrum of gender behaviours, but Sex is yes/no, Male/Female.

You were not /assigned/ your M/F operator at birth, you were literally born in configuration M / configuration F.

**** You want to get off that high horse? It seems to be digging into your ass.

Sex determining region Y, typically found on the Y chromosome, part of the protein binding process that helps determine if you get male or female sexual organs, and the malformation of the gene can cause syndromes where the organism has a typically male or female karyotype but the opposite genitals.

Since sexual characteristics play such a large part in the development of the brain (due in no small part to hormonal release), your sex is still determined by your plumbing, while your gender is a spectrum with traditionally masculine elements on one side and traditional female elements on the other.

Still a stupid question.

You can also have different DNA in different body parts.

And even with same DNA and no "strange" mutations you can develop different genitalia and different body plan (ans obviously - different sexual orientation and gender identification) depending on various factors (like hormones level, and different sensitivity of fetus to these hormones).

**** If XX and XY are the "most common" specimens, and the rest occur at a rate no lower then 1 in 500, going as high as 1 in 50,000, I would argue that at that point you can classify XX/XY as the norm, and the rest as aberrant variants of.

Having different genitalia from what your hormones say you should is a well-studied phenomena - it's referred to as "gender dysphoria" and is considered a condition to be treated, not a "well, sucks for you, weird gene person".

I don't see the relevance of bringing up differently-DNA body parts for this discussion. I was under the impression that, when we say (X)'s DNA, we mean "the majority of X's DNA sequence". Please clarify how this datum is related.

My point was - there's no obiovus way to define biological sex for corner cases, and no reason to throw away data from them.

That's why "what sex you were assigned" is IMHO a more reasonable question, than alternatives trying to strictly define biological sex.

Functioning genitals are a pretty good indicator of X/Y, but I can see your point for intersex "ain't got anything that works" cases.

I would argue against labeling it as "assigned", because "assigned" both indicates the intentional removal of agency (I hereby assign you to be [thing]), as well as implying there was a choice in your biological makeup (which is currently untrue, though it may be true later when gene editing can be done to developing fetuses for designer babies).

I would say that a properly worded question 4 would be "Which biological sex were you identified as at birth?", because that's literally what happens when you come out of the hole; a doctor picks you up, checks the plumbing, and announces "It's a boy/girl/totadile!"
