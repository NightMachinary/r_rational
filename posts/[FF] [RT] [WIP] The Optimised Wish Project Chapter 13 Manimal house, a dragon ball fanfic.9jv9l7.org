***** There are some, but one I can disclose because it's canon: the transformed entity can't be stronger than the original. So basically he can't become, say, a tank and roll through the walls of a house because he wouldn't be able to output that level of power.

******* I'm going into this more in detail in chapter 15, but as a general rule he has to keep his own integrity. It's not dissimilar from animagus or other transmutations in HPMOR, though with a bit more tolerance re: changes undergone while transmuted. Liquids, gases, explosives are pretty much a no-go. He could go nuclear if he thought of it but it'd be a last-ditch suicidal attack. Also he retains sentience, but his abilities are otherwise connected to the item he transformed into. If it doesn't have locomotion means, it can't move. If it doesn't have any way to produce sound, it can't speak.

******** Interesting. Not sure if you want to reveal all of the details, but if you don't mind I'm curious.

What if the device can perform computation(I asume he doesn't know enough of the computer to do other things)can he do stuff like having an integrated calculator and doing complex math on his head? Or at least have a working computer.

Can he turn into things that don't exist yet if bulma gives him schematics ?

Can he turn into things that use external power , like for example could he turn into a railgun and shoot if he was connected ?

Can he turn into things that need electricity plus a generator?

********* Ok, keeping in mind that this is an /incredibly/ munchkin-able ability I would never have thought even including in the story if it wasn't canon, and in fact I have tried nerfing a bit because it's ridiculously OP to begin with - so I really hope what I do with it will feel reasonably satisfying and not too plot-convenient, or that I won't miss any obvious exploits. I'll put this under spoilers:

********** I think you are doing fine. You definitely don't have to consider all the crazy exploits the subredit's combined mental power could think of , only the obvious ones plus some non obvious ones that Puar might think of. Energy limits tends to prevent a lot of exploits(mostly because its crazy to ignore conservation of energy on the first place, even if most magic systems do).

Though just one thing , can puar loose small bits of himself when transformed and be fine? I mean dong it repeatedly might kill him , y and the parts might revert whith him when he untransforms.

But maybe he can make self replicating nanotech(well I mean technically turning into a plant whith seeds and then planting them is creating self replicating nanotech, or even turning into something plus a few bioengeniered bacteria)

*********** I'd say there's a rough mapping from transformed to normal body, so if he loses a small bit, he might find himself without a finger. Self replicating nanotech wouldn't be a "single" part in any sense of the word so it's a no go. He could become a single nanomachine able to replicate itself from surrounding matter, but without a design to take inspiration from that probably still exceeds his mental abilities.

He's awkward but sociable- well visible from his talk with Goku and recognition of the fight that was about to start.\\
Also well aware and concerned with (social) situation around him- like the sleeping quarters and other questions.

Puar worries me. Power and knowledge will only fuel one another. Possibly one of main villains of this arc?

******* Additional note after some googling, it looks Luna park was a common term used in the early 20th century. Apparently Coney Island had one too, and Australia had 3, however the Sydney one appears to be the only one still in operation.

Also, I didn't mind the language slip at all, I'd have never guessed you weren't a non native speaker or Italian from what you've written so far!

******* Huh, I roomed with an Italian while In the US and he never let the phrase slip when we went to six flags. And he could barely speak English.

Makes sense, Australia has a strong Italian diaspora and the founding of Luna park could easily have been from an Italian immigrant.

***** He didn't spend one year looking for the Dragon Balls, that was just a few days. Then a few months before the Tournament. Actually going to retcon that because in canon Toriyama didn't properly account for a whole year before the time Pilaf summons the dragon and when Goku goes chasing after the balls and butts head with Red Ribbon.

(this makes me realise I should pay more attention to this stuff, like keeping track of the season and weather!)
