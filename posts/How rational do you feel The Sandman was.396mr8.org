The Neil Gaiman series, if that needed clarification.

EDIT: I should clarify that I wasn't asking with reference to the cosmology, but to characters and actions. "Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being 'good' or 'evil'", &c.


** Not very rational, but that's more because the characters were believably irrational - they had that element of myth and mystery. It's a pretty wonderful piece of work, though.

** I wouldn't call Sandman a rationalist fiction. However that doesn't mean the work was without merit. The series is an exploration of human nature through the use mythic and occult imagery. It still has a lot to so say even though its not strictly rational.

You should also read Lucifer the spinoff series if you enjoyed Sandman.

** It was arational. It was an exploration of myths as the fundamental bbuilding blocks of the universe, and the personifications of experiences that are fundamental to life as we experience it, but have no connection to material physics.

*** The lack of connection to 'material physics' has nothing to do with rationality or lack thereof; give me magic and I'll work with magic.

I agree with you that the work is arational, but that's because none of the mythic characters and few of the mortals have consequentialist desires in the sense of visibly wanting particular future outcomes. To write rationalfic in the setting, you'd either need to insert a human protagonist that wanted the future to have some particular property, or drastically change the character of one of the mythic characters.

** Though not doing so with "good" and "evil", other values and beliefs were certainly arbitrarily defined and used to further reality-as-myth.

Otherwise, the caring and rational Death would be working to put itself out of (most of) a job by, say, giving Dream some hints to drop into mortal life extension and anti-aging scientists' minds at night.

*** Assuming that Death cared about long lives. That doesn't appear to be a priority of hers though, from what I recall. She seems interested with easing the transition, but that doesn't necessarily imply that her value system cares about keeping people alive (especially since, IIRC, people really do go to the afterlife).

No. That's not the assumption being made here. Look deeper.

Death in the /Sandman/ series isn't a fan of people dying. "She" just accepts it. But not because of a love of the process, she appears apathetic to it, but because she doesn't have any real goals of her own. Death regularly becomes human for a day just to remind herself what humans are like, yet afterward she never tries to improve her experiences or those of other intelligent beings.

She is shown to like humans and humanity enough to revel in their culture and care about individual people one by one as they die, but not enough to do anything about their struggles, or even any problems that get in the way of the cultural developments and positive humanist messages she personally claims to enjoy. Developments driven by the same people that pointless, meaningless deaths squash out constantly.

In this system where powerful immortals do and create fuck-all and are impressed by human-scale creations, more, longer sentient lives equals more Mary Poppins-es and shades of black eyeliner to entertain Death. She's not /reacting/ rationally even if she doesn't care about humans living long lives. Even if she were stupid or irrational (for a good reason) about this, she'd act differently if she were a logical being capable of acting on personal goals.

Death in /Sandman/ is presented as just a puppet for natural forces, she sort of is just a natural force, so she doesn't do anything about it--not even justifying her own lack of actions with a vague greater good excuse. That's not very rationally presented, but is rather simply romanticized and anthropomorphized because that's the story; nothing about that is explored or extended one step further than that.

*Positive* afterlives aren't described well enough to judge, but the number of people who would end up going to bad ends by rational inspection of the environment presented are...not good for final moral judgement of a rational immortal being responsible for taking care of everyone and anything that dies anywhere in the universe. If not malevolent or seriously impotent, Death in /Sandman/ can't be a rational process, let alone a rationally-constructed (let alone personally rational) character. Even a consensus reality afterlife smorgasbord screws atheists and other non-easy-infinite-paradise people really, really hard, and for no mechanically logical reason. This doesn't jell with Death as presented.

/Sandman/ examined rationally and canonically, with no other changes and just a focus shift, is pure, inescapable eldritch horror. Uncaring omnipresent beings of unimaginable power ruling over abstract processes that render intelligent beings' goals, and even lives, completely meaningless. Focusing on one listless git's journey amidst all that that is not rational fiction.

***** Ah. It's been awhile since I've read it, and I forgot about some of those aspects (of Death especially).

Thanks for taking the time to spell them out instead of going "Go read the Wikipedia articles, you idiot!"

(Which you would have been totally justified in doing, I might add)

***** The problem with dealing with the Endless in general is that the personality is always a slave to their nature.

Death, no matter how much she likes someone, is always going to be the last one standing in the end.

Destiny is always going to be helpless to change any fate he sees.

Desire is always going to going to be a slave to every whim, pleasant and unpleasant, kind and cruel that occurs to ... (hir? Desire is also always going to be havok to pronouns)

Even Destruction, in denying his nature and embracing creativity is buggered. Every thing he makes during his appearance is effectively useless. The large dinner he makes, no-one eats. The art he makes, has only an uncultured dog to appreciate it...

It's ultimately a story about Dream getting pissed off about it, and changing it in the most direct way he can. (Which isn't direct at all tbh)

****** If taken to the logical conclusion, that devolves the entire story into non-sentient, abstract parts of the universe talking to each other and generally faffing about. Which is...ehh, different I guess. But if anything, that's even less rational a story than more anthropomorphic interpretations.

I think the idea was that their powers and duties were formed as part of some collective reality. Doesn't explain why they wouldn't use those powers to achieve immortal-scale personal goals, so that is still pretty sub-rational.
