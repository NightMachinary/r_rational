This time we'll be doing *Memory Modification*. Your challenge, should you chose to accept it, is to write a story which involves the alteration of memories in some way, whether through memetics, anti-memetics, erasure, neural tinkering, or anything else. It's a good chance to try out some alternative narrative structures or play with presentation to the audience.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, October 5th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge will be *Elves*. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter][See the TVTropes page here]], but as always the prompts are to inspire, not to limit, so pick whichever elves you'd like to do your own take on. Reading recommendations include /The Nightmare Stacks/ by Charles Stross and /Lords and Ladies/ by Terry Pratchett, but obviously the ur example of elves is /The Lord of the Rings/ by J.R.R. Tolkien. If you're looking for things to rationalize, you might want to think about the eleven mindset, the types of societies that would form is people lived for hundreds of years, and cross-species politics. Or write about the Keebler elves, I don't know, I'm not your boss.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/5.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53w4an/challenge_companion_memory_modification/][available here.]]

*** Note that the fourth paragraph, describing the official records of the war, does not update properly; it should change the initial Eastasia reference to Eurasia.

Also, since the change appears to be based on when elements lose visibility, you can play with it by zooming out (thus reading the whole thing without it changing) or in (thus making early references change before later ones do).

Cool effect though :).

**** Yeah, it's an effect of the javascript scrolling. If you zoom in and scroll down more (or if you use a smaller screen), it'll update properly.

(It updates when you scroll past the enitre paragraph block)

With longer webfiction spanning multiple pages, you could store cookies so that it all updates properly. Although that would force the reader to go back and reread the updated content, which may or may not be annoying.
