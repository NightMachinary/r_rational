Limitations, pictures only. Storage space of say a standard cheap pendrive. No indexing issues. Protagonist does not know everything in the data at once, he still has to sort through them. He can also modify the data.

Off the top of your head, what would be the most useful things to carry around? See any interesting uses?


** 1. An organization/sorting system. Ideally, tags associated with each and every photograph, and the ability to comb through it all so that I can quickly find (for example) a diagram showing different cuts of meat.
2. Pictures of text. This might be cheating, but it simplifies life immensely, especially if I can overlay text onto pictures. Pictures of people would have their biographical information. If my tagging system works, I would be able to search "female" "blonde" "work" in order to figure out who I was talking to (along with personal interests, etc.). Much more useful if I have contextual facial recognition built in, and if I can do this on the fly without vocalizing.
3. Instructions for things I might need to do. Diagrams of which fork goes with which course. How to tie a tie. First aid. How to change a tire. How to survive in the woods. Identification guide for mushrooms. Etc. Works a lot better with the tagging system, or if I can have distinct (well-organized) folders.
4. A detailed map of the city I live in, along with all other places that I have been known to go.
5. Depending on space available, a collection of paintings and artwork to look at in my leisure time. If I can have (zoomable) pictures of text, probably some books to read too.

Some of these functions are duplicated by having a simple smartphone, and some are only worthwhile depending on the interface available to me.

** How do I get new pictures into the chip? Or am I stuck with the ones that it had when it was implanted?

** I'm gonna use one of the various text encoding methods suggested by others. I'd have a copy of every famous book, play, song, speech, and quote, along with analysis of each so that I could always look smart at parties.

Several standard textbooks, cheatsheets, and formula lists for every subject I can.

A few books for reading

The major advatage of this over a smartphone is that it's handsfree and can't be easily detected; There are a lot of situations where using a smartphone is prevented (exams) or considered rude (social events, meetings).

** Well, how about having it record the last 10 minutes of everything the user sees (and hears, it would be asinine not to have it record audio as well), continually, and let the user selectively tag chunks of that for permanent storage.

1. Black Box, for forensic recovery.

2. Never forget a face.

3. And everything else that goes with literally photographic memory.

4. That would give you about an hours worth of video on a cheap chip. Download it at the end of the day (induction reader in the pillow) and as memory upgrades become available you can re-upload it.

** Abridged wikipedia, encoded via bitmap at the lowest legible resolution.

Passively: Frames of video from the middle 1 degree of each eye at 64 fps. Barring intervention, the framerate of stored footage is halved each day, to a limit of 1 frame per 32 seconds.

Actively: Snapshots and video, whenever I choose.

I can modify the data? That sounds like a really handy way to create persistent images directly from imagination.

Can I adjust qualities of the images to make features difficult to discern with the naked eye easier to spot?

Artistic reproduction just became much easier, I guess.

An interesting way to use this: There's brain-interfacing technology capable of backing up your mental state in case of death - or cloning - but the equipment takes up a small room. The "flash drives", however, are small enough that they can fit into your brain without breaking anything. They're intended as a moment-to-moment journal of sorts, keeping yourself informed of business in case of death too long after a backup session, but then some bright soul had the idea to make them wireless...

Speak for yourself. Not to mention that built-in video would mean built-in wikipedia, with some basic tinkering.

So, maybe 32 gigabytes.

  No indexing issues.

By which you mean the storage system comes with a good indexing system? I can insert images along with some metadata and throw that all together into Lucene or something else running in my brain? Well then... /cracks knuckles/

I insert 1px images with interesting data as metadata. Specifically, I have one field as a Wikipedia article title, and I have another field as that Wikipedia article's full text. With the space limitations, I can store a good chunk of Wikipedia, though not the full thing. The issue is the lack of a UI to read that index.

But for the most part, I have a phone, so I don't really need anything like what you're describing. The lower latency would be nice, but it's only pictures, not interactive, and not /that/ much storage.
