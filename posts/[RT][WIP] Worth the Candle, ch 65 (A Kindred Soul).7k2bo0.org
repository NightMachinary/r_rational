  I frowned slightly. This could all have been avoided if he was more loyal to me. Twinned Souls would remove the need for his informed consent.

Is this not a huge red flag for anyone else? Or has the rampant paranoia in the story affected me?

*** Nope. I definitely read that line and did like a mental 'double-take' and wondered if Joon was being exceptionally pragmatic and cold hearted or if this was a purposeful hint left by the author to show that Joon is in fact not alright.

My tentative theory-bunny is that perhaps Joon is compromised but Grak is /not/ and, as being the only companion not soul bonded to Joon (edit: Six Eyed Doe isn't yet but it's a doe and Fallethr also doesn't know about it yet), Fallatehr hasn't had time to compromise him in some other fashion. Grak says he tried to rouse Joon by touching him but it's also possible that Fallatehr could mess with Joon's soul in some other fashion or through touching Joon very softly, such as grasping a few strands of Joon's hair or something similar. We haven't heard Grak's side of the story (since he himself assumes that he's compromised) so we only have the nonanima's version of events and, much as I instinctively like her due to the shitty, pitiable life she's had, it's also possible she's been Fallatehr's puppet/agent from the jump. The sudden loyalty jumps are concerning to me and I feel like they may be a method that Fallatehr is using to attempt to connect her to Joon via Twinsouls (which it's possible he knows about, if he got to access Joon's soul, we can't say for sure)

Either way, due to the intelligent way this fic is written and the very real possibilty of everyone double crossing everyone and soul magic fuckery thrown into the mix...I can say I'm more than eager for seeing where [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] takes us.

But I do agree that would be a /very/ interesting spin on things considering the amount of agency Joon's had so far. And the SED could also bring potential interest to such a storyline too.

*** I read it as him disproving of twin souls. "Wow this would make it easy to bypass informed consent /frown/". Now that you mention it, it does sounds like a Fallatehr thing to think.

Perhaps thats how Fallatehr does it at first, insert minor pragmatic beliefs that align with Fallatehr. They are minor and useful so they will probably self-reinforce and stick around (as long as there isn't too much dissonance with existing beliefs). All the while making Joon easier to deal with.

Prediction: If this theory is true we will see the gang act slowly more sociopathic, pragmatic, academic, and reckless. Recklessness will help them give him openings. The other values that would help Fallatehr get along with them safely until he has the info he needs to act.

**** I'm not so sure. Fallatehr could tell at a glance that Joon is a blood mage. Maybe he can see (but not alter) a person's soul at a glance, and he can tell something is going on between Amaryllis, Fenn, and Joon with that ability. If 'being companions' is something he can detect by sight alone, he might alter Valencia to rapidly grow in loyalty as a gambit. Er, if a soulless being can be altered....

Disregarding that, he did spend some time in Fenn's glove. Maybe he saw the Twinned Souls from her end.

** I think a sufficiently devious soul mage wouldn't just springboard themselves up in the values table. Instead they would change the math that allows values to change. Qualitatively that might look like "rational arguments have a 1.5x effectiveness in changing someones values." In this way the soul mage would immediately know the best ways to 'naturally' get to the top of the persons value table. This type of manipulation would be much harder to detect.

** Once again we see someone making a joke about Juniper looking like a 'default' character. My hypothesis is that Juniper is a game character, but not as someone from Earth playing in Aerb, but rather someone from a future high-tech society who is playing as a character from present-day Earth thrown into Aerb.

It sounds weird to have Juniper be a character from Earth rather than being an Aerb native, but it saves on exposition having him already know the backstory of any 'dungeons' the party enters and it provides a mystery/plot for the player to pursue (why am I in Aerb and how can I go back to Earth?).

It could explain the weirdness of several different layers in the game. It's because multiple different highly advanced gaming software are being used in a kludge by people just importing assets to make the game Aerb.

Also can I say how much I love this chapter for being a real-life version of high-stakes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game][Mafia]])?

Unrelated- if I were her, first order of business would be to ask joon to reveal something private about her. That would relieve most risks of joon being corrupted- a fully corrupted joon would not reveal the twinned souls thing, and a joon who didn't have twinned souls essentialism could not reveal information.

The problem of scar magic is that it is permanent and only works briefly. Why not use a soul mage to keep it tuned up? Just heal into the right configuration after correcting the soul to a functional scar magic upgrade. Or at the very least, clean her soul of those scars.

Fenns hatred of Fallather (sp?) Means that the teaching relationship will not end peacefully.

*** Through this lens, what if the point of the 'game' layer's skill numbers are a way to not-really learn the subject, an abstraction between it and the player's brain?

Suppose you want to play a survival game with immersion but making traps to catch small animals is aesthetically unpleasing to you even if you're not a vegetarian. The ability to +map+reduce a skill set to a number has an obvious appeal in the domain of fighting and violence. But why not just combat skills? Consider driving as an example. The instincts of a NASCAR racer on a closed course are not the best for everyday driving.

Now to take this line of reasoning to the fullest: ideal Bayesians don't want to learn false things in general, so the abstraction allows the designers to respect this preference /and/ invent systems and interactions for the game. Magic is a prime example. Training the impulse to call on non-existent magic to solve an urgent problem seems like an actively bad thing to do to yourself.

Having said that, I think this explanation is missing something. When the narration jumps back to Earth, there's clearly someone we're following. And when I try for increasingly fanciful explanations I keep hitting the same sort of notes that we're presently or imminently experiencing on the topic of our new friend Valencia.

** thought

I was reminded of his lisp from Ch. 61

#+begin_quote
  To my surprise, I realized that he had a lisp; the ‘th' sound was coming out awkwardly, or replaced entirely by something that sounded similar. ‘Uther' had become ‘Oo-her'. I could imagine how that was a hard sound if you had to stick your tongue against pointy teeth, but couldn't remember the other elf having that problem.
#+end_quote

How many other elves have lisps? It's not something I've ever seen mentioned before, even in passing, but idk how many elves we've seen before other than fake-Fallatehr (even as simple one-liner NPCs). Maybe lisps are common in elves since they have those ridiculous fangs, but you'd think they'd be used to them. I'm no linguist but that sounds like someone trying to keep their tongue /away/ from their teeth because they've accidentally bitten down one too many times. (acci/dental/ly huehuehue)

Maybe Fallatehr is just an outlier. Or maybe that's what happens when someone's transformed into an elf but isn't used to talking in that form.

Conjecture: We haven't met Fallatehr.

The story's awesome btw [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]!

[EDIT] Hmm. When they broke him out they got quest text including "You have retrieved Fallatehr Whiteshell" - but I've played games that lied in the quest text to preserve an in-universe fiction.

*** I think this whole arc is about resetting Joon and our expectations by creating as much paranoia about the game interface as possible. The DM/Cthulhuraejepsen is setting trap after trap using assumptions based on game interface information. The DM won't lie in the game text. But he can arrange situations where we and Joon assume the wrong thing from the assembled info.

--------------

Joons gets the quest update message when he crossed the wall with Nulli. It doesn't happen when the arrow gets across.

This allows for a version of the story where Nulli is The soul mage. The name null pointer exception is the means by which he escaped the prison's detection. Coincidentally (DM is cheating) this tricks Joons companion log.

This works in my own head because it is the intersection of [[/u/Cthulhuraejepsen]]'s desire to surprise us, the DMs desire to make Joon afraid of his own conclusions (like the suits of armor), the symmetry of fallatehr actually becoming a companion, and the cost of losing solace just to get an empty shell. The remaining incongruity is the rapid increase in Nulli's loyalty. Maybe fallatehr is ratcheting up his loyalty in order to facilitate integration into the party without realizing that Joon gets immediate verbatim feedback on it. Again DM fuckery to make the whole arc joonbait.

Also, super funny how Jun's value system rates Tiff over Fenn (if I interpreted last chapter correctly), but as soon as he sees Fenn's system rating some rando over himself he gets irked.

Also also, the value system has thus far revealed a lot of potentially frightening stuff: Jun's (healthy?) obsession with leveling up, Mary basically being some sort of bred-from-birth automaton fixated on her own success above all else (above even her kingdom's propsering, which she pays lip service to as her responsibility but is apparently just a rationalization for gathering power/safety?), Fenn doing a rather exceptional job at hiding her murderous inclinations vs anyone of the elf race.

But on the bright side Juniper doesn't have to worry about figuring his companions out anymore, since he can just directly hack into their brains once they pass the loyalty threshold. I'm sure he'll use this newfound power responsibly.

**** True. But we keep getting this signal that Fallatehr is extremely dangerous. I think it was in the last thread that somebody suggested he may be reading Juniper like a book with his crazy high Soc. He may basically be HPMOR's Voldemort. If so, a quick reading of Fenn to see that she dislikes him and extremely quick thinking to adjust that dislike into a useful extreme would not be beyond him. It is also possible that we will only learn too late how true, loyal to Juniper, and amiable he was, and come to regret this needless paranoia. In fact, I find myself inexplicable warming up to him as we speak. How could we have ever distrusted Fallatehr?

Or, if you want to go down the rabbithole, the absence of Fenn among those values is evidence they've been changed (for what reason would Fenn be devalued though?)

Maybe she is romantically interested in Fenn, but doesn't sufficiently value romance to place that above the ticket to power that is Joon. When she's disappointed with Joon saying everything looked as expected, she's disappointed to confirm that's the type of person she is.

** This is probably going to be a lengthy post so let me start right.

*First of all* i really liked the story and characters, even tho binge reading kills my soul cause i have a habit of putting myself into characters shoes.

I find so elements of the story or rather Junipers description of things funny or ironic considering his knowledge, but i it maybe a personal thing.

Here is the list if this funny\ironic things.

*1. At the start of the novel he comments about video games having less freedom or free form compared to D&D and the like.*

But i'm pretty sure there are plenty types of video games that allow you to just run a simulation of regular life Sims style or even be a Tycoon. Even some RPG's are strictly about running your own shop and being a merchant. In the world of Aerb and to an extension in the previous D&D sessions of juniper he says the narrative wouldn't allow it or it would be boring. I think this highly depends on the group you are playing with and the system you use. There are even some homebrew systems like Maid RPG and i'm sure there are some that are dedicated or applicable to running a fantasy tavern with friends that can be used after you are tired of looting and plundering. This leads into 2.

*2. I guess D&D is more rigid about stuff you can do and what exactly counts as out of box thinking.*

But it seems the narrative and his previous D&D experience was to an extent about party being a Murderhobo type. We have them talk about issues and discuss roles and being in character, but at the end of the day Aerb and snippets of previous escapades lean towards kill them after identifying the problems you have with them approach. Every "enemy" or problem is mostly resolved with killing stuff, in a smart or roundabout way, but still. They are not full on murderhobos, but funnily enough they are technically hobos and they do murder a lot. System itself lead into 3.

*3. The d20, fabled natural 20*

I was under impression that physics still worked somewhat normally in D&D and the example of sickly crippled man vs. knight in super armor raise a couple of questions. The d20 results of critical successes very not misrepresented per say, but the explanation was somewhat weird for me.

For example a super strong warrior saying that he starts flapping his hands and begins to fly wouldn't prompt the DM giving him flight even he throws a 20 and at the very list all rules thrown aside would require a series of 20 for a variety of tests.

In the case of crippled guy he would not only require an aim throw of 20, but at least a strength check of 20, maybe even a vitality check so that he isn't crumpling to the ground cause his body can't take it. I'm also pretty sure the difficulty of the task affects the rolls and makes it semi to impossible to make it even with a 20 at hand. I guess grazing the cheek and not straight up murder is the result of this super successes failing, but it still kinda felt like treating d20 as something that it's not.

*4. The DM not being able to wiggle the results.*

This one seemed pretty funny since there is a system that bears name of Pendragon and if i remember correctly it actually has the exact thing that would have helped Amaryllis in their D&D game to protect her sister. It's called Passions and she would be able to make a passion roll or DM could say she should make one or gets a bonus, since she is protecting her Sister and Family could be a passion in that system.

*5. Bond Girl and creating conflict*

Again kinda ties into the whole D&D in Junipers case was more about fight action and other systems followed in similar ways. There are more narrative driven systems, but i'm sure author knows that.

The conflict or interest generated from Bond Girl syndrome serves almost no purpose in the D&D campaign and in the case of Aerb's DM (him existing or not) would loose all tension after a couple of deaths. Repetition of the same trick is kinda tires people and players or observers\readers wouldn't really care after the 5 attempt cause it would seem artificial. For all the 'rules" of narrative Aerb "follows" it certainly can hint at choosing boring\artificial ones to uphold. The Bond thing also raises the question of the DM's ability to tell a story, cause Bond Girls were more of a necessity and inability to progress the character\story with them intact. Also Bond from a movies stand point was played by different people too, would it call for Juniper changing for another protagonist who is similar and in some cases totally different?

In case of his previous D&D group the DM(Juniper) would be somewhat an asshole somewhat if he tried to create tension by killing the lover frequently or at all, cause for it to work the pair would be a real couple of players - aka real people and his friends (murder without reason mind you, they can't just say love wins all the battles). There is a little chance of someone role playing a realistic romance and even if they did that, they wouldn't exactly care about death of an NPC after a couple of times. It's like making all of the chests in the game mimics, you become desensitized and don't really care after a while, no tension just tired of the same tricks even if it's a variety of mimics.

*6. Stagnation and change, there is conflict or there is non?*

I know people are complex creatures and not everything can be solved by analyzing what someone said or did. This just seemed funny and part of it felt wrong or out of place.

Joon's thought process or things he thought about after the revelation of Fenn being thirty-three years old seemed kinda strange and didn't sit well with me. It wasn't out of character or contradictory to himself in a span of those thought, but it seemed kinda out of place with itself on a small scale. I wish i could put my finger on it, but maybe i'm just confusing myself or combining multiple different dialogs and talks into one in my head.

His assumption of her not changing in the span of 16 years, or his definition of maturity and what "adult" people do and feel, seemed okay for a panicked reaction of a 17 year old, but at the same time felt strange and like him thinking it for story reasons and not person reasons. He wanted to change and grow with her, but at the same time he didn't want her to change previously and i bet even after this. I guess there is nuance to those "changes", but it still felt like going in circles.

I'm also sure that not addressing personal problems or even thinking about them as problems or "high school level drama" and not as people being themselves, is totally healthy and not a problem onto itself (Sarcasm). But this at least is in connection with a 17 year old boy who didn't really see much of the world.

*All in all this story is a great read and i hope people will notice and disagree\agree and talk\comment about points a brought up.*

  I gained a single point of loyalty from [learning dwarvish from Grak], bringing him up to 7, when I apologized if my relationship with Fenn made things awkward, but that was about as much as I got for my efforts. I'd had this idea of ‘grinding loyalty' with him, but it didn't really pan out like that, no matter how much we talked. He had, apparently, made up his mind about me and trying to budge him wasn't easy, especially since he knew that I wanted him to be more loyal. I'd tried telling him the same thing I'd told Amaryllis, that he would become more powerful, but that didn't sway him like it had swayed her.

** Devils can take possession of normal people. Is that a danger? Possession jumping is easier when the devil's in a non-anima?

I'm getting the Yeerk vibe from devils, but if it's only explicit/declarative memory, then having enough Insight might let Joon discern a poor actor of a devil. On the other hand, if the devil also actively access implicit memories like muscle memory or conditioning, having soul magic makes it relatively easy to check for foreign souls in her body.

So soul magic can work through clothing. (Fenn's glove considered clothing or does skin-contact with invested entads make it a part of you?) Would be scary if the definition of contact isn't clear or can be changed.
