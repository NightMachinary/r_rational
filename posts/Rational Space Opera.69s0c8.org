Does it exist? Is it a contradiction with no possibility of existing in the reality? By space opera I mean stuff like Futurama and Guardians of the Galaxy (Does a rat!GotG exist?). I would put a border on stuff like Hyperion Cantos in terms of seriousness.

A good setting which makes sense, is consistent and yet allows for a bunch of guys to go around and having lighthearted adventures.


** We write [[https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/][sideways in hyperspace]] which is written as rational space opera.

That said, we seem to have slightly different ideas of what a space opera is. When we think space opera, the region of thingspace that comes to mind includes things like Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, The Expanse, Andromeda, Farscape, Dark Matter, and yes, also things like Guardians of the Galaxy.

Here's what we consider the components of the space opera format:

- Large ensemble cast of characters
- Space setting
- Large scale conflicts involving whole civilizations
- "Magical" technology allows everything to happen.

If you were to move /Lord of the Rings/ into space, turn Mordor into a race of aggressive spacefaring aliens, make Frodo and Sam the captains of the Cool Starship, and Gondor into The Federation, it'd be space opera. We don't really think the seriousness or lack thereof is what determines it's 'space-opera-ness'.

*** I came to give a pointer to SiH but you beat me to it by half a day.

I agree with your point that 'space opera' doesn't have to be lighthearted. When I think of space opera my mind automatically goes to E.E. 'Doc' Smith's Lensman series and Issac Asimov's Foundation series. But I guess that's just me showing my age.

** Hmm, wouldn't */To the Stars/* *([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866][fanfiction.net]] | [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ToTheStars][TV Tropes]])*, a /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ fanfiction, count? Assuming you're using [[/u/Sagebrysh][u/Sagebrysh]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69s0c8/rational_space_opera/dh8wnxg/][definition]], that is --- it's not really 'lighthearted', but pretty rational, large-scale, and in space.

*** Got to add that the worldbuilding is insanely detailed

**** Yes. I usually dislike extensive worldbuilding, caring about the plot more, and I /still/ love /To the Stars'/ worldbuidling.

** Is Schlock Mercenary good enough? It's consistent, makes sense and yet allows for a bunch of guys to go around and having lighthearted adventures. Granted they're nat all that rational, but they're fairly rational for mercenaries.

*** Yeah, SM is pretty great in that regard. Very funny yet good worldbuilding, not to mention the big climax is coming in and it's about the Fermi Paradox.

More webcomic examples I'd point to are Freefall (it all takes place on the same planet but there is at least one alien and AI's galore - and all the characters are acting either crazy awesome or deliciously rational - sometimes both at the same time) and A Miracle of Science (somewhat similar to The Expanse setting wise with more mad science that is used in a very sensible way)

**** A Miracle of Science - it's a great webcomic with a great story and it's also complete! And I completely forgot about it until you mentioned it!

** I thought the /Revelation space/ series by Alastair Reynolds had mostly rational characters and a consistent setting.

*** OP asked for lighthearted adventures, and that series is anything but. Still seconding it as rational space opera.

** The Vorkosigan Series is my favorite, but some of the things that happen are unlikely (improbable timing, for example). Still, its protagonist is one who wins by out-thinking his opponents.

** Crystal Society goes from being hard AI book to being space opera, it's got mixed reviews but I really enjoyed the first book (free online) and the second one while not as good was still very good (cheap on kindle).

** The Polity series by Neal Asher. I personally recommend the Spatterjay series, beginning with The Skinner. The characters do things based on their own, internal motivations and the entities that are supposed to be the smartest in all the universe... are actually the smartest in all the universe.
