** So it was the most obvious and first thought of answer all along... woo!

Aaaaaaaaaaaah so much hype.

Edit: Next chapter is up too. Another obvious answer used.

*** Given the existence of auto-targeting and area spells, and the degree to which he was outnumbered, I'm hard pressed to come up with anything he could have done within the time and tactical constraints that would have been more restrained and still at all effective.

***** He is completely magically drained after finishing up with voldy. There is no way he would have been able to cast 36 sleeping spells and be able to get tourniquets on them (also I doubt his healing kit has 36 tourniquets in it) before they bleed out. Also, it was the plan he came up with after only 60 seconds to think about it. If he had weeks to plan it /might/ be legitimate to criticize him for not being batman, but he came up with a plan that would take out someone who had personally killed 107+ people in private and was planning on overthrowing the world's government and going to war against muggles. 36 not-so-innocent lives are worth much less than the hundreds if not more lives that would be ruined under voldy's rule.

***** Stunning Voldemort incapacitated Harry for a while, too. And even if not, 36 somniums, at a minimum, before a single one managed to swap hands and fight back? The only semi-non-lethal takedown I could think of was to transfigure a small amount of FOOF, or anti-matter directly into their wand hands, so the wands would be destroyed too.

  *Purim* (/ˈpʊərɪm/; [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language][Hebrew]]:  פּוּרִים (help·info) /Pûrîm/ "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition][lots]]", from the word פור /pur/, related to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language][Akkadian]]: /pūru/) is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_holidays#Purim.E2.80.94Festival_of_Lots][Jewish holiday]] that commemorates the deliverance of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews][Jewish]] people in the ancient [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire][Persian Empire]] where a plot had been formed to destroy them. The story is recorded in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketuvim][Biblical]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther][Book of Esther]] (/Megillat Ester/ מגילת אסתר in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language][Hebrew]]).

  According to the Book of Esther, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman_(Bible)][Haman]], royal [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier][vizier]] to King [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahasuerus][Ahasuerus]] (presumed to be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I][Xerxes I]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia][Persia]] ), planned to kill all the Jews in the empire, but his plans were foiled by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai][Mordecai]] and his cousin and adopted daughter [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther][Esther]], who had risen to become Queen of Persia. The day of deliverance became a day of feasting and rejoicing.

  Based on the conclusions of the Scroll of Esther ([[http://tools.wmflabs.org/bibleversefinder/?book=Esther&verse=9:22&src=HE][Esther 9:22]]): "[...] that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor." Purim is therefore celebrated among Jews by:

  - Exchanging reciprocal gifts of food and drink known as /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishloach_manot][mishloach manot]]/

  - Donating [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzedakah][charity]] to the poor known as /mattanot la-evyonim/

  - Eating a celebratory meal known as a /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seudat_mitzvah#Seudat_Purim][se'udat Purim]]/

  - Public recitation ("reading of the megillah") of the Scroll of Esther, known as /kriat ha-megillah/, usually in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue][synagogue]]

  - Reciting additions, known as /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_HaNissim][Al HaNissim]]/, to the daily [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah][prayers]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkat_Hamazon][grace after meals]]

  Other customs include drinking wine or any other alcoholic beverage, wearing of masks and costumes, and public celebration.

  Purim is celebrated annually according to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar][Hebrew calendar]] on the 14th day of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Months][Hebrew month]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adar][Adar]] (and on Adar II in Hebrew leap years that take place every 2 to 3 years), the day following the victory of the Jews over their enemies. In cities that were protected by a surrounding wall at the time of the Biblical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua][Joshua]], Purim is instead celebrated on the 15th of the month of Adar on what is known as /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim#Shushan_Purim][Shushan Purim]]/, since fighting in the walled city of Shushan continued through the 14th day of Adar. Today, only [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem][Jerusalem]] and a few other cities celebrate Purim on the 15th of Adar.

***** It's Purim today. Purim is the Jewish festival where we celebrate doing to our enemies as they were going to do unto us. The simultaneous garrotting of the Death-Eaters is a particularly close point of similarity.

I dunno, too big a stretch?
