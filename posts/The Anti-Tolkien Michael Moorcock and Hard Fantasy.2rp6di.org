** I'm downvoting this, not because it's an objectionable article qua article, but because I don't see how Moorcock is linked to particularly rational content - though I've only read some Elric books and would be happy to be proven wrong with citations to short stories I can read.

*** I'd agree but they are making a case for how Moocook was a counter revolutionary to the romance of Tolkien (romance= a good destiny draws events towards their positive outcome) and how Moorcook was different with Tragic Elric.

Bleh, these are works of two very different levels of quality if you ask me, this should be best demonstrated by the comparative time spent on them, but to quote another of my favored authors that was lambasted, that is left as an exercise for the student.

** While I have to say that Moorcock is probably not rational, if anything he's gloriously irrational, I've been reading his books for over half my life and they've influenced me hugely.

They tend to be well written and characters rarely hold the idiot ball.

Hopefully I'll get to meet him at a book signing later this month.
