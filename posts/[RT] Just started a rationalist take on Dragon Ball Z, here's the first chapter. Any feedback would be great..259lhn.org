** I approve of Goku still being dumb. That said, it's pretty expositiony. I'd suggest rewriting it to weave the exposition in more subtly.

*** Yeah, the exposition will be more tied in with conversation when I rewrite it. I left Goku dumb so he could act as the "Dumbledore" figure (Methods of Rationality of course) whereas Piccolo will be the dark rationalist mentor like Quirril.

**** I don't know if I'd call HPMOR Dumbledore dumb! But I do like the idea of including that type of character as long as he's not a strawman.

** *Changes to the universe include:*

Goku married Bulma instead of Chi-Chi.

Radditz arrives 8 years after canon making Gohan 12 years old instead of 4.

*** As someone who didn't watch all of DragonBall, can you explain the cause of these changes?

What leads you to believe that Goku would marry Bulma? What would lead Radditz to such a delayed arrival?

As an aside, Gohan in your story references his 'Saiyan blood'. Unless something is very different between the dubbed and/or subtitled DBZ I've seen and the original Japanese, Goku never thought he was anything but a normal human until Radditz told him otherwise.

Sure, I could buy into Bulma testing him and discovering he wasn't human (though how he could have a child with her would then be problematic) but it isn't like the word 'Saiyan' would be encoded in his DNA.

**** The two changes are purely for the purpose of making this story work as rational fiction. He just happens to marry Bulma instead in order for Gohan to have the scientific background and Radditz just happens to be late in this universe so Gohan will be old enough to make sense as a rational character.

Great catch with the "Saiyan blood" part, I'll take that out when I rewrite.

***** I dunno - it seems like a pretty major change to the character of Bulma for her to become interested in Goku as a sexual being/potential husband. Chi-chi at least always seemed interested in marrying Goku.

Goku was very impressionable and easy to sway (as long as he didn't think it was a wrong thing to do) so I could see him marrying either.

I'd guess that the only thing that would slow Radditz down is conquering a few more planets first, meaning he'd be a bit more powerful, having more experience.

EDIT: Also, Chi-chi always pushed Gohan hard in his schooling, so I could see that meaning he'd get a decent education. I mean, he was 4 and studying Trig, if I recall.

Just my off-the-cuff guesses.

****** I'm not all that well-acquainted with the canon, but building on this: if these characters all know each other, older!Gohan could still have some kind of mentor/mentee relationship with Bulma even if she's not his actual mom.

****** I don't think the leap to make Bulma interested in Goku is one taken that far. I mean she wound up marrying Vegeta who literally tried to kill all of her friends one time.

***** I was just reading a summary of Bulma on the Dragonball wiki: [[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Bulma]]

It has this interesting quote near the end of Dragonball: "With Goku now being 18 years old and Bulma now 22, Bulma refers to him as handsome and almost takes a liking to him. However, any possibility of a connection was not going to happen since Goku ended up getting engaged to his childhood sweetheart, Chi-Chi in the Quarterfinals."

If he had not ended up with ChiChi, it is very possible he would have ended up with Bulma. They have a lot of history and friendship together, so their union would not be that strange. I mean, if we're supposed to believe Goku and ChiChi have a happy marriage, we really should not have trouble believing Goku and Bulma would have one.

ABout the delay in Radditz arriving, it's also not that serious. They expected Goku to kill all life on earth. Assuming he only needs to kill humans, and there are 6 billion people in the world, and Goku kills 1 million a day, he still needs about 16 years to kill everything. Obviously an adult Saiyan can do a little better, but a baby does much worse, so it averages out. If these Saiyans know basic calculus, it makes sense to give somebody a lot of time to achieve all this. Having Radditz explain the Math behind his reasoning, shows why he would give Goku more time than in canon. He can say he used a logorithmic scale, working on the assumption Goku would get stronger each day, working on estimates on how many organisms are on earth etcetera etcetera.

Personally, I have no problems with a fanfic making a few changes like that as a premise. It does help though if you can have some single excuse to point to. HPMOR says Harry was always a genius, but the neglect in canon caused his intellect to decline. So yeah, it makes everything simpler if all changes come from Goku not choosing Chi Chi at that time, and everyone getting an intelligence upgrade.

****** The reason I chose Bulma over Chi-Chi was her position in Capsule Corp, I plan to make it a large part of the story especially during the Goku dominated parts of the plot.

Don't worry, there is always room for more Nappa. (Are we there yet?)

** Basically, I really liked this, but it was way too short. I want more of the rational Dragon Ball Z concept. I want Gohan using his scientific mind analyzing and investigating chakra powers. I want him consulting with Bulma and making batteries that are charged with the body's energy.

SO yeah :) definitely looking forward to more.
