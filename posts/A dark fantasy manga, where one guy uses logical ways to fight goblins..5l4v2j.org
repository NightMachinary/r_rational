** Too much smut for me.

Decent amount of things-that-look-like-thinking, one possible example of actual thinking.

*** +1. MC uses resources in fairly trivial ways, contrasted with everyone else being 'heroic'. And that's presented as some kind of tactical genius. (Wow, you're going to use /sleep/ and /silence/ together to ambush a camp! So creative!)

*** Seconding this. Also, I'm not interested in seeing goblins rape somebody every chapter or two.

*** I agree that the rapefest is utterly tasteless.

However, I did quite enjoy the rest of the story. No, the protagonist is not HPMOR-style brilliant, but the story is still a decent deconstruction of all the usual fantasy stories. It is kind of nice to read a story for once where adventurers act more like a SWAT team and less like muscle brains.

I also liked the little details like the kid swinging his sword around too much so the others can't help him, and getting it stuck against the cave wall. That sort of thing makes the story feel much more realistic/rational.

*** ...As in gore on every page or as in there is a nipple on one panel in the middle of the story?

**** Or, for that matter, discussions about paying the bills on time and talking problems out rather than yelling about them?

(I mean, that's maturity, right?)

***** I was mildly disappointed that there's no term that means "anime featuring adult protagonists". I did a search for "adult anime", and... well... you know.

******* Seinen refers to anime/manga marketed at adult males. I was looking for anime/manga that has adults as protagonists. There's overlap, but it's not the same thing.

** It was alright. As mentioned before, it's fairly gratuitous. Made it hard to determine if the gore was well used or excessive.

** Pretty sure the manga is an adaptation of a light novel and that there's an english TL of it. Haven't read either, but if it's just gratuitous visual depictions that would bother someone, I'd suggest looking into the LN as a possible alternative. Prose is also a much better medium for conveying thoughts, plans, and inner-monologues than manga, so it may help with your second objection as well. (again, I haven't read either, so this is just a possibility).
