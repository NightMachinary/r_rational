** I don't have a bunch of suggestions for Scott Alexander, but at least he's pinpointed a lot of the problems that I have with the book, which is that a bunch of it is disconnected and ultimately pointless to the plot, better served as being a short story than a piece of the greater work.

(Authors putting every idea they ever had into a single book is a big pet peeve of mine. (Obviously when /I/ do it, it's fine.))

**** I would probably also be fine with a restructuring so that it was more of a loose collection of vingettes, but as it stands, I don't think that's /particularly/ true of the structure, since there are protagonists who are following goals/journeys, there are just quite a few of them. The book should either put more emphasis on the plot and characters and less on the vingettes, or lean into the vingettes entirely (which will be hard to do while telling a cohesive story).

(If I were more invested, I would go through and count what all the chapters/scenes are about and plot it out on corkboard-alike to get a firmer look at the /actual/ structure. I haven't read it since it was published.)

***** It straight up feel weird disagreeing with you on this, because you're probably my favourite author right now.

I like the mix between vignettes and plot. The self contained stories interrupting the plot (San Fransisco, New York Invasion, Richard Nixon) build the world in a way that I've never seen done in a series. It charmingly trivializes the whole thing, which is almost necessary when you discuss religion in the manner that Unsong does.

****** I think where I disagree is probably that I think a lot of the vingettes /don't/ build the world, they stand by themselves as individual ideas. In a lot of cases, these individual ideas were taken from previous works by Scott Alexander with only mild alterations. /To me/, a fair number of the vingettes stand out as being "of themselves" rather than properly integral to the world and part of the mesh, which is what makes me feel like they don't belong as part of the work.

Wall Drug is probably one of those big points of contention, because while I like the idea, it doesn't feel like it's very /Unsong/ to me, it feels like a different idea from a different story that wandered in and found a very uncomfortable home. To other people, it feels natural, or the coolness of the idea makes up for the lack of cohesion.

***** This reminds me of /The Grapes of Wrath/, which alternates between vignettes and plot with every chapter. The vignettes kinda follow the characters around, in that they tend to be set near whereever the characters are in their corresponding chapter, but that's mostly it. I'm not sure how hard it'd be to make that work with Unsong, given that some of the not-immediately-relevant chapters have their own plots and characters.

** The charm of this book is how completely off the wall it is. Some of these proposed changes, like removing wall drug and attempting to better justify Ana's introduction into the ship, make the plot make a bit more sense at the expense of the tone of the series.

Some of these changes are just base removal of flavour. I'm honestly directly opposed to most of these removals.

I'm extremely biased though. This was one of the best books I've ever read, and it feels like a shame to cut out bits of it.

** Personally, I feel like a lot of this would be a mistake. I loved the vignettes and flashbacks that weren't really connected to much else, however I do understand that it might not work in a published book.

With that said, some of these changes seem like they would completely change the tone of the story. For example, point 13 where you want to change the "speaking a name causes a feeling to rush through you" thing is a mistake in my opinion. Not only does it remove a memorable bit of backstory, but more importantly, we're talking about discovering a new name of god here. Whenever someone properly speaks it, they should absolutely experience something profound. You can still change it so that they don't understand the meaning and can't use it properly if they aren't kabbalists (or have had it explained to them by kabbalists) but needing a machine to recognise a name of god just seems way sillier.

I also disagree with the Sohu choice. Sohu being an eternal child and being kept as an idealistic hero who mimics Jala's stand against Thamiel is really powerful and is what makes her such a good character. It's what makes the finale where she dies refusing to hate her father so good. Just turning her into the symbol of necessary evil of the government with a demon aura just feels like you're fixing the small problem of Malia by making other parts significantly worse.

Finally, Thamiel. Thamiel is such a good character and his ending is one of the best parts of the story imo. Merging him and Sataniel works, but Thamiel can't be conflicted like Sataniel is in the beginning, and Sataniel can't instantly become like Thamiel when he comes back to the heavenly host. You need to show Sataniel somewhat gradually becoming better at being evil and I think it would be great if he added the second head here to feel his inner conflict so the rest of him didn't have to.

P.S. Aaron vs the drug lord was fine, sometimes a character can do stupid things and I think the situation was enough of an explanation.

The amount of chapter/interlude removals he wants to do also surprises me because the book itself already suffers from slamming the brakes too early. So much momentum just going kaput.

** A few thoughts, although it's been well over a year since I last read the story so I could be misremembering a few things:

1. I thought that the notarikon in the chapter titles was a very strong touch and I would be very sad to see that cut.
2. "Planning to replace this with something where the theonomics have a machine that can sense whether a useful Name was spoken in their vicinity, but otherwise Names do nothing until you direct them with some kind of prayer." I don't like this. Such a machine wouldn't have existed until Names were a well-known phenomenon, plus it would remove the ability for the layman to stumble across a name which IIRC was a plot point at least once. Of course, I also don't think that understanding a Name when you invoke it is particularly hokey, so... take that with a grain of salt.
3. Same thing re: Ana joining the ship. I didn't find it hokey. To quote Good Omens, God's Plan is ineffible, and part of the charm was a series of "coincidences" that just work nicely for the plot. After all, everything is connected.
4. The Sohu-Malia connection could work and would certainly provide a reason for UNSONG to be a larger part of the story.

** Much of this, especially the bits about Sohu and the notarikon, feel as though SA is expicitly satirizing people who disliked Unsong and requested for it to be changed in ways that fundamentally made it a different, differently-structured, and differently-written story.

Some of Unsong could probably be usefully edited or tightened up, but on the whole these edits as described don't strike me as useful. Also, the depiction of the edit reasons (particularly for Sohu's and Aaron's re: the Drug Lord) are almost blatantly trolling.

** I like the idea of Sohu as Malia Ngo, which not only makes that mystery more satisfying but also turns Sohu's chapters into backstory for UNSONG, tying it more to the plot. However, I agree with [[/u/LordSwedish]] that it would be important to keep essential Sohu moments like refusing to curse her father.

I also agree with getting rid of the "Ethiopians have no souls" thing. It was fun but p-zombies don't really work in Unsong where souls make random laptops into sentient AIs and are required for the most common form of spellcasting.

I don't feel strongly about the Harmonious Jade Dragon Empire or Sarah Michelle Gellar but yeah, probably no harm in replacing them.

However, I would be quite disappointed by most of these changes. I found Aaron's failure against the Drug Lord very powerful, Wall Drug was great and while I know some people had fun ideas I never thought it /needed/ an explanation given how much weirdness is knocking around the setting, Not A Metaphor is an amazing name, etc.

** I'll be curious to see how he manages to cut a bunch of chapters while preserving all of the Kabbalist easter eggs, like there being 72 chapters, with names chosen just so, etc.

The document linked here seems quite at odds with lots of delicate structure picked out in [[https://unsongbook.com/tosefta/]]

That isn't to say a good deal of it couldn't be patched up, but it sounds like it'd be a heck of a struggle to get right.

** As a mega-fan, the exposition that bothered me the most was the more laborious kabbalistic elements. The world is weird enough you can delete maybe 85% of the "this random pop culture is Adam Kadmon" style stuff.

I think the Malia Ngo thing is a good idea. It prevents even more confusion about why Thamiel doesn't control most bureaucracies. No reason for hellspawn to not be exceptionally obvious when on the surface.

** I generally agree with the proposed changes, especially the removal of the Wall Drug sections.

Perhaps more controversially, I think a culling of the weaker, more arbitrary ‘fundamental interconnectedness of all things' passages would benefit the book, as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6brv2x/unsong_epilogue/dhph7cv/][they're what led to me dropping it initially]]. I ended up eventually picking it back up (to my great enjoyment!) but recall a few of those sections rather dragging on. But I guess they're one of the selling points of the work, and likely the author isn't trying to tailor it to my likes alone ¯\/(ツ)//¯
