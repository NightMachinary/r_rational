** tl;dr: "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1632_%28novel%29][1632]] with Uruks".

Biggest criticism for me is that Saruman's voice sounds ... off. He sounds like he's reading off Wikipedia sometimes. Could have spent some more time polishing his manner of speech, but it's all good for the crossover awesomeness.

*** If you like often highly specific and technical reading I definitely recommend the alternatehistory.com boards where the author posts this story. You can find lengthy stories on what seem like tiny changes and outside of ASB (alien space bats) forum they all are attempting to accurately represent people and their desires (huge part of history), no evil irrational antagonist. You also get lots of discussion about how a 17th century weaponry operates etc. I've recommended the site before here.

** So after reading the first two chapters I have one thing that irks me most. The Uruk's anachronism. It makes sense that the ancient and wise Saruman mentally connected to the stunted FAI 'Central' thinks in a rather modern fashion, but what made the Uruk into disciplined and educated men discussing Gandalf's bigotry? And what happened to the LOTR canon degeneration. Did Saruman manage to cure his race completely of everything but their ugly face despite millennia of corruption through Morgoth?

Which is, of course, merely a racist stereotype perpetuated by the enemies of scientific advancement -- one that, it seems, you've bought hook, line, and sinker. Feel free to educate yourself on your antiquated bigotry with the Salon essay [[http://www.salon.com/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/][/Enemy of Progress/]] and the excellent fanfic [[http://ymarkov.livejournal.com/280578.html][/The Last Ringbearer/]].

**** So generations of purposeful inbreeding don't have any actual effect? Because it seems like the book treats all the rest of the book as canon, including fiery balrogs, magical palantir and Sauron with all his evil magic and manifold minions. In any case, even if the Uruk minds are as sharp or sharper than those of humans they still wouldn't suddenly become a wise-cracking, post-medieval culture casually talking about Gandalf's bigotry. Not to mention how they are suddenly completely at home with any new innovation, supremely understanding and disciplined and generally more perfect than life all the while, if I understood the Uruk creation process right, having had less than 5 years of education since their birth. Because if Uruk have a normal life cycle then when did Saruman manage to breed several regiments plus support staff in the little time since he came into contact with Sauron? And who the hell gave them all of that anachronistic culture? Allfather Saruman?

*** I am curious how it will develop given that God literally has a plan for this world that He's acting to defend and I'm pretty sure that plan does not include outerdimensional AIs. I wonder if this world is even still in the same cosmology. I mean, the power of the Maiar is technically outerdimensional itself, no? So how does that work with the cosmology?

**** Well, it later on /does/ allude more than once on how Uruk's are created and very young. The several soldiers being less than two years old kind of young. So my argument still stands. You need more than just /not/ being corrupted to suddenly become the most wisecracking and progressive society on the continent at age 5.

***** I'm not intimately familiar with the uruk creation process but Saruman manages to train an entire army well enough to carry out a siege and march in ranks, there's clearly some initial knowledge dump which presumably could be tinkered. Other than that I think it was mainly just the author using a conversation to contrast the story uruks to canon uruks.

*** fanfiction.net has a category called "Book X-overs" which seems to be used for crossovers with books that aren't in their own category, or for when there's a crossover between multiple books. It's basically a failure state for their categorization system, since saying that this is a /Lord of the Rings/ and /Book X-overs/ crossover is utterly meaningless.

It's actually a crossover between /The Lord of the Rings/ and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_series][/The General/ series]] by S.M. Stirling.
