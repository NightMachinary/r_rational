Lord of the Mysteries (LotM) is a reconstruction of xianxia, combining the classic Chinese elements of progression fantasy and godhood ("immortality") with Western ideas of rationality, morality, mystery, and horror.

*The good*

** Power system

LotM has the best power system I have seen in xianxia, at least in the low-mid power range. There are 22 different pathways ("classes") that have clearly-defined, distinct powers. These powers are pretty limited, and rather "weak." This makes it so that even a normal person can take out people with powers, and the fights are more about proper planning and preparation than who has "higher numbers." Unfortunately, this stops being true in the high levels, to the detriment of the novel.

** Rational characters

The characters are among the most rational ones you'd see in any novel. There is no clear good/evil (mostly), people have their own motivations, and they plan smartly to reach their objectives. The novel presents the best battles of wits I have ever seen.

** Mostly consistent world-building

The world-building is mostly consistent, with clear rules that don't get violated. This adds an air of mystery to everything because we know things happen for reasons and not willy-nilly, and we want to get to know those reasons.

** Relatable side-characters

The novel switches PoVs to some side-characters, and does this well-enough that they don't feel like cringey fillers.

** Atmosphere

The whole novel has an air of horror, magic, and ancient mysteries.

*The bad*

** Starts slowly

The pacing at the first volume is rather slow, and the plot takes some time to get off.

** Needs an editor to cut some fillers, like most webnovels

** The ending is rushed, even though it is just the end of the first part of a trilogy

** Side-characters get left behind by the plot, and become almost irrelevant

--------------

All in all, highly recommended.

One of the oldest empirical philosophies was the Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, historically India has a long history of empirical philosophy. Also the middle east was big on empiricism for a while, IDK if you're counting that as Western. I'm just assuming you mean empiricism and not rationalism.

** I don't think I would call it a Xianxia, unless any progression oriented fantasy written in Chinese is. There aren't really any cultivation themes.

Personally I quite enjoyed the high level conflicts later in the story. I didn't notice a simple higher number means victory pattern, unless you mean truly vast power differences.

*** I don't know what you mean; the main power-up mechanic, gradually absorbing progressive power potions made of rare creatures, this grim fetishization of the worst side of Chinese medicine, is a staple of Xianxia

**** Some Xianxia stories indeed have elixirs and such things used as cultivation boosts, but that seems like a minor similarity and not the main thrust of the concept of cultivation.

I consider consuming beyonder characteristics along a sequence pathway and synchronizing with them through the acting method to be an original progression system.

** Don't think it is xianxia, Western Continent as per author's notes might be, still depends on author, and that is where sequel is supposed to be.

First volume to me is more of a merger of Charles Dickens, since similarity of setting like Oliver Twist, or Great Expectations, and H.P. Lovecraft and his Mythos cosmology, Chthulu and the gang.

For me the best part is Tarot club meetings and Emperor's diary. Don't feel side characters are forgotten, some are mentioned as snippets in the news if no direct connection.

** What fillers? As for the characters that got left behind aspect on your bad part, it is mostly because near the end of the novel their stories or journey that thay started out when they first came into the scene has already ended, Xio got her revenge, Fors got rid of her curse, Derric already liberated his City, other than an end to their journey, there are also some that has just begin their journey like Alger sailing towards the west continent, Leonard and Emelyn starting to seige an enemy territory, Cateleya is growing out of her nest, Audrey just left her family and even Klien himself starting his journey of dreams. The characters is LoTM is not just objects that revolve around the MC alone, some of these character mentioned stop trying to improve after they have achieve their goals and feeling comfortable with thier position as not all of them have high ambition like Alger, Emilyn and by a strech Leonard and Cattleya is, unlike most xanxia, the stronger they are, the more they will lose themselve and go crazy or lost control a cost most xanxia MC would not wish to pay, if Klien was not the type of person he is he would just stop advancing after sequence 7 or at sequence 3. But this story is mostly themed on journey, the fool is the beggining with unlimited potential and the world returning to origin.

** Is LoTM 2 any good? I tried first couple of chapters and they were kind of uninspired, not like first LoTM. Does it get better later?

*** LotM 2 has not started, and won't start till 2022 at least. Those were side stories, probably. I did not like them either.

** The main things that bothered me were the casual (but sometimes pointed) transphobia every ten chapters or so for the first 1000 chapters, and the proudly lavish descriptions of consuming the flesh of demihumans. Overall, it was pretty entertaining though.

*** I agree, the author portrayed Klein at least as transphobic. The author themselves might not have been so. Anyway, this novel is already way too Western. Most Chinese novels' morality is at the level of "don't bully the innocent too much if you don't absolutely need to and they aren't related to people you have a beef with." I guess this is because the Chinese society has less economic abundance and more corruption. This is not something that one person can solve, it's a stable nash equilibrium.
