Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** So, a lot of the "bootstrap civilization" stories, cognizant of the fact that modern society is built off the backs of genaration after genaration of machines building machines, give their charachter some pretty massive advantages. For example, easy contact with royalty, the ability to use magic, or having their charachter just, out of sheer happenstance, be the kind of person that's memorized, among other things: the bessemer process, a macroeconomics textbook, the art of war, gunsmithing, the periodic table, etcetera.

But it occured to me that'a not exactly necessary. Most of us have smartphones, and with battery conserving tactics most smartphones can last for eight hours.

So with the much more plausible assumptions that an SI will prioritize finding themselves a writing material, and that they'll have a fully charged phone (okay, not that plausible), what set of images could the SI have on their phone, transcribable in under eight hours, that could plausibly give an SI the knowledge they need for bootstrapping?

*edit:* to clarify a little, I'm asking this in the sense of "what set of images should /I/ put on my phone" (or any other [[/r/rational]] reader) to prepare for uplift. Not because I seriously think it's a possibility, just as a thought exercise.

*** You could potentially circumvent the eight hour time limit if your first set of images allowed you to construct a generator and any other necessary things to charge your phone.

I'm not sure exactly what would be required for that. From "scratch", you might have to do the whole bootstrapping process up to and including smelting and forging, which could take longer than 8 hours.

There may be a way to short-circuit the process for the specific application of charging your phone, but I wouldn't know how off the top of my head. Getting it wrong could potentially brick your phone, which would be disastrous in the long term.

The real problem would be acquiring the materials to build that generator, and if you've just been dropped into a random fantasy world/historical era you're going to have far more pressing concerns than recharging your phone, so it's not feasible until the long term.

In the short term, you need to get useful knowledge down fast.

*** Another thing, is that if a person were to be SI'd into a story, it's not unlikely that they would have a case with an extra battery, like if they had a Galaxy (S3-S6) phone, that would be reasonable, OR the user would have case battery as well, doubling the phone's life span.

My phone gains about 2-3 hours of active use when in Airplane mode. Then with battery saving turned on, a good 12-13 hours is reasonable. If you had been planning for a two-way trip, say a trip across country, you'd probably have most of the external power sources already figured out any way. I mean, with my last phone, I had a case that doubled as a battery pack, giving me an extra 1.25 battery charge.

Your story could be similar to: go on trip, go on hike early in the morning, bringing charged phone and case from night before, get trapped in fantasy world. Have battery packs. The only thing would be to make why the main character would have all that stuff on their person on their phone already.

If someone had a Kindle or the kindle app on their phone, on the other hand, they could be reading Art of War for fun (yes, people do) or other historical war books (about the Mongols or Exploits of Roman Generals) for fun as well. That, and a Kindle can last for weeks without needing to be recharged.

So I guess my point is that extra batteries for their phone or a Kindle would be likely.

That would work, yes. But most of us don't spend anything resembling a majority of our lives hiking. In contrast, I think most of us will carry a phone for twelve to sixteen hours a day. It's just so much easier to justify, and thus so much easier to avoid breaking SOD. Giving your charachters a few advantages is fine, but readers start getting annoyed when it's obvious the writer has set the work to easymode.

It's why we like rational fiction in the first place-- charachters can't rely on Deus Ex Machinas. In the interest of narrative few works are /entirely/ rational, but we do our best.

You're missing the point. If the setup of the SI is "Fall into a fantasy world and start a tech revolution", a reasonable point of entry would be falling down a hole or something in some wilderness while on a hike. It's not "how often do we go hiking", it's "what's a reasonable setup to make the having the equipment rational" even if this is the first hike for yourself/your SI in 3+ years, it's reasonable to think you would have your phone on you still.

On the flip side, only with what information you already have in your head.

The end result isn't particularly optimistic. As someone that hasn't gone out of there way to study useful things in relation to this, the best I've got is a broad spectrum, shallow view of a huge range of things that most internet age people with a 1st world education have, being further limited by there being no initial industrial base at all to work from.

At the end of the day, the best I could really come up on is more of an advisory role. Educating in the very basics (like base 10 systems, math, etc.)

I'm sure I have some knowledge that would be useful for things that would pop up in that time period (I've got no idea how to make antibiotics besides some vague knowledge penicillin comes from some kind of mold, but I'm sure basic knowledge of hygiene / bacteria is useful. I have vague knowledge that you can make electricity from a river, spinning things, and metal wires to produce / collect static electricity, but not the actual process of doing so or making it useful, etc).

So I'd teach the basics that I could. Once I've ran out, I'd do my best to refine areas of my shallow knowledge pool that it's possible to do so with just thinking about things and small scale experiments, but I'd imagine that to be of limited use.

I'd imagine at the end of the day instilling a basic education, measurement system, and the process of experimentation would be the best impact I'd realistically have. After that it would be more describing things as well as I can with my shallow areas of education (like vague notions of how electricity works) and then relying on the population to preform experiments and work things out from there.

I assume that having accurate knowledge of the end results and basic sciences would give the population some degree of better advancement but no idea of how much.

If you get to restart mathematics from scratch, use base twelve. Please, I'm begging you.

Here's a demonstration of why:

Base 10:

** I noticed a little while ago that there's a distinct lack of rational fiction set in the real world, either modern or historical. Also noticing that there are certain lessons, insights, or other basic information that's lacking from rational fiction in general because of the tendency to make characters significantly overpowered for their settings (usually by exploiting some seemingly simple aspect of the setting that somehow the millions of equally well placed people who came before them somehow didn't think to exploit) or else by being unusually well placed to execute an exploit or apply some rationality with large and far-sweeping consequences.

With that in mind, I picked up a biography of Napoleon, thinking it would help to illuminate exactly how real world stories of those who climbed top or were otherwise able to have an outsized influence on the world differ from rational fiction.

What I've discovered is that Napoleon basically exploited as aspect of his world that none of the equally well placed people who came before him did, and was unusually well placed to have an outsized influence on society.

He read /everything/ even tangentially related to warfare and the basic concept of a Great Man as he was taught it and turned theoretical tactical suggestions into applied battlefield strategy, and micromanaged the shit out of his army's logistics and supply to the point of simply making up statistics to send to the government in his requests for more supplies.

He was the first generation of Corsican nobility offered the chance to integrate with the French nobility and attend their prestigious military academies, but unlike most other young French nobles he got early and direct exposure to national level politics on Corsica, which emboldened him in his dealings with the other nations of Europe later on. It's shocking to imagine a 27-year-old nation builder until you realize he had been pretty damn close to the center of Corsican politics at 17. That, plus being one of few competent military officers who hung around during the Revolution meant he was thrust into high command in his mid twenties instead of ~50 like most others.

I will note that the second aspect as a "just-so" story feeling to it. If I had been there at the time, I'm not sure I would have picked a Corsican as "Most Likely to Take Over the French Government" on the basis that he had experience in national politics, but I imagine it would have been a useful discriminator in looking for those likely to make an attempt at a coup.

The one area he does differ from most rationalist heroes is that he's incredibly, incredibly, and repeatedly lucky. He's discharged from the Army as a junior officer for desertion while he's off getting caught up in Corsican politics, but on return finds that his discharge papers have been lost and he's been granted a promotion instead based on the shortage of available officers. His response? He demands an extra promotion on the basis that it would match the rank he was awarded in the Corsican National Guard.

Later, when he leaves his Army in Egypt to return to France and effect the coup of the national government, he's sailing through waters patrolled regularly by the British Navy, which had just destroyed the fleet meant to escort him and his army back, but gets lucky with the wind and doesn't encounter them.

I haven't gotten to the downturn of his career yet, but the author has at least hinted that it's more a matter of his perennial luck running out than any dramatic shift in his approach to problems, so we'll see how that pans out.

**** If I had to sum him up so far - he appears to have been genuinely and exceptionally competent as a general. He was incredibly detailed focused and capable of a level of micromanagement that I can hardly believe.

His record in other areas is sketchier - he essentially appears to have created satellite states for France based on the principle that their institutions should have the apparent structure and appearance of Republican idealism, but should have particular restrictions that obligated them to France, or where possible to him directly. Most of these subordinate states were conquered and dissolved or annexed directly into France in short order, though, so no real insight into how well they would have fared longer term.

With regard to France, his assumption of almost total control as First Consul certainly triggered a massive turnaround in the state of the country, but a large part of that was probably simply more due to obvious corrections to the faults and inadequacies of the Directory which preceded the Consulate.

You're absolutely right that the chaos of the revolution was what opened the door for Napoleon's rise to power, and certainly an outside observer would probably have predicted the rise of /some/ strongman dictator in its wake as a significant possibility, but the question of why that person was Napoleon takes a bit more analysis. The proximate answer is simply that he was the most successful of France's generals and had the ambition to parlay that success into political power when there was a relative power vacuum in France, but digging deeper into why he was successful, and why he succeeded when there's evidence of at least a dozen other plots to overthrow the Directory at the same time as his coup was being put in place is more interesting. I'm not sure I'm able to offer a satisfactory answer other than "Everyone knew it had to be someone, and he was the obvious focal point to unite the nation."

**** /Outliers/ is interesting, but I've gone back and forth in my opinion of it since I first read it. The whole book is a weird mix of starting off from a good scientific foundation (The whole 10,000 hours of deliberate practice leading to expert-level performance seems to trace reasonably well back to the Cambridge Manual of Expertise and Expert Performance and Ericsson, et al. (2007) - "Making of an Expert") but that gets piled under a whole lot of anecdote and conjecture.

That's not the worst writing style in the world, as it makes it far more accessible to people unused to the academic citation-chain style of writing, but also prompts people to go off on their own tangents and rely on anecdotal evidence really heavily when thinking about this sort of thing.

Ultimately, I think the snowball effect (wherein early initial advantages can be decisive because they prompt the further accumulation of info and resources that further exaggerate the advantage, and on and on...) is a valid observation. I also believe that deliberate practice is probably the dominant if not near-exclusive determinant of performance outside of genetics and physiology.

Where I think /Outliers/ and the culture that grew up around it after it was published fall short as generalizable advice or a set of parables for rationalists, is the implied conclusion of believing both of those two things - that success can be predictably achieved by deliberately practicing the most advantageous skills. That's how you end up at "Tiger Mom".

The tricky part is identifying which skills you're best placed to take advantage of, and which will be most advantageous ~10-20 years down the line.

For Bill Gates, he might have known that access to a computer gave him a rare chance to develop skills few others would have, but would the /rational/ prediction at that point been that personal programming skill and knowledge of computers would give him a decisive advantage in his career? His family had apparently been pushing him to pursue a career in law, and his grandfather had been a bank president. Even though he's an archetypal example in /Outliers/, I think that if he had been presented the book without his story in it, it would likely have been interpreted as encouraging him to press his advantage in law or finance. Being a pioneer in a field without much in the way of established practice methods at the time would seem foolhardy.

As such, while /Outliers/ has some good methodological advice on /how/ to reach a performacne goal and why focusing on performance leads to success, it's ability to predict ahead of time exactly which skills will have the biggest impact is limited, and so the scope of its thesis should not be interpreted as arguing for any particular skill over another.

***** I recently finished reading "Peak" by Ericsson (that I really enjoyed), and he criticizes the 10 thousand rule made up in Outliers from his studies.

His true message from his research is that every person that reached the top in his field did that thanks to massive effort and dedication. On the other hand Ericsson didn't find any proof that talent exist, outside of physical advantages for sport and the result of deliberate practice.

In short, he never found a magic number for expertise, and you can usually become good at something in way less time.

Proud characters know that their reasoning is flawed and don't care, while stubborn characters reject the idea that their reasoning is flawed. I split them up like this because I've noticed I tend to enjoy the former and despise the latter.

I actually find characters that admit their irrational and don't see that as a bad thing to be entertaining.

These characters are usually villains, of course, but I find myself enjoying them as characters.

Characters that are too thick headed to realize they're irrational, on the other hand, I just find annoying. From a narrative perspective they accomplish the exact same goal of creating a character that seeks to fulfill a goal and can't be reasoned with, but it comes across as them being stupid, which I don't find entertaining. Does anyone else have thoughts on this?

** I wrote a thing about population ethics, or how to apply utilitarianism to a set of individuals:

[[http://agarri.ga/post/an-alternative-population-ethics]]

It introduces the topic, covers literature a little and I finally give a tentative solution that avoids the Repugnant Conclusion and seems satisfactory.

I was close to asking people to "munchkin" and raise objections to it on the Munchkinry Thread, but then I found out it was only for fiction. If you feel like doing it though, I'll appreciate any issues you find.

  The criterion as-is needs at least one amendment. Currently, an agent deciding by this criterion will not hesitate to create arbitrarily many lives with negative utility, to increase the utility of the people who are alive just a little.

  ...

  A possible rule for this would be: when playing as Green, find the Green-best outcome such that no purple life has a negative welfare. Subtract that from the absolute Green-best outcome. The difference is the maximum price, in negative purple-welfare, that you are able to pay. All choices outside of the budget are outlawed for Green.
#+end_quote

I don't think the add-on rule quite works. Consider these three options:

1. Green 1000\\
   Purple -1

2. Green 1001\\
   Purple -1000

3. Green 0\\
   Purple 0

Green's absolute best is #2, where green has 1001. Its best option with no negative purple is #3, where green has 0. Therefore it has a budget of -1001 to inflict on purple, and it is free to choose #2.

This seems pretty bad, though ... green is only better off by +1 by switching from #1 to #2, but it imposes a cost of -999 on purple to do so!

**** Thank you very much, this is the sort of thing I was looking for. Yes, it's pretty bad.

I'm thinking about more possible solutions. What if, when the utility of purple is negative, it gets counted with green to be maximised? Then, the utility for Green of options (1000, -1), (1001, -1000), (1001, 1000) and (1002, 1) would be 999, 1, 1001 and 1002, and it would choose the latter.

But then it'd be foregoing the opportunity to have 2001 total utility! But this is precisely what leads to the Repugnant Conclusion, so it's not all that bad. We care about maximising current people's welfare, and additional lives that are happy, if not very happy, are definitely not bad.

1. Green: 1 billion happy original people. Purple: 100 billion new happy people

2. Green: 1 billion slightly happier original people. Purple: googolplex barely-worth-living new people

Since the new people aren't negative, they are ignored, so the system chooses #2. The original people stay happy ... but at the end of the day the world is still mostly Malthusian (plus a small elite class of "original beings," which seems almost extra distasteful?)

****** Huh, you are right. Perhaps we should call this the Distasteful Conclusion?

Yesterday I read [[https://www.mccaughan.org.uk/g/essays/cui-bono.html][another argument in favor of the Repugnant Conclusion]]. It says that 0 utility is not a person contemplating suicide. That is because a life has extra value to its owner, so it has to get really bad for its owner to consider suicide. Instead 0 is a life "objectively" worth living.

This is somewhat convincing. It reminded me of the "Critical Level" theories, where adding a life is only good if it has more than a positive threshold of utility. In the original, pure population axiology setting, this led to the "Sadistic Conclusion". But with this framework that also references the current state of affairs, has at least another, albeit much less nasty, issue. Let's say we put the threshold at 10, which is a fairly good life. Then we'll have googolplex people living a life with utility 10. But why not increase that to utility 11? or 12? It's hard or impossible to justify leaving the threshold at any place.

I'm starting to think we can't really use our intuitions in this topic unless we /actually know how the human utility function looks like/. Otherwise, we'll come up with conclusions totally detached from reality, that we won't be able to agree on.

*** See, I'm a utilitarian (more or less, anyways), but I'm personally of the opinion that it's shit as a /moral/ system.

Applied on a personal level (maximizing /own/ utility) it's downright tautological-- why should I maximize my own utility? -> Because it maximizes my utility. That's useful to keep in mind, but doesn't actually reccomend any particular action in any particular situation.

Instead, I put forward that utilitarianism is best used as something akin to a negotiation and political analysis tool. You can't convince someone else to act just because "it's the right thing to do" unless you and they hold the same idea of what "the right thing to do" is. Instead, you appeal to their own self-interest. So then, when it comes to politics, or similarly large-scale endeavors where any single person is unlikely to affect the path of a nation-state or company or whatever, utilitarianism is the best policy to push, because it makes the group happier on average. Therefore, convincing a group of people to appoint someone who'll act in a utilitarian fashion works because they are, probabilistically speaking, likely to benefit.

So while in an actual trolley problem, I might still chose the "kill five people" outcome if I feel very strongly about the one person being saved, I'd vote for the government that chooses "kill one person" every time, because that's what's most likely to benefit me.

**** As a utilitarian and game theorist, I believe that most if not all problems people have with utility is that they fail to define it sufficiently robustly. Utility isn't just how much money you have, or material goods, it's happiness, or self-fulfillment, or whatever end emotional state you want to have. It's stuff you want.

A kind and charitable person might give away all of their life savings and go help poor people in Africa. And for them this is a rational thing to do if they value helping people. If they are happy being poor while helping people and knowing that they're making the world a better place, then we can say that the act of helping others is a positive value to them. Every person has their own unique utility function.

A rudimentary and easy adjustment is to define altruism as a coefficient such that you can add a percentage of someone else's utility to the altruistic persons. So if John has an altruism value of 0.1, then whenever James gains 10 points, John will gain 1 point as a direct result just from seeing James being happy. And if James loses 10 points John will lose 1 point, and so on.

Thus we can attempt to define morality by setting some amount of altruism as "appropriate" and saying actions which would be rational to someone with more altruism than that amount are "good" and actions which would not be rational to someone with that much altruism are "evil". Or something like that. You'd probably need to make the system more complicated to avoid munchkinry, and it still might not be the /best/ model, but it's not terrible.

**** Utilititarianism has its problems, but: What would you use as a moral-decision-making tool, if not utilitarianism?

I'll explain: we want a tool that, given any set of outcomes and the current situation, it can choose the morally best outcome from the set. Such tool should also be transitive and complete, to avoid inconsistencies or situations when deciding is impossible. If we take all current situations and all outcomes and run it through the function, recording which outcomes are not-worse than which outcomes, we'll be able to order the set of all outcomes. Which is the same as mapping outcomes to integers, if they can be enumerated, or reals, if they cannot.

(I am regretfully not a mathematician, this might be wrong. Educate me if that's the case :)

Thus, you need utilitarism. How you compute this function mapping real world outcomes (or, as I proposed, current-state--outcome pairs) to reals/integers is a really important question and one that is wide open. And as [[/u/zarraha]] said, this gaping hole in knowledge makes people question the validity of utility or its realism. Which is very reasonable but, if not utility, what can we use?

I'll engage with your concerns now.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It does! Just take the action that will maximise your utility, in as long a run as your discount factor demands. Calculating these things explicitly is pretty infeasible currently, but human brain "rewards" are exactly utility as evolved to guide you. Although your culturally, personally, learned utility function may not completely line up with the function you have instinctively.

Yet utilitarianism as a policy is useless alone. It needs to be coupled with an utility function or, more feasibly, with a set of values the policy cares about. In that case, the groups benefit from government by someone who has their same values. So different subgroups have all the incentives to fight to put a different agent in power, sparking competition à là Moloch.

Utilitarianism is somewhat useful as a philosophy, but never on its own. Utilitarianism doesn't, in and of itself, define the relative utility gained from each choice. Our own internal set of virtue ethics does that. Utilitarianism is useful for deciding how to act on our virtue ethics, but ultimately can't be used on its own on a personal level.

That's why I critiscized it so harshly-- attempting to use it as a moral system just leads to recursiveness issues. It's just a decision theory for use with moral systems.

But it /is/ coupled with a utility function, by the nature of politics. Namely, the population the elected official serves. Because the politician's own "get elected" drive is fulfilled by making their citizens happy.
