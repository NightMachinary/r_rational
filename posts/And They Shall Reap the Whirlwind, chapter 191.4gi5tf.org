** Judging by the downvotes, it's a bit spammy to post every chapter - generally that should be reserved for explicitly rationalist fiction. Maybe just post when something notable happens...

*** This reddit is not only for rationalist fic, but also for rational fics.

And I absolutely consider historical fiction, especially well done and researched ones to be rational fics.

**** I'm not saying you can't post it, and mods aren't going to remove these posts. I'm just pointing out a voting pattern. Do what you think is best.

***** I just decided to stop posting it here since [[/r/rational]] isn't that interested in alternate history, or maybe this one is somehow poor quality.

Anyway, it only recently got zero votes or below. I suspect a few users here decided that they actively don't like that kind of stuff.

OK.

I'll submit other content that I think that people will like here.

****** I think over-saturation is also a culprit. I'm quite sure if you were to post after a few chapters have accumulated, you'd get a better reception.

I, for one, am happy to be informed of new fiction and don't mind being reminded every now and then that new chapters have come out, but posting the same story every few days can be a tiny bit annoying.
