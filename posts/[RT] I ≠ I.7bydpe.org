*** I think by the rules of the room that statement was ok - that doesn't form a tautology. ('Very good' does not imply that 'its reversible')

Probably still shouldn't have said that though :D

** I don't get it.

There is some kind of dais, and things said in the dais have an effect on reality. OK.

Why is the Foundation sending not-very-smart people onto this dais to fuck around? What are they hoping to achieve here? At a minimum, why isn't the dais restricted to certified geniuses with a demonstrated high degree of self-control?

*** If you read other SCPs, you'll notice a trend of less-than-competent staff being put in positions where they inevitably fuck up.

"Oh, this artifact cuts the hands off of anyone who lies in its presence. I guess I'll boast about bluffing it while standing three feet away!"

"Oh, this artifact re-writes history to be progressively more awful whenever it comes into contact with fluids it can use as ink. Let's see how bad it can get by feeding it my own blood!"

"Let's cross-test these apocalyptically-volatile eldritch artefacts and hope the weirdness cancels itself out!"

Hey, it wasn't a Foundation researcher who fiddled around with SCP-140, just some random schmuck historian. I mean, in general you're right, but that /particular/ instance of incompetence wasn't the Foundation's fault.
