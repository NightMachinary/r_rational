** I didn't know there was non-magical hp fanfic.

After reading the first ten chapters I don't think I'm going to continue this. A lot of the first part of it seems to be just forcing the hp plot in a super spy school, and at a lot moments come off as weird.

The writing is ok, and it does have a lot good ideas. I think it would be way better rewrite without all the hp stuff, maybe also age the characters a few years?

** OK, I've read the first five chapters. Writing style seems solid, very few errors that I noticed, the conversion from magic to SF seems pretty smooth and shows some cleverness.

It's just...not grabbing me? I'm not feeling any particular hook. The author has clearly put in effort and has talent, the story has value as a "look what you can do with this", but I'm having a hard time getting into it.

** This is a long but fantastic read, and easily the best "reimagine the setting" fic I've read in years. A reviewer puts it well:

#+begin_quote
  This universe has absolutely no magic, but super-science can create some similar results, and biochemicals can cause mutations that create superheroes and supervillains (although that wouldn't become public during this story's timeline). This is also a James Bond crossover, so expect that level of violence.' And you might find that my characters are subtly different enough from Rowling's writing that your preconceived notions may not apply.
#+end_quote

In other words: this is medium-hardness SF, with a huge dose of historical and technical fact, stirred well with espionage both real and imagined.

*** This looks good and I'll definitely check it out. Would you recommend the author's other stories on the website?

**** I'd strongly recommend starting with this one, and maybe go back to her earlier work if you want to explore the wider setting.

(this is part four in a sprawling multiverse, most recently published but still a prequel. Personally I just ignored the whole series thing because it stands perfectly well along and I didn't want to read the others.)

** I have a problem with this story.

Things do not seem to scale, and there are parts that do not seem to make physical sense.

I'm going to bring up an example of each (scaling, physical inaccuracy) that are not spoilers, but there are other examples that would be spoilers.

Example 1: Hermione is invited to help edit/research a paper by a professor during her second year. Why wasn't an older student asked? Is the implication here that she is better equipped to do this job better than all others? She's not in the most advanced class. As there is several tiers above what she is currently in. There might be some hidden reason, but the biggest problem is that it doesn't strike Hermione as weird. And Hermione has been written and revealed to be very smart and questioning of peoples' motives.

Example 2. Hermione says she spent the summer (between First year and Second year) running 10 kilometers in 30 minutes. That is close to a 5 minute pace per mile. I ran cross country in college, and only the very top men (although it wasnt a very competitive sports college) could even get close to that. Also, their cross country team is running 12 kilometers for their races. College cross country (and they are all younger than college age) runs 8 Kilometer races. Why? No explanation is given. No one reacts like that is absolutely insane for a Second year (12-13 year old) to be doing.

Did anyone else notice this kind of thing? Did it bother them? Im curious as to what people think now that this is has been up for a couple of days and people have read some of it.

*** Regarding the first example, I think the topic of the paper was the poison Snape set up to guard the Philosopher's Stone and the antidote Hermione developed for that poison.

**** It is. You are correct, but okay. Think of it this way. You're in 6th grade, and you like math. You're in an advanced private school for gifted people, and a lot of the people you are meeting come from families that not only have a family history of being smart but also having demanding and interesting and difficult jobs.

Despite being a genius, which you maybe are, do you think you can actually keep up with sophomores in that high school? Or juniors?

That's what I mean when I say things don't scale. If Hermione is X units of smart. And she's not a wildly special case (which she shouldn't be because no one at Harworts is dumb and, in fact, most of these kids have probably been trained by specialists like how Pet trained Euterpe) then the people older than her should be X + years of work smart.

And that just isn't present in the text. Which makes me sad.

***** I broadly agree with there being problems with scale, and dropped the story myself, but Hermione being a particular genius ("the smartest X of her generation") seems fine to me. That saod there is unevenness in the story where sometimes we're informed of her prodigious intellect and other times she seems merely extremely bright.

*** I enjoyed it and the fact that Hermione is smarter than everyone else didn't really phase me. But, there were a few times where I thought that everyone was rather stupid including Hermione and that broke my suspension of disbelief a bit.

Beside that, I enjoyed the novel take on the potter universe and thought that the concept was rather fresh and original
