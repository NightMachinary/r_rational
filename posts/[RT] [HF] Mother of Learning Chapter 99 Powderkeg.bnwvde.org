On the other hand, if Zorian could bypass Zach's mind blank and override his senses to show him Zorian dying in the fighting, well, what is there for Zach to believe except that Zorian's dead? Zach was under mind blank, after all, so he can surely trust what he sees with his own two eyes.

*** I also love the part of stories that deal with it too. They bring our attention that every characters has their own problem, has their own skill set that may not be enough to solve their problem themselves, and give main character push and pull so he can develop. They're in correct dose too! I mean, this novel is still about Zorian, all these relationship subplot is always low key. But in the end, it has great effect: It brings characters alive!

That said, I have dissatisfaction with Daimen's reaction in this chapter. We know he's having bad days. He's expedition not working smoothly, stressfulness from the arrival of his parents, and I'm sure the pressure from the Taramatula, especially his fiancee Orissa, must be mounting. Dropping a big problem he's not ready with should made him speechless, disbelieving, before transitioning into outrage and finally acceptance. There might be pressure to keep word count low, or maybe the pay-off from doing that part perfectly weren't big enough (the readers already know all of this anyway), but I still hope it was done well.

Edit: On reread I identified the speechless part. Actually, the interaction is pretty good on slow read. Incredulity -> Dismissal -> (Show the orb) Surprise -> Speechlessness -> Confusion -> Frustration -> Anger -> Tentative Acceptance. I wonder, why the shock was barely noticeable on first read. It's unlike memorable Haslush reaction on Mr Kesir's (/ordering stronger alcohol, repeating "this is insane"/), or from further past, Zorian reaction on Merenptah's (/want to claim that he's furiously thinking, but the shock is too great he's left dazzled/).

** So with the sigil network that literally no one but Zorian is aware of allowing him full coverage of the city with his mind whammy, and the mention of him needing to know soon how capable a normal human mind mage is, I guess the only question left is: do we expect a bluff, double bluff, or a side-by-side bluff?

Is he only going to take over Zach's mind and show him everyone who knows about the time loop dying, or will he take over Zach's mind and show him a convincing human-level attempt to take over Zach's mind and allow the simulated takeover attempt to be shredded by contract magic then let the higher level sim allow Zach to kill everyone who knows about the time loop? And will he be simultaneously (side-by-side) showing the invaders a simulation of their victory?

I'd really like to see the meta-level scene in this instance with Zorian sitting there, hand on the wall and holding a drooling, feebly kicking Zach while his allies quietly round up the streetsful of sleeping invaders.

** I'm writing this as more of a stream of consciousness:

I'm assuming Zorian's work with mental illusions in chapter 97 with Spear of Resolve is foreshadowing a scenario where Zorian will subvert Zach's mind blank during the final battle and show a scene where everyone that knows about the time loop dies, leaving Zach thinking that that portion of his contract is fulfilled. Even still, Zorian is refusing to tell Daimen where his notebooks came from as a precaution. Zorian really is super paranoid.

Zorian's vision from chapter 75 came true! The sea of suns represents his mental network that he has established throughout Cyoria!

Did the angels talk to the sulthorum again in the real world? In the time loop the sulthorum were told that a powerful mage would come for the ring. Now they are willing to uproot and fight in Cyoria. It's good that he has more allies.

I think Tinami might be looking at Zorian in a more romantic light. With the comments Daimen has made about Zorian being more confident and Zorian doing the mental lessons with Tinami in the real world, Tinami has a much better impression of Zorian.

Finally, Raynie's back! Jornak seems to have looked outward for shifter children for the primordial summoning ritual. It sucks for Raynie, but I'm confident that Zorian can save her brother and get into Raynie's good graces. I'm personally rooting for Zorian to get to know Raynie better in the real world considering how they got along earlier when he interacted with her.

*** My personal pet theory re: mental simulations is that he knows Zach is expecting an attempt to subvert the contract this way. So he intends to have two levels of simulation, one at a normal human mind mage level (hence the remark during the Tinami session) which he allows Zach to see through, and the other at or above the level of clarity we saw before.

When Zach drops into the second simulation, he believes he's beaten Zorian's trick and is compelled by the contract to kill everyone who knew about the time loop. End chapter on cliffhanger, next chapter is the reveal that Zorian keikaku'd everywhere and everyone is fine except for mental trauma on Zach's part because that was really an exceedingly realistic sim and why are you so good at simulating blood spatter, Zorian?

Called it, kinda at least haha. Man, Zorian is getting scary powerful, isn't he.

I think honestly the author has shied away from romance from the most part, I don't think Tinami is leading up to that anyway. She's also repeatedly described as shy, so I'd doubt that angle.

Re angels and sulrothum - that IS weird. These guys have an intense relationship going on, although informing the church might not be ideal because it may leak out, whereas who will talk to devil wasps a continent away?

**** The comment by the sulrothum high priest is by far the part that stuck out for me.

It's a unexamined assumption that what the contract says is what the Angel's want to happen. The angel interaction with the sulrothum speaks to there being more going on on the Angel side than we know about.

What if the point of the contract is to put Zach into a life or death moral decision where he has to choose between the lives of his allies or his own life? Perhaps with the added twist of finding out if he's strong enough to resist the compulsion of the contract?

There's no doubt in my mind the Angels could release him from the contract with a wave of a weird, tree tentacle thing.

Let's remember the last known use of the time loop created the Emperor that unified the world. Perhaps the reason Zorian wouldn't have been a candidate has more to do with bloodline than temperament.

If this is right, then we'll see all of Zorian's beautiful plans get ripped down at the last second, perhaps by the Angels or Sulthorum. Keep in mind, Zorian may be the book's protagonist, but Zach is supposed to be the hero of the story.

It also bother's me that Zach's been offscreen the last few chapters. What's he been up to?

****** I agree, they specifically said they can't change the terms of the contract. And yes, the primordial being released definitely will trigger the 'bad stuff', but everything else is all tied to Zach's perceptions, Zach's judgement, etc. Doesn't rule out the Angel's just removing the Divine Framework, or nulling the contract in some other way.

Consider the other oddities around the contract:

- The fact that it just ends at the end of the month.
- It's comprehensive and detailed, but doesn't stop a obvious way to get information out of the loop (research notes)
- It doesn't stop Zach from communicating about the time loop in the loop (surely this would be an easy way to block information)
- Nor does it prevent him from creating Temporary Loopers (again another easy to block thing).
- There's no block on what Zorian did, or any method of physically removing stuff from the loop. Admittedly this is weak, since it would be reasonable to assume that the Guardian would prevent this kind of thing.

These discrepancies all make some sense if you consider the time loop as a crucible specifically for Zach, he has to have the opportunity to make mistakes, and deal with the consequences. According to the Angels, if Zach had ever stopped the invasion perfectly then all the information would have been granted, but that doesn't mean that the angel's considered the task doable. If the angel's considered the task itself as impossible without allies then the strange restrictions make sense.

I just wonder if all these little discrepancies around the Angel's actions, and the contract add up to something else. Again, big assumption, the Angel's choosing Zach was the best way to stop the primordial. Doesn't add up now that we have a view of the kinds of people who have shown they are willing to help with said Primordial. But again, if there's more than one goal here, then it may make sense.

I think we'll revisit the question of "Why Zach" at some point, and hope the answer is more satisfying than "because".

She's part of house Aope, an old family of witches who gained nobility status as a condition of turning against the Necromancers in the war that led to their exile on Ulqaan Ubasa. Tinami herself requested a partner to practice mind magic from Ilsa. Zorian practiced it with her in 2 previous restarts. The first one was when Zorian was Ilsa's succeeding disciple, and the second one was in the same restart as the first time Zorian approached Raynie. That time, during their meeting where they practiced mind magic, Kiana showed up and told Zorian that Raynie agreed to a meeting, leading Tinami to assume that Zorian had learned a secret of Raynie's through telepathy and spreading a rumor that he was dating her.

Forgot to mention, but Tinami also constantly wears a ring with a spell formula inscribed on it. The spell is harmless, but causes tremendous pain on whoever is hit by it. She used it during the party at Zach's place, against invaders and monsters. Also, on top of being interested in spiders, she's very interested in lineage and family trees. Probably part of Tinami's witch heritage. She was very interested to learn that Zorian's grandmother was a witch, in the restart where she told him about the noble families. (Chapters 49 & 50, iirc.)

********* We first met Neolu because Zach was hanging around with her and some other unnamed girl in the very first iteration of the loop that Zorian remembers, before Quatach Ichl partially melded his soul with Zach's. The reason for this was later revealed to be because she is apparently easy to convince about the truth of the time loop, so Zach would occasionally spend a restart hanging around her to decompress and have someone to talk to. Zorian later realized that without Zach's presence, Neolu was incapable of reaching the same results in grades and magical abilities as she did in his first restart, and that she was decidedly fairly average as a mage.

The next time she was relevant was in one of the restarts before Zach woke up from his soul damage-induced coma. Zorian's previous restart had ended with him being stabbed in the chest after telling his language teacher about the Ibasans, and so he was understandably reticent to openly warn people about the invasion again. As such, he asked Benisek for advice about how to send a message secretly. As a result, Benisek then promptly spread a rumor all over the city about how Zorian was in love and wanted to send a secret message to his beloved, much to Zorian's annoyance. After a class, Neolu then casually walked by him, and dropped a note with multiple book titles about the subject written on it, as well as many hand-drawn small hearts around the edges. Zorian resisted his urge to burn the paper, and he actually took the time to go through Neolu's suggested list of books, and found to his surprise that they were very good recommendations. He used his newfound knowledge to send many anonymous messages about the invasion to authorities in the police force, the Church and the mage guild, but was disappointed that nothing really happened as a result, and that the city was just as unprepared for when the invasion actually happened. But at least Zorian wasn't stabbed in the chest a second time.

After that, Neolu only became relevant again when Zorian was attempting to learn the dialect of the people residing on the islands and towns between Eldemar and Koth, to help him reach Daimen in good time, before Z&Z & Silent Doorway Adepts found Bakora Gates on that continent. Neolu came from a noble clan in the area, and was sent away to the Academy as a way of protecting herself while her family tried to resolve some conflicts. She thus helped Zorian at translating a few common words and phrases, to help his simulacrum negotiate for teleports from the locals.

And the next time she became relevant was for the airship ride, when Z&Z wanted her to help them with her connections in order to get an Ikosian-to-Sulrothum translator, in order to get the surrounding devil wasps' colonies help to launch an attack against the Ziggurat of the Sun. During this airship ride, Zorian thought that Neolu was being strangely credulous to Z&Z's claims. He concluded that it was possible that her third eye tattoo and bloodline were related somehow, and that she has a way to tell if someone is speaking truthfully. This was also the first time that the author mentioned that she has facial tattoos.

Well, as far as I remember, this is accurate. I can't really recall any other moment where she was particularly important.

Thanks for the chapter. I just re read the serie and I have a few questions.

- In earlier chapter you said that pocket dimensions have the same weight

#+begin_quote
  the weight of the object inside did not disappear, so a chest with several tons of rock inside would still weight several tons, no matter how small it looked. chapter 78
#+end_quote

So how they could create that orb with Silverlake, Damien, and Xvim in the last restart ?

- What happened to that orb they made, did they try to bring it with them to escape or not since it require a constant mana ?

- Do Zach use golem for his simulacrum or it's only Zorian ?

- Can a familiar increase your mana regeneration by somehow ?

- How strong is Xvim ? I mean in term of natural mana reserve.

- Can the dagger control any Hydra or only the princess ?

*** *The weight limitation is only valid for the basic pocket dimensions shown in that chapter. The chapter even notes that it isn't a total restriction (in that Silverlake claimed the palace orb could be reproduced through purely mortal magic). Chapter 85 features a mention of Zach and Zorian being able to build the most advanced type of pocket dimensions. ("These objects were not containers with expanded interior at all. They were self-contained pocket worlds anchored to an object.") I though I mentioned there that these ones don't have weight limitations, but apparently not.

*They did try to bring it with them, but since the only thing to pass through the escape passage was Zorian's soul, it was naturally lost along all its contents.

*Only Zorian.

*No.

*His natural mana reserves are bigger than Zorian's but not particularly large. Magnitude 14 to 16, as opposed to Zorian's 8/10. Still considered fairly average, but on the higher end of that category.

*Just Princess.

That's interesting - I remember the knock-off imperial orb they made was powered by a tiny dimensional gate leading to the depth of the local dungeon, so I assumed they wouldn't be able to bring it with them to the real world, since once the portal to the real world was closed it would probably sever the link created by that dimensional gate as well. Or even if not, then at least when the iteration of the loop ended it should destroy the end of the dimensional gate that leads back to the copy-world.

So the knockoff orb can last for a little while after being cut off from its source of power? In retrospect, there were a few passages coming from the story that suggests a spell formula could keep circulating a certain store of mana even without a battery explicitly being built into it. That exposition about about some wards being able to last months after being cut off from its power source, for one.

***** Yes, spell formula usually do have a form of mana storage, and large ward schemes often have massive ones. This is because when a ward fails do to a lack of mana, it's permanently gone - even if you supplied it with mana later on, it would not bring back the spells used to make it. Those have to be cast all over again. Obviously, this is something that makers and buyers try to avoid as much as possible.

It's not that mana cannot be stores, it's that it cannot keep its attunement when it's done so, making such storages useless for a mage's personal needs. But for spell formula, this isn't important.
