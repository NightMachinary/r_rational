The story is centered around the Skaven Warlock- Engineer Maulokk, who is the son of Morskittar himself, the Skryre Lord of Decay. Maulokk is sent on a doomed mission to Middenheim because of a plot to weaken Morskittar, and he must use his extensive skills at plotting, in magic, and in martial arts to prevail.

I'm posting this here because it's an old story that I desire to share since it's pretty hard to find, and I think it's very well written. Considering that this is my first time posting here, I wouldn't be surprised if it is inappropriate, I did something wrong, or I don't have the permission, so please excuse that if it's the case.


** pretty long, will give it a try. I believe this is the first Warhmmer Fantasy thing posted on this subreddit.

*** Imoression on the first 2 chapters. Loved the variety of mnsters descriptions plus points. Disliked the long history of clan warfare info dump. All in all liking it so far.

** I liked it. The writing could be improved by I liked the skaven inside interaction. Points for Fimir mentions. I didn't really get what happened to to the elf at the end. I guess he was contacted by a Chaos entity but I didn't understood who and what he turned into. ANy help?
