Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Would anyone be interested in a Harry Potter RPG, with or without the serial numbers filed off? I have one more-or-less complete, but I need playtesters. (Also, anyone have any advice on playing pen-and-paper RPGs over the net?)

As for advice I'd recommend either Roll20 or Tabletop Simulator for the game depending on if you wanted to use macros or not. (Roll20s Macros take some getting used to.)

*** I'm already a part of as many pen-and-paper games as I have time for, but I can offer some advice on how to play online.

The first thing you need to do is figure out whether you're going to be playing synchronously or asynchronously.

I've personally found that play-by-post or play-by-email has a tendency to fall apart, especially if you're doing a lot of combat. Where it excels is allowing for roleplaying and rich, deliberate descriptions. Where it fails is mostly in visualization (or if the people involved are bad at improv). Combat tends to be tough because if you've got four players and one DM, a full round takes a minimum of five posts. When you add in things like reactions, it takes even more. The big problem with this is that it can kill momentum and (sometimes) interest. To some extent this depends on the specifics of the system.

Synchronous sessions /usually/ mean voice chat, though I've done it over IRC as well. I currently use [[http://www.roll20.net][roll20.net]] with my group, which is free and serves the purpose of showing where walls and token are. The big problem for synchronous play is scheduling, especially since you have to schedule over and over everytime someone cancels, drops out, or a new person joins. (I also find that roll20 is a little worse for improv, partly because I'm trying to use good-looking maps and keep production values high, but that's a personal problem.)

** How realistically different do you feel created fantasy worlds need to be for you to read a story without getting torn out of the story due to the improbability of earthlike similarities? Even if a planet has a similar year it probably wouldn't have 7 day weeks or months with the same names as earth. Am I overthinking this when in actuality no one cares if the world has similar dating systems for convenience of writing or is this something I should make sure is unique to the world I'm building?

*** I struggled with this when writing Set In Stone. I am fairly confident that I did not mention names of days, or even the number of days in weeks or months, though I did indicate that years were roughly the same length. I felt backed into a corner.

On the one side, the Nirvanans never lost their civilization, only their advanced technology, and they had a very strong education system to help them hold their institutional knowledge.

On the other side, it had been nearly 5000 years since the AI took technology away and started the 'domestication' of humans. I did take liberties with changed spellings of common names.

I wanted a recognizable world, but I also needed a different world or it would be unbelievable. Balancing act.

In the end, I'd say this:

If you do not need to reference background being different, don't. Let the reader fill in the blanks that you do not NEED to have filled in for story purposes.

*** That's one of those things that I've always struggled with. On the one hand, you don't want to break immersion by including things that are obviously taken from Earth cultures. On the other hand, no one really cares about your system of dividing up the 122-day years or the system of measurement, and it's almost certainly not going to be part of the plot, so you don't want to waste everyone's time by including it.

I generally do my best to talk around the cultural artifacts if I can and only include analogs if it can't be avoided or there's something compelling about the differences. If a culture is heavily into numerology you can give exposition on their divisions of time that way without /completely/ boring people, for example.

*** If I might go off on a (related) tangent -- a personal pet peeve of mine is sports metaphors appearing in the speech of characters from imaginary words.

Example: Wizards X & Y are talking and X remarks that someone "hit a home run" with one of his spells.

!?!?

Do they fucking have baseball in middle earth or wherever?

Sorry. This drives me up the wall.

Other examples: characters who live in fantasy worlds should not use expressions like "blindsided," "punted," "out of left field," "par for the course," etc etc. For me, at least, this completely breaks the immersion. You would be surprised how many fantasy writers break this rule.

Likewise, if there is a prophecy but uncertainty as to the exact date due to calendar reforms the actual length of the week they use might matter. Otherwise, SI units and earth time are fine. The same "translator" converting the dialogue from lesser west phelenian can be presumed to be converting that too.

** What do you value?

Some possible reframings:

- What do you want to improve about the world?

- What makes life worth living for you?

- What does an ideal life look like?

- What about life is unsavory and worth eliminating?

- What do you imagine life in a far future technological eutopia to be like?

--------------

I've thought about this a lot lately, and I think I've come to the conclusion that I don't really care about EA -- or at least, typical EA goals. I mean, I do of course care about people and would prefer there wasn't extreme poverty and preventable death and all that. But, like, I just don't actually care about that more than other things, among which is trying to live and enjoy my own life. It's almost like I could spend those thousands of dollars much more, ahem, effectively.

Of course for others, that could mean helping to eliminate extreme poverty asap. For me, I think that's something in the realm of exploring constructed worlds and immersive fiction, developing better technology to facilitate creation and experience of these things, etc. And then, life extention, because more of a good thing is always better. And x-risk, because you still need a society of creative individuals to create these things. Oh, and I think it's at least fleetingly possible we might accomplish biological immortality sometime in my lifetime, so I want civilization to stick around too. (That's more than a little bit narcissistic, but hey, I didn't choose to have these values.) Those aren't the only reasons and goals (obvious though, I would hope) -- just a broad outline of my thinking process.

Of course, it's not like I don't care at all about typical EA concerns. It's just that I see extreme poverty and death from preventable diseases, and then I think about what's possible, and it's immediately clear to me that the difference between first and third world on that scale is basically a rounding error.

Mostly I bring this up because in these circles, EA is rather central to the ingroup identity, and within that, EA-to-end-poverty is taken as a given. But I don't see much discussion about what people actually value, and how to effectively realize those values. As long as you have a term for other people (or at least your interactions with other people), I think "altruism" still applies and we can work towards our mutual interests.

...Or it could just be that I'm the borderline psychopathic outlier. /shrug/

I think an important thing to consider here is how much impact one can expect to have in these fields. My expectation is that really cool VR (for example) is going to happen because of markets, and that donating/funding such efforts would be low impact unless one has a lot of money (which could otherwise save a lot of lives; of course, funding such an effort would hopefully have returns which could later be used to save lives). If one is thinking of doing direct work in one of the fields you mentioned, there is nothing stopping such a person from donating some fraction of their income to more typical EA causes.

My objection to this is that I don't believe it comes "for free", but instead at a steep price, and that it's actually /easier/ to expand the upper limits of the possible when society shifts to become more equal than when you assume that actually-existing inequality "comes for free".

For a concrete example, consider the issue of trying to do radical life extension in a country that doesn't practice herd-immunity vaccination for common diseases. You /can/ invest a shit-ton of resources in keeping your life-extension patients unexposed to, say, /polio/, but it's actually, in my opinion, on sum cheaper and easier to just vaccinate everyone against polio, eradicate the pathogen from common circulation, and be done with it.

I'm not sure that this is true. From my perspective, not everyone has to be altruistic. I would prefer however, that the people who /are/ altruistic know about EA and that therefore the inherent charitable-ness of humanity were efficiently channelled. As such anyone who I interact with does not get negative points from me for not being an altruist, I simply view them as normal/baseline human.

**** The main problem with that is the Panacea Effect. If you ever read worm, Panacea is a superhero who has perfect biomancy, and she uses it to heal. Outside of battles, she spends most of her time at the hospitals, even giving up sleep.

She's been doing it for a while now, and by the beginning of the story, she despises it.

If you follow your plan, you may end up suicidal, or at the very least, with depression. Also, people are going to be pissed you're going to /that/ hospital and not /this/ one.

Similarly, Panacea probably would have been better off playing chaotic good and doing whatever she wanted. A Robin Hood healer of sorts ignoring all legal precedent and breaking into hospitals to go on healing sprees when she felt like it. She'd be a villain, but as long as she participated in endbringer fights... well. Nobody fucks with the white mage.

Of course Panacea's personality, home life, and the bad PR Nilbog racked up threw a wrench in that in canon.

Moral antirealism is kind of the way reality is. I've never really asked about your considerations of objective morality, but I would guess that what you would claim as an objective ethics would in fact be relative to a social and liberal society. I suspect that it would only be acceptable to a certain class of cooperative and/or empathetic beings, or a larger group of slightly less cooperative or empathetic beings participating under plausible threat of force.

- I actually thought people were talking about a mix of conventional hedonic utilitarianism (pure-strain Peter Singer EA-types) and conventional preference utilitarianism (most everyone else).

#+begin_quote
  Moral antirealism is kind of the way reality is.
#+end_quote

Depends which meaning of the word "realism". If you ask, "Do our moral judgements pick out real (although possibly local) properties of the world?", then basically everyone's a realist, including me. If you ask, "Does the universe somehow force us to obey morality *handwaves God, handwaves Kantian rationality*?", then almost everyone is an anti-realist, including me.

Sorry to always jump down your throat with stupid distinctions, but I do somewhat think this one counts for something? Like, if you're antirealist in the /first/ sense, then you go down the road that ends in "MUH VALUES" talk: since your morals are, at that point, not based on correspondence and fully /a priori/, it becomes /impossible/ to have a disagreement over moral facts. Everyone's just disagreeing because, so to speak, they've got a different utility function from you, and in fact, every thinking being in the universe is either "of use" to you or a /threat/ to "MUH VALUES".

And /then/ of course there's the question of how all these preferences come to be in the brain as weightings of learned causal models and all that jazz.

I don't believe it's necessary to be a hedonic utilitarian to be an EA at all. I just want to make it clear that when I say I'm infected by EA, I'm not talking about hedonic utilitarianism or Peter Singer in particular in any capacity.

#+end_quote

Naturally. I don't believe there is a single singularly compelling normalization schema, however. Markets are a fair try but don't actually exist and depend on resources as intermediaries. Normalization is done when comparing utilities, but as there is no universal reference frame, the normalization is itself relative.

I could handwave some mathematical formalism where two people's utility functions contain terms for the other's utility, and eventually some convergence might be reached, but I can't guarantee convergence and I doubt there aren't pathological examples in reality where two empathetic beings literally cannot decide. Pie distribution comes to mind as a fairly familiar model.

#+begin_quote

I'm not entirely sure what that means. Do you mean that there are things that will objectively make us (in the instant) happy or sad, or harmed or helped?

I also have an issue here pertaining to existentialism and self-actualization. I think you should be free to choose your preferences by System 2, and to modify yourself so that your System 1 reacts to reality accordingly. (That's another problem with using the standard mathematical formalism to talk about utility, our utility functions mutate.)

#+begin_quote

Well, I don't think so. I think that moral "facts" don't exist insofar as they are always relative to some preference system, but they are facts when considering the reference frame. I also think that we can have useful conversations about relative preferences by talking about people in classes, and trading values against each other. For my Ethics final, I made an argument that preference relativism can be used to describe society as constituents collaborating with a preference system generalized over them all, and that trade with society is generally good because the constituents are more social than not, comparative advantage and specialization makes sociality a positive-sum game, and that this in effect can counteract the individual loss of utility for each person where they differ by raising the utility where they share.

It's not exactly System 2 making the decision. It's System 1 and System 2 arguing with each other over how you feel and how things are and what you should do and feel about it. System 2 is a more conscious, logical, and deliberate reasoner, which can help show yourself consequences, externalities, biases, etc., while System 1 is more intuitive and provides emotional reactions to things, including the simplified memetic models System 2 is showing it as a result of its reasoning. This is a stupid pseudopsychological metaphor. But basically what I'm saying is that free will means you are free to change your mind how you want, and System 2 knows some things about how to do that, particularly if you know about conditioning.

The genetic code does not map to a single mind, or even a single mind-lifetime. The preferences are relative to the mind (as well as the things the mind owns, which includes the body the mind is situated in), which itself changes over time.

- /Be noncommittal:/ This is truthful, since I don't care about whether or not my described course of action is moral. However, this invites accusations of being "edgy" just for attention (i.e., trolling)--and various previously-revealed pieces of information (as well as past helpfulness/productiveness) that serve as evidence against this user's being a troll may not be known by the reader.\\
- /Don't respond at all:/ This leads a reader of the thread to assume that I'm shamefully lurking in silence after previously /both/ believing that my course of action was moral /and/ caring about its morality, and then being disabused of the former notion.

So, I've chosen the first option of a noncommittal response, but also added these additional paragraphs to fend off accusations of attention-grabbing through edginess.

"I go up to someone I find smart and attractive and offer them wirehead-pleasure in exchange for sex, their income, assistance with various tasks, with no guarantee that it will end there due to my ability to execute them if they defect."

I can see no realistic reason for you going through the manipulation route other than that you know they wouldn't accept this deal. There is no real way in which the secretive pleasure inducement can not act as a means of creating a dependency and this, combined with the threat of execution for defecting, makes this violate any non-esoteric definition of a consensual exchange.

Admittance of assumption: I figured this, given that both the root of the discussion as well as some of the branches seem to show a familiarity with the concept of wireheading. I was not fully justified taking this conclusion, but still felt confident enough to bring it up.

****** There isn't an explicit rule, but there's a strong social norm against it. It is good that there is a strong social norm against it because it drives the discussions away from particular places that I personally prefer they not go. It also makes it easier to sell newcomers on this subreddit. I did not downvote ToaKraka for his response, but I do think it's fairly scary. It is not, however, surprising.

If ToaKraka phrased his reply as a work of fiction, by the way, I don't think people would care. I probably would not. I do, however, have an instinctive wariness when these ideas are presented as hypothetical plans or suggestions rather than stories that aren't true. Most people are like me in this regard.

Regarding newcomers, if so many of us answer in the disapproving way we did and get upvoted for it I don't see how it is any different from when something similar happens on more popular subreddits. AskReddit for instance had had plenty of "what's the worst thing you've done" type of topics that can get pretty dark at times if one is willing to scroll down.

What I'm trying to say is that I agree with most people's reaction to ToaKraka but the way you put it it sounded like as a general rule you'd have deleted his post but didn't so that people know they are dealing with a sociopath or something. The general rule part is what I disagree with and didn't notice to be part of this subreddit's rules in the first place.

Speaking from personal experience, aside from the occasional spam link from a bot, I've never seen the mods censor or delete posts. This is a very small community and so it is not necessary. About this comment in particular: This wasn't [[/u/eaturbrainz]] saying "I usually delete comments", this was them saying "the moderation is aware of this post, and is not deleting it, but also not endorsing it or sanctioning it."

Basically, with something like this mods are under a lot of pressure to make a post saying "we are aware of this" so that people feel assured about it, and also a post saying "this is a bad post" because that also makes people feel assured.

/Why would you not start with animators?/ I wasn't going to upvote you for honesty because you seem pretty incapable of being dishonest, but this is just beyond the pale. You do not select for animators on the precondition of attractive women, you select for attractive women on the precondition of animators. Otherwise you'll take forever to actually find an attractive woman who is also an animator!

Not to mention the total fantasy of producing an animated miniseries/movie with only one animator who is being put under extreme psychological states. Not to mention /also/ the guaranteed psychological failure of the person in question after being put in extreme withdrawal, and the actual lack of addiction. Habit-forming is done with variable-rate variable-reward schedules, while what you're proposing is about as effective as blackmailing someone with bipolar disorder. You are dysfunctional in more ways than the incredibly obvious one. Downvoting for lack of a good plan.

Oh, and just to be clear? You are not allowed to have powers. If you ever get powers, pretty much everyone involved is going to have a horrific time. Please explain what your post-knee-jerk reaction is, if it's changed at all. I'm intrigued to see if it's changed.

I also want to know if you've told any of your conversation friends about this sort of thing.

...Okay. Switching tack:

If you gained these powers, do you believe you would actually do this? Also, why? Why the fixation on Time Braid, to the point that you would literally risk vivisection in order to see it animated? Why would you not try to approach this with a legal and entrepreneurial spirit? Why would you not at least go the quasi-legal route and form an actual cult?

Some tangential questions: Do you have emotions? It's a bit of a stereotype, but do you feel happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, shame? Have you ever felt empathy towards someone, as in feeling hurt by their hurt, made happy by their happiness? IIRC, you're somewhat autistic: Do you have trouble telling what people are feeling when you see their faces? Do you have an easier time empathizing with fictional characters than with real people?

#+end_quote

This was just a minor example of the many things that I'd want done for me. /Time Braid/ is my favorite book, but I definitely wouldn't say it's the best thing of all time--I'm even partway through making an edited version for myself, so I definitely recognize that it has flaws (e.g., swearing by "God" in early chapters, but by "gods" in later chapters). An animated version of /Time Braid/ would just be a relatively minor perk, paling in comparison with not having to work for the rest of my life.

#+begin_quote
  Why would you not try to approach this with a legal and entrepreneurial spirit?
#+end_quote

I'm not even sure how this would work. Would I create a start-up company where all the people, being constantly happy, had abnormally high productivity? It seems awfully roundabout, not to mention difficult, time-consuming, and immediately obvious to anyone who looks.

#+begin_quote
  Why would you not at least go the quasi-legal route and form an actual cult?
#+end_quote

Again, this seems like a lot of complication for hardly any extra gain. /One/ oddly-happy person is weird, but dismissable--but /several/ oddly-happy people, all in the same place, will prompt an investigation.

  Do you have emotions?
#+end_quote

Oh, definitely. I'm feeling quite happy right now--look at all this conversation I've managed to acquire! I wonder whether this is what a troll feels like, when he's managed to get a rise out of his targets...\\
On the other side of the coin, I felt almost tearful while reading of the collapse of the United States in /Atlas Shrugged/, and filled with a sense of awe during the lead-up to the climactic French invasion of England in /Look to the West/.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have trouble telling what people are feeling when you see their faces?
#+end_quote

I don't think so. I could be wrong, though, since it certainly isn't as if I often see people demonstrating strong emotions.

#+begin_quote
  Have you ever felt empathy towards someone, as in feeling hurt by their hurt, made happy by their happiness?
#+end_quote

I feel crawling sensations when looking at, say, a gory [[/r/WTF][r/WTF]] image that's made it into [[/r/all][r/all]], and I certainly avoid scenes of "awkwardness" like the plague (I have a marked dislike for impersonation scenes, live theater, and call-in radio shows). I can't say that I can recall feeling /happy/ for anyone else--but I could just be forgetting an instance.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have an easier time empathizing with fictional characters than with real people?
#+end_quote

Hmm... When I cast about in my memory for "emotional person", the first match is +Alphonse+ Edward Elric tearfully shouting about something--but that could just be a reflection of the fact that I hardly ever watch anything in live-action (whether fictional or non-fictional), and I certainly don't have occasion to see many people with strong feelings in real life.

Tears of sadness have started in my eyes at my first (and, so far, only) viewing of the ending of /Death Note/, and at my subsequent viewings (two or three, IIRC) of that series' first episode. IIRC, I also found three scenes in my sole viewing of /Mobile Fighter G Gundam/ ([[#s][1]] [[#s][2]] [[#s][3]]) to be similarly moving. I think there were some similar situations in my sole viewing of /Angel Beats!/, but I can't remember any specifics, other than [[#s][the final scene of the series]], and maybe something to do with the guitar-player of the band.\\
Nothing else comes to mind--and none of the aforementioned scenes were moving enough to make me /cry outright/.
