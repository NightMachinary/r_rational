** He finally beat them and the whole miniature world was satisfying. Dunno how the old silver lake is faring nor the grey Hunter.

This was a satisfying ending. Obviously they tried their best and made it through the month. They couldn't kill all the enemies but the two enemy time Loopers are dead. I wonder if silver lake ever had a Killswitch but honestly she is too distrustful to do anything like that.

Here's hoping for an epilogue especially with his friends.

Up to [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]]. Not sure if he even planned on including it in the epilogue, anyhow.

The one I want to learn more about is vampire girl, though. A single scene of her gloating over QI's loss would be great, but I'd want to have an explanation of why she only participated in the invasion that one time. I assumed that the reason QI returned to Ibasan territory every restart was to deal with politics involving her family, but nothing ever came from it.

That's why we never saw her in the loops when RR was out, and why she wasn't included in the real world. Or maybe she was included in the real fight, but she wasn't important enough that we saw her

******* If it were so, we should have had at least one mention of her when we had Red Robe's perspective, though. He would have had to really go out of his way in the time loop to meet her, if she wasn't initially involved without his prompting and negotiations. It seems very underwhelming if this is the end of it.

Honestly, if there are no edits in "I Win II" to include her, or no mention of her in the epilogue, then I think it's possible that she might be removed entirely from the story when this whole webnovel is edited into a coherent book version.

**** There's a good chance that silverlake just took the spider for her potion. The difficulty in catching a grey hunter is its speed to avoid traps and magic sense. If she's got one already captured in a ward, she should have all the hard work done with no risk to her.

It doesn't have any particularly novel way of escaping capture, since it relies on raw physical ability and venom, instead of something esoteric like dimension hopping amphibians.

******* The latest MoLU post plus the last few chapters leave me thinking that soul magic is hands down the highest peak of magic that isn't divine (and that might also be soul magic v2, from mentions in story). And angels/demons use it every second of their lives, apparently, and are skilled in a way humans can't be because of that, way beyond even the aranae mind magic/human telepath difference. Even QI wants nothing to do with that class of critter if he hasn't performed absurd amounts of prepwork beforehand.

The angel mangled something that nearly accidentallied Zorian because he looked at it while still fighting everything else. I'd guess that it could probably do to Oganj what the demon nearly did to Zorian if it wasn't so brutalised, and just as casually.

Consider: the contract gives him strong impulses to fulfil it, such as when it compelled him to do self-checks and try to detect any mental control. If he knew of specific people who were claimed to have time loop knowledge, then it could drive him to check on them. But without any such details, there's nothing to compel. And if there's nothing that the contract is compelling him to do, I'd expect that it's not in a failure mode either.

A lot more likely, in my opinion. And red robe could have given specific names and places as well. He was already taunting him in the maze, so it wouldn't have been any more work. And he already went through enormous effort to fuck over everybody in case he lost.

It's far more possible that red robe sent some letters than the mind blank spell was defeated. Especially since it is explicitly stated that red robe DID send letters as a contingency.

Some quotes that support my take on angels:

“[Angels] care about the ideals they are supposed to embody and the duty they have to the angelic hierarchy on a deep, instinctual level that humans would find next to impossible to grasp. As far as the angels are concerned, humans and other material beings are severely lacking in dedication, thoughtfulness, and selflessness.”

“Angels definitely try to live up to their virtues. It's not just a matter of them being forced to behave as they do by divine restrictions.”

“...a ruthless and methodical angel would be far more concerned about not crossing certain invisible lines than a human, who would see laws and ethical restrictions that get in the way of their ‘utility maximization' as annoying and onerous, and try to weasel out of them in any way they can.”

  Happy Groundhog Day everybody! I bring you gifts of new chapters on this very special day!

  I have a confession to make. I did not really finish the entire story. The epilogue still isn't finished, so there is one more update I have to make after this.

  The reason I did this was because: a) The chapters I did write outright end the plot of the novel. Not having an epilogue is annoying, but shouldn't diminish people's enjoyment of the ending too much. b) My editor convinced me I should extend the epilogue a little and make it more fleshed out. After thinking about it somewhat, I agree it will probably be more satisfying for the reasons if I did that. Even if they don't really get their promised ending post as a result.

  I know that some of you have increased your donations in response to my promise of making this the final update. Be sure to return your pledges to their normal levels after today! Or just cancel them altogether if you want to - I won't mind. I don't know if I'll make the epilogue a charged post - it depends on how long the new version ends up being.

****** It's still not negligible. QI said in chapter 81 that the crown gave him ten times the mana reserves, on top of his divine blessing, and he started at about magnitude 25 and has certainly maxed his growth.

So, firstly, QI will have to fight much more conservatively than usual.

Secondly, that actually is enough of a boost to matter to a dragon. Judging by QI's numbers, it can store mana equal to approximately magnitude 1000, and the author has indicated before that Zach at magnitude 200-ish (50 plus full growth) could potentially cast some lesser draconic spells, so 1000 is enough to make a difference.

Let's suppose that the draconic equivalent of magic missile costs 200, nearly all of Zach's reserves. Most mages would be pretty happy about carrying an item that can store enough personal mana to cast 5 extra magic missiles.

To take advantage of Sovereign Gate one must be marked by its creator or its agent. Will he be marked? Even if he got marked, will he survive inside?

Then convince them to add a "temporary" marker, and also to accept just a little self-updating memory package that they'll be able to carry out, just like with Jornak....

Plus, you've got a known way to get the Gate activated: Release a primordial!

So now in four hundred years, QI "tries" to release Panax again. When the looper shows up, do some soul magic fucker to stick a similar thing as with RR, and make sure the looper forgets you ever did that.

******** Huh. You know, looking through the story again, I think you're right. It somehow didn't register to me that the party wasn't the actual start of the summer festival, just a celebration preluding to it.

And the language of Zach's contract mentioned in-story said the kill-switch activation happened at the "end of the month", which I'm pretty sure means twelve o'clock of the night of the party, so Zorian and Zach cut it really close attacking on the last day available.

But then Jornak's POV in chapt. 105 said he started the invasion a day before the actual due date? I wonder if that was meant not quite literally, as in "one calendar date before the due date" which would be less than 24 hours before the deadline, rather than "more than twenty-four hours beforehand" that I was thinking of, or if his kill-switch activation actually happened a bit later than Zach's...

** Great ending to an awesome story.

I love the things left open... for later...

- Organj with two define artifacts. Remember when Zach got to carry the crown because it would help him more than Zorian - it gives a bonus as a percentage of your current reserves... and without that boost the dragon is already at least somewhat comparable to a high level angel. Who's hyped for hypothetical-book-2 "Zorian and the Dragon Tyrant"?

- Grey hunter enhanced with Panaxeth primordial essence. Another already-unstoppable killing machine, now potentially enhanced to an unknown level.

- Quatach-Ichl. Beaten, battered, but not destroyed. Wiser from the experience. An ally against Organj perhaps? No doubt that would mean awarding him the crown, and how far could he ever be trusted?

- Political instability may lead to war. Jornak claimed Eldemar is horribly corrupt, maybe that is his twisted perspective, maybe not.

- What caused the weeping?

*** You are mistaken about the crown. It does not give a percent boost. For Zorian its something like a 100x boost. For Zach its a 10x. The reason Zach uses the crown is that the crown does not provide a boost to mana regen which is a percent of total reserves normally. So for Zorian recharging the crown takes around 10x the time it takes for Zach to do so. As a result its more practical for him and Zorian is already specialized in a low mana efficient style of combat anyway.

***** He would regenerate it quickly, but even Zach has less mana than a dragon. I think at its most useful, assuming Zach has half his reserves, it would quintuple (5x) Organj's mana reserves. If it's less than that, it gets proportionally smaller and smaller. But even double reserves is no good for a dragon who can regenerate it so quickly.

I wonder how QI's crown retrieval will go when he's somewhat equivalent to Zach and Zorian without it increasing his mana reserves. But he's very crafty, so I do think he has a chance of recovering it.

Still, if the crown can hold about ten times as much as QI's reserves (which are similar to Zach's), then that means it's about an extra ten magic missiles for Oganj. Nothing to sneeze at, and there's nothing else in the world like it.

Contract is for Zach to not allow that info leaked before the end of the month. If Zach didn't know someone know, then it's fine. That's why, after he saw Zorian died along with his three enemies, he only checked his allies: Xvim, Alanic, Daimen, and the Arachnea. As far as he know, nobody else should know. Thus, he fulfilled that part of contract.

About random citizen that got their memories wiped, Zach will think it's an extra-paranoid move from Zorian part. It will also suggest to him that Zorian got everyone in his mass mind-wipe. Zach is safe.

What angel imply going after anyone knowing about time loop is for when Panaxeth released. It's not part of the contract, but a low key threat they threw to Zorian. Zorian, in turn, throw the same threat toward Quatach Ichl. Due to Pan remain sealed, there's no reason to carry the threat. The angels turn a blind eye as they promised.

*** It doesn't matter. Only Zach's perception is important, and he's convinced that everyone lost memories. He checked everyone who he knew was clued in, after all. You can't expect him to go for everyone who /might/ be clued in, since it's the entire world if you are paranoid enough.

Also Zorian did modify his memory slightly.

Btw, it was never said if Oganj knows about the time loop.

** I just realise that the time loop did change silverlake and becomes her downfall. She unconsciously believed that her doppelgänger will behave similarly with zach and zorian doppelgängers due to multiple exposures and the nature of time-loops. The time-loop had mellowed out her sense of caution towards a copy of her. She had dismissed the old silverlake as unimportant and not threatening.

Another reason to be added on will be that Silverlake is so self centered that shes unable to think from the perspective of the old her. Both of which let to her dead and downfall. Am i right [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]]

She's also all the time shielded from dangers, both from fellow loopers (due to her vital role) and from outside world (due to Zorian's Gift scheme). She won't be that different than she was.

And remembering she's the reckless type, I think she just forgot old Silverlake exist.

3) What, you thought that Silverlake was a nice person? Seriously, we also read about Jornak torturing and killing masses of people For Science, and kidnapping babies to sell to witches so they could do more of the same. Yes, the villains do and say things that good people should not.
