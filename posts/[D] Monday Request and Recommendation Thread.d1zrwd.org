Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I was wondering what good "Academy" stories are out there not necessarily rational. By academy I mean a group of people join some sort of academy for some amount of years, sometimes with some seasonal events for each year. Examples of the top my head of are [[http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds][Superpowered]] which used to be mostly a web novel and of course, Harry Potter.

I had quite liked superpowered and was wondering if what else was out there that has a similar story structure. even a link to a TvTropes page about these kinds of stories with examples would be apriciated.

**** As a mild counter, I was not a fan of this book. This book appears to be very divisive, and I have a few complaints, mostly about it's pacing. It's epic in length, but not in scope. It's a single book squeezed into a trilogy, to paraphrase Ebert. Keeps you on the hook about amazing deeds and then spends a whole book on his early teenage years.\\
You'll need a fair bit of patience to enjoy the indulgent story-telling, which I don't think necessarily resonates with this sub. The prose is better than most fics posted here, but not brilliant when compared to most published prose.

***** The KingKilller Chronicle is flawed, I agree. Certain sections remind me a little bit of the Inheritance Cycle, where time passes very slowly in great detail before passing very quickly with significantly less detail.

You also hit on some of the positives, the quality of the prose and story, the grandiose drama and passionate behavior of each plot point.

It is the type of story near every fantasy nerd has read, the type people loved in the first reading, recommended to all their friends, then spent the last few years loving to hate online and in person.

The moment Doors of Stone (putative book 3) is available for pre-order, I think a lot of the hate will dissipate and turn to excitement. The only way you could frame the story as rational would be by claiming Kvothe is really changing the details of the events he is narrating. The high fantasy setting, the complex, powerful, and seemingly unlimited magic shown by various parties, they all make the story both less rational, less believable, and more entertaining.

I would love to see the world experienced through other perspectives. /The Slow Regard of Silent Things/ was so different, so unique, and so rewarding that I would hate to see the universe Rothfuss has created be scrapped after Kvothe finishes his tale.

****** Sadly, I think the tale will never be finished. Rothfuss already started another novel set in the universe, but his editor was like "Fuck no. Finish the damn book." Rothfuss' response has been to play videogames and sweat over minutia for almost a decade. I legit think he was too slow, missed out on his most creative 5 years, and now he's not the type of person that can tell that story anymore. I really, really hope I'm wrong. But he hasn't published /anything/ for five years.

***** I'll mildly counter that mild counter. On a plot level the books are all over the place and move slowly. Rothfuss is probably the most successful author I know at using beta readers, though, so you'll generally find any given segment to be engaging. I think the prose is actually quite good for the standard of a commercial fantasy novel, the only current fantasy author that I think is a better technical writer is Abercrombie. Agree that it might not be a 100% fit for this sub, but they're worth reading.

***** The book is not divisive at all. It came out to major critical and general public acclaim and is thus both popular and highly regarded by critics. And in my opinion botht the critics and the public are right, its a pretty great series.

Now, I'm not going to claim it doesn't have big problems, the main character is a massive Mary sue, the fact that the third (and final) book in the series will never be released, the pacing in the second book isn't the best ever. But none of these are dealbreakers to me, and I don't think any of these will be dealbreakers to the typical readers of this sub (eg. most of us read fanfictions/webnovels where the MC is also a Mary Sue, will likely never finish and have shit pacing).

The school setting isn't heavily present---it serves more as a plot device to launch the characters out into the world, the world-building is that of humanity being repressed by a slew of different types of fantasy monsters that control entire swathes of continents, also: alternative history.

The first forty chapters have been edited and are being sold on amazon for a paltry price, which I recommend reading instead of the royalroad chapters since there's typos and the author's still learning how to write.

The author is well read and references famous literature/films. The author doesn't deconstruct tropes or satirize anything, it's predictable, but it's as good as anything if you're looking for something to binge.

****** Okay, here are a few of the bigger plot holes:

•Irrational Use of The Heretical Edge\\
In nature, there are two main strategies animals use to make the next generation. The first is mainly used by predators or larger mammals, where each individual offspring is cared and provided for as much as possible so it grows up real strong. The other strategy is numbers. With thousands of offspring, what does it matter that hundreds of them get eaten before they're even out of the egg? /Neither/ strategies are used in story, when both would have been the best. You could have the Heretical Edge active constantly by going around the world and going “hey, wanna be a magic person?” Then let them sink or swim on their own merit. Meanwhile, the normal screening procedures in the story let people go to magic island school where they're given a constant stream of high level monsters to deal the last blow to until every one of these students has their bases covered. The latter scenario happens /once/ to give everyone a small amount of regeneration. And apparently these weak kills /stack/! But no, only give one weak toad monster to each person.

•Worldwide Interaction\\
I get it, the author was too lazy to figure out how magic teleporting mirrors would have impacted shipping and the economy and all that. Still, at least a mention of /why/ they couldn't sell magic mirrors would fix this. Or even an idle thought from the main character. Sure, the monsters have an antimemetic effect, that's all well and good, but the magic itself isn't inherently unknowable. Set up magic healing thingies and call them technology. Save lives.

•Eden's Garden of Idiots\\
At least this one requires a presumably slow growing fruit instead of being flashed by a big light to become a Heretic, but come on---none of these guys give the newbies free monster kills either. Everyone's supposed to be a badass killer from the age of like nine or whatever and even these guys lack a few caged dinosaurs that the kids can poke to death.

•Magic is Programming\\
The story uses this trope and then does nothing with it. Exploding stones? Sure. More complex devices? Not even mentioned.

•Oh No Killers But Let's Not Be Too Hasty\\
So there's sabotage meant to kill someone, an ambush meant to kill someone, a teacher is dead, and the staff isn't pulling everyone out of class to personally be interviewed with Super Lie Detector spells from day one. That Heretic who's supposed to be investigating is only mentioned in passing and then does nothing because we can't have authority figures actually being useful.

•Guy Kills a World And It's Fine I Guess\\
Hey protagonist, this guy murdered an entire planet. You gonna tell your teachers, or ... no, okay, guess not. Good luck facing him later. Alone. You moron.

******* It's been a while since I got caught up on reading Heretical Edge but the reason they don't just line up tons of monsters for the kids is because it's explained that easy kills for the Reaper-based Heretics drives them insane with bloodlust

The useless administration is also explained but I'm a little more fuzzy on it, IIRC there's a lot of high level conspiracy stuff like half the staff is secretly brainwashed and/or aliens and the actual non-compromised staff can't do anything for their own reasons

Honestly, I can see where you're coming from. A lot of Cerulean's work is like this, where plot points are set up over multiple arcs, and it can get really frustrating waiting weeks or months for a real explanation as to why an otherwise semi-rational story has such a glaring plot hole.

I feel like this is a result of the plot being planned out and having been gone over by the author so much, without enough awareness of things other than the plot. I think at a certain point they kinda forget that the character should be questioning stuff like this, because they the author know the answer so it doesn't even occur to them. Definitely a flaw.

Yeah this is basically a big ol' plot hole. You could say that magic is still super hard despite the freedom it allows, but it's hard to believe that would limit it as much as it seems to in the story. I'm much more of a fan of restricted magic systems fully explored than supposedly open magic systems being underutilised. It would have been better if the magic abilities and properties of material was the only magic in the setting, IMO. Even a little bit of magic is overpowered in a rational context, though, so it's pretty hard to find stories with actual magic realism.

See, if only she'd /asked/ that could've been kept a mystery. And even then: that just means they gotta set a killing schedule, yeah? Otherwise people are going to be hunting and killing as much as they can. This is the kinda thing you warn people about.

Like, all or most of the things I bring up get addressed later and I /know/ that, but no one treats them rationally. Even after they have an explanation it feels forced because there's nothing that makes the surprise seem inevitable. That's the key to making a good plot twist: surprising, yet inevitable. The first component's there, but what the story is now doesn't really work. A bunch of the more open ended elements should've been pared down in the editing phase, and the story reworked so that the different plot points fit together. (I have some problems with the beginning of the story too.)

That's definitely something I was thinking at first, but potential traitors are already given too much power just by being heretics in the first place. They can't actually truly test people's loyalty for whatever reason (I would imagine a combination of limits of magic and heretic families not standing up for invasive methods (I think these are sorta indirectly mentioned)) so it wouldn't be a wise move to guarantee that traitors get maximum power I guess?

But then again, the on average the people who kill more are likelier to be more loyal just as it's already set up, so I don't know.

And yeah, I get what you're saying. There's a difference between a story with rational explanations and a rational story. On the subject of plot twists I guess I get what you're saying, but I don't know if I agree how much it applies to HE. I'm sure there's lots of what you're describing, but since it's been so long since I've read the early parts I basically only remember the standout twists, the best of the best.

********** I'll assume you mean the problems I have with the start of the story? They're mostly about tone and promises. The thing is, the beginning isn't bad on its own. It grounds the reader's expectations but also sets the main character up as someone competent and experienced. And that's why it doesn't work at all with the rest of the story, because the main character is simultaneously an intrepid, calculated risk-taker and a wide-eyed fish out of water. It's /jarring/ to see this person who's shown to operate in high stress situations and roll with the punches just /freeze/ for entire paragraphs of internal narration and description. And the yelping, what's with that? She yelps way too often.

Got off track. The point is, the start of the story promises some detective shenanigans---Scooby Doo stuff, or Sherlock Holmes. Down to earth, nonmagical. And then all that's immediately thrown out of the window, both character building and tone.

******** Some people like book five. Some people even like the whole series up until the end. But, in my opinion, it gets worse every book after 4.

The first three books shouldn't really be read as straight fantasy. They're a little more in a fairy tale genre. You're not really intended to think of the Dursleys as abusers any more than you're supposed to think of the evil stepsisters in Cinderella as abusers. I mean, you can use that lens, and it applies, but its not the lens that the stories themselves assume you'll apply. Same with the ridiculously unsafe castle (they get sent to a deathtrap forest for detention, for example) and the somewhat fairy-tale last act to the first book. Starting with book 4 there's a bit of a genre transition to straight fantasy, the books become much longer and they lose the fairy tale quality.

Also, was just kidding, life is short and there's no shame in choosing not to read something. But good that you started the series!

It is not essential however and if you are time limited id invest the time reading some other fantastic fanfiction like anything nonjon has written (Yudkowski gets the name david monroe from "a black comedy" which i recommend even higher than hpmor for sheer entertainment value) and "harry the hufflepuff" featuring a harry that had been called lazy more than a freak and tries to live up to his reputation.

If there was a isekai version of Dungeon Engineer with an intellectual and rational protagonist, check out [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26977/second-life-as-the-sister-of-a-goddess][Second Life as the Sister of a Goddess]].

The MC was a 60-something year old fitness instructor before being reincarnated as a non-human (avoiding spoilers) baby. Instead of engineering and terrariums we get neuroscience and developmental biology, along with magic and mythology.

The story is extremely well written so far, however the pacing is somewhat slow, with occasionally multiple PoVs of the same events. I do think it's slow because I'm comparing it to other isekai stories that skim through early life, and it would be better enjoyed with an open mind.

I would just like to point out that it's mentioned that the reason Earth doesn't have any magic at all is because a god managed to gain power beyond all other existing gods and sealed Earth off from access to magic. It's implied that the most well known gods are also the most powerful and what god is more well known than the Christian god?

****** On the other hand, the isolation between dimensions isn't absolute, since she herself managed to cross from one to another as a mere mortal. So it'd be reasonable for her to assume at least likelyhood of her former god keeping tabs on her and punishing / rewarding her based on her actions in the new dimension. “Commandments jurisdiction outside of the default dimension” sort of thing.

*** Thanks for recommending this. I agree the pacing is slow, but it was still very readable. The refreshing thing for me is that the author has a concept, establishes rules and runs with it, even when that is at the expense of what authors would ordinarily do or "good writing." A story that is well fit for [[/r/rational]] I think.

An example was that at one point [the author] justifies the magic system using some logic which is sort of almost reasonable. This was actually negative to my suspension of disbelief - the argument was not enough to /actually/ be reasonable (of course), but enough to engage my instinct to evaluate things rather than just treating it as technobabble like most stories do. That is certainly something I'll forgive though. As light entertainment goes, you could do worse.

Maybe something for authors to remember: don't try to justify why your built world is the way it is. Just say "them's the rules" and then have the in-world characters introduce their theories (or not) as appropriate. Having an argument as to why your world is a certain way is not necessary: the real world certainly doesn't.

Also, as far as current season anime go, I recommend:

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/327551/changeling-space-program][Changeling Space Program]] is a My Little Pony story about the changelings in a space race against the other species to be the first ones to reach the moon. There is a sequel crossover with the Martian, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian][The Maretian]], which is about the Equestrian crew crash landing on Mars and sharing in Mark's challenges and woes. Heavy on the sciencing one's way into space with some political drama/comedy.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break Them All]] is about exploring what happens when modern science is applied to a magic system which resembles magic used in stories like Harry Potter and similar systems with quirks like gold being hard to conjure, old artifacts/spells are stronger than modern day magic, and other fairy tale like qualities. Fairly slice of life while exploring magical consequences.

The sixth book in a series I follow, [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CGH284?ref_=dbs_r_series&storeType=ebooks][Nightlord]], has just came out. It's about a guy who gets turned into a vampire and then tossed into another world with magic set in a medieval era where he spends time wandering around as a hero before sorta accidentally-on-purpose becoming the king of a newly founded kingdom.

Despite the cliche wish fulfillment sounding summary, he acts very much like someone from this community where he spends time investigating his powers as a vampire and as a wizard (plus the magic to cross alternate worlds), puts serious thought into the ethics of a modern person as a king in a dark ages society, and has genuine relationships with one woman at a time instead of the standard harem.

One issue that might put off readers is that the books are very long and the plot...sort of meanders around a little. Very often the protagonist sets out to do one thing in a subplot and ends up starting another entirely different subplot. The story always gets back to the old plots, but it's evocative of real life where events are messy and don't ever have a neat, self-contained arc or episode. I liked it, but I know it's not to everyone's taste. The books are also very long. As in each book is as long as a trilogy for any other series. A short one, but still.

Preorders for [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8ZH6BS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Uncrowned]] is now out for anyone who is a fan of the Cradle series.

It's about a guy who gets summoned to another world to be a +hero+ dungeon master. Ie, to work for the other side. It's not rationalist, but he does get creative in fun ways with abusing the systems. For one thing he plays around with a "Create Golem" skill to create lots of different kinds of machines nobody else can replicate. When chosen to be Issekai'd he also gets the power to understand all languages, which is only moderately useful... Until he realizes that incantations for spells are just commands issued in a long dead language... Which he can now speak...

That said, he's not very ambitious, so he mostly uses his powers to protect/upgrade his dungeon and live in luxury. Still, it's entertaining.

** Repping a manga I saw trolling the last few weeks' archive: [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/102690/Deatte_5-byou_de_Battle][Battle in 5 Seconds after meeting]]

It falls into a genre I've taken to calling "power battler", whose qualities are:

1. Characters have various special/unique abilities or powers, usually supernatural

2. Conflict in the plot is solved by the application of powers or their loopholes

3. Downtime in the plot involves theorycrafting on power strengths and weaknesses, and trying to forge alliances with powers that complement one's own or exploit a weakness in the enemys' powers.

Examples: [[https://mangakakalot.com/manga/be919195][Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors]], [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]] (and possibly Glowfic, though I haven't gotten much into it), [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] (Superhero stories lend themselves to this)

** I'm not looking for a specific book. I'm looking for a better way to search for books to read.

I have a list of books I like and have rated, both on amazon and on Goodreads. What I want is a good recommendation engine that can take a look at all of those books and spit out similar books that I might like.

Amazon supposedly does this. But it cheats, and the way it cheats makes the recommendations really shitty. Instead of looking at all my books, it just looks at the most recently read books. And then it only looks at one book at a time. Which is fine as a recommendation engine if I want more stuff in the same series (stupidly easy to find), stuff by the same author (also very easy to find on my own), or some vaguely similar new releases on kindle unlimited (hard to find, but very hit or miss in terms of quality).

List of things I want from a recommendation engine:

1. Take into account my past reading.
2. Allow me to filter down the list and remove items I have decided not to read (Amazon doesn't seem to let me remove recommendations which is frustrating as hell).
3. Not have any strong biases that I don't care about (amazon will recommend new stuff over old stuff 9 times out of 10, but I have no such preference).

******* The main character is just way too powerful for the setting. Nothing's a real challenge, which could be done well but not with the plot as is. You could have something like /Significant Digits/ where you have the plot based more on scientific advancement and finding out the hidden bad guys, but naw, straight power fantasy. She's just /given/ tons of rare items for no reason, because why not, and gets a bunch of powerful friends, because she's just that good I guess. Everything feels like it revolves around her, where in a good story you'd pick up that other people have their own lives. This makes everything she achieves feel unearned.

******** That... is a totally fair gripe to have with the story! I guess I'm somewhat inured to it, since what you describe is prevalent in Xianxia which I'm generally willing to read, and increasingly common in other webnovels.

It makes for a decent popcorn fic if you can put up with that - it's competently written, with some nice worldbuilding - but if that's a dealbreaker then be assured it doesn't improve much in that respect.

********* I agree, popcorn fic is a good word for it. Good in short bursts, but if I think too hard about it I get annoyed. I used to be able to just power through any story if I liked the premise, but then I started writing. And the thing is, nowadays if a story could've been great but was executed horribly, I get /ideas/ I don't have the time to get out of my head and on to a page. So they fester, and that sucks.

*** Unfortunately I don't think anything like this exists. Sites which provide recommendations are generally incredibly bad at it. I think this is mainly because they assume "good recommendation == work similar to what the user has read before in some way." I don't see any reason to believe that in general, although you can get some kind of results that way. I suspect those results are worse in practice than uniform random sampling weighted by popularity though [allowing users to pick filters to limit the set of works considered and obviously removing things they have already read + things they have marked as not interested]. Companies who definitely have the technical capability to do better than the current situation typically don't have any incentive to.

An example of how I might approach attempting to do better than random (not as easy as it sounds!) would be:

1. Get the entirety of the posts & comments on [[/r/rational]] and extract user->recommendation pairs from the posts
2. Apply something like PageRank to build a map of the works which are most recommended
3. Recursively add works to the map by seeing what [[/r/rational]] users recommend elsewhere and also by finding users who recommend the same works in other subreddits and seeing what else they recommend
4. You then have a starting point for "works which are likely to be relevant to [[/r/rational]] users". It's almost certainly the case that you would have read almost all of the top suggestions; this is good as it allows you to immediately rate them. I personally would probably use 3 options for rating read works: "high quality," "guilty pleasure/readable but nothing special" and "bad." Also as you suggest "won't read" for works you haven't read.
5. Based on the ratings, weight the contributions of individual users to build a map which is directly relevant to you. Possibly also show which users have a good track record so you can pay attention to future recommendations from them.

Although I can't prove it without actually doing this, I feel like this would be very obviously better than any other recommendation system currently out there. Conceptually, to sort things based on "generalised word of mouth". I have some confidence that this would work given how huge an improvement google search was over anything else when they first started up and the main thing they did differently was use PageRank.
