** Ugh. Got to about chapter 5 or 6, still no proper munchkining (just somewhat-OP protagonist), and then it turned NSFW.

I much prefer [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] - which is unfinished and only updating occasionally, but still worth a read.

*** Munchkining won't start until around chapter 34. Protagonist is just flailing around doing nsfw stuff and getting crippled in process (don't ask) while whining about his social awkwardness.

Indeed. But when considering his reasons for dismissing the one and chasing the other, I don't have respect for those reasons.

***** spoilers until about chapter 13 though nothing major :

I'm pretty sure it's not just about the proportions. How comfortable are you with entering long term relationships with a 16 yo? Also the waitress /knew/ it was just something casual and accepted it, you could even say she even wanted it that way so their interests aligned. If he got in a relationship with Sila he would've basically had to marry her or be even more of an asshole and dump her after he had his fun.

Long term relationships between elves and humans might not be a good idea at all, they can't have children and one lives 3 times more than the other so I don't see any reason to not respect him. Hell you could say he showed exceptional restrain to not sleep with her when she threw herself at him

** I am a subscriber (and occasional writer) on [[/r/HFY]]

Not sure it's exactly rational per say, more that it aims to put humans in the best light possible. Think of it as a counter to all the death, destruction, and general misery in the real world. As [[/u/NotACauldronAgent]] said, it's usually done through the antagonist +being an idiot+ missing some key feature.

Treat the stories as normal stories, without expecting them to be rational. And don't be surprised that some themes/tropes become very very common (and somewhat repetitive).

** So, real question:

How good is the stuff on [[/r/HFY]]? The themes seem to be largely ones this subreddit shares, but is it actually /rational/?

*** Ah, not really? It's nice and all, and the categories HFY and Rational are definitely not mutually exclusive, but most HFYs in my experience tend to be "humans are awesome because I've made the antagonists missing something" or just generic "humans win." Not to say there aren't good ones, I've enjoyed some, but despite often being pro- things much of the rationalist community are for, like space travel, fusion power, or transhumanism, most are merely science fiction.

*** Not remotely rational. Additionally, I tried reading all the top upvoted posts and found them all pretty average. Rather disappointing as I feel it's the kind of thing I would really enjoy. I remember feeling some pretty strong frisson when reading about Larry Niven's human-kzin wars or the yeerk's opinion on humans in Animorphs, for example.

** So I stumbled over this story on [[/r/HFY]] (highly recommend the subreddit itself), and I've only read the first chapter so far. But it seems to fit this subreddit very well.

It's about the standard trope of a protagonist being thrown into a fantasy word, but with a focus on him applying his modern scientific knowledge to the magic. The magic system isn't like a programming language or anything so recognizably modern. It's more like him learning DnD-like spells and munchkining the hell out of them.

Also, it works really well in a reddit format with the commentary that's just as interesting as the story itself.
