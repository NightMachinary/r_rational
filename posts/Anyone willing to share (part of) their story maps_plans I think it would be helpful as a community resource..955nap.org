The rational fiction community seems very good about planning their stories extensively before writing them (unlike most of the webnovel community).

I know my story plans and notes are all over the place and go through revisions all the time and then when it actually comes to writing, I'll often go with the flow and ignore the story map for a while, so what's written ends up being quite different from what was planned.

I was curious to see what other people do---especially here where the stories are so well plotted---and also see how much the written story ends up diverging from the plan.

So, anyone who's published or posted all or part of your story on the internet: would you be willing to share the part of your story map/plan/notes that don't contain spoilers for any as-yet-unreleased parts of your story? I know it would help me and I think it would be a good community resource.

Thanks!

Not that I've published anything under my name in a long time, but I do NaNo every year, which is writing! Anyway.

My usual thing is that I start with a thesis. Speculative fiction at its best, whether it's original fiction or fanfiction and whether it's SF or Fantasy, is about an idea as seen through the lens of people and persons; this is just as true for the old classics (Foundation, 10,000 Leagues) as it is for the more modern stuff (Jo Walton's 'Tooth and Claw' asks what biology would support the claims of regency romance, Bakker's 'Prince of Nothing' asks what an ubermench is).

So let's say my theses are "What does an urban fantasy that doesn't beg the question actually look like?" (in homage to Mage's Technocracy) and "What would someone from outside our context think of our attitude towards environmental/ecological issues?" (hi, Modesitt, thanks for the feels, you jerk). I answer those questions, and that brings up more questions, and I answer those questions.

Somewhere around there I have ideas for cool scenes or people or abstract concepts, and I turn those into vignettes or structure them out; as I do this, more questions pose themselves.

The last thing I do is I pull up some random "give your character more depth" questionnaire and answer it for literally every character I have the patience to, then figure out what progress they're making on their personal goals and how their life is changing while they're offscreen.

After that, I'm ready to write! Bonus, I have vignettes that I can slot into what I've already written to cheat a little on the wordcount. I'd never win NaNo without that, probably; I'm bad at writing, especially compared to the titanic work ethic of the web serial authors whom I really shouldn't be comparing myself to.

*** Thanks, this is great (though that means I have to read your story now to see how it compares to the outline o.0).

You mentioned in your third post you were planning to put together a "pseudocode" version of the story before you started writing. Did you ever do that? If so, would you mind posting it or sending it to me? (I know it's a bit like walking around in your underwear though, so I'll understand if you don't want to. I think that's why I haven't gotten any responses of this kind yet.)

Though it's still useful as a general framework for the story as a whole, Harmon's story circle isn't a great fit for multi-arc stories, series, or sprawling epics, so the main thing I've been looking for has been those "pseudocode" story plans, especially when there's a posted work I can compare them to.

**** [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HNPzM2CiRMehpr3kbcCEbimyGfz0qMkqEKSkhWvzKSw/edit?usp=sharing][Here you go.]] That's v1 and v2 of the psuedocode, so you can see some of the evolution.

Edit: Note, the last edit on that doc was October 29, 2014, which was a handful of days before the first words of the story were written. There are some obvious changes in the text itself, some of which are a result of writing that document, some of which came from more spur of the moment things. Sofia and Rowan originally had a brother, who the psuedocode revealed didn't really have a point. Henry used to be named Harry, Omarr used to be named Omake. I /think/ the way the v2 version was written was that each un-italicized sentence was written first, then the italicized paragraphs were written after all the individual sentence descriptions of chapters/scenes were finished (edit 2: confirmed to be the case through revision history). The whole sub-plot with Sofia's mother wasn't in there at all.

Also, because I forgot to link it, you can read the first draft of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][here]].

***** Thanks a bunch! What I most wanted was outlines from before the writing process started, so this is perfect. I know I tend to edit my outlines as I write to keep them at least somewhat updated with what I ended up writing, so the "original plan" ends up not existing anymore. I wasn't too hopeful that I'd be able to find any in its raw form. Thanks for this. I'll be reading your story over the next week.

** Not precisely what you're asking, but I find that one of the most important things for me is to keep a careful timeline as I write. It helps me track how long various things should have lasted, if it's feasible for the cavalry to ride to the rescue in time, etc. It also tells me where I have space to go back and insert a new scene if I want.

*** This is something you do as/after you write, right? Like after writing a bit, you'll fill in your timeline with how long things lasted? I can't imagine writing out a timeline /before/ you write that's detailed enough to use it the way you do.

Edit: To answer your other question, I'm asking if anyone is willing to post their point-by-point story plans, or as alexanderwales referred to it, the "pseudocode" version of the story. I'm looking to improve my technique in this area, so I was hoping to have examples I could look at of what other people have done.

Being able to look at this kind of outline side-by-side with the final product that was written based on it would hopefully allow me to see not only what works for other people, but also how much of the foreshadowing, hints, plot twists, etc. was actually planned from the beginning, which were happy accidents, which were done on the fly, etc.

***** Gotcha. Just for the record, I'm not looking for something well organized (my notes sure aren't). I just wanted to see examples of what people are working with, so the raw, unfiltered version is exactly what I want (though I realize it could be embarrassing to share it, I figured the rational community would be more open to doing so than other writers).

That said, if you haven't written or posted the story yet, I obviously won't ask to see the notes. Nobody likes spoilers.

** Not exactly what you were asking for, but since my process is a bit different as I work with another person in an extremely collaborative way, I thought I'd show the "house map" I sketched out once I realised, in editing, that I'd need to make sure the house the story is set in is described in a consistent manner.

[[https://imgur.com/a/bCFUeMH]]

Even though it's not to scale and not "official" in any meaningful sense - I might decide I need an extra room later on - I can be confident that when I describe the kitchen as being through the dining room from the sitting room, or that the bathroom is at the end of a long hallway, I'm not going to write myself into a corner.

Like how the simpson's house has a door that leads to the basement or the closet, or how the bathroom on the top floor moves around between episodes. Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder!

**** It helps to conceptualise the story by making me think about it: the house in question is being rented by the protagonist from the antagonist, so I thought about what the /antagonist/ would put in her house. The top floor, in particular, caters to her sensibilities concerning servants. So it was a tool that helped me conceptualise /that/.

Plus, it helps with some atmospheric stuff: vampires are scared of the sun, so how do they avoid it? In this case, I have lots of "airlocks", so that way accidental door openings during the sunshine don't end up deadly, and have the vampire quarters in the centre of the house so e.g. a falling tree is less likely to affect it, and the stove at a far corner surrounded by thick stone walls.

I had an underground vampire compound in a nWoD campaign I GMed, and I gave that tons and tons of ornamental reflective pools, so that way in the event of attack the vampires could jump into the pools to put out fires/etc.

** I've had a few different approaches to outlines, but my big personal rule of writing prep 'best practices' is to be able to describe the whole arc of the story before I start, including the climax, the conclusion, and what the main characters are trying to achieve. For a given story, sometimes I've had many pages of notes before I started writing, and sometimes I've just started with a blank page, but for the stories I've been most satisfied with, the common denominator is knowing what I'm writing towards, even in a broad sense.

*** Right, I think this community is very good at planning their stories ahead of time. I was hoping people would be willing to share their outlines for things they've already finished writing (or parts of the outlines for things they've written so far). Taking a look at real examples along with the written work is much more useful than just theory. Do you have anything you're willing to share?

**** Here's the only extended part of my notes on Rebels Can't Go Home that isn't spoilers:

/Barder bland tan the witch is a leopard head/torso and has two minds, in a crash site near Basecamp, points at tach harvesters down the hill working for days, lifeboat is trashed, and barder tells the/ story in the worst way,

/Other yellow eyes, rounded, furry ears, black line on front, patterned white, nanites/

/The ranger who'd suggested scavenging--Atil of Subclan Tahl'. The warrior who'd volunteered his cathan to pull the monster--Vren of Subclan Gorth'. Cupping a hand to the shoulder Hett of Yatt' his-saah/

/( burial of elder and missing others + sick + herbalist + 23 archers + 3 cathan rider (score of prisoners, 12 porters, 6 knights, 2 red robed)/

/many huntmasters, re'eef (bray) backed adapted runners )/

Probably not what you're looking for, but it's a start. Components that refer to plot points include 'harvesters down the hill' (refers to a search in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/94np29/rebels_cant_go_home_chapter_22/][Chapter 22]]) and 'burial of elder' (refers to a burial in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/94d379/rebels_cant_go_home_chapter_21/][Chapter 21]]); most of the rest is character description/characterization.

EDIT: I imagine more useful than what I've provided is Brandon Sanderson's online posting of [[https://brandonsanderson.com/books/warbreaker/warbreaker/][Warbreaker]], which includes chapter-by-chapter commentary of his writing process.
