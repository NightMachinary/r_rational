Hi, Is there a way to get automatic email updates whenever a chapter is posted? I am getting email updates when a new chapter of Worth the Candle is posted, but I would like to get updates for the following list:

- Pokemon: origin of species
- The wandering inn
- The daily grind
- The practical guide to evil

I would appreciate any tips.

Thanks!


** I think all those stories have RSS feeds. You [[https://ifttt.com/applets/147561p-rss-feed-to-email][apparently]] can set up [[https://ifttt.com/][IFTTT]] (with which I am /not/ acquainted, so take this with a grain of salt) to send you an email whenever an RSS feed updates. Alternatively, you can just use [[https://feedly.com][Feedly]] to follow the RSS feeds directly; it doesn't send out emails, but at least it consolidates all the stories in one place that you can check regularly.

*** Also, if you use Thunderbird, that has a built-in RSS reader as well, removing any practical difference between checking emails and RSS feeds.

** All of these stories have email alerts, with the caveat that you sign up for the service (Fanfiction.net, Wordpress and RoyalRoadL) and subscribe to the story.

** PTGE is on WordPress and you can get email updates via WordPress followed sites.

** RSS feeds are the best! All RR stories have feeds of their own, and if you want to participate in this sub Reddit, (and get updates for the stories here that don't have RSS feeds) just add .RSS to the url, makes it into a feed link.

** PGtE is every MWF with bonus chapters on the first of the month and EE is like a machine when it comes to updating on time. The others it might be worth getting a FF account
