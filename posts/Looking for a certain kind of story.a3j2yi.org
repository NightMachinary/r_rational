I was wondering if there were any rational stories about sentient video game characters? Specifically, giving focus to the relationship between the character and the player who has a great deal of power over them. I asked someone I know who reads a lot of rational fiction if they knew any such stories, and they said no, so are there any that exist? (And are good)


** Dunno about rational fiction, but have you played Undertale or Doki Doki Literature Club?

*** I've seen playthroughs. I was wondering if there were any rational stories on what a game like those would be like if it were /actually/ for real.

**** Yeah, sadly I can't help with that. Although honestly I think that kind of story really benefits from the interactive nature of video games as a medium.

***** Rationalist VN where you dialogue with a character that's fully self-aware of his status as such. I dig the idea.

** the Friendship is Optimal verse covers a lot of these. Read the original and then the three works by Chatoyance as a good starting point for high quality stories. Then go through the rest of the stories in the tag.

It is MLP fanfic but the MLP lore is not the main focus of it: it's a story about artificial intelligence first and foremost.

**** It didn't for me, at least in the original. It's a paperclipping AI, but instead of paperclips, it's friendship and ponies, a fact which is played for horror rather than to indulge a love of ponies (at least, in my opinion).

As for the derivative works, it's kind of a crapshoot. Some people have a different take that's rather more heavy on the ponies and light on the existential horror, which doesn't really work for me. The original is worth a read though, definitely, even if you're not into ponies (which I'm not).

***** It's funny that I once saw a take on FiO that was basically "these rationalists are crazy, who the hell could think this scenario is desirable" and I was surprised because for me it doesn't /feel/ like the fic describes a desirable scenario at all - perhaps better than some of the most nightmarish paperclipping ones, but at the very best extremely ambiguous and with some rather horrifying undertones. But obviously it's subjective, and I'm not entirely sure about what the author's original intent even was.

**** Look if you are completely allergic to the word "pony" then maybe, but the premise is that a post human AI is made and its job is to, essentially, run the MLP MMO. There's a lot of stuff where people are outraged about post-human AI doing pony-related things. It's not set in the pony world; it's set in the Near Future in Our World, not in the pony world.

The first story, by iceman, is relatively short and definitely worth a shot. You can determine whether it's got too much pony for yourself. (The first chapter has a huge amount of pony relative to the rest of the story, FYI; but it's a play demo of the MLP MMO. You might want to just skip it and start with Chapter 2).

**** "What if somebody /doesn't want to be a pony/?"

“At some point, their desire to not be a pony will come in conflict with their other desires. For example, they may be lonely because there will be very few humans left. Or perhaps they'll give into social pressure because their family or close circle of friends decided to upload together. Or maybe they hold out for a long time, but run out of food because society collapsed around them.”

** I don't know if I'd consider it "rational", /or/ if it has an English dub, but there's an Italian movie from the 90s, "Nirvana", that confronts exactly this issue. In a cyberpunk future, an unspecified glitch causes the main character from a game that's about to be released to become sentient and able to retain memory of each playthrough, and having understood the limits of his existence, he begs his developer to delete him before the game is distributed and his mind is copied over the entire world so many times he'll basically become immortal and forced to relive his limited story over and over again.

** Another MLP story, which actually is MLP fanfic, fits your request pretty well: /[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/181949/at-the-inn-of-the-prancing-pony][At the Inn of the Prancing Pony]]/, by [[https://www.fimfiction.net/user/33111/McPoodle][McPoodle]]. An mysterious power has enabled D&D gamers in a parallel-universe version of our world to take control of ponies in Equestria, and changed Equestria into a more stereotypical D&D world. Princess Celestia, recently awakened from enchanted sleep, struggles to get to the bottom of things and break the connection.

The meta-lore behind the connection isn't developed so well, but the story does do a good job exploring the relationship between player and character.

*** I've read that, but thats more like the player getting transported into the game. I'm looking for one where the player interacts with characters from the real world, like DDLC or Oneshot, and goes into detail about that kind of relationship.

** Oh I can't remember the name of it but there's a story about a character who is playing a video game and the love interest character turns out to be sentient and has an existential crisis over it (and also is a bit jealous of his irl girlfriend). Turns out it's all an elaborate prank by his irl girlfriend except in the end he is still left wondering for some reason

(spoilers which ruin the ending but are probably necessary for identifying the story)

- Small Medium is about an NPC in a world that was made for players. It's still early in, though.
- Changing Faces is about an NPC that switches souls with the PC that killed him, and being respawned in a New Game+ type manner, which was clearly intended for a PC, not him.
