Today I lost a loved one. It might seem weird, and maybe I'm a weird person, but what I'd really love to read right now are your favorite quotes about the fight against death. Why death is something to struggle against, how science promises us the tools to defeat it, really anything that reminds the reader that death isn't something that needs to be blindly accepted. To start things off I'll post one of mine. It doesn't specifically mention death, but I feel it's appropriate:

White Hat: So, has this sickness opened you up to looking for answers beyond science?

Cueball: ...no, not really.

[Cueball turns to face White Hat.]

Cueball: We've groped for comfort before the slings and arrows of [mis]fortune for millennia, and I begrudge nobody their sources of solace.

Cueball: But Science provides tools.

Cueball: $100 billion a year in scientific studies and medical R&D has bought us some pretty damn powerful slings and arrows of our own.

Cueball: This world is amazing, and I'm going to live to experience more of it thanks to people who refused to gracefully accept the ineffability of reality.

Cueball: I find my courage where I can, but I take my weapons from science.

Cueball: Because they work, bitches.

** HPMOR at its finest:

#+begin_quote
  Within his mind, Harry discarded the last remnants of the peace of the phoenix, put aside the calm, the dreamlike state, remembered instead Fawkes's piercing cry, and roused himself for battle. Called upon all the pieces and elements of himself to awaken. Raised up within himself all the strength that the Patronus Charm could ever draw upon, to put himself into the right frame of mind for the final warm and happy thought; remembered all bright things.

  The books his father had bought him.

  Mum's smile when Harry had handmade her a mother's day card, an elaborate thing that had used half a pound of spare electronics parts from the garage to flash lights and beep a little tune, and had taken him three days to make.

  Professor McGonagall telling him that his parents had died well, protecting him. As they had.

  Realizing that Hermione was keeping up with him and even running faster, that they could be true rivals and friends.

  Coaxing Draco out of the darkness, watching him slowly move toward the light.

  Neville and Seamus and Lavender and Dean and everyone else who looked up to him, everyone that he would have fought to protect if anything threatened Hogwarts.

  Everything that made life worth living.

  His wand rose into the starting position for the Patronus Charm.

  Harry thought of the stars, the image that had almost held off the Dementor even without a Patronus. Only this time, Harry added the missing ingredient, he'd never truly seen it but he'd seen the pictures and the video. The Earth, blazing blue and white with reflected sunlight as it hung in space, amid the black void and the brilliant points of light. It belonged there, within that image, because it was what gave everything else its meaning. The Earth was what made the stars significant, made them more than uncontrolled fusion reactions, because it was Earth that would someday colonize the galaxy, and fulfill the promise of the night sky.

  Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children's children's children, the distant descendants of humankind as they strode from star to star? No. Of course not. The Dementors were only little nuisances, paling into nothingness in the light of that promise; not unkillable, not invincible, not even close. You had to put up with little nuisances, if you were one of the lucky and unlucky few to be born on Earth; on Ancient Earth, as it would be remembered someday. That too was part of what it meant to be alive, if you were one of the tiny handful of sentient beings born into the beginning of all things, before intelligent life had come fully into its power. That the much vaster future depended on what you did here, now, in the earliest days of dawn, when there was still so much darkness to be fought, and temporary nuisances like Dementors.

  Mum and Dad, Hermione's friendship and Draco's journey, Neville and Seamus and Lavender and Dean, the blue sky and brilliant Sun and all bright things, the Earth, the stars, the promise, everything humanity was and everything it would become...

  On the wand, Harry's fingers moved into their starting positions; he was ready, now, to think the right sort of warm and happy thought.

  And Harry's eyes stared directly at that which lay beneath the tattered cloak, looked straight at that which had been named Dementor. The void, the emptiness, the hole in the universe, the absence of color and space, the open drain through which warmth poured out of the world.

  The fear it exuded stole away all happy thoughts, its closeness drained your power and strength, its kiss would destroy everything that you were.

  I know you now, Harry thought as his wand twitched once, twice, thrice and four times, as his fingers slid exactly the right distances, I comprehend your nature, you symbolize Death, through some law of magic you are a shadow that Death casts into the world.

  And Death is not something I will ever embrace.

  It is only a childish thing, that the human species has not yet outgrown.

  And someday...

  We'll get over it...

  And people won't have to say goodbye any more...

  The wand rose up and leveled straight at the Dementor.

  "EXPECTO PATRONUM!"

  The thought exploded from him like a breaking dam, surged down his arm into his wand, burst from it as blazing white light. Light that became corporeal, took on shape and substance.

  A figure with two arms, two legs, and a head, standing upright; the animal Homo sapiens, the shape of a human being.

  Glowing brighter and brighter as Harry poured all his strength into his spell, blazing with incandescent light brighter than the fading sunset, the Aurors and Professor Quirrell shielding their eyes in shock -

  And someday when the descendants of humanity have spread from star to star, they won't tell the children about the history of Ancient Earth until they're old enough to bear it; and when they learn they'll weep to hear that such a thing as Death had ever once existed!

  The figure of a human shone more brilliant now than the noonday Sun, so radiant that Harry could feel the warmth of it on his skin; and Harry sent out all his defiance at the shadow of Death, opening all the floodgates inside him to make that bright shape blaze even brighter and yet brighter.

  You are not invincible, and someday the human species will end you.

  I will end you if I can, by the power of mind and magic and science.

  I won't cower in fear of Death, not while I have a chance of winning.

  I won't let Death touch me, I won't let Death touch the ones I love.

  And even if you do end me before I end you,

  Another will take my place, and another,

  Until the wound in the world is healed at last...

  Harry lowered his wand, and the bright figure of a human faded away.

  Slowly, he exhaled.

  Like waking up from a dream, like opening his eyes after sleep, Harry's gaze moved away from the cage, he looked around and saw that everyone was staring at him.

  Albus Dumbledore was staring at him.

  Professor Quirrell was staring at him.

  The Auror trio was staring at him.

  They were all looking at him like they'd just seen him destroy a Dementor.

  The tattered cloak lay empty within the cage.

** [[http://www.yudkowsky.net/other/yehuda/][Eliezer Yudkowsky's email message after the death of his brother.]] Some quotes:

#+begin_quote
  I used to say: "I have four living grandparents and I intend to have four living grandparents when the last star in the Milky Way burns out." I still have four living grandparents, but I don't think I'll be saying that any more. Even if we make it to and through the Singularity, it will be too late. One of the people I love won't be there. The universe has a surprising ability to stab you through the heart from somewhere you weren't looking. Of all the people I had to protect, I never thought that Yehuda might be one of them. Yehuda was born July 11, 1985. He was nineteen years old when he died.

  Yehuda's death is the first time I ever lost someone close enough for it to hurt. So now I've seen the face of the enemy. Now I understand, a little better, the price of half a second. I don't understand it well, because the human brain has a pattern built into it. We do not grieve forever, but move on. We mourn for a few days and then continue with our lives. Such underreaction poorly equips us to comprehend Yehuda's death. Nineteen years, 7053 days, of life and memory annihilated. A thousand years, or a million millennia, or a forever, of future life lost. The sun should have dimmed when Yehuda died, and a chill wind blown in every place that sentient beings gather, to tell us that our number was diminished by one. But the sun did not dim, because we do not live in that sensible a universe. Even if the sun did dim whenever someone died, it wouldn't be noticeable except as a continuous flickering. Soon everyone would get used to it, and they would no longer notice the flickering of the sun.

  Death is not a distant dream, not a terrible tragedy that happens to someone else like the stories you read in newspapers. One day you'll get a phone call, like I got a phone call, and the possibility that seemed distant will become reality. You will mourn, and finish mourning, and go on with your life, and then one day you'll get another phone call. That is the fate this world has in store for you, unless you make a convulsive effort to change it.

  It is so much easier to attribute death some meaning or even positive qualities. It means that we don't have to fight it or fear it, death is normal, good even and we can get back to our everyday routine. But the reality is 100% different. Death is not the mother of beauty. Death is the mother of worms, eating your rotting body. Death makes your life worth nothing. And it doesn't matter if you leave your work behind -- you won't care, because there will be no you. Just like every dying pharaoh would trade all the gold and pyramids he owns for another day of life, every lethally sick person would give everything he owns for the cure, just to live one more day, just to breathe for a bit longer.
