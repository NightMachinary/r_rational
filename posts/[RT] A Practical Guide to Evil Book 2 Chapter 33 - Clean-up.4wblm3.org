** If I'm understanding the end correctly, did Warlock just hijack a way through Arcadia to "teleport" to Marchford? Stabbing some poor fae sod along the way?

Damn man. Warlock is a badass.

Although that hesitation in answering about his son's condition makes me a tad worried...

*** That's my take on the portal too.

Yep, I wonder if his son is infected and he thinks it can be fixed.

** A shame Squire doesn't have any of that painless poison she used on the traitors left.

** So is Aprentice corrupted or not?

WHy they did not lit the ammunitions after Heiress entered the manor?

*** My guess: munitions alone wouldn't kill Heiress, and would be too open of an attack. She DOES still have the demon in the banner, after all. While killing Heiress would be good overall, I can absolutely see her releasing the demon if cornered. And open attacks would lead to reprisal from the Empress, because Heiress is nobility.
