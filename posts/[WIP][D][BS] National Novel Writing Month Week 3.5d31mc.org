This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which starts November 1st; we'll have four or five of these posts throughout the month.

- Want to check in your some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

(This thread will be pinned after a day or so.)

** As of the start of this week, I've officially crossed the 100K-mark for total words written for my current book , 'Mapmaker, Mapbreaker' (27K since Nov 1st). This makes the whole concept of finishing my book so much more believable for me, given that my current goal is 200K words pre-revisions and editing. I can actually do this. It's going to happen. I just need to stick to writing every day, keep up the consistency. But it's going to happen.

** Still going on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]]. I've finally started having my protagonist interact with more fully-realized characters, who I'm trying to stuff as much characterization and Yudkowskyian [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][advice]] as I can, though it's still too early to see the results.

I pulled my planned "[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChandlersLaw][Suddenly, Ninjas!]]" on schedule. :)

For at least some of the characters, I'm trying an old writer's cheat: drawing up a list of characters I know well from other stories, rolling some dice to pick one, filing the serial numbers off, and writing, say, "Dan Fielding from Night Court if he lived in this setting". (Not that I've used that particular fellow, yet.)

Around a week ago, I planned to take a day off writing, because of anticipated wooziness from a blood donation. I think I'm taking an unanticipated day off today, due to headache and stomach upset from watching a 3D movie. Maybe I'll try some eyes-closed typing later.

That's a bit trickier. I do have one story idea plotted out for such a format - but I just haven't actually gotten around to writing it. I'm trying to use NaNoWriMo to get back into the habit of daily writing, so that once I finish Extracts, I can keep on keeping on with more writing.

(Unfortunately, what I expect actually will happen is that yet another bout of anhedonia and depression will lead to me trailing off on that attempted habit-building in a month or three; I haven't yet found the right combination of tricks to deal with my traitorous brain chemistry, but I keep plugging away on it.)

***** Well, I do find that every time take a break I see some more interesting ideas/settings. So I don't know that you writing daily is actually better for me as a reader. Actually, if I had to guess it seems like writing every day for a few months, then taking a few months off creates the best content.

Alternatively, LSD microdosing ;p

If I could reliably accomplish the next implied step - to start writing again after the break - then that might be a tad more workable.

Given that I have a strong suspicion that the root of most of my problems is my non-24-hour sleep-wake phase disorder, and that LSD is known to disrupt sleep cycles even further, I suspect this would be somewhat counterproductive. Ahem. :)

** I'm ahead by about 5,000 words at this point, or as a percent, 60% complete.

Two days of thinking haven't really helped me decide what I want to do about my ending. It's either "heroes meet the villain, have a confrontation, get their butts kicked, and regroup for battle" or "heroes meet the villain, have a confrontation, then immediately proceed to the final battle". It's all variations on a theme, so I'm not too worried either way, but I am rapidly approaching the point where I need to make a decision.

I also have a minor problem involving travel time. It's supposed to be two full months from Marurbo to the Citadel on foot, with Leshampur being the halfway point. But I don't think this is really the place for "and the two months pass", especially not since the plan was to have a pursuit by someone who can make the trip in less than two weeks. There are three established methods of fast travel (dark magic travel through the space between realms, carried on the back of an oathkeeper, spirit-back travel) but I'm not sure which of them I want to use - they all have their established limitations and drawbacks from a narrative perspective.

From a plot/character perspective, *(spoilers if you're reading along or ever intend to read this book once it's polished)*:

- V will do as commanded; his commands are to bring H to the capital with all due haste, and to bring S to the capital with extreme prejudice (might have to retroactively reword that a bit). He cannot be convinced otherwise, since disobeying his orders would violate his oaths and lose him all his accumulated power.

- Once S has the crown, she knows that her father has died and presumes that her brother has too. That makes going to the capital dangerous, since foul play can be assumed, putting her at odds with V.

- H ... wants to make amends with S, wants to protect S, has at least some reason to suspect that the capital is not safe, beyond just the prophecy (which should worry anyone). He's also by-default at odds with V given their positions/professions.

This was /supposed/ to be the miniboss encounter, but I am not sure how precisely to set this conflict in motion for both maximal impact and best connection to the ending portion. I am specifically concerned with this because it's the least firm thing right now and needs to connect to the firm parts at the end of the story (all the stuff in the buildup to the climax, the climax itself, and the denouement, which I think are pretty solid).

I think I need to make a list of all of the neatest scenes I had in my head, then figure out the shortest path through them. Plus it has to fit this portion of the prophecy:

#+begin_quote
  /A princess with hair of flame lays beneath the throne,\\
  Vengeful spirits cloak her fragile form.\\
  Blood-soaked clothes and shattered bone,\\
  The dark wizard wrapped in brewing storm./
#+end_quote

But in keeping with what I view as good storytelling practice, this can't do overly much to drive the plot. Which, now that I think about it, probably means that I'm better off doing the "lose a conflict, retreat, win a conflict", since after "lose a conflict" we're past the point of prophecy and go into the ending with it being unknowable. In fact, I'm practically locked into that unless I want to have a black ending, which I don't think I do. Though a triumph of utilitarianism over deontology was foreshadowed ...

*** If you want a different payoff, you can go back and add antagonist's POV chapters after writing the final battle, so the audience isn't sure for whom to root in the final battle.

**** I guess the problem is that I have two protagonists, one of which is a deontologist, the other of which is a utilitarian. The primary antagonist is /also/ a utilitarian, but following one of what I see as a failure mode for utilitarian ethics, which is a bias towards self-serving behaviors and for-the-greater-good. In the last antagonist chapter he forced an innocent girl into committing suicide so that she wouldn't be a thorn in his side, since naturally having to deal with her accusations would impact his ability to do good.

Which I think probably talks me out of changing the payoff and into just having a "we can rule this kingdom together" moment prior to the finale.

***** That sounds reasonable. My problem is I tend to always have that moment, and also have difficulty thinking of a reason why they wouldn't decide in favor of actually reconciling their issues and working together. Haven't figured out how to make that moment feel suitably climactic if they do end up working together.

** And now, a whinny rant about my story:

I hate everything I've written so far. The pacing's all over the place, the plot isn't compelling, and I think my world building is generic. My characters are the only thing I /think/ is working, but even then, it's just that they're not complete shit, nothing amazing. And the dialogue. Oh god the dialogue. It's so bad that I can't bear it. I just passed 20k words and the only reason I haven't quit yet is because my self-esteem will go lower if I give up than if I shit out a bad story. Not by much though.

This has concluded my halfway point rant. I wish the best of luck to those participating and implore that none of you quit. I just hope most of you aren't as self-critical as me :)

** My novel is made of poo and everything is poo. My protagonist has lost sight of her goals due to SAD (what do you call a Mary Sue when the character apes all of the BAD parts of your life?) and the antagonist is juggling six idiot balls. There is a wise old man just waiting for protagonist if she can get her shit together to meet him, but oh ghods it's like pulling teeth!

Here endeth the midway rant. Only consolation is that I'm nearly at 26k, so not TOO far off par.

*** Protagonist has no met wise old man, and I think I'm mostly making him actually wise-ish rather than super cryptic. I need more brief arguments for an against religion in my world. Brief because no-one will want to read screeds of it, but neccesary because something which makes you literally born again should at least make you consider the idea of a god... Or at least that's what WOM is saying right now

**** If you want to complicate the discussion of religion, then one of the standard tropes in SpaceBattles is the ROB: the 'Random Omnipotent Bastard', any one of the possible hypothetical reasonably-omnipotent entities, who often have a penchant for taking modern-day humans and dropping them into fictional or fantastic settings, apparently for their own amusement. For example, if one of your characters is arguing that the evidence supports one particular religion but they don't want to admit that it also supports the ROB theory, then that could be enough conflict to keep the reader's interest for the scene.
