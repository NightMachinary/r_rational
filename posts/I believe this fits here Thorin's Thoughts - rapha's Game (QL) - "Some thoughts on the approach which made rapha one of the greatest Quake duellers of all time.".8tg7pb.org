** I'm not sure if this fits here. I listened to the whole thing despite knowing nothing about Quake because I'm weird like that. The overall message seems to be "Rapha won against more technically proficient players by planning around their strengths and how they were most likely to act." It's the sort of thing I could see a smart protagonist doing, but it's not really the theme of this sub?

I don't know, I don't feel comfortable upvoting or downvoting this.

** This would go great in one of the Friday threads!

... or the Monday thread, even.

** I gotta respect your gumption in taking a personal interest and pushing it here due to it sharing a small point of commonality. It shows character.

That said, I also don't think this is actually all that relevant to the subreddit. Since rapha is not a fictional character in a story.

** Thorin is a smart guy and a great storyteller--I enjoy his content. I don't think biographical accounts of smart things people did fits this subreddit. I'm not opposed to videos with rational messages being posted here, but there is a line between this and that.
