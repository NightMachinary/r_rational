*** In chapter 17 the matriarch notes that Zorian is hard to read covertly as he's open and that he has impressive discipline with his surface thoughts. I suspect that applies. His teacher might catch the odd surface thought but invading his innermost memories would be obvious to him and as such his teacher avoids doing that. After all his training and practice this would be even more true.

Plus he has an alien mind, being human, so his mind is hard to read.

I'd also note that he is very obviously a dangerous and deadly wizard. Aranea are likely very nervous about deliberately pissing him off.

***** If he had indeed spent weeks in constant contact with a psychic that would mean he would be likely to spill the secret but in actuality he just had daily lessons where he spent a short time with his teacher, and then collapsed later in a headache away.

At the start of chapter seventeen he notes the issue. As a mage he has had years of training to clear his mind of stray thoughts and can already do that well, but doing it for extended periods of time is tiring and leads to failure. He had short bursts with a psychic.

The alien mind issue also can't be discounted. Suppose after his defences were crushed he let out an involuntary thought "Next time in this month's loop I'll crush her back."

She isn't a human expert, she doesn't know human idioms or language that well. The idea of a time loop isn't even on her radar, unlike with the matriarch who was considering it due to the invaders. Many random emotions or thoughts aren't going to be clear enough for her to have any sort of idea of what he means. She's more likely to think "Hah, another uppity student. He won't be anywhere close to that in our next session this month. If he feels like it's getting repetitive though maybe I should call in another teacher to spice things up."

Suppose you heard someone say "This day feels like it never ends." would you think that meant they had a temporal stasis machine?

Bakora gates an ancient teleportation network ... more like an ancient network of recall anchors.

Am thinking the Bakora gates as a recall network were abandoned as inconvenient once teleportation magic became widespread. Also, thinking they are the height of recall magic and will work much better than the current recall stone he just figured out.

**** I remember that there was a small impact. She was a device to show how small changes in behavior each loop can have huge repercussions. Specifically he decided to not go the path where he met the girl in most of his repeats. Then in one of the loops he passes the bridge and there is a scene where he notices a cat sadly looking out to the river or something like that. I took it as meaning that the girl tried to get the bicycle on her own and... failed. Actually gave me an emotional twinge.

** Another fun chapter, I really like this series. Wish it updated more often, but I'll take what I'm given and be happy with it.

At this point it looks like I was wrong about the Sword Divers just being overly cautious/suspicious of Zorian, and that they're more likely just assholeish. Then again, even the IGC matriarch stated that there was no way to be completely sure of their motivations. The YCG are suspicious for their immediate denial to Zorian, but I'm wondering if they've been targeted by the invaders or Red Robe, which could be significant. Or it could be nothing.

It's amusing how easily the River Navigators accepted his offer. I wonder how many loops he'll spend in Mind Like Fire's tutelage before he decides to move on up to the Luminous Advocates for top tier training. I wonder if the story will start moving faster once he's able to read the minds of any invaders or other enemies he encounters.

Given Zorian's personality, if he makes it out of everything alive, he's going to be spending the next few years paying back people for assistance they gave him within the loop which they'll have absolutely no knowledge.

******** I don't see there being spells don't restore psychic energy, since that's still just mana. Possibly there's a spell to refresh/restore mental acuity, some magical equivalent of caffeine.

There were a few other things I was wondering though, if psychic abilities fall under the category of "unstructured magic", does this current training count as a shaping exercise? We were told that mastering shaping exercises reduced the mana cost of related magics and increased effectiveness. Given that the mental abilities are already his most cost-efficient magic, does this mean they'll get a whole lot better as his training continues? In addition, we don't really know how Zorian compares in mana capacity to the Aranea, so it's even possible that his subpar human mana capacity is actually better than an Araneas.

More to the topic at hand, after a mind shield has been defeated once, it's possible that it is no longer particular effective. Take one of those interlinked blacksmith puzzles, at first you might have trouble with it, but after you've learned the trick it's easy to deal with. Even if Zorian had used his Mind Shield spell in the training against Mind Like Fire, she might be able to get around it much faster the more he attempts it.
