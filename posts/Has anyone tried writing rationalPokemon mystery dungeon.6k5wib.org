I'm just sort of curious if anyone has tried this, or how they'd imagine it would be like. Right now as far as I know the closest any pmd fic comes to the kind of stuff we tend to prefer on this sub is Silver Resistance, and that's not really rational. I would write something myself but I tend to have trouble sticking to long adventure fics even though that's where all my inspiration tends to be for some reason.

Thoughts?


** I've mostly played Red Rescue Team and Explorers of Sky, so I can only really offer ideas on those two.

Red Rescue Team has heavy fate elements, with the protagonist being sent into the Pokemon world so that they might save the Pokemon world. The main problem, the meteor, is solved by Rayquaza blowing it up with a Hyper Beam, which ought to do next to nothing to the meteor itself beyond reducing it to a ton of smaller meteors no less deadly when summed up. The protagonist is also guided through the plot by a Gardevoir who can only appear in dreams, despite said Gardevoir having nothing at all to do with the protagonist. From the perspective of rational fiction, the overall plot's a total mess.

Explorers of Sky has a lot more character agency, comparatively. There's you, a human with pre/postcognitive powers, and Grovyle, who both head back in time from a Bad Future to try and Fix Things. There's Primal Dialga, the tyrant ruling over the Bad Future where Time itself has fallen apart, and his faithful servant Dusknoir who is sent back in time to stop you and Grovyle. Then there's Darkrai, the hidden mastermind behind not only Dialga's descent into madness but also the human, you, being separated from Grovyle, gaining amnesia, and being put in a Pokemon body from attacking you while you were time traveling. The only real beef I have with it is how Darkrai is unambiguously evil so the fundamental drive of the plot isn't as interesting as it could be.

Insofar as adapting an existing story to a rational fic, Explorers of Sky sounds like a good fit, though the many moving parts might make Red Rescue Team an easier target for its simplicity. Insofar as making an original world/plotline of the Mystery Dungeon theme for a rational fic, there's enough creative freedom in the world for a large variety of plots, but as a price you effectively have an original fiction with a Pokemon veneer.

*** Depending on the specifics of how and where it gets hyper beamed that could make a huge difference actually. lots of little meteors burn up in atmosphere, and if done from far enough away or with enough force it could spread apart the individual meteors enough to cause no long lasting harm, or if the hyper beam goes through the meteor it might throw half or more of the mass in the opposite direction.

Also, darkrai having no real motive makes it easier imho, as that means one can be assigned much easier.

*** Have you ever read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4298303/1/][Silver Ressistance?]] While it has plenty of fate I gues you could call it I'd say it's the closest thing to a rafional mystery dungeon fic out there espdcially since so far, even the most mysterious parts have been explained.

**** Seconded. I think it's the closest we have. It's also very good and very well written, though it's been ongoing (legitimately, it's not dead) for years now and it's hard to say when it'll end.

***** If you ever read his journals on DeviantArt you'll see that it's starting to vime to a close.

He has stated himself that Otto and Ray's and Princes and Lily's character development is finished.

That Scythes will be done after the next arc (Basin Canyon) and then its just Eva/Char left going into the last couple arcs.

***** It was the orignal big pokemon fic, like Origins of Species is now about 3 years ago it was the first result whenever you typed in Pokemon Fanfiction and was in the top ten results if you typed in Mystery Dungeon or Scyther.

After or before reading that I reccomend you check out his other fic Eon Fable, by god is it great, ya know if ya din't mind reading 60,000 word chapters.

****** I've read Ri2's fanfics, where the chapters of Brave New World regularly go above 100,000 words, so I think I'll be fine.

** Closest thing I can think of is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4298303/1/][Silver Resistance]], but if you're looling for an actual adaptation of the main series games I got no clue.

** I plan to write a rational mystery dungueon and i already have a lot of worldbuilding ideas and part of the first chapter ,but I just cant start writing, and I keep procastinating and leaving it for later. Its also the first thing I write so I dont think its going to be very good but anyway I think I should start writing and post it somewhere to get feedback instead of being constantly rewriting the first charter. So thanks for giving me a reason to convince myself to start writing.

Originaly it was the plot of a mystery dungueon fangame I was making and I migth still do the fangame but In going to write it as a fanfiction anyway.

I don't know how rational the story is going to be I have more or less an idea of how to make the setting make sense , (although I still havent though munch about things like politics and how the viliages are organiced,or why the main character ends up in the pokemon world), but I don't know if I will be able to write good intelligent characters.

** There is a very, very old fanfic I read... must have been about 15 years ago called: "The Type Chart". I remember thinking it was awesome, and it was kinda vaguely along these lines.

EDIT:

Holy Miltank! [[http://www.thepokemontower.com][www.thepokemontower.com]] is still up! All the fanfiction of my youthful reading! wow!

And I found it!

Fic is by Dragonfree, direct link to the text is [[http://www.thepokemontower.com/authors/dragonfree/typechart1.html]], 7 chapters long, each chapter increasing that final integer by 1.

Nostalgia time!

It's incomplete. I didn't even remember. ;-;
