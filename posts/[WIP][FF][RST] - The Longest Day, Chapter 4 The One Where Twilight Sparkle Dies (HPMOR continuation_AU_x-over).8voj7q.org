** It only took three-ish months and about five different rewrites, but Chapter 4 is finally done. Hopefully my work on Orders of Magnitude gives credibility when I say that I have the full story written out in my head, and it will be finished within the year.

Oh, by the way, spoiler alert: Twilight Sparkle dies.

Mind blown. You've taken on yourself a hard task here, but it does fit a realm where magic is so intricately knit into the world - and it also would go far toward explaining the similarities between Equestrian and Earth culture.

Well done; I'm eagerly awaiting more!

** Dumbledore felt a bit ooc in this chapter. It felt kind of forced. The limitation on the philosopher's stone felt like it was pulled out of thin air. If the philosopher's stone embodies all of transfiguration then there is no good reason for it to be limited to less than a few hundred transformations per day. It would make more sense if all transfigurations everywhere drew from the power of the stone, and whatever unused power is leftover would be from worlds with a very small or inefficient population of magic users. The available power should vary depending on how much magic is being used for transfiguration at any given time. And that should still leave a hell of a lot of power left. More than enough to grant immortality to everyone on Earth including muggles.

The explanation of "the stone is a threat to statute of secrecy" is good enough. Why not just go with that and leave out all the extra unnecessary stuff? Instead of constructing this unbelievably complicated hypothetical dystopian future in order to justify an unrealistically fair and just status quo. Also, your portraying someone like Dumbledore in this way doesn't make sense at all. It's flat out denying the cultural divide between wizards and muggles and between Harry and Dumbledore which was brought up in "Pretending to be Wise part 2". In doing so you've also eliminated at least a couple of Dumbledore's main character flaws/blind spots.

Your explanation should basically just boil down to "a muggleborn will break statute of secrecy by revealing the stone 's existence to muggles => a muggleborn will try to transfigure a bunch of subatomic particles. The end."

Combined with the existence of an afterlife in this story, the stakes are much lower than they were in the original HPMOR. it's much harder to care as much about whether Hermione is brought back to life or not because she's STILL ALIVE and has been this entire time, just transported to an an alternate plane of existence.

Sorry, but this story reads a LOT like pro-death apologism and social modesty trying to masquerade as transhumanism and rationality.

Your writing is good quality, but I think you might be trying to appeal to the wrong audience.

*** It's a fair point about Dumbledore's characterization. I felt like the HPMOR-version of Dumbledore was played a bit too clueless for my liking, so in this universe, he's more savvy than Harry initially gives him credit for.

Also a fair criticism re: the lower stakes. Part of that was by necessity: there was suspense in the original HPMOR because you weren't actually sure if Harry would be able to bring back Hermione. But the canon ending explicitly introduces an afterlife into the universe. So any continuation/AU-fic either has to do some pretty serious ret-conning, or has to work within those limitations.

From a literary perspective, I'm hoping to build suspense via HOW Hermione gets resurrected, rather than WHETHER she gets resurrected. Whether I'll succeed at that, well, that's up to you as the reader.

That said, I did want to address two minor points directly:

1. The limitation of the Stone was taken directly from the ending of HPMOR.
2. If you do happen to stick around and read the work in its entirety, hopefully it will convince you that it is quite decidedly NOT pro-death.

**** Okay so maybe I'm just getting a bit confused about the math involved here. I thought the limitation in canon HPMOR was higher because Harry explicitly states that it could be used for all muggles too as well as all sentient magical creatures. The canon reason he doesn't do this is not because the stone isn't capable of it, it's because it would require breaking the statute of secrecy, and then some muggleborn tries to transfigure subatomic particles and destroys the universe.

Also, Dumbledore wasn't unrealistically clueless, he had very particular realistic blindspots due to his upbringing. There are many MANY instances in real life of geniuses as brilliant as Dumbledore making exactly that kind of moronic mistake in reasoning, especially outside their area of expertise.

Canon HPMOR DID NOT have an afterlife. What are you talking about?

***** Double checking the math real quick... In Ch 119 it says, "/Experiment had showed that the Stone made one Transfiguration permanent every three minutes and fifty-four seconds/". 3 minutes, 54 seconds = One use of the stone per 234 seconds. One day = 86,400 seconds. 86,000 / 234 ~= 367 uses of the stone per day.

****** Gotcha. I see where the confusion is. Most wizards are not on the verge of dying. The stone would be used primarily for patients in the verge of death. That lowers the number of patients needing the stone treatment a lot.

******* Interestingly, I actually wound up editing out a rather sizable chunk of dialog where Harry explicitly works through the math and Dumbledore (fairly ruthlessly) shoots him down. The gist of it was that the rate at which Muggles die every year is roughly 50,000 times higher than the Stone's capacity.

Incidentally, this is a passage from the most recent chapter that ended up on the cutting room floor during the editing process.

/It all came back to these Elements, whatever they may have been, and the two battling figures who now took the form of two wolves, one black, and one white./

/The black one spoke, wistfully. 'It's almost poetic. One hundred billion lives lost, one hundred billion stars."/

/The white wolf tore at the black, to no avail. "The rules, damnit. Remember the rules! Rule 34: There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do not breach!"/

/The black wolf deflected the blow. "You should know me better than that. Since when have I ever truly followed the rules? This is simply..."/

/The black wolf snapped its jaws shut, and the neverending chorus of a multitude of stars going nova at once rang across the blackness./

/"Technique," it finished./

/The Professor broke eye contact with her, and was breathing faster now. "Are the elements absolutely necessary? Do I need them to stop this darkness?"/

To paraphrase from another comment reply (Reddit isn't great about grouping threads together): Maybe "afterlife" is not the best word for it. But Hermione died, then she came back to life. Part of what I'm aiming to do with this story is provide a concrete mechanism for that resurrection.

***** I agree that Dumbledore wasn't /unrealistically/ clueless. The cluelessness perfectly fit his characterization in HPMOR. With this story, I'm trying to explore a much darker side of Dumbledore, the side of Dumbledore who almost took over the world with Grindelwald for the "greater good", which has necessitated reframing some of Dumbledore's flaws from the original canon. Rather than being blissfully ignorant, he's painfully aware but chooses to act otherwise.

As for an afterlife in the original canon, maybe that's not the best word for it. But Hermione died, then she came back to life. Part of what I'm aiming to do with this story is provide a concrete mechanism for that resurrection.

Hopefully I'll achieve those aims, but I'll let you be the judge of that!

****** There already WAS a concrete mechanism for it. Hermione's brain was preserved by the cooling charm, and the human mind/soul is one of the main functions of the human brain. It just needed to be defrosted and given life energy from Harry's patronus charm.

When Harry says he doesn't believe in souls, what that basically amounts to is that he doesn't believe in an afterlife or in peope being just some supernatural "essence" or "spark". But let's not forget that what laypeople know as the heart/soul and the mind, neuroscience just refers to as system 1 (automatic system) and system 2 (intentional system). They use the word mind to describe the whole thing, and that is very misleading to a layperson.

In retrospect though, a better way to phrase it instead of "provide a concrete mechanism", would be, "to explore that mechanism". Ultimately (SPOILER ALERT but not really), he revives Hermione the same way that he does in Canon!HPMOR.

****** I actually like this Dumbledore a lot more than the Dumbledore presented in HPMOR canon. However, as [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]] says, HPMOR sufficiently explains Hermione's resurrection without requiring a soul. It's consistent with a soul existing, but you don't need that assumption.

Now, it seems to me that MLP canon (e.g. dreamwalking, the Realm of Ascension) points much more toward ponies having souls, so you probably made the best choice for this crossover. Still, this'll be a huge shock to Harry when he finds out!

Agreed. I mentioned this in a reply to [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]] but a better way to say what I'm trying to do is /exploring/ the mechanism of revival, moreso that /creating a new one/.

As for the question of "souls", I don't want to spoil things, but I'll say this: Hermione's memory isn't /perfect/, and Godel Escher Bach is a reaaaaaaly long book.
