Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I was starting to plan out a (more) rational /Timeless/ fanfic, but kept getting hung up on how to model their version of time travel. So I went searching and found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f21i6/bst_ripple_effect_time_travel/?ref=search_posts][this post]] which sounded almost exactly like what I was thinking of ... only to realize that I was the one who had written it, and was asking for help with the same thing I'm struggling with now. :(

*** I only watched the pilot for Timeless and found it just okay. The underwhelming tv show I want to see rational fic for is The Librarians.

**** I want to write a Timeless fanfic mostly because there's a lot of potential for existential dread, values dissonance, etc. You start with "the past is a foreign country" and then move toward "the present is a foreign country". I'm still figuring out what the punchlines would be though, and I would rather have a time travel model that makes /rational/ sense rather than just /intuitive/ sense.

I agree that the show is mostly just okay, but I think that the supposed core mission of "preserve America" is a wonderful setup for a story that's about what America /is./ If the show grew some balls that might be what they would do, but I doubt that network television is the place for anything more than a whitewashing of history.

***** That sounds like it could make for a very interesting story and philosophical conversations, particularly the question of self righteous altering of history. I think the way you could rationalize the time machines is by changing the relationship between the two machines so that they both leave and arrive at the some moment, and give the machines a 24 hour priming for launch that the heroes can detect. You'd have to rework the pilot to explain how the villains got the machine, but I think it'd work.

**** It'll be coming back after National Novel Writing Month is done. I just sort of got off rhythm, which makes it hard to get back on rhythm. I've never done gymnastics, but when they're doing their routine and screw up once, then they screw up again, and the mistakes keep piling up because they're a bit rattled, so then they have to stop and center themselves before starting up again. That's sort of what I'm trying to do here, because I got off my rhythm, which leads to words coming out slowly, frustration with the words coming out slowly, second-guessing what I've written because clearly if the words came out slowly the viscosity of the words is wrong, wanting to write other words about different things, etc.

So I have the vast majority of the next chapter written, but it's going to be a while until I know that I can move forward at a decent clip, and will definitely be after /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ is done.

** Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=drive_web][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

So I missed last week, as my phone committed hara-kiri and I'm still waiting for the replacement to head in. [[/u/InfernoVulpix]] covered the update at least.

This week involved a lot of research into voxel systems and brushing up on my hex grid library of choice, which recently went through a major version change. The unity project for the hex map prototype technically exists, but there's nothing to show besides an empty scene. Reading up on how to create a voxel system based on hexes rather than cubes has taken more time than I anticipated; the ‘tons of literature' that I was lead to believe existed on the internet is more concerned with whitepaper algorithms and/or code dumps, where what I need is more a bird's eye overview. So oh well, guess it's down to reading code to learn again.

I've actually also spent some time tinkering with a command-line prototype of the NPC conversation/opinion/notoriety system, which hasn't borne a whole lot of fruit yet but lets you define cities of variable numbers of people with randomized names and connections. We'll see how far this can get in isolation from any other systems.

The majority of the /visible/ work I've done this week is on the feature roadmap. It was quite a mess previously, with sections but no real organization. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e4bMBgsvshUBFShes2bG3RGXIzVYh16EPboqDTdpfA/edit?usp=drive_weband][It now has a bit more order to it]] has been fleshed out significantly more. Everything down to section 15 is effectively complete, with the rest still pending. Once the rest has been finished getting cleaned up, I'll have a better foundation to build the Software Requirements document on, as well as the Design Document 2.0.

Some of the discussion highlights from [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BBPJoGaMDwAsxP9lYNLyARKCGI9pZGLXf2x-IgWbfs/edit?usp=drive_web#heading=h.swbifc8jeyfw][this past week's Discord discussion]]:

- We decided that vision will be handled in two parts: Perception will be a stat for all units that defines a small circle around the unit, maybe ~5 hexes or so on average. This will abstract out hearing, smell, and situational awareness, etc. A second Sight stat will determine how far the unit sees in front of it, with a cone extending in the direction the unit is facing. This naturally requires that we track which direction units are facing, which may or may not be an issue, especially with multiple heads. But it seems like a good starting point.

- We put together the bare-bones design for a move association system, whereby an attack can be associated as a response to a particular incoming attack. This may or may not turn out to be too complicated.

- We decided that trains probably aren't a thing if businesses built around teleportation of goods ever gained traction.

- We divided TMs into TMs and HMs: TMs will now be strictly the pokedex simulation “training video” that teaches how to use an unknown move, while HMs are actual vials or syringes that contain the ability to add organs that the pokemon does not have by default. HMs will not be content gates, and while you would have a Flamethrower TM, it won't do you any good if you don't also have the Oil Gland HM.

*** Here are the latest odds from the bookmakers:

*Clinton is the next president: 3/10 (short) odds, or ≤77% chance of Clinton being the next president.*

*Trump is the next president: 5/2 (long) odds, or ≤28% chance of Trump being the next president*

So, it's generally expected that Clinton is the next president, but it's totally plausible that Trump wins. Since this adds up to 105%+, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time, etc. The bookies also give Sanders ≤2%, Biden ≤1%. I'll be interested to see how things turn out.

I hope that Trump does not win, because I think he will likely not be a good president for a variety of reasons. In retrospect, I was too hard on Bush, McCain, and Romney. Although I disagreed with their policies, I never doubted they wanted to do the right thing and help America. They weren't the enemy, just the opposition. Trump, though... sheesh, man. You know, I don't think he'll as bad as people say on some things (like I don't think he'll actually use nukes) but I think it will still be a bad presidency. A lot of the president's job is like super boring shit like appointing people to run various government agencies and making sure the right hand knows what the left hand is doing and attending complicated annoying staff meetings all the time. I can't imagine Trump will have the patience to deal with this effectively, or the humility to appoint and listen to smart secretaries and staffers. If he wins, though, I hope he proves me wrong.

I do notice that there is a strong sentiment on some parts of the internet against Hillary Clinton because she is a very Washington-insider, business-as-usual candidate. "Too moderate," complain the Democrats. "Too corrupt," complain the centrists. "Literally the Devil," complain the Republicans. They're not wrong. Well, she's not literally the Devil but this isn't the actual complaint the Republicans have. And I do see why some people complain about her. Nonetheless, I voted for her in the primary over Bernie Sanders, because I didn't like Sanders' policies and I don't think he'd do nearly as good a job. I also voted for her in the primaries in 2008. As far as I can tell, Clinton will be a fine president if she wins. She's smart, tenacious, wonkish, centrist, and ambitious. I'll be voting for her on Tuesday.

Make sure to turn out and vote, everyone! If you are an American, it is your civic duty. As a citizen, you are entrusted with the power to cast a vote, and you have an obligation to exercise it.

Did we live through the same Bush administration? I can believe that he believed in what he did. That doesn't really change the fact that what he did was /atrocious/.

I mean, he basically started out in office by passing a bunch of tax cuts I don't like, /scuttling the Kyoto Treaty after we'd already signed it/, encouraging consumerism as a response to the dot-com bubble collapse, and then /starting a bunch of aggressive wars and encouraging consumerism as a contribution to the war-effort while cutting more taxes during wartime/. While also doing a bunch of other stuff I don't like personally and passing /massive/ restrictions on civil liberties, including consolidating all internal security agencies (ie: what other countries rightly regard deeply corrupt agencies with totalitarian tendencies) into one big department (ie: one /big/ deeply corrupt agency with totalitarian tendencies /and no civil-liberties laws to stop them/).

Like, Bush was the guy who told the librarians to start handing over people's /public-library borrowing records/ so his government could check for /terrorists/, by which he meant leftists.

Bush was objectively really fucking bad. It was under Bush that I had to hold my breath so a random guy in a mosque in my area wouldn't be convicted in a weapons trafficking "sting" that was /clearly/ entrapment. Luckily, the local Civil Liberties Union actually had our acts together, and so the case /was/ eventually thrown out as entrapment. By which I mean, under Bush, the FBI entrapped rando Muslims into weapons trafficking so it would have "terrorists" to hunt.

And as far as anyone knows, none of this shit was ever rolled back under Obama. Mind, I thought Romney was pretty damned evil, but just, you know, /bourgeois/ evil, without as much of the god-bothering imperialist mayhem that made the Bush years so /exciting/.

If the only reason you would want to vote is uh, controlling bits of entropy (do you mean having an affect on election outcomes? I didn't understand this, but assume that's what you mean) then yeah, voting isn't a good idea. If you like fulfilling civic duty and feel good about that, and also believe that casting an informed vote is your civic duty, then voting is a great idea. This is how I feel, and why I vote, and I'd like to think that it's on the backs of people like me that our democratic system rests, which makes me feel even better about voting!

This is now the 4th Presidential election I have paid close attention to. This is said every time, about every Republican candidate, to the point where it is now a cliche. It's possible you're an introspective unicorn (much more likely than average, given what I've seen of you, base modifier for membership in this community, etc). But there's something eyeroll worthy about watching people (who cried "Bushitler!", who declared the selection of Palin as VP the functional equivalent of /treason/, and who savaged Romney as a poor-murdering plutocrat extremist) suddenly realize that they have no room left to escalate their rhetoric against Trump.

Disclosure: I am voting Johnson, but I think Trump's [evil * ability to enact evil] <<< Hillary's [evil * ability to enact evil].

Counterpoint to your final note: In all but the smallest, most local elections, any individual vote is staggeringly unlikely to matter. I believe that the best justification for spending the time to do so is to enable the right to complain afterwards. If this is not an important factor to you personally, then remember to vote IFF there is nothing you could be doing with your time that would be more useful to anyone.

***** Yeah, one of the things that make politics so hard is that everyone wants to be superlative at all time. The opposition candidate is never "not that bad, but clearly worse than my favorite candidate", they're THE WORST CANDIDATE EVER AND THE MOST CORRUPT AND THE MOST EVIL.

When Trumps says something about vets who commit suicide because they think they're tough but they can't take it, it's not "a clumsy statement from a good sentiment", it's Trump being the worst person ever. When Hillary says she might impose a no-flight zone over Syria, OH NO SHE WILL SHOOT DOWN RUSSIAN PLANES AND START WORLD WAR III.

This sucks because it creates an enormous amount of noise that make it really, really hard to find actual signals, and in particular it makes it way harder to spot /actual/ superlatively bad statements, like Trump saying he might shoot down Iraqi boats for taunting American warships (which sounds even worse in context).

***** I was definitely a big anti-fan of Bush, but I was a young man at the time. I liked McCain much better than Bush but didn't like his pick of VP and figured he was old enough it might matter. I actually liked Romney quite a bit, though I still gave him no small amount of shit for turning around on Obamacare's concepts. I thought he was better than McCain or Bush, since he was far more centrist, and certainly he was the smartest of the three. The reason I gave for voting for Obama in 2012 was twofold; one, Romney, although a reasonable guy, would still be beholden to the Republican party with which I disagree on many issues. The other reason is outlined [[http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/2012/11/02/four-more-years-with-head-held-high/][here]].

So in my view I guess each new Republican nominee was better than the last, until Trump came along. I don't feel like I've been gradually saying each Republican is worst than the last, since it seems like the opposite is the case. I know there are whiners who always say "this is the worst Republican ever" but they're just not correct (except this time).

Personally I think anyone who is truly undecided should just stay home rather than cast a vote without being fully committed to the decision.

I'm not saying a person has to perfectly sure that they're making the right choice in a candidate (or on any other issue). But I don't think we should pressure people into voting if they don't have an understanding of the issues, or if they don't really have much preference even after understanding the issues.

******* Thank you! Everyone talks about this civic duty as if it's an inherent truth of democracy that everyone must vote. I think the system would probably run a lot smoother if there were some sort of lottery that chose a small portion of people, and then those people would do all of the research and look carefully and then vote, and everyone else stayed out of it. If you get chosen 1/100 of the time, but your vote carries 100 times as much weight (because only 1/100 of other people are voting) then on average you have the exact same amount of influence you do in the current system. We could do this for any fraction, so long as the number of voters is sufficiently large to avoid significant statistical noise.

This wouldn't actually work, but the reason isn't because it's a bad system, but because people would refuse to accept it. Most people don't understand expected values and the idea of having a nonzero amount of actual value keeps people pacified even when things they don't like happen. The percentage system doesn't "feel" good or fair to the people who go their whole lives without being selected, even though in the current system your vote won't swing the election anyway.

***** Assuming nothing too "out there" happens, I imagine Trump would be much less involved in our commitments and responsibilities overseas than Clinton would be, except for when he absolutely (rare, but it could happen) flips the heck out. If we leave aside his comments about surprise bombing civilian areas where we think ISIS leaders are (I don't think he'd actually do this) without letting people evacuate first, we can expect a significant drawdown in direct casualties from US shots fired overseas. So, leaving out the possible but unlikely "way worse than any possible policy" thing that Trump might do, I see how this could be less violent. And if that's all you measure, then this will be a great thing. I see why people might like this, and I respect that opinion.

I'm an American exceptionalist and a believer in American hegemony. I think that international geopolitical stability, and the promotion of democratic interests and the possibility for liberal democracies everywhere, relies on the United States of America. We're the best democratic republic, and the biggest, and the richest, and so many other things. This is why I donate to the ACLU, rather than just say MIRI. The dangerous future of AI isn't just an unfriendly or poorly thought out AI running wild, it's an AI that does exactly what we want it to, and us wanting the wrong things. We are the bastion of stability and democracy in the world. My boy Barack Obama agrees:

#+begin_quote
  But the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought stability to a post-World War II world. Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans.
#+end_quote

Yes, we kill people, both enemies and civilians, overseas. Yes, we have a huge, expensive military designed for interventions anywhere in the world--and we use it. A lot. We patrol the trade routes of our world's oceans, we back people on one side or another of various civil conflicts, and we invade countries, sometimes for the right reasons and with good outcomes, and sometimes with less good reasons and bad outcomes. We are a world power. In some ways, we are /the/ world power. Blood will be shed for us to enforce justice in the world, and to bring order to chaos.

Jefferson once said, "What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it's natural manure." At the time, he was dismissing concerns about a rebellion that happened in the US, saying that we shouldn't worry if this happens from time to time. Though it is oft misused, the quotation itself isn't completely wrong in other contexts. I support military interventions and the US Navy patrolling the sealanes and promoting our interests around the world. I think, given what's happening in Europe and how tenuous republican democracy is in other places, we have an obligation to make sure the torch of democratic civilization keeps burning somewhere in the world.

My full thoughts on this are a lot longer and more involved. So I guess I'm an American exceptionalist and an interventionist. But I do see why people think differently; most of my liberal friends disagree with me stridently on both these issues, and I don't think they're entirely wrong to do so. I think it's easy for people, especially young people, to discount just how valuable it is that our armed forces do what they do.

I guess, if someone thinks for some reason that Trump and Clinton are comparable in any way, they wouldn't be swayed by me telling them that Trump actually has a chance to do these things. If someone thinks Trump is the more peaceful candidate, the only real way to approach them, assuming they're reasonably informed, is to point out that Trump has a long tail on foreign policy outcomes, and point out his other failings. I don't think it's really possible to change people's minds a lot in politics outside of unusual circumstances.

I don't donate to the ACLU /in order/ to support the American military. Sorry if I came off that way; that must be a miscommunication on my part. Let me rephrase: I support the ACLU. Also, /separately/ from my ACLU donations, I believe that American military influence and interventions in the world should be active and has a good place in policy. The ACLU enforces my values and vision for the world domestically, and the military enforces my vision for the world abroad and in international waters. The ACLU is not actually an anti-military organization. They are against the militarization of police and surveillance of American citizens, and want better rights of free expression for soldiers, as well as good access for journalists to US warzones, but these are all different than actually being anti-war.

The ACLU is not against the US underwriting global security, patrolling our sealanes, or bringing justice to foreign countries. They care a LOT about /how/ we do it, of course, but they're not against it. This is actually really good and I like this.

*** I feel like spamming EY's "Stop Voting for Nincompoops" everywhere. I voted early for the Green Party in a safe state. I kinda want the neo-Nazi killed or jailed, because that's what you do when you /actually seriously believe/ a major-party Presidential candidate is an actual Nazi. This actually gives me empathy for his supporters, who sound crazy but also seem to be the only ones /taking seriously/ the immense amount of evidence that their opponent is an influence-peddling criminal, that she conspired with the press corps to manipulate the primaries, and that the press has /volunteered themselves/ to act as her propaganda ministry in the generals.

I hate white supremacy as much as any good leftist, but the way the Dems are speaking "against" it only reinforces the framing of white Americans as an ethnonationality whose material interests conflict with those of other ethnic groups in this country. So I can't speak the language of the mainstream and have to sound like a crazy commie in a park with a cardboard sign because I don't want to incite race war or feed fascism.

The most popular Presidential candidate in the whole contest, my candidate - whose policy proposals are objectively moderate, tried-and-tested stuff meant to improve people's lives without risking radical change and whom people actually liked, trusted, and respected - was laughed out of the race five months ago as an unserious loon.

In all seriousness, I feel like these are the situations that really do call for revolution. "The system" has now proven that it laughs in the face of the common citizen's needs, treats the interests and rituals of a narrow elite as moral gospel, and has no sanitary cordon against lunatic nincompoops. I actually wish it was just me being a crazy leftist at this point.

I voted in the Presidential primaries and in the state and local primaries, for candidates who /won't/ bring about Fully Automated Luxury Communism or make everyone Sapient Pony Happy, but who /would/ and hopefully /can/ incrementally improve people's lives in ways the people understand, can cope with, and actively want for themselves. I've canvassed and phone-banked for the campaign I supported, and I'm doing more canvassing against a ballot measure I want defeated. My efforts were crushed by opponents who now want me in line behind them, except maybe on the ballot measures. The party who represent my beliefs about policy most closely are represented by batshit insane hippies.

And the whole country or world could go down in flames because a narcissist realized he could appeal to identitarian fascist sentiments to catapult himself to the world's most influential single office. He has sowed utter discord and crashed through the institutional rot of this society and he still manages to be worse than the toxic fungus he's against. A perfect Ork Warboss.

This election drives me to tears. I'm scared, I'm tired, and most of all, I'm scared and tired of feeling like the crazy person in the room because I point out how crazy it all is.

Oh, I agree. Stein is nuts. I don't like her. I especially don't like Baraka: he's an Assad apologist.

I voted for them mainly because, if a third-party gets over 5% on a Presidential ballot, they can run candidates for dog-catcher or State Assembly without going through a complicated bureaucratic maze -- they're just /on the ballot/ by declaring a candidate by a deadline. I deliberately wasted my Presidential vote in order to potentially buy opportunities to vote for better candidates down-ballot in future races, which we especially need in my state because we're the worst in the country for having contested (more than one candidate) state and local elections.

And actually, since Johnson's higher in the polls than Stein, I perhaps should have voted for him. It depends how much I care about getting a third-party their dog-catcher candidacies /in principle/ and how much I care about doing so for a /left-wing/ party in specific.

So I hope that if Donald Trump teaches the establishment one fucking thing, it is this: policies matter, outcomes matter, and the value of a procedure is just the information it integrates as input and the expected utility it generates as output.

Because HE LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISING MASS DEPORTATIONS. Not closed borders as a component of a sane, humane immigration policy, MASS DEPORTATIONS. And he comes as a culmination of a DECADES-LONG TREND in which his party have come to consider themselves the ONLY LEGITIMATE GOVERNING PARTY, and as he continued his campaign he asked WHY WE CAN'T JUST NUKE PEOPLE, and in the closing days of his campaign he has promised to ELIMINATE CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH OF ALL KINDS.

I'd call that a good test of whether you have a decently democratic system with a reasonably wide variety of candidates or parties. Unfortunately, [[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/02/for-many-voters-its-not-which-presidential-candidate-theyre-for-but-which-theyre-against/][right now it's not actually true.]] Most voters right now are holding their noses.

The test would apply more easily in the primaries, where we have a wider variety of candidates, but even there, it didn't /really/ happen. Most voters in the primaries were consciously and openly voting for a compromise between desired policies and ability to succeed in the "general" (ie: runoff) election.

Now, I personally /disagree/ with my "side's" voters' estimation of who was a more viable candidate in the general election (ie: two-candidate runoff). Your test definitely applies within the primaries to the weighted mix of beliefs that mattered in the primaries.

Which brings up that my objection to this electoral process is systemic: despite the fact that only the primaries were even a compromised version of a real election (by the test of whether your standard applies), only 9% of Americans actually supported the primary winners. So the "popular mandate" of our two "general election" (again: runoff) candidates is about 4.5% each. /That was how this all happened/: first you get 4.5% of the population to support you, and then you get 51% to hold their nose because you're better than that other jerk.

Yes! Of course! That's /why/ it's important to run on more than personality. Every candidate is going to have smears thrown at them and dirt dug-up on them, and that's why they /need/ to be able to point to a clear policy platform (or party manifesto, as other countries would call it), a strong back-bench within their party infrastructure, and hopefully a popular movement behind them.

The first and third items are things that Clinton doesn't seem to /want/, and the second is something she can't seem to /achieve/ (the Democratic Party has suffered a collapse of its state-and-local back-bench since about 2006). For all that she portrays herself as an expert political insider, /she actually stands a significant chance of losing to motherfucking Donald Trump/. For all that she portrayed herself in the primaries as better able to build a party, she's /been/ doing that for all these years, and her party's back-bench of lower-level office-holders has /collapsed/.

Maybe she and they can fix that this Tuesday and take a Senate majority and a larger House minority. Maybe they'll be stuck with the Presidency against an adversarial Congress. Or maybe they'll lose everything.

****** I didn't realize that that's enough time for a third of the population to replace itself. But still, the key question to ask is still whether more lives will be saved if you rebel compared to not rebelling. When answering that question it could be important to take other things into account like, "could this impede other efforts to save lives that very smart people are already undertaking," or "are there any other ways besides rebelling that could save more lives". Yes those last few decades before we get GAI still matter, but I would say there's a significantly higher probability that outright rebelling against a much bigger, stronger enemy like the /US government/ is only going to get a lot more people pointlessly killed compared to other methods of trying to save lives.

Furthermore, even if you were to somehow miraculously succeed, a huge sudden shock to society like that could be very risky and have unforeseen repercussions and make things a lot less predictable for a lot of people. Yes, the US government for the most part doesn't seem to care very much about most of its citizens. But we could have far worse governments than that. I'm not sure how long it would take to build a better government in the unlikely event that you do succeed, but I would expect it to take a few decades rather than a few years, simply because just putting new people in power historically hasn't magically made things better. Even if smart, competent, and well-intentioned people could theoretically be put into power, the chances of that happening seem very slim.

I suspect that if there was someone sufficiently competent at politics and with enough money and who was intelligent enough, they /might/ be able to get some of the most problematic parts of the US government replaced, or give them incentive to act more in the interest of the citizens, so that the world is less likely to get destroyed by crazy/irresponsible/ evil people in the US government (I.e. Trump) and so that more net lives are saved. Or maybe they could just entirely reform the government outright without rebelling. I don't know what is possible because I'm just a layperson with no legal or political expertise.

Ultimately, the sort of endeavor you propose is not only extremely risky in terms of human lives compared to alternatives, but to make such an endeavor less risky would probably require years of study in the fields of law and political science, and military training too. Any less than that i expect would have a higher probability of failing and causing more net lives to be lost.

But maybe I'm missing something here. Maybe if I consider your belief that rebelling will save more net lives than not rebelling for five minutes I will realize that you're right? But I have no idea where to begin to steelman your position that rebelling will save more net lives than not rebelling, because I lack the expertise. How would the world look different if rebelling was more likely to save more net lives compared to not rebelling? I don't know. Maybe there's some reason that rebelling would be a more feasible way to save a positive number of net lives than I expect? Ultimately, thinking about it for five minutes is a start, but it's not enough. Sometimes you actually need to have more knowledge.

Show me the evidence that more net lives are likely to be saved if you do this than if you don't do this. And please don't use any more ad hominem arguments. I don't like it when people die any more than you do.

This situation is upsetting to me too, but I'm not upset in the moment because there's no point in getting upset about it. When I said "I understand that you're upset about this" it was in the sense of being viscerally upset in the moment. And I'm not viscerally upset about this in the moment because getting myself worked up about it won't accomplish anything. I've gotten rather numb to politics at this point and I'm focusing my emotional energy on things that I am more likely to be able to do something about. If I thought too much about politics I would just get really angry and upset. So I've just been choosing not to think too much about politics in order to avoid getting that angry and upset because it's not productive. I'm still angry and upset in the general sense, I'm just choosing not to let myself feel it right now because it would interfere with my other goals to get that upset about this.

Why is a complicated answer, which [[https://www.amazon.com/World-Very-Small-Place-Africa/dp/0765624842][this book]] will help you to understand. In brief, foreign aid is necessary because western enterprise has created economies of dependencies in the third world, so aid efforts are sabotaged and ignored in order to preserve revenue streams.

And you conveniently skipped over the part where if you fail to overthrow the US government they just go right back to killing gratuitously abroad, only this time you'll have even more people dead in total because there would be people who died domestically too.

Also, since the NSA can spy on you to find out any plans you try to share with people electronically, you likely can only communicate such plans to people in person. Even if there were some way to completely protect yourself from the NSA's spying, it would probably cost a lot of money, and purchases made with credit/debit cards are probably tracked by the government too. And I'm pretty sure cash withdrawals can also be tracked since banks also use electronic record keeping these days. And if you make a pure cash withdrawal large enough to buy state of the art equipment for avoiding cyber tracking by the government, I'm pretty sure that will make them suspicious of you. Good luck trying to grow your rebellion faster than it can be found and shut down when it only spreads by word of mouth, while the government has instant communication on /their side/ and you /don't/.

Furthermore, what if the US govt decides to blame your rebellion on a foreign gov't rather than on domestic rebels? Could it be another Iraq?

Or maybe someone in China or Russia or someone else that doesn't like the US decides to aid your rebellion, and some kind of twisted entanglement of alliances causes another country to aid the US gov't against the rebellion, and suddenly you have WWIII on your hands!

Do you have any idea what might happen? Are you actually thinking about the probabilities of negative externalities and taking them into account, or are you just declaring that because the US government is causing more harm than good, that therefore it is /deontologically/ a good idea to overthrow them, regardless of the what the actual consequences are? There is such a thing as the cure being worse than the disease, you know.

Don't forget that whatever you decide to do should be trying to maximize the number of lives saved. Do you need me to explain basic decision theory to you? Here's an example: if you're faced with a choice between act A (1% chance of saving 99 lives) and act not-A (99% chance of saving 70 lives) over a population of 100 lives, then you're more likely to save the most lives if you choose not-A.

That is to say, even if the number of lives that could be saved by rebelling is theoretically higher then not rebelling; if the probability of that many of them being saved is sufficiently low for rebelling compared to not rebelling, then in practice it would be better to pick not rebelling, because then you are on average saving more lives.

It still seems most likely to me that more people could be expected to die if you rebel than if you don't rebel. And you still have yet to show me any evidence to contradict this.

Something else to keep in mind, is that the US probably has a lot of treaties that will be null and void if the US government no longer exists. So if you want to avoid dragging foreign powers into your mess, you will need to reform the US government without literally overthrowing it. If you take a boat and replace one part of that boat every year, eventually all the parts will be replaced, but it will still be known by the same name and will still be considered the same boat. And since the US government is unlikely to decide to reform itself, you will need to get people elected/appointed into positions of power who will be more sympathetic, or who might have something to gain for themselves from the reforms you want to implement. A sympathetic politician or group of sympathetic politicians could pretend to agree with current policies until they have amassed enough political power to unexpectedly legislate a bunch of reforms. Or maybe some sympathetic business people will be able to buy out a group of politicians and have them pass those reforms even if they wouldn't want to otherwise. And if there are literally no sufficiently skilled politicians or sufficiently wealthy business people who are sympathetic to your cause, have at least someone with diplomatic skills negotiate with them until they are.

Don't break the law or kill people unless it's actually necessary to save more lives. If there's a relatively non-violent alternative to open armed rebellion which is more likely to succeed than open armed rebellion, it's better to go for that alternative instead.

That being said, I've got no political or business expertise, so take my words with a grain of salt. Still, this seems to be the most obvious strategy for reforming the US government, which I thought of in about five minutes once I actually applied myself to the problem, which it only occurred to me to do after finding out that Trump got elected. :/

If I can think of it, someone else who does have the expertise to carry it out definitely can. However, that might just be my total lack of expertise talking, and maybe there's some reason that such a plan is entirely unfeasible. But if that's the case they might even think of something better.

I find it hard to believe that if you put a bunch of creative, politically-savvy people in a room together to work on this problem, that armed rebellion would be the only viable solution that they generate.

And if it gets to the point where armed rebellion is the only option left, then we are all probably doomed in any case.

So in Presidential election years (years evenly divisible by 4), Americans cast their vote for President, the Representative for their district, and between zero and one Senators depending on how the terms line up (I don't believe any states have synchronized Senate terms). Generally, however, only a few of the Congress seats are actually competitive in a given year.

If I had to guess, Republicans are trying to make the best of a situation where Hillary gets elected by refusing to allow her to enact any of her agenda, thereby protecting themselves from primary challengers (members of the same party competing to be the party nominee for the seat) who might otherwise challenge their commitment to conservative principles, and don't expect to get punished for their obstructionism the next time the general election comes up because, as I mentioned, so few seats are actually competitive.

Several of the blue dogs (conservative Democrats) were ousted in general elections, and many moderate Republicans were ousted in primary elections, and replaced with radical Tea Party Republicans.

Many canny and capable moderate Republicans held on to their seats, by swinging just far enough to the right to undercut their Tea Party challengers, then coming back to the center for the general election enough to beat the moderate Democrat who runs against them (but not so much as to piss off their base). This is /not easy/. It also really constrains their ability to act like normal people while in office.

Take, for example, my boy McCain. McCain /hates/ Trump. He really truly loathes Trump. And for good reason! McCain is a sane person and a career politician and has every reason to hate Trump. Trump also personally insulted McCain for being a PoW... etc etc. Well, in any case, you may remember that McCain endorsed Trump. Seems strange, right? McCain really does hate that guy! So why did he do it? He did this because he was facing a primary challenge from a populist rightist who was a total nutjob. After winning the primary, he waited for an opportune time to unendorse Trump. He has since went back to the middle and now has to win the general election. He probably will.

In any case, not saying we shouldn't blame Republicans for intransigence if they actually follow through with it, but bear in mind that they all are trying to get re-elected, and not all of them have the political skills and war chest of McCain.

They say that evidence found in a previously unrelated case may be relevant, and they need to investigate further to determine whether anything has changed or not.

Clinton naturally considers this a disgraceful attempt by the FBI to influence the election, and maintains that there is nothing to find. Those opposed to Clinton (disclaimer: including myself) point to the still ongoing, daily leaks of emails between her highest staff which, arguably, indicate her participation in outright bribery, on top of additional national security concerns. Clinton counters that these leaks are from a cyberattack orchestrated by Russian hackers, not to be trusted, and claims that Russia is /also/ disgracefully attempting to influence the election.

Trump, meanwhile, is continuing his ongoing vendetta against his own foot. Candid audio was released in which he advocated that when you're rich, you can get away with sexual assault (Money line: "You can grab them by the pussy!"), which he dismisses as "locker room talk". Shortly thereafter, a number of women have emerged accusing him of raping them. I think that the worst "Trump says stupid, dangerous thing" is still older lines like him asking, "What's the point of having [nuclear weapons] if you can't use them?" or him refusing to commit to defending NATO ally nations unless they've paid their bills.

Ow, that's a tough one.

Ideally, you want to weigh their opinion against partisans of the "other side" of the story - preferably from people who are roughly as eloquent as your first source, otherwise you're introducing a bias. Most of the time, you'll end up more confused and mostly neutral, which is good because you should /not/ change your opinion after listening to a one-sided source anyway (or only change it slightly).

As Yudkowsky pointed out, this method has a failure mode, especially when applied to politics: you might hear good-sounding arguments for the two sides, and never shift your opinion, even though one side's arguments are much more important/accurate/better than the other. Eg "this candidate will keep the corrupt systems that impoverishes you" vs "that candidate might start a nuclear war".

I don't know any solution to this problem besides "be better informed". Like Professor Quirell said, only harsh experience teaches you that "Kill your problems immediately with a lot of death" is more important than "Avoid making powerful enemies when you don't have to". Otherwise they both sound very convincing.

You have to take the all of the information at once, and update based on what you would have expected based on certain situations.

Let's say you figure there's a half chance that there is a car behind door number 1, and a half chance that it is something nearly worthless.

Here are the rules:

1) Door number 1 has one person in front of it. This person, the salesman, tries to get you to pick door number 1 no matter what (by convincing you its a car).

2) They can not lie.

3) They only get one statement to convince you.

The salesman might tell you "Behind door number 1 is an object whose outer body is made mostly of metal."

If this person wasn't a salesman, and was instead just someone spewing out random facts about what was behind the door, that should move your posterior above a half. Why? /Because you would expect someone spewing out random facts to say something that doesn't apply to a car if it wasn't a car."/

But since it is a salesman, you should adjust /downward,/ not upward. Why? /Because you would expect a salesman to say something like "It's a car behind door number 1," if it really was a car./ The fact that they didn't is evidence /against/ it being a car.

Fair enough, I have kind of a personal bias in this case. I was raised Southern Baptist.

- I was shown [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind][Kent Hovind]] videos as a kid and told they were fact. Kent Hovind is a young earth creationist. He believes Evolution is a deliberate lie and the Earth is only 6,000-10,000 years old. His "theories" fail back-of-the-envelope calculations.

- My High School (located in a suburban area of Florida), taught abstinence-only sex education. We were shown pictures of the effects of STDs, and we were told how having sex before major would ruin our ability to bond emotionally with our future spouse. One exercise they used was to give us pieces of tape and then stick the pieces of tape to each other and pull them apart, so that the pieces of tape eventually lost this stickiness. This was supposed to illustrate how pre-marital sex would affect us. There was no discussion of any forms of birth control. There was no discussion of how to get tested for STDs. There was no discussion of what consent means.

- One of my Christian friends from Church in High School shunned another one of my friends upon learning that he was bisexual. My Christian's friend's parents encouraged his decision to shun my bisexual friend. These Christians were in most cases your stereotypical Southern Hospitality sort in terms of their behavior. They were willing to open up their home (their father was a lawyer and made lots of money so they had a big home) to lots of Church youth group events, they volunteered at the church, etc. My Mom tried convincing his Mom that shunning wasn't mature and wasn't Christian behavior, but instead of convincing her, instead his Mom convinced my Mom that their was probably something else wrong or perverted about my bisexual friend just because he was bisexual, and that her son was being justifiably cautious and prudent by avoiding my bisexual friend.

I can give more examples of why this group is so bad. I can understand you wanting to take a neutral stance, particularly if you haven't been exposed to this cultural mindset before.

  American Churches
#+end_quote

This is a mistake. It isn't actually Americans churches in general. It is a specific subculture mostly found in the South, the so called "Bible-Belt". Hence why I used the terms "Evangelical", and "Fundamentalist" repeatedly. American Catholics, for example, will believe evolution is real, believe climate change is real, and may be Democrat or Republican, because they don't view things in terms of a single set of issues. Southern Baptists on the other hand will often make statements indicating that Catholics aren't real Christians, I've heard said at the pulpit of the Church I grew up in that Catholics are pagans (because of their worship of the Saints, which isn't true, but the idea was never corrected from the pulpit). Many non-evangelical denominations have found room for compromise and understanding on issues like gay marriage. So American Churches are not one thing. That said, I think many surveys indicate somewhere between 20% and 50% of Americans believe in young-earth creationism (evolution is a lie, the Earth is only 6,000-10,000 years old) so they do represent a plurality and a leading cultural force, which is thankfully dying off.

******** It's funny. You talk about a group being unwilling to compromise as your justification to be unwilling to compromise with them. Not only that, but you imply disdain for their unwillingness to compromise, and yet consider your own unwillingness without fault.

Let me ask a question. What if you're wrong? Sure, narrow the scope of the group to be limited to people unable to compromise and you can say that they are unwilling to compromise, but when you merely talk about 'the other tribe', there's no /inherent/ quality that makes them unwilling to compromise. What if, now that you've dismissed them all as uncompromising, and thus refuse to entertain compromising with them, they say the same about you? If we go with what you say, they have every reason to say that our tribe wants their tribe scattered to the winds, and are unwilling to compromise. From that, what else can follow but meaningless hatred between the two tribes, if each tribe sees the other as not worth rational discourse with?

Even if they deserve to be made fun of, however you'd quantify that, making fun of them isn't productive in any way, and is in fact counter to the idea of spreading rationality. The only good it does is make you feel superior on the same primal level they feel superior by retaliating to our closed-minded intolerance.

**** Again, I agree, but lack of ~ ex machinae is a different rule than the story must be a puzzle.

Also, that's arguing for foreshadowing being good writing, which isn't what I'm disputing. I'm disputing the requirement that all rationalist stories be a puzzle, for it's overly restrictive if the intent is really, "The story does not utilize ~ ex machina plot devices."

Take, for example, a story about elves. The protagonist is on a stroll through the forest contemplating how they might beat their political and social rival when they witness humans prospecting.

If the protagonist was hyper-focused on their clan struggles, and you want to shock the reader as well as the protagonist, then one shouldn't foreshadow the humans' appearance. But that's not puzzle-like.

For the above example, if the antagonist knows more magic than the protagonist, then of course they'll steal it. It's the author's job to find a way to make that satisfying. Adding a requirement that all works of the subgenre be puzzles is one author forcing their solution to the problem on all others. Better to have a subgenre-defining rule that reflects the intent than a rule that solves the main problem while introducing unnecessary restrictions and obstacles.

I'm not sure what the full intent is, so I can't write that alternate rule myself. [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]]'s writing on the subject is intertwined with writing advice. A rule that's also writing advice is prescriptivist and unnecessarily restrictive.

I disagree. Say a character has been established as an excellent diplomat, and there's a conflict with another nation. The obvious answer to the conflict is to send the diplomat and spend time showing how the diplomat solves the conflict.

Told straight, the conflict arises, they send the diplomat to a diplomatic convention, and we watch them as they wield diplomacy to their faction's ends.

Told as a puzzle, the diplomat explains the issues, describes the players (other diplomats) and what the diplomat thinks they want, and lays out what resources the diplomat has with which to bargain and deal.

Both options embrace the fundamental truth-seeking and thoughtfulness that's expected of rationalist fiction; they just do it differently.

--------------

In the first scenario, if we have yet to see inside the mind of that diplomat, then there are things we reasonably won't know. The diplomat will probably give us an overview before they talk to someone as a review, but they might also go straight into dealing in diplomacy, gradually revealing to the reader their approach as they do it. The latter isn't a puzzle; the reader may be familiar with the resources of their faction and thus able to guess what incentives to deal the diplomat can offer, but has no way of knowing exactly how the diplomat will respond to novel information. Further, if the diplomat is given free reign to promise whatever they like, no matter how outrageous, then the reader won't be able to guess what the diplomat will say in a conversation unless it's something like:

- "There's Duke Gaspard. He loves ponies."

- Reader stops reading and thinks for a few minutes.

- "'Hello, Duke Gaspard! We need you to ally with us for just a season-long campaign. Just monster-slaying. If you do, we promise to turn you into the largest pony to ever live - greater than even the moon to a cave-child's eye!'"

Even then, I don't foresee a reader guessing that solution.

If the story must be puzzle-like, then the author is forced to go with the second option, where "the diplomat explains the issues, describes the players (other diplomats) and what the diplomat thinks they want, and lays out what resources the diplomat has with which to bargain and deal."

It's one solution, but it's not the only solution, and I don't understand why all works of rationalist fiction must abide by the stipulation that they must be puzzle-like, so long as resources or information aren't pulled out of thin air.

--------------

If someone is the ruler of an alternate universe's country, and a new conflict arises that inspires the ruler to ask, "Do we have people who specialize in this sort of thing?" and the answer is yes, then the reader wasn't aware of the information specifically but could still have deduced "delegate to specialists" as an honest means a ruler of a country would use to solve a novel conflict.

Another example: a character is well connected. A new conflict comes to their attention. The character goes to a heretofore unmentioned contact in order to solve or seek help in solving the the conflict. A reader couldn't puzzle that out except in the broadest sense, but the character is still acting rationally according to their characterization.

--------------

Perhaps I'm quibbling. The distinction is fine, but I think it's important that a subgenre-defining rule be as specific and hew as closely to its intent as possible.

I'm not sure if I'm being clear.

Say the conflict is opening a mechanical apple by a student at magitech academy.

*Puzzle:*

- 1) Learn (components). 2) Think (how they fit together). 3) Apply (solutions).

*Other approach I:*

- 1) Think (about mechanical apples). 2) Learn and apply at the same time (e.g. ask the academy's resident klepto if they know anything about mechanical apples, then follow them to a thief's guild meeting hoping someone will open it for you).

*Other approach II:*

- 1) Think (about immediate solutions). 2) Apply (e.g. place a reward for the apple's opening and wait; offer to grade a Professor's homework for lower classes if they open it for you; run odd words in the speech of the person who gave you the apple through some cryptographic algorithms).

*Other approach III:*

- 1) Apply (solve it during the same interaction you receive it by noticing hints on the device itself, and relating each hint back to classes previously covered in the story; e.g. where Leaf in the Wind means freedom from gravity: "A leaf? Maybe..." He lightly tossed it straight up, and at the zenith of its arc, the leaf lit and opened a third of the apple.)

Apologies for the lack of concision. Hopefully I've at least made my argument clear.

- Use hyperlinks, not footnotes. Well, use footnotes if you like /as well/, but it's [Current Year]. Hyperlinks are convenient.

- The connection between the posts that you mention and your premise is not clear.

- The reference to the "game being called 'terrible'" sets your audience up to assume you /are/ talking about fun. You deflect this later, but you can do better by not bringing up the question in the first place: use the word "playability" instead, which describes what you're looking to accomplish a bit better.

- Discussing motivation for a paper is fine, but don't just state "these things motivated me", instead spend some time walking the audience through your thought process, try and set up some of the thought connections that you had, and let the reader come to the conclusion you did by walking the same mental path.

- I would not bother discussing multiplayer being outside of scope. If your methods are correct, they will scale just fine to the multiplayer experience, and drawing attention to what you're /not/ going to discuss before you've brought any meat to the table sabatoges your reader's interest. If you haven't already piqued their curiosity, but then draw attention to an interesting idea and then say "this. I won't talk about this", you leave your reader a bit confused about what you /will/ talk about.

- It's a bit unclear if your methods are intended for use by game developers or game players. Even if they might be used by both, I would focus on how this benefits developers (as they are in fact the ones that would most use such a system).

- The System Requirements section is a bit strange. The connection between having a system requirements list and the topic of this paper is not immediately clear. Walk the reader through why these are required. If this is instead an example of a possible application of the methods of this paper, instead move this section to the end as a proof of concept.

- The System Requirements questions themselves are all over the place. 1 and 2 are the same question. I know one is about installation and one is about running, but I'm afraid when it comes down to brass tacks, if you can install it but can't run it /you haven't really installed it/. 3 seems to be a meta-consideration and does not help actually define a specific requirement so much as put an upper bound on all such requirements. 4 should be reworded to indicate you are looking for several levels of requirements. 5 and 6 seem oddly specific and their reason for inclusion is not super clear. 7 and 9 are related enough to be collapsed into one. All in all the reason the reader is answering these questions is left unclear.

- What is the purpose of the Technical Operations section? I see questions that are common usability issues, but it's not clear if the reader should be coming up with these themselves, or if this is a list of metrics that is canonical, or what is going on. The jabs at buggy games is not really needed; you don't need to sit down and explain to developers that errors in their code is a Bad Thing. Oh, and FPS seems like a pretty damn important metric for such a list; having your game chug along at 5 FPS is a usability issue much worse than many of the nitpicky things being measured.

- "Gameplay Attributes" is an unclear statement. You list /genres/ (and call them qualities), but I have no idea what this section is talking about.

- Heck, I'm not quite sure what /any/ of these sections are here for. These are all things related to games, yes, and I understand that you have some sort of system for quantifying game metrics, but I've got a jigsaw puzzle with more holes than pieces here. Discuss methods and /then/ discuss differences in kind, if that's what this is trying to.

- Story analysis seems completely orthagonal to the question of "is a game playable", but without an understanding of what's going on, it's hard to tell.

- All in all, I know more about what this paper is trying to talk about based on what you've told me /outside/ of it than what you've told me /inside/ it. I don't have a chain of thought to follow, and outside of the existence of the premise I haven't walked away with any more information than what I started with. I understand this is obviously unfinished, but I'm not even sure what it's /trying/ to build.

** So, how can we found our own nation? What does a nation need, to consolidate enough power to matter?

Let's think about the problem space for a bit, because I know I'm not prepared to even think about planning.

- A place for people to live?

  - What about a distributed republic? A "country" that owns no land?
  - Boats?

- Our own banks, and control over what kind of companies get investments? Who gets loans?

  - I don't know if we can invest in companies that we like and be competitive. But my bank is offering free ipads with new accounts, so I suspect the efficient market hypothesis isn't in play and that they don't have the consumers best interest. If they have enough market power to be as inefficient as they are...

- What are our countries key exports? I presume we're not growing grain ourselves, so we're going to need to buy some.
- Etc, et al.

*** Have you checked out Sealand? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand]]

I think the main criteria they're missing is: "people and other countries recognize it as a country"

You can't have businesses go to your place to avoid taxes unless the countries in which they do business allow them to do so. You can't have embassies or diplomats unless other countries allow you to. You can't gather global support to help defend you against invasion unless the world perceives action against you as an actual invasion and decides to help.

And it matters whether the people in the land you control perceive you as a government and obey your laws. If the whole world decided and agreed that North Korea isn't a real country, it would still keep doing what it's doing internally and not much would change (unless we decided to take action as a result of their new definition).

Having things like farms, citizens, banks etc might shift public perception in your favor, but I think they're more of things that a country probably wants to have, rather than strict necessities.

--------------

This is more or less why I'm asking this question, to figure out what we need.

As to the why, that should be pretty obviously. The US isn't doing so well, and most of the people in the rationalist diaspora live in the US, excluding myself. How do we provide an alternative franchise? It's a question I think we should each think about for at least 5 minutes.

What roles does the US fill, what are it's most useful facets, and how can we provide them ourselves without relying on the US?

Ideally, once we've identified those roles, we'd take gradual steps towards creating an organization that fullfills them.

I think embassies, passports, and recognition as a country /could/ be pretty low priority, depending on the strategy we use. A distributed republic, a seamount, A loose collection of social-media tools, a bank. None of those require recognition as a country.

I have given some thought to identity services as a fundamental export, verification of some sort of digital "citizen". It would solve a lot of problems in smart contracts if you could rely on unique user votes.

So let me phrase this question a bit differently. What essential services does the US (not the government, but the system) provide for you, and what are our options for bypassing them?

#+end_quote

Alright, well that's a pretty simple one. We're getting a lot better at distributed utilities. We're not quite at the level where small-scale alternative energy can do everything we need to, but it's more then doable if you're frugal with using energy and can burn some sort of fuel for heat. For personal use if not industrial.

I'm not going to bother even including that on the list, since there are already plenty of commercial, workable, less-convenient, options on the market.

#+begin_quote
  inspected food and drugs
#+end_quote

Everybody else uses the FDA, so I don't think it's a big problem if we use it as well. Of course being able to bypass it has some big advantages as well, right now it's enforced.

#+begin_quote
  police/firemen/ambulances
#+end_quote

That's a pretty big one. Any ideas?

#+begin_quote
  legal recourse to crimes
#+end_quote

I feel like there are policy options we could take that would provide some-recourse. Pretending that we're seasteaders, simply denying them access to resources like marinas and resupply points would be good recourse for financial crimes and the like. If we were a "bayesian-conspiracy" job site, likewise.

If we're providing a legitimate service, then cutting them off from that service provides some manner of recourse.

#+begin_quote
  army protecting from (or mostly just deterring) every other nation on Earth from just taking our stuff.

Duel citizinship, or even just us being a loose unrecognized coalition, does similar.

I'm not positing that the US is going to collapse or anything, just that I know a lot of people who'd rather live somewhere saner.

--------------

But I feel like those are some of the least interesting problems you could have come up with. Here are some ones that I personally find more interesting, that you might have some ideas on.

- Access to community (meeting new people, etc)

- Postal Service

- Face to Face meetings with the people who employ you

- Civic centers that make it much easier to find gainful employment

- Mortgages (for both properties and industrial equipment)

- land equity

Try suggesting some solutions, to some of the problems. We don't have to get it all, but there are some low-handing fruit there. Maybe start with postal service? What would we need to create to make a reasonable alternative to the postal service?

It's more that in nationalist theory, nations are considered organic, pre-theoretical entities that either actually exist or actually don't. /Creating/ a nation where one does /not/ previously exist usually involves becoming a dictator and welding people together through economic, cultural, linguistic, and educational integration (by force if necessary).
