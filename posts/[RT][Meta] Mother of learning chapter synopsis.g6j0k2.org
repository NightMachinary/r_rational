I made a google doc for chapter summaries of Mother of Learning. Its public so anyone who wants to add to it can. It's pretty bare since I only made the document yesterday, but it should become an easy to use resource once its finished.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2XOHtPp9kICDRZd22YT5guSD6yaqC0SBiBiR836lE4/edit][Chapter synopsis]]

Let me know if there is anything wrong with the doc, like you can't edit it.


** Nice! I really wish there were more initiatives like this (be the change you want to see, I know, etc. etc.). For slow updating fics, or fics I drop and then revisit after later recommendations, or fics that go on hiatus, it's really nice to be able to recap what's happened. I feel ye olde timey novels would often have an "in which our heroes find themselves at odds with the nefarious shark people and eat a huckleberry cake" at the start of each chapter but haven't seen that convention in anything more recent.

*** [[http://www.wotsummary.com/]] is a great example. I wish it was a wiki, though.

** Might be worth putting a blank page after ever ten chapters such that people can refresh on part of it without getting spoiled too far.

*** The idea behind this is that its for people who have already read the series and want to find a specific moment and not have to read the whole story again to find it. Because of that, I don't think spoilers are something to worry about. If you still thin it would be best to have a blank page after every ten chapters, then you could add that in yourself, since the document is public.

**** Another good use is someone who hasn't read in a while and wants to get refreshed on where they were.
