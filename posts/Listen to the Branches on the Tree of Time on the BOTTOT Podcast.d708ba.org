Hi all,

I've completed my first ever audio narration! It's of Alexander Wales's Branches on the Tree of Time, a Terminator fanfic. Thank you sir for a great story. (Also, a tip of the hat to Eneasz Brodski for the years of inspiration with his HPMOR podcast.)

I put it up on SoundCloud as six separate tracks in a [[https://soundcloud.com/user-650319904/sets/bottot][playlist]].

Also, an [[http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:336066354/sounds.rss][RSS Feed]]

I've submitted to Apple podcasts and am waiting for approval (takes up to 3 weeks). I'll comment on this thread when it's up.

This is literally my first attempt at narration / podcasting, so the audio is admittedly a bit rough, though it gets a little better as the story progresses. I hope to do more narration of different stories, primarily rational fiction over time and improve by voice technique, my studio set up, and my editing skills.

Let me know what you think (be gentle) and if you have suggestions for rationalist, never-before-narrated, short to medium length (<50,000 words) stories you'd like to hear, post them!

Best,

W
