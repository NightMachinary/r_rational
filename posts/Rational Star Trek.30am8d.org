I was wondering what would have to be done to "fix" the Trek universe. The obvious first step is to either dispose of time travel completely or make it always entirely linear.

As far as the aliens are concerned, you'd either have to vastly de-humanize all the non-humans in the galaxy, or else embrace the common ancestor device completely and dispose of almost all standard evolution and natural selection, which would be downright hell from a revisionist historical standpoint.

The away teams would of course usually have to wear air-tight suits, since barely any planets would realistically have an Earth-like atmosphere. And by the time of the 24th century, the ship interiors would be almost entirely holographic and instantly adjustable, because why not.

Those are just my first few thoughts on the subject. Feel free to discuss. Maybe someone can solve the problem of why humans seem to be the only species still inventing new technologies anymore.


** Well, you'll need a predictable warp scale. I like /Warp Factor x/ = c(/x/^{/x/)}

And for gods sake, stop having the captain, first officer, and senior medical officer beam down to the planet, when Away Team 7, with optional Diplomatic Officer Jones is a much more sensible plan.

Also, where are the NCO's? Sure, Cheif O'Brian shows up, but what about Crewman second class Smith? If everybody is an officer, what's the point of officers?

Please, move the bridge. Everything is view-screens anyway. Put the most important command and control systems in the core of the hull, behind extra shielding, not sitting on top of the ship with a "Please shoot me" sign and some nice breakable windows on top.

Shall I continue, or are you giving this up for a loss?

*** On the contrary. There are clear solutions to every problem you just listed. The warp 1-10 scale never made much sense anyway, with the distances presented. So a new exponential scale would be implemented. The away teams would simply become B-team main characters, which would lead to a much more ensemble cast, some of which may actually die over the course of the series.

I don't know enough about the structuring of military or Starfleet in particular to address the NCOs, but I have a feeling it could be easily solved by the same ensemble cast as above. Yes, the bridge must move. And with that said, the ships would likely have to be redesigned as well. It's a shame to get rid of the classic Enterprise shape, but there's little justification for it.

If Harry Potter can be made rational, surely the same can be done for one of the greatest science fiction franchises of the last fifty years. If you wish to dissuade me, then yes, you shall continue. I am not giving up.

**** You need a better explanation for why transporters and replicators can't be used to just clone people wholesale (which probably means making some retcons to problematic episodes).

You need a better explanation for why replicators can't make living things in general - the explanation that Star Trek uses is that everything that looks organic is really just cobbled together from nonorganic parts, but tastes like and functions as the nutritional equivalent of its organic counterpart.

You need some kind of explanation for how the economy works - even if material goods are now meaningless, labor isn't, which means that an economy of some kind should exist.

You need an explanation for why there isn't artificial intelligence (or why it sucks so much).

You need an explanation for why everyone seems to be at the same general tech level, and seemingly got there through different paths.

You need an explanation for why every species looks the same.

You need an explanation for why there's no brain simulation/uploading/interface - how people have holograms and no one has thought to just plug their brain into a computer (or if they have, why no one is ever seen doing that).

***** Replicators use fairly simple uniform patterns that take up very little relative data space. That's why home-cooked foods taste so much better. They have far more variety from one cubic millimeter to the next. The transporter is a bigger issue, but not an impossible one. If it proves too difficult, however, you could simply dispose of them and make away teams always take a shuttle.

The economy is volunteer-based. Engineers are engineers because they want to be. Redshirts are Redshirts because they know Kung Fu, and almost nothing about warp coils. Same goes for architects and construction workers. There are billions of people back on earth and the colonies who are perfectly content to just eat replicated food and watch holoplays for the rest of their lives.

AI is simply much more difficult than it seems. The ships computer is the closest Starfleet has. Professor Soong was a genius beyond his time, and a specialist in studying ancient technologies left behind by great extinct civilizations.

The tech level is probably the most difficult problem I've seen here so far. I honestly don't know how to fix it. I suppose you could say that most species developed roughly parallel to each other, or that some of them have reached a level of cultural stagnation that prevents progress. Both are extremely questionable solutions, to say the least.

They look the same because a common ancestor seeded millions of terraformed planets across the galaxy with life, several dozen millennia ago. This is canon, and little has to change about it to be more adequately explained.

I suppose there could be some unsolved issues with VR and brain interface that make it dangerous, or unpredictable. This is reasonable, considering how vastly complicated the human brain is, and how different it can be from person to person, let alone species to species.

****** The economy thing isn't really solved by having a volunteer economy.

Let's say that I want a haircut. I would have to go find a guy who decided that he wanted to be a barber, right? But it seems really, really unlikely that supply of barber-hours would magically match the demand of barber-hours, doesn't it? So either we have:

- A shortage of barbers. This is a big problem, because there's nothing pushing people to /become/ barbers if they don't want to be. We don't have money, right? So I can't simply pay someone to cut my hair. The demand for haircuts keeps going up, but it's totally disconnected from the supply of barbers.
- A shortage of hair to cut. This is less of a problem - presumably some of those would-be barbers just quit. (This seems somewhat unlikely to me, given that I don't know many people with enthusiasm for service.)

This applies to literally every service that someone in the Federation might want another person to provide. And if you're going with "replicator food tastes worse" you're exacerbating how ridiculous this economy is, because now there's a demand for non-replicated goods which can only be filled by people deciding to become farmers. Same goes for everything that a replicator only makes a sub-par version of. Tailors, bakers, chefs, etc.

The natural result of a government-enforced "volunteer economy" is a grey market. The best chef on the station gives preferential treatment to the best barber, and they bypass each others waiting list. Maybe those people with high demand for their services start asking for something that can't be replicated, like strips of latinum (or better, a cryptocurrency). And suddenly you have a real economy again, if one that the Federation is trying desperately to stamp out because it conflicts with their ideals.

For non-military technologies, economy/trade would tend to keep most species at comparable levels of technology. Everyone wants to get their grasping appendages on the future equivalent of the latest ipod. Someone will always be willing to buy and sell for the right price.

From a military standpoint, the Cold War may offer the best parallel: The US and USSR were not openly sharing technology but through various forms of espionage and observation, the two nations' military technology were kept /roughly/ on par even if they occasionally chose different solutions to similar problems. If one nation gained a slight advantage, a counter development by the other nation usually followed soon after.

And then Geordi accidentally created strong AI by not choosing his words carefully enough in a holodeck. This is the sort of thing you just have to excise whole-cloth from a rational reinterpretation; that the ship's computer, completely unbeknownst to those who designed, built, maintain, and operate it, is capable of creating a strong AI, and has zero safeguards to prevent anyone from instructing it to do so merely by uttering a few words in the holodeck, is just not credible. That, upon discovering this ability, they promptly /forget all about it/ pushes it soundly into the realm of the surreal.

***** re: their economy, my headcanon has always been that they were, for all intents and purposes, a post-scarcity economy, thanks mainly to matter replicators. The amount of non-automatable labor actually required to sustain a population would be fairly small, very plausibly small enough for an entirely volunteer workforce to handle.

Their hand-wavey explanation for why they can't just replicate people is that the patterns are too massive, that food patterns are compressed to simple repeating formula, while a human, or any living thing, has a pattern that must be preserved exactly, without such cheating, particularly in the brain, where I think they even threw in stuff about quantum state having to be copied exactly (how on earth they are supposed to be reading and then reproducing both the position and the velocity of every electron, I have no idea. The Heisenberg Compensators were probably involved.) None of these explanations are entirely satisfactory from a hard sci-fi perspective, of course.

I would think to translate the ideas into hard scifi, first you would have to create a hard differentiation of replicators and transporters; they should not be related technology at all. Replicators should be a form of nanoassembly, building up atoms into molecules and ultimately into complex objects. Not, as said in canon, literally making energy into matter. This would have the side-benefit of explaining why they can't just replicate antimatter in whatever quantity they need, as no transformation the replicator could apply would turn matter into antimatter. Which allows you to have elements of a scarcity economy, if only at the level of the starships, which depend on antimatter engines to power their warp drives. Which, in turn, gives an answer to why gangs of bored teenagers don't build and fly their own starships around after downloading replicator plans from the 24th century interweb.

As for transporters... eeh... I have no good answer for how transporters could work in a hard sci-fi setting. I honestly just don't. Someone more clever than me may come up with one, but for myself, I would either add a liberal amount of handwavium to power actual matter teleportation - you're not torn apart, digitized, and then rebuilt, you're literally, physically teleported, somehow - or I'd remove transporters entirely. The latter, of course, makes it notably less Trek, since they are such a staple of the trekverse.

******* that explanation would effectively repurpose the existing handwavium supply, which is good. Feels a little strange to me, and would beg the question of why these bubbles are different from those used on ships - if you can create completely enclosed bubbles, that cease to connect or interact with normal space entirely (so they can go through the ship's hull, etc), then why don't ships do that when traveling at warp? You could say that creating such closed bubbles is more energy-intensive than the "open," gradient, bubbles ships use, and that it's only possible because the size of the bubbles is so much smaller, I suppose; but then, why don't they put these on torpedoes? shields might be said to protect against the effect, but once past shields, such a torpedo could detonate deep inside the ship, at any precise location you want (like, say, inside their engine core) rather than against the hull. Of course, I overlooked this same question in suggesting the vague "literal teleportation" in the first place, now that I think of it. Meh.

******** Those are all good points. I think we can place rational limits on the technology to prevent such problems. The transporter bubbles need to be constantly maintained or they will fall apart and destroy whatever is inside them. The computing power and energy requirements to wrap and unwrap space is monumental, in fact it requires something the size of Galaxy class spaceship. Shields disrupt the bubble maintenance beams causing the bubbles to fail catastrophically. Hulls also have a strong electrical charge, the voltage constantly shifting which also disrupts transporter signals. One would need to know the hull and shield frequencies to allow a transporter beam through. Consequently while bubbles can go through your own hull and shields they are unlikely to make it through an enemy's shield or hull. It also allows for rational advances in shield, hull and transporter bubble technologies.

Warp bubbles put the objects within them into "subspace" (what ever that might be) whereas transporters use real space. The main difference being that one can transmit and receive information from real space when in subspace and vice versa but this means you can't pass through solid matter. The warp fields are relatively simpler to compute and maintain as a result.

Likewise, they wouldn't be able to transport into buildings or caves, only on the planet surface.

They're post-goods-scarcity, but they're not post-services-scarcity. They still need doctors, engineers, police, emergency response, administration, teachers, etc. And at least canonically, there are some things that can't be replicated for one reason or another. One of the big questions that I have about the setting is how much labor is actually automated. Clearly they /don't/ have strong AI, or even terribly good weak AI, which means that intellectual labor probably remains in heavy demand. We never really see much in the way of robotics either, which means that there's at least some labor demand for any remaining unpleasant tasks (unless this robot army is hidden from view for reasons of series budget or aesthetics).

To be frank, a lot of what people are seen doing in the series seems like grunt work, and I kind of wonder how it is that people outside of Starfleet don't just look at problems that need fixing and think "someone else can recalibrate the sensors today, that seems boring". But maybe I'm just too cynical about what motivates people to do work.

This was a plot point in Voyager. It turns out that the Medical Hologram Mark I was rejected for service as an emergency medical device, but was repurposed as a janitor. This so upset Dr. Zimmerman that he used other people to model subsequent EMHs.

******* re: AI, they do and they don't. I mean, every holodeck personality, not just the "special" ones the writers graced with proper self-awareness, is an AI far beyond our current capabilities. And at one point, on VOY, there was an alpha quadrant subplot about the old first generation EMH being repurposed as miners. Within the confines of a holodeck, or within the effective area of a holographic emitter, holograms /are/ AI. Very good AI. AI completely capable of doing anything from menial labor to providing medical care. They never /call/ it "AI" but there's no escaping the fact that it /is/ AI. I'm not entirely clear on where the distinction is drawn between "strong" and "weak" AI, but they are nearly as intelligent and capable as a human and, within areas of specialization, have been demonstrated to equal if not exceed the best humans. The EMH on Voyager made legitimate new medical breakthroughs; the leah brahms charater from Geordi's program was not just a mechanized assistant, but clearly a collaborating partner in their efforts to save the ship. The doctor even had a desire to improve himself, though he lacked the knowledge, or programming, to properly understand holoprogramming, and so was not able to do so himself. But there's no reason to think holoprogramming is inherently more complex than the entire field of medical knowledge and practice for a an advanced multi-species culture, or the complete workings of the Enterprise engines, power systems, and warp drive. They just never showed an AI that had been programmed with that specialized knowledge before. If they did, I suspect it would certainly qualify as strong AI, with all the risks and rewards that entails.

**** not saying you're wrong that it should be abandoned, but within the framework of the system, the warp factor as a measure wasn't actually arbitrary, at least, not after the TNG overhauls to the system. Warp factors were stable points in subspace field compression, or some other such technobabble, but the specific speeds in it's logarithmic progression were stable nodes in that compression, points at which the power output needed to maintain the field dropped off sharply. For example, once you hit warp 2, the power needed to maintain warp 2 was drastically less than the power required to sustain warp 1.9. Now, you might want to throw out warp drive and this explanation entirely, but since I'm not aware of any practical, plausible ideas for ftl travel as convenient as is absolutely required to make the Trek universe actually be the Trek universe, I'm not sure you want to do that. I'd just do what the writers rarely did, and consistently apply warp drive as it's described in the tech manual. Namely, the transition /to/ warp 9 is the single most power-intensive thing the ship ever does; it might briefly interrupt use of warp power for secondary systems, or even be impossible of backup power is offline, limiting the ship to warp 8 until backup is online again. And a ship should never travel at anything but a whole-number warp factor, excepting at greater than 9, since the threshold to achieve warp 10 requires requires an infinite amount of energy, making it as impossible as accelerating to light speed with conventional propulsion. But given the insanely sharp logarithmic spike in power use past warp 9, it would be a thing for short-term use in the most desperate emergencies only, and should have real consequences for the ship, including wearing out engine components, depleting fuel supplies, and disabling secondary systems for the duration.

:edit: You might well want to readjust the scale, of course; as it stood in tng, it was never clear why they would ever travel at less than warp 8, at least, unless you factor in the whole "turns out warp drive breaks space" thing they threw out in a later season and rarely mentioned again. But just some kajiggering with fuel and wear economy might resolve this problem; if warp 8 is 10x faster than warp 7, but consumes fuel at 50x the rate and wears out expensive engine components many times faster as well, it would suddenly make sense to be economical with your speed choices, even if they had a huge impact on your schedule.

I believe one of the official "Science of Star Trek" books said that. And then warp factors up to 36 were used in the series. People tried to explain that by saying that warp factors were re-designated in the beginning of the 24th century, and that by the 2350s "warp factor 10" is an impossibility (whereas in the 2250s it was merely unsafe for passengers). But several times afterward, warp factors of 10 and above were observed.

Then ther ewas the abomination of an episode of Voyager where they managed to hit warp 10, traveling infinitely fast and passing through every point in the universe, and as a result, captain janeway and tom paris turned into giant salimanders and had sex. That episode Should also Not Be Spoken Of.

It was TOS that predated the "warp 10 is infinite speed/infinite energy" idea, and used a completely different warp scale.

There's very little evidence of virtual reality being a viable and commonplace technology in Starfleet. The clearest example of this is in the holodeck, which takes up much more space and is much more limited than simply giving each crewmember a VR headset. And if they don't even have proper VR, they certainly can't upload people entirely.

The transporter doesn't work like you're thinking it does. It actually transforms the objects into a kind of particle beam, which is reassembled into matter on the other end. The computer at no point stores all the information of a complete person, since the buffer couldn't handle that much data. This actually becomes a plot point in DS9, when they have to erase almost every file on the entire station just to store a pattern that the buffer would've lost otherwise.

Of course with that being said, the transporter would almost certainly have to be redesigned to make more sense, if not disposed of completely.

Subspace communications have always been one of the more problematic elements of Trek. Simply having the vessels receive prerecorded orders that take time to transmit is the easiest solution, which also makes remote starships not possible.

Disassembling planets is no small order. Especially when said planets are covered in culture and life that one has to sustain.

That's why I have humans on the ship. They can control the robots from there. The only problem is if communications can be blocked. There also might be a speed-of-light delay. It would be hard to tell from them just talking, but it would be problematic if they're controlling robots. In that case, they just need to be on or hovering over the planet somewhere near the robots. They can still be in their own fortress.

There is no way they have the technology to create edible food from atoms, but they can't do proper VR.

The computer on a teleporter doesn't store all the information of a person, but I'm pretty sure it processes it. You'd be able to scan someone's brain and record just what you need to upload them.

Once you can get solar panels to be sufficiently cheap and efficient, you can use the power from them to harvest more matter, resulting in an exponential growth until you have a Dyson sphere.

The Earth requires ten million tonnes of resources to create one square meter of living space. I don't know politics, so I don't know how what would be required, but just leaving the planet there is insane. France can keep their Eiffel tower, but unless they plan on using the 180 billion tonnes of resources under it, I figure they're up for grabs.

The brain is an adequately complicated mechanism to cause trouble interacting with even very advanced technology. For this same reason, uploading people could prove very problematic.

The rationalized Starfleet no longer has the capability of transforming energy into matter freely. Very few devices shown rely on it that couldn't work through some other less troublesome mechanic instead.

The Eiffel tower was just an example. You can't disassemble a planet without demolishing the vast majority of the things on it. Most of those things are owned by people who almost certainly wouldn't want their homes to be demolished. The opposition for such a project would be simply overwhelming, in any century. TNG even had an episode where numerous parties stood against the creation of a new continent on earth, because they didn't want their homeworld to change. Nostalgia will always stand in the way of progress in some form or another. Here's your 23rd century example.

The sun emits 63 megawatts per square meter. This is enough to lift 50 grams of matter from Mercury using radiation pressure, which is an insanely inefficient way of doing it. It won't take long to have another square meter of solar panels, and increase the rate of building exponentially. Once you have the technology for a Dyson sphere to be possible, doing it is trivial.

Holodecks can only alter your environment. VR can alter you. They'd need something far more impressive than this to turn into starfish aliens, but this setup would work for becoming a pony or something. Someone on VR can just use a robot to interact with normal people. Normal people cannot immigrate to Equestria. Also, holodecks seem to be expensive or something. There's just a few per ship, instead of making the whole ship like that. Admittedly, they might just be heavy or something, and they're only rare on starships. Either way, starships need VR.

Suppose the world was going to end in a billion years. But you could change something to make it last two billion. Would you? Now imagine that instead of these next billion years happening in series, they could happen in parallel. It has some disadvantages. It's harder to do science in parallel. But it's still almost as good.

But if you don't buy any of that, and you don't care about parallelizing science, the simple fact is that the Federation faces existential threats that it could stop with more manpower. They wouldn't have to worry about Klingons or the Borg or whoever made the planet-eating doomsday device.

You value culture? You need people to have culture. If you have more people, more cultures can thrive. Consider how much cultural diversity we have with six billion people. Now imagine how much we could have if we built a Dyson sphere that could support a septillion people. Now imagine if we did that for each star. Remember that xkcd comic about the [[https://xkcd.com/1095/][crazy straw enthusiasts]]? That would stop looking so silly. I was only suggesting clones for necessary manpower, so they would necessarily have a purpose. I personally would be in favor of increasing the population as high as possible, with the purpose of having fun.

I accept the repugnant conclusion, but I do not think it's applicable to a transhuman society. The expensive part about a person isn't that they're happy and fulfilled. It's that they have a mind. If you spend the energy to make a person, you might as well add in the tiny extra resources to connect them and their neighbors into a virtual utopia.

Suppose the Federation has a population of a trillion, and will exist for a billion years. Adding on another billion years is creating a new population of a trillion people for a billion years.

************* I'm starting to understand your line of reasoning a bit more. Not to say I agree with it, but I think I can understand it.

On the point of VR vs Holodeck, I think our disagreement is more one of priorities than actual dissonant logic. You care more about the Most-Probable-Outcome for history, which has us developing VR within the next century and holodecks never being invented due to being obsolete before they arrive. I care more about preserving Trek, at the cost of improbable turns in science such as the failure to perfect safe brain interface even in the semi-distant future. Both are completely possible. One is just more likely, while the other is compatible with Trek as we know it.

In a galaxy where you can't blow up an asteroid without some piece of shrapnel hitting a Goldilocks Zone M-class planet, and where starships and space travel are more common than dirt, finding places for people to live isn't going to be enough of an issue to where Dyson Spheres become efficient, let alone necessary. I don't argue with the possibility or practicality of it. I argue that even in the future politics and humanity in general wouldn't be far-seeing enough to prepare for a thousand years later when they hit the twenty-octillion population mark and run out of uninhabited planets to colonize and terraform.

The Borg do eventually harvest matter and energy as well. They go into this a bit more in Voyager, and even more in the comics. There are Borg mega-stations that enclose small stars and gradually extract all the radiation and rare minerals from them. In the distant 128th century, when the Borg have successfully assimilated the entire galaxy, their territory has no planets or stars or black holes or any other celestial bodies. Instead, they have a vast grid of perfectly spaced and uniform mass. They just haven't gotten there yet with the Alpha Quadrant in the 24th century. And similarly, they do in fact invent a lot of new tech. The Transwarp conduits weren't assimilated from anyone. They were an original Borg creation based off of the collective scientific know-how of hundreds of other species.

Granted, steak or cereal or what have you would compress much better than a human brain, and you can potentially have it in read-only storage after spending an outrageous amount of computational power analyzing the object and finding a compact representation.

On the other hand, there's a potentially much larger problem than mere storage space: processing speed. So, fine, you have physical humans on the ship.

***** *TL;DR:*

DS9 likely vastly overestimated the amount of data required to store an individual, even when including the amount of information needed to store brain patterns at the quantum level.

A device the size of a cell phone can hold about a hundred-thousand times more data than the entire human race has created (including books, images, and video) if said device had the information density of DNA.

--------------

I just read that the human body, excluding the non-human microbes within each person, contains 150 trillion GB of information as DNA. And mass-wise, DNA is a negligible portion of the body.

Here's an approximate calculation using DNA's information density. Hopefully, I make no errors! ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yottabyte][I double-checked with Wikipedia. I'm not far off, so I think I did things correctly.]])

Data per human in GB: 10^{14} GB

Mass of DNA per person: 10 g

Information Density: 10^{13} GB g^{-1}

To do the calculation, let's assume a futuristic replicator storage device is about the size of a cell phone, which has a volume of about 10^{2} cm^{3}. We'll also need to identify a plausible material so we can use its density. Since DNA is organic material, it probably contains a lot of carbon, so I'll use the density of graphite, which is carbon in its standard state at room temperature.

Graphite's density is about 10^{0} g cm^{-3} at room temperature.

The storage of a cell phone sized device with DNA-like information density and graphite-like physical density:

= (Information Density) (Physical Density) (Volume of Object)

= (10^{13} GB g^{-1}) (10^{0} g cm^{-3}) (10^{2} cm^{3})

= 10^{15} GB per cellphone

= 10^{24} B, or a yottabyte of information

For comparison, it's estimated that humans have created about 10^{19} B of information, including all books and digital media, which could all fit in a billion times over inside of this cell phone-sized, DNA-like device.

** you wouldn't have to abandon evolution entirely; the common-ancestor established as canon in TNG episode The Chase wasn't a simple, naturalistic case of "we all evolved from them." it was a case of stupidly-advanced-civilization seeding the universe with dna that was basically pre-loaded with the potential for humanoid life. Convergent evolution may be bs when applied as a justification for the standard "minor variations on humans" approach to aliens, but there is a real phenomenon there, and if certain conditions are favored by pre-existing code in these genetic seeds, it doesn't seem entirely implausible to me that billions of years of divergent evolution from those common seeds might tend in most cases to carry over those constraints. Add in that planets without the seeds, or where the seeds mutated early to lose these constraints, might have an objective evolutionary dis-advantage, basically deviating from the plan in ways that required them to evolve new solutions to challenges that arrive later, where pre-coded solutions are no longer applicable. This would mean that, while many other kinds of alien life are certainly possible, they would take longer to evolve compared to the humanoids who stick generally to the plan coded into these life-seeds, and so would be exceptionally rare in the timeframe of the story.

More interesting, to me, is the question of what you would have to change about the underlying philosophy of the federation. Friendship and cooperation and peace are certainly fine rational goals, as is a willingness to fight back when others don't always share that philosophy. But what of their relationships with other species? The prime directive has always been contentious, and seems at times to exist only so that the various trek crews can find reasons to have to violate it. If the rule is a good rule, it needs to be enforced, consistently, and if it's not a good rule, then it needs to be redefined or replaced with something that is a good rule, and can be enforced consistently. The idea that the federation's prime directive is so frequently set aside, and with no significant consequences, just strains credibility.

:edit: Oh, the half-human-half-alien thing would have to go, though; unless there is literally a common ancestor that is very recent in evolutionary terms (like romulans and vulcans), there's just no rationalizing this short of extremely complicated genetic engineering, on a level nobody in the trek universe seems to have come close to. Well, except, possibly, those ancestors who seeded us all - which might, actually, be something more useful than "hi, kids, you play nice now" as a final message/gift for those progenetors to have buried in our DNA for us to find. But without serious canon history restructuring, such that that discovery was made centuries earlier, you couldn't have, say, Spock as a half-human, half-vulcan in the TOS era. Which, actually, as I think about it, I think is absolutely what you should do, and make Spock one of the first experimental applications of this knowledge, a hybrid created towards the express purpose of bringing humans and vulcans closer together.

It's an integral part of the Trekverse, so it /should/ still be present, but it needs better apologetics than the primary sources have provided for it. Absent the existence of a coherent moral theory that explains why noninterference is such a good policy, you get the following rational response (by [[http://warpfairy.dreamwidth.org/441.html][Alicorn]], if you haven't seen this one before):

  The Prime Directive is the most staggering atrocity - in sheer scope - ever to have been perpetrated by an advanced civilization.

  In its name, genocides and mass enslavements are committed, planets are wrenched out of orbit into their suns or torn apart by supervolcanoes with millions or billions of innocents aboard, and literally uncounted numbers of men, women, and children fall prey to all manner of poverty, scarcity, illness, violence, disaster, and opportunity cost with every second that ticks by. Meanwhile, prosperous neighbors, concealing themselves like shy gods, leaving the little cousins to their deadly growth and winnowing, cheat themselves out of all the culture and insight and genius that they insist on abandoning to their noninterference policy.

Starfleet in particular is strongly incentivized to focus on defense and peacekeeping, with humanitarian projects strictly limited to cases of political expediency.

So, you posit a second large, powerful, charitable organization in the TrekVerse, the purpose of which is exactly that.

**** Part of the problem is that it is simply too broad to be a simple, absolute rule. It should absolutely be a crime of the highest order to take a primitive world and use advanced tech to dominate them, whether it's by posing as gods or just through brute-force oppression. Any reasonable person should agree with that, I think you can safely say. And that /does/ branch out a bit. If you were to plop down onto a planet with a pre-industrial civilization and just start transforming their world in the most benevolent way possible, giving them medicine, technology, and education - you would be helping the people, yes, but it seems almost inevitable that you would, in the process, murder their culture in the process, displacing it in favor of a little parody of your own. Regardless of your good intentions, they would still effectively be subservient, at least until they grew to the point that they could sustain this improved quality of life without your assistance. To make that happen quickly, would mean being immensely disruptive in the short term. To throttle their development, make it happen slowly, would just prolong their period of dependence. There's no obvious, perfect answer. So I could accept an expansion beyond a simple prohibition against direct exploitation, as I can see the consequences of benevolent interference being destructive, too.

But to extend it as far as a vague prohibition against any interference, interpreted so broadly as to mean you can't fire a few photon torpedos at an asteroid you happen to notice is on course to hit their planet and render it uninhabitable in a few years, from the complete safety and anonymity of space, where they will never know you were even there? That is just madness, and completely unjustifiable. The only rationale I can even conceive to defend that would be a resort to a higher power, that the asteroid is some god's will, and that we should not interfere. Which is flimsy even if it's true, since if there is such a powerful god going around willing things like that, why should it be assumed that we are somehow able to subvert that omnipotent being's plans?

It is harsh, but I could accept going so far as to say you will not, under /almost/ any circumstances, save them from their own actions or choices. If you encounter the equivalent of a nuclear WWIII, you don't just step in and force them to be peaceful. However good your intentions, and however good the immediate impact, it seems likely it would only lead back to another situation where you were forced to dominate their civilization until they stopped wanting to blow each other up. And once you start to justify that sort of thing, where do you stop? At what point do you deem the planet "mature" enough to withdraw from? Can you imagine how the military and government leadership on Earth would react in such a scenario? How many generations would it take for the resentment that kind of interference would create to be completely forgotten, even if it's kept alive only in the subculture of the world's military? Now, sometimes, all of that might not be necessary; if, during the cold war, someone had gotten twitchy and launched the first nuke, and set a whole chain of MAD into action, had some unknown alien agents simply destroyed /all/ the missiles in the air, it /might/ have nipped the whole thing in the bud, given us a second chance. Or, they might simply have launched more. So that level of interference might be acceptable, in theory, but in practice, do we keep a heavily-armed, cloaked ship parked in orbit of every world that might destroy itself? That alone, if discovered, would certainly be a source of fear and resentment should it become known, and again, once you start that sort of thing, where do you stop? When do you declare a planet "safe enough" to withdraw your orbital suppression platforms?

So it's not a simple matter. There are cases where it is obviously right, and cases where it is obviously wrong, but in between, there are many cases where it is gray. Which is why I think you can't just "tweak" the prime directive into a single, better rule, but rather, it should be treated as the complex issue that it is. It should be, not a pithy phrase you can put on a plaque, but the title of lengthy book, delving into the philosophy and morality, admitting that there are no perfect answers to some questions.

**** dangit, lost my lengthy reply to an internet hiccup. Retyping...

yeah, the more I think about this idea, the more I'm liking it, and I'm thinking this is really the rational!trek story I really want to read.

I've always felt there was something off, in a pieces-don't-quite-fit way, with Spock's story. He's generally presented as being less logical and more emotional than other Vulcans, but at the same time, Vulcans are said to actually have /more/ intense emotions than humans, which contributed to their development of a culture based on emotional suppression. But if their emotions are more intense, and their control is learned, then a half-human, half-vulcan would, high-level logically if not by sound genetic theory, be less emotional, and so if raised Vulcan, have better emotional control than pure vulcans his own age. He would be a prodigy of logic, not a victim of human emotions. Further, most major vulcan characters end up being portrayed as quite clearly more motivated by emotions than they will admit, and simply maintain a calm veneer of logic while rationalizing this behavior.

Now, given that, picture a half-human spock growing up among Vulcans. He is, in fact, a prodigy in logic and emotional control, thanks to the moderating influence of his human side's less intense emotions. Whether he is known by all to be half-human or only known by certain authority figures makes little difference, I think. His peers will resent him for his perceived superiority either way; knowing his ancestry will only be a change of degree in this resentment, a point they will hang their rationalizations on if they know. Either way, their resentment will result to them finding subtle ways to provoke him. Add in some authority figures, teachers and the like, who know his ancestry and find him offensive because of it, and you've created an environment where he will be attacked, however passive-aggressively, on all sides; held to higher standards, provoked far more than his peers, and punished out of proportion for any slips. And in the face of all of this, he may well have more emotional outbursts than his peers, despite superior emotional control, which will naturally be pointed to as proof of his inferiority, weakness resulting from his hybrid ancestry. But whatever they think, he remains a prodigy in emotional control, and eventually rises above even this increased level of stress to be a model of the vulcan ideal. However, the result will still be a rational!spock surrounded by Vulcans who believe themselves to be perfectly rational but are clearly and demonstrably not. He controls his impulse to resent them, and in time even comes to genuinely be thankful for the extra stress that he has been subjected to, seeing it as the fire by which his mastery of his own mind was tempered. And this Spock, coming to meet humans for the first time as a young man, finds them no more rational than Vulcans, but more honest in their irrationality, and is drawn to Star Fleet because of this.

yeah... that's a story I'd read.

I'm not super well-versed in my Trek lore, so when did these Precursors stop doing stuff? Even if they were hanging around up to a million years ago (or if they'd left probes) they could have stacked the deck pretty heavily.

As for the Prime Directive, it seems like an at least /mostly/ reasonable rule that honestly never turned out badly for the sole reason that the plot required this to be so.

But picard violated it around 10 times, and that's only counting the times the script explicitly pointed out that he was violating it. No consequences for him, and no revisions made. Hell, even if you just stop treating it as a single, simple rule and make it a premise from which a whole complicated book of interpretation and application is drawn, with case history and precedent and the like, it would no longer bother me. It's a blanket rule with some pretty awful consequences, like "if this struggling species of intelligent, pre-warp-drive humanoids last 1000 survivors are going to die because their star is going nova, well, sucks to be them, but Prime Directive says we can't help!" and, apparently, no exceptions made except in a seek-forgiveness-afterwords kind of way.

This would be, of course, flatly impossible - or at least, as close to it as to make no odds - for two truly independently evolved species, but might be possible for two expressions of one form that grew from a common, designed genetic seed.

For a fully reasonable explanation, you probably want to extend this genetic manipulation to about 1GA in the past. This would account for the genetic similarity between humans and other creatures.

**** I don't think anyone on earth has enough understanding of genetics yet to do more than spitball a probability estimate, but it may well be impossible. I was thinking the seeds would be encoded with a large amount of "junk dna" that was actually useful recipes to facilitate their evolution, just waiting to be activated. Obviously there would be drift, and mutation, and expecting these genes to all survive billions of years of independent, unguided evolution entirely intact is a fool's game. But as a few obvious examples, a strong predisposition for developing bilateral symetry could be build into the simplest life. It was said the seeds were microorganisms; I'm imagining them being given a massive toolbox of inactive genes, with loads of redundancy, which would greatly increase the likelihood of live evolving along certain paths. Evolution would be completely free to ignore the hint, mutate all the genes into uselessness (or divergent usefulness), and blaze it's own path, but this process would take far longer, because those that happen to follow the intended path find themselves already armed with genes for overcoming evolutionary challenges just waiting to be activated. This is, of course, may well be incompatible with what is already known about the evolution of life on earth, but I'm not constraining myself in my rational!trek idea to "this could be an actual future from this point in reality," and have no objection to tweaking earth's evolutionary history within the story to be compatible with this notion. If you developed such a seed and planted it on every planet in the goldilocks zone in the entire galaxy, even if the vast majority of them went off-script at some point, a few wouldn't, and those few might develop sentient humanoids, or at least, roughly compatible biospheres (i.e., breathable air), at a far faster rate than natural evolution, meaning that a few billion years later, you would suddenly get a lot of similar humanoid races appearing within what by evolutionary terms is a pretty short timeframe, and with very little competition at the same level from non-humanoid intelligence that evolved entirely naturally or without staying roughly on the seed's planned rails.

:edit: Oh, and bear in mind with all of this, according to canon, the progenitors explored the galaxy and found themselves alone, implying that intelligent life was an incredibly rare thing to evolve entirely naturally. Honestly, that seems like motive enough to me right there for wanting to seed the future of the galaxy to produce more life before going off to whatever their version of a transhuman singularity was.

** I don't really think that Star Trek is a good setting to give the rational treatment to. Technology was never the point, at least in the best episodes; it's just a way to get people into their predicaments, mostly to examine modern social problems through the lens of some exotic setup. But in a rational treatment of the series, sensible use of the technology completely warps everything until the rest of the trappings of the series melt away - this might work if technology was ever the point in the first place, but it doesn't work for a series to be mutated so thoroughly by a background detail.

I think you'd probably get a better exploration of Star Trek's themes - modern social problems in new contexts, with an optimistic take - with something closer to near-future cyberpunk and early pre-singularity metahumans.

If you're dead set on Star Trek though, I think the only thing that can save the series is if all the homeworlds are run by FAI and most people live in a technological singularity, but nobody has found a version of fun theory that catches quite everyone, so we still have bored adventure seekers off in space.

** OP, this is an amazing idea. I have recently been watching DS9 for the first time since reading HPMOR, and it is completely ruined. The number of just boneheaded mistakes made per episode makes it almost unwatchable. Even so, I grew up with this franchise, and still love it.

A few of my personal suggestions:

- Fix the economy via basic income. The Federation is a post scarcity society that provides a basic level of existance, but anything beyond that and you need to get a paying job. The Federation gets around their "no money" rule by providing energy credits. It's not really money, it's a reallocation of reactor time!

- Pretend the Sol System is average. Much like MOR inserts a new rule of reality, you can play with habitable planets by saying that our solar system is pretty average, and most systems have an "earth like" planet.

- (Relaited to above) Pretend humans are the average. Earth like species happen to be the solution that nature tends towards. It doesn't have to be correct, just internally consistant. Delete all viable mixed species offspring, but not interspecies romance. After all... it's not unheard of here in the real world.

- Read some good military science fiction before you start writing. My personal suggestions are The Lost Fleet series (arguably the best depiction of space battles between capital ships), Odyssey One, Democracy's Right, and just for fun Wings of Steele (just the first book).

Edit: One more.

- Fix replicators by making them 3D printers that can do certain molecular manipulations. They can build a steak, but not a living cow. They can build a circuit board, but economies of scale make it cheaper to actually use a ship yard to build the /Enterprise/, and a foundry for armor plating.

** The ships would have no physical interior space. They would consist of solid computronium. Anything beamed aboard or brought in through an 'airlock' or 'hangar' would simply be converted to transporter buffer patterns which ran in appropriately shielded sandboxes and were able to interact with each other in a simulation of a ship interior (which wouldn't have to be even remotely consistent with the exterior, Euclidian space, or the laws of physics). No inertial dampers needed, too, unless to hold the ship itself together. Certainly none tuned to avoid turning the crew into strawberry wallpaper during acceleration.

The exterior designs themselves would be much more symmetrical on a vertical axis. Fewer goose-neck designs and more like the Sovereign or Constellation classes. There's also no real reason they shouldn't be rotationally symmetric to a significant degree. The only reason that could possibly work for the majority of canon Federation designs would be if the warp fields were specifically and deliberately designed to be lopsided for some reason. Even needing to land on a planet shouldn't necessarily mean nacelles way off-center from the center of mass.

A sphere is actually a /much/ better design - smaller target for a given volume/mass, a better-protected core, lower shield-power requirements. I'd like to see one with a tennis-ball curve of phaser banks. Or, given phasers appear to be able to shoot in any direction, why not use the transporter systems to plate the entire exterior surface with phasers wherever and whenever they're needed?

Physical away teams would be generated as needed, with self-contained intelligence and a permanent subspace comms link to the ship. They could, of course, be entirely human for all intents and purposes, or humanoid robots, or replicas of local sapients, or floating clouds of smart dust.

** With time travel it'd be good to have an increased risk factor. The various methods of time travel they use are pretty unpredictable so have them not always work. As a general matter, roll a 1d20 whenever they time travel, if it hits anything below 18 they all die.

For the aliens you could have a mix of common ancestor devices and evolution. Have the standard canon races like vulcans and such be humanoid but most races encountered be alien. This was done due to budget constraints, in a literary story you can ignore budgets. Likewise with the suits.

Holographic stuff and teleportation and replication should be limited- huge energy requirements, a single holodeck is a substantial portion of the ships energy expenditure, teleportation is enormously expensive in energy. The computing requirements for all should also be substantial, if your computer is figuring out firing solutions you don't want to waste power or computing time on teleportation, replication or holodecks.

On technology, stealing alien technology should be a major thing.

[[http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Vulcan_history]]

Per this timeline it might take on average several millennia for the average civilization to develop effective warp travel. Perhaps it's very non intuitive how it works and requires careful analysis of the results of increasingly powerful particle accelerators and very powerful sensory data. Humanity has an advantage with stolen alien technology and their technological advancements are based on those. The development of advanced transwarp and time travel technologies would require extensive study of wormholes and stellar engineering to build transwarp gates which for an average civilization might take more millennia of study.

Some of the principles behind these things are very simple, hypothetically. A subspace manipulator just requires precise manufacturing to an atomic scale of promethium rotating at 999.07 hertz and a flow of electricity across it at .666V. An engineer who has studied more advanced alien ships may be able to use some alien technology intuitively to do something unusual if they know that at 1432.6 hertz and 0.4242V you can get quadruple the output at the cost of a massive increase in radioactive decay.

This would mean that species like the Horta would be persona non-grata to many people, even in the oh-so-tolerant Federation.

There are so many problems opened up by the telepathy in Trek that I'm almost tempted to just throw it out completely.

But then, you could also just limit it. Say Vulcans need the physical contact to do anything. That they can only read humanoid species. Same limitations given to Betaziods, with perhaps a slight proximity bonus at the cost of detail and depth.

** I've been working through some math relating to the warp factors and the amount of energy warp travel takes. A rather efficient matter/antimatter reactor provided with 4 grams of antimatter is capable of producing 3*10^{14} joules of energy. If we say that this is the maximum output per second of a starship reactor, that needs to be approximately the energy required to travel at warp 10, which is standard top speed.

I came up with the following equation to approximate energy usage per second for different warp factors. X is the warp factor achieved. The equation output is the energy needed measured in 1*10^{13} joules.

((cos X ^ sin X)+2)X

If you graph it, you'll see there are dips, where warp travel becomes much more efficient. Normally the energy required simply increases. But at these points it decreases dramatically. The first of these is warp 6.9, which requires only 6.9/10^{13} joules. In contrast, warp 6.4 and warp 7.2 both require 14.9/10^{13} joules. The next dip is at warp 7.9, and then finally at 8.9. The next after that is at warp 13, but to get there you would have to pass warp 12, which requires 35.6*10^{13} joules, significantly beyond the output of the reactor.

What this means is that the vast majority of space travel would happen at warp 8.9. But then that begs the question of exactly how fast warp 8.9 is. For that, I made a second equation.

We know the Milky Way galaxy has an approximate radius of 50,000 light years. It can be accepted that the Alpha Quadrant would measure across at approximately that same figure. Voyager, which was stranded a grand maximum of 100,000 light years from where it started, would have taken several decades to get home. They presumably were moving in a straight line towards earth at a near-constant rate of warp 8.9, which as previously determined is the maximum energy efficient warp speed.

If the warp factor is X, and the output of the following equation is a multiple of the speed of light, then warp 8.9 is 1849 times the speed of light, which would have taken Voyager 54 years to get back to earth.

X^{X^(1/sqrt(6})+1)

If you graph that, warp 6.9 is 483.5 times lightspeed, warp 7.9 is 965.5 times lightspeed, and warp 13 would be 19,413.4 times lightspeed. Another interesting thing to note is that warp 0.9 and below are actually slower than their non-warp counterparts. Which somewhat explains why they have impulse engines as well. Not sure how sub-lightspeed warp could be exploited from a worldbuilding viewpoint. Maybe y'all could help with that.

Here's a small table of noteworthy warp factors, the lightspeed multiple they represent, and the energy output required to maintain them.

0 = 0 = 0

warp 1 = c = 2.5*10^{13}

warp 2 = 5c = 3.3*10^{13}

warp 3 = 16.7c = 7*10^{13}

warp 4 = 46c = 1.2*10^{14}

warp 5 = 111.5c = 1.5*10^{14}

warp 6 = 248c = 1.7*10^{14}

warp 7 = 519c = 7.6*10^{13}

warp 8 = 1032c = 1.6*10^{14}

warp 9 = 1969c = 1.1*10^{14}

warp 10 = 3631c = 2.9*10^{14}

warp 11 = 6504c = 3.3*10^{14}

warp 12 = 11361c = 3.5*10^{14}

warp 13 = 19413c = 1.3*10^{14}

In effect, they don't traverse the grand majority of the space between point A and point B because point B simply moves closer to the ship while point A moves farther away. NASA is actually working on building a warp drive IRL.

The implication is that nothing would be destroyed because if the ship hits anything it will simply be warped around the ship as it passes. Of course canon Trek is full of examples that break this concept. But canon Trek wasn't often consistent about much of anything.
