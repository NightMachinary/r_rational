*** I know what you're thinking, and I'd recommend against it. Notice how you can't copy text on fanfiction.net or fictionpress? It's a crude attempt at DRM.

My understanding is that the staff is a little bit insane as far as copyright is concerned. Especially considering it's /fanfiction/ for fucks sake.

Archiveofourown is a less evil ff.net, specifically created to adress fanfiction.net's problems.

I'm already providing wordpress hosting for one rationalfic writer. It's not a bad platform for publishing fiction. I'd recommend using wordpress.com unless you plan on using specific plugins for monetization. I could set you up with a free wordpress install if you wanted to use wordpress with plugins. You'd need to supply a domain name.

**** Extremely crude. It took me less than five minutes of googling and installing a firefox addon to reenable fanfiction.net's copy/select text (because I like to highlight text when reading). I had honestly forgotten that they did that.

That said, as a reader I really like archive of our own or fanfiction.net or fictionpress over wordpress, simply because it is so much simpler to convert those sites into readable .epub files for my phone compared to wordpress (where no simple, already automated solution exists that doesn't involve modifying python scripts, afaik).

**** I don't have any objection to posting a story in multiple places - after all, HPMoR itself is at both hpmor.com and at FanFiction.net.

(I already have a copy of Wordpress running blog.datapacrat.com. It should be possible to adapt it to run another sub-domain for fiction, if I wanted.)

[Edit] Also, encouraged by this story, I went ahead and tried to search the website for other good ones.

** Slow start, detailed world and plenty of rational tidbits thrown in from all side not just the protag's perspective. Best part is recognizing the posibility of gvzr geniry abg orvat vaqrsvavgr. Feel free to add RT tag in title. Also protag is a bit slow sometimes. rot13.com is your friend

*** Spoiler tags are your friends moreso, as is saying the chapter the spoiler is for in the tag.

I'll add the RT on any update posts.

Yeah, the protagonist can be a little slow, but that's half the fun of reading a mystery, being able to put the clues together before the protagonist does.

** From the author's user page:

#+begin_quote
  Mother of Learning Next Chapter Target Date: 22nd of June, 2014

  - break -

  Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

  Not even close to the end. The story basically has 3 arcs, and we're only getting close to the end of the first one. I'm really going to have to speed up the pace if I want to finish the story in anything resembling a reasonable time-frame.
#+end_quote

My, it looks like this one is in to be nice and wonderfully long, if slowly updating.

***** How are you supposed to judge if a story is worth trying without a summary? It's the author's judgement call to make whether to put any kind of spoilers in the summary.

Edit: Also, if the author doesn't consider something a spoiler, it's impossible to avoid it by blocking the summary. They could put it in author's notes at the beginning, or, heck, even in the title.

****** I don't block the summary in the fiction search engines, but I usually find the ones I want to read through other sources; that tends to work out without too much telling. I've found the the author's notes and the titles usually don't spoil as much as the summary does.

(In this specific case, I found it spoilery because it felt like a riddle to be solved in the very beginning of the story.)

*** Not much longer. The author usually has a target update date up on his profile page, currently aiming for the 22nd. He's been pretty good at keeping to a ~1, never less than 2 month interval schedule for the last year.

Warning, there are a few minor spoilers of recent chapters on that page.

** The rain barrier spell seems to be inconsistent. If it can move puddles out of the way it should probably remove a lot of surface moisture when you cross through it, drying you out.

*** Heh, the inconsistency was noted the first time Zorian interacted with one.

I'm willing to bet it's an issue of that universe's "weak innate magic protection" trope at work, the ward is keyed to water pure enough to be rain, but intentionally gives a wide berth to people.

Seems like it would be easy to hack the personal rain barrier to use less mana by more specifically targeting it at pure water, if I'm understanding this magic system correctly.
