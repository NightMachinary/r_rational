** What about this story makes it rational? I wasn't overly impressed reading through the first couple of chapters but I also didn't follow sailor moon so maybe I am missing something.

*** Lots of clever munchkinry used to beat much-stronger enemies (in the well-written way where the enemies' strength actually feels pertinent and threatening, not the "munchkin stompfest against nominally-stronger enemies with no narrative weight" failure mode that a lot of stories have). Lots of well-executed good-versus-good conflicts wherein all involved parties are well-intentioned but either place differing weights on particular tradeoffs or are unable to trust one another due to epistemological issues. Also does a bunch of good worldbuilding, both on the "fleshing out the Dungeon Keeper universe" front and on the "fusing it in interesting ways with the Sailor Moon universe" front.

**** I don't think that's enough to make it rationalist. In particular she uses the system and thinks about how to use it more efficiently but she doesn't question it, for example the sapphire-gold-aluminium oxide-sapphire cycle is made but no questioning of why gold and sapphire are valuable in the way they are or why no other power appears to have used it, including ones that have the power and knowledge to do so. In addition the munchkin stompfest definitely happens, the author gets better at it over the course of the story but the effects are still felt to the current part. Really what redeems it for me is how when she touched the molten adamantium and had a test of guilt the main thing is how she realised that she shouldn't have invaded the dwarves like that, even if you have power and cause to do something doesn't mean you should.

***** I never claimed that it was rationalist, just that it was rational.

But, assuming you meant to claim that it wasn't rational, I disagree. It's pretty common in rational stories for the characters to take the known rules of magic as brute fact and work within them without worrying about why they're the specific way they are rather than some other way. There exist some exceptions, sure, but I feel like claiming that being-an-exception is necessary for a story to count as rational will lead you to an excessively narrow picture of what exactly ratfic is.

*** The best way to do it is to read the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][story only thread]], which contains every chapter in non-confusing linear order from the first to the most recent, including the ones which were previously hosted elsewhere in more-confusing order.

***** The Anime Addventure format was deliberately designed so that anyone can take an un-used prompt and start adding at any point in the story, creating a new branch for the story to go off of. The good news is that the author Pusakuronu has written an unbroken, un-branching story that has been re-posted to a forum and can be read like a traditional narrative.

** I'm surprised Ami hasn't developed an instant sleep spell for herself yet. She already has the instant grow spell for plants based on necromantic time acceleration, so why can't she use a similar spell on herself to speed through 8 hours of sleep in an instant?

**** #+begin_quote
  To accomplish something similar for a pseudo-sleep spell, Ami would need a specialized medical setup. She'd need something to oxygenate her blood /and/ remove the carbon dioxide, and /fast./ Probably without ever actually moving it all through her lungs either, since even with her heart pumping faster, there's probably some hard hydraulic limitations on how fast liquid can move through tight spaces...
#+end_quote

Then how do the plants do it? Plants too need to "breathe", in the sense of absorbing air. The leaves may be fine because they produce oxygen, but the rest of the plant needs to absorb oxygen or it dies. A similar issue arises for water: plants don't have blood, but they still need water to live. So when a plant is accelerated, liquid has to move FAST from the roots to the leaves through tight spaces otherwise the plant dies.
