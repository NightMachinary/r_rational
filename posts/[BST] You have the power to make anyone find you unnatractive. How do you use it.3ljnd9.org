*** I think this is the best answer so far, and also the explanation for why "can't you do that anyway by doing something gross" isn't an answer. The difference between making yourself unattractive this way and just doing something gross is that someone who finds you unattractive because of this power can't communicate why they find you unattractive; as far as everyone else is concerned, you are just being victimized for no reason. And appearing to be an unjustified victim can be useful.

*** Could be a variant on "Plateau Eyes" in Niven's "A Gift From Earth". Basically, it was a psychic power that made people lose interest in you. They forgot you were there. This one is like a weaker version.

Niven came up with a kind of hokey superficially plausible mechanism for it, involving contracting the target's pupil triggering a conditioned response because when you are less interested in something your pupil contracts. The logic doesn't really work, but the character in the book who came up with it wasn't a scientist.

Anyway, it was purely line of sight. People had to see you to lose interest in you. That would be a cromulent mechanism for this.

** Okay. So first of all - I assume that by default the person is attractive, otherwise it's not a power, just an unfortunate situation.

Another point - if you can use this power on everybody around you all the time, that means you can be unattractive and suddenly become attractive.

Where switching between attractive/unattractive modes could be useful?

- Obvious one, you could prevent yourself from being raped.
- You could make people underestimate you, and when necessary - suddenly become attractive. (can't think of an example where it could be useful)
- Does unattractiveness work by magic feromones, or by changing your appearance? If it changes your appearance - you could have a great disguise, like a second body. For example you could commit a crime as an ugly person, and evade police as long as you want as an attractive one.

That's all I've got for now....

***** I think most rapists are actually people known to the victim, and it's believed they're usually motivated by power dynamics - putting someone in their place and all that - although it's certainly not /always/ the case.

It would certainly prevent /unwanted romantic attention/, from someone you don't like who won't stop hitting on you to someone who keeps trying to cop a feel. Assuming they're not trying to put on some sort of show to prove how libidinous they are to the crowd, which happens.

****** Rape is more about power than attraction. That's a fact. That being said, serial rapists who rape randomly, should, logically speaking, choose to rape attractive targets over unattractive targets. There has to be something about you that makes them want to rape you. I don't think any serial rapist wants to rape someone ugly. On /average/. People that commit rape do so for a variety of reasons, so it's hard to say that for every single rapist. But, in general, it seems logical to assume rapists would go for attractive vs. non-attractive. Especially if this power worked very well.

** I would use it to power a civilization of infinitely immortal beings!

The human brain is a mesh of neurons and synapses firing, right? If someone's opinion changes, that must entail some sort of new pattern of neurons and synapses firing. The prompt implies that no outside stimulus changes, so the only way I can see this working is if I caused a neuron (or neurons) to fire that wouldn't have otherwise. Which I believe implies I created energy out of nowhere.

So how do I power an entire civilization for eternity? Because I consider a "person" to simply be an information process. If that information process runs on a silicon computer (or some furuistic-y replacement) instead of a mushy carbon one, I still consider it a person. Soooo, if that mind happens to run on a computer that ran on a bajillon (Totally Scientific ^{TM} ) Gigawatts, that would mean the virtual neuron I caused to fire would produce a massive amount of energy.

BAM, true immortality via the (literal) power of our feelings!

** Assuming that it doesn't change your appearance in any way, and simply changes how people react to your appearance...

You could use it to:

- avoid unwanted social interaction

Aaand that's about it. I'm not making any assumptions about default appearance, only that this power just makes people find you less attractive than they normally would.

Being ugly doesn't affect the world in any real way, except one thing: it makes a lot of other people instinctively want to avoid interacting with you. If they're polite enough, there isn't even that much of a difference; and if you can do something really well, the respect they gain for you makes up for being unattractive, for a lot of people.

This means you can only exploit it if you /want/ to avoid social interaction with people.

However, this has applications.

See, if you do something annoying or infuriating, being ugly makes people react that much worse to you.

So what you can do is associate yourself with something or someone you dislike, but others don't; then, you can do mildly annoying and/or infuriating things to turn people against you, and them by extension.

You can use this to get out of being raped. You can use this to make people leave you alone.

You can even use this to attract attention, depending on how unattractive you can make yourself seem. Especially unattractive people draw attention to themselves.

Really, that's about it. That's all I got.
