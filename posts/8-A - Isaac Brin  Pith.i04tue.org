** Damn, Isaac Brin is a paranoid panic attack in the rough shape of a person. I suppose it makes sense why he has views so conservative he openly advocates for mindwiping all the Humdrums in the world when /that's/ how he looks at the world.

Also...

  Like Anabelle Gage, even though she didn't trust him and he underpaid her to leverage her, an act that made his stomach twinge with guilt.
#+end_quote

Just in case anyone was still actually wondering about that. It's nice to have this confirmed, even if we all basically knew it already.

**** I actually feel like this chapter was an interesting exploration of 'what's a well calibrated level of paranoia'. Because the only reason that he wasn't taken over is that he has some level of paranoia and yet he struggles with finding an appropriate level.

***** My impression was that his level of paranoia was just barely sufficient for the threat he faced (he very nearly didn't catch it), but also that it's crippling overkill when it comes to other parts of his life. So it's less about finding the right level and more about being able to vary it between situations?

Or he just has to deal with so much subterfuge that he actually has to pick between functional but vulnerable and safe but...well.

****** I think there is no level of paranoia that's correct for all situations unfortunately, constant vigilance is required for his job and country but will ruin his life and family. it seems like that's just how it has to be.

*** You kind of start to sympathize with his fascist worldview when you realize how much effort foreign countries are pouring into toppling the government and throw everything into civil war.

Of course, part of the reason they're doing that is in response to the Dominion's own genocidal imperialism, but that's why they call it a cycle of violence.

**** Ok this might be totally, completely wrong but if the Pyre Witch's real vocation is a whisper one involving mass memory modification then that could neatly explain the scene with the Broadcast King and a few other things. But I'm just pattern-matching here since in other rational fics, when a character is too powerful in too many varied ways, and the described magic system makes that implausible, it usually turns out to be some kind of perceptual modification -- "I notice I am confused" and all.

** Just noting down the possible meta-references to other fiction I saw for fun, since I've noticed rational fic writers leave them in as a reward to readers.

- The Whisper vocation control thing seemed like it was referencing HJPEV in HPMOR's idea of using the Imperius to control the entire Ministry.

- I thought the rising sea and exponentiality might be referring to AI, especially with Brin's commentary on how nobody else was paying attention, since that's a common theme - probably a longshot.

- Guessing the bird-control network is referencing Taylor's power in Worm, and/or the kid in Ward who got a split-off shard that allowed him to control birds, forgot what his name was.

- Eye of Makara seems like it's referencing Bayesian analysis, I've always thought this would be a cool ability.

Other stuff: I went back and reread the first arc and although you started from a pretty high point, I feel like you've really quickly improved? Which I guess isn't surprising because writing a webfic on a tight schedule and getting comments every 1/2 weeks creates a nice feedback loop. It's not in a way I can pinpoint, everything just flows better and the chapters are hooking my attention more (although that could just be me becoming more and more invested). Every single side-character chapter has been really compelling. When Pith is wrapped up, if you did a write-up, maybe describing stuff like what your process as a writer is, the challenges you encountered, some things in the text nobody managed to pick up on, etc. etc. I would be super interested in that and I think other readers would too? I haven't seen a lot of other authors here do that but it would be cool. Unless you want to avoid giving away trade secrets

*** I think you're reaching pretty hard with most of these. The idea of mind controlling the government, for example, is probably the most obvious threat there is if you know that mind control exists, no need for another story to tell you that. And the rising sea, if it is intended to reference or parallel something else, seems much more obvious a metaphor for... rising sea levels. Like, that's a thing that the real world is dealing with, and it's a much more clear and obvious connection than vague concerns about AI.

Not everything is a reference, and it's possible for multiple people to arrive at the same idea independently. I think it's generally best to assume that's what happened unless given specific reason to believe otherwise.

**** Yeah, the "rising sea" part gave me more of a "Battle Royale" feel, where as the arena gets tighter, violence becomes more frequent and intense.

(you could also draw global warming parallels if you want the easy metaphor)
