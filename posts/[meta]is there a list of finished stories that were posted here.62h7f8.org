*** I've been cataloguing every short story every posted here as a post so I could make an anthology of sorts. Maybe "Snippets of a More Rational World"?

It's not done, but once I think I've covered every short story ever written on [[/r/rational]], I'll make a post asking about the legality of redistributing what others have posted here as a simple, free epub. Considering the writers in question are all commenters on this subreddit, I can be really sure by asking the authors.

***** No I record those separately, I mean when people directly post some story to the subreddit that they have written. You can see some of them if you look at the most upvoted posts.

**** That's because the original site where [[http://freetexthost.com/ikucx6nse4][Nonlinear Regression]] was hosted doesn't have the story anymore, but if you go to the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160908221217/http://freetexthost.com/ikucx6nse4][Wayback Archive]], you can still read the story.
