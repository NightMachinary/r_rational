** I love how perfectly this story properly represents this subreddit. You have a time loop as an advantage, but so do your enemies, so each character acts as their own entity, and you get really interesting conflicts.

Munchkining does not work out great if both people are doing it. If your plan relies on taking advantage of a "super obvious weakness" then it probably is not a real weakness and your plan probably will not work.

No sign of Silverlake is concerning. Is there any risk of RR/SL trying to break out the primordial early/setting things in motion before the invasion? I'm not sure whether the dimensional magic boost provided by the planar alignment is a requirement for that.

It was mentioned in 91 that the gate would be even better than shifter children for connecting to Panaxeth, it's just A. the cultists/QI don't know about it and B. Divine artifacts are notoriously difficult to analyze. But Silverlake and RR know what it is and where/how to get it!

**** I think this would likely require the key, which is currently scattered around the world and in the hands of some very dangerous creatures, it's possible that RR knows all of these places as he managed to leave the loop, but it's also possible that he never had to unlock the gate as it wasn't barred when he went in. This would mean going to Koth, fighting princess breaking into the Eldermarian royal volt, beating up or convincing QI out of his crown, and raiding the demon wasps.

There are of course easy ways to do a few of these but I don't think RR and SL have access to them, the angels could have visited the wasps and told them the loop is over, which makes getting the ring /hell/, they may not know how to use the dagger in the orb, I don't know if Z&Z made that info public, and they don't have Zorian's skill at Mind magic to shunt QI out of his body.

They may not need them, but their is no reason to assume that everything will go well for them, especially because they are suspicious unstable psciopaths who almost certainly don't trust each other.

***** You don't need the key to use the Sovereign Gate to connect to Panaxeth, just to unlock it as a portal to reality when inside the gate.

Panaxeth is directly attached to the thing, and if you need to open the gate to get at him, then it's useless because only The Maker and his Agents can activate it and thus open the gate to the inside, as they did for Zack.

Point is, there's no need for RR to get the key.

My point isn't that this would be the only obstacle, just that they will be facing obstacles of their own with their tasks, no matter what they are, they have to try and guess what Z&Z are doing at any moment as well, though SL has a better idea of it than RR.

It's also distinctly possible that they aren't working together.

He didn't need to collect the entire key to unbar the path. And he would most likely not hesitate to sacrifice dozens of lives in a ritual in order to gain soul sight, even if he somehow failed to find an alternative method to obtain it like Zorian did. So why do you think that he has any idea of the location of any of the artifacts other than the crown and the dagger, or that he has a method of traveling inter-continental distances like Zorian?

Even if Z&Z never trusted her with the information directly (unlikely, as they would not have been able to keep her cooperation if they appeared to be shutting her out of important conversations) and she never participated in any of the recovery quests, it would have still been impractical to completely obscure when in each loop Z&Z begin having each pieces and what resources they take with them with and where they go just before that point.

  However, the cult leaders would ultimately see the light when Zach and Zorian showed them the Sovereign Gate. They did not explain to the cultists what the object exactly did, but they did tell them it was a divine artifact that contained some of the essence of Panaxeth itself... and could thus be used as a key to open Panaxeth's prison. A much better key than the shifter blood essence they originally planned to use for the purpose, too.

  Though their description was deceptive, the basic facts were entirely true -- *within the reality of the time loop*, the Sovereign Gate could very much be used as a key to open Panaxeth's prison. In fact, using the Sovereign Gate was the key part of their plan to exit the time loop. This had been true while they had Silverlake's cooperation and it was true now.

******** The Sovereign gate had contingencies such that if a primordial was freed inside of it, that iteration would be destroyed and a new one made. We've seen this happen, in Ch 52:

#+begin_quote
  Above the Hole, and presumably on the inside of it, space shuddered and writhed, distorting everything like hot summer air. Slowly, jagged black threads started rising into the air from the depths, zig-zagging through the air and occasionally forking offshoots.

  They were cracks, Zorian realized. Reality was breaking.

  Suddenly, a huge volume of space in the center of the cracks simply... caved in, creating a pitch black hole that hung in the air. Something huge and dark brown, like a hand studded with mouths and eyes, shot out of the rip in space, but Zorian didn't have time to study it much. Without any prompting from him, the marker on his soul suddenly activated and everything went black.

  He woke up in his bed in Cirin, with Kirielle wishing him a good morning.

So Panaxeth has been freed inside the loop (the usual way with the shifter children, not using the Sovereign Gate, but the result would have been the same), but it didn't help him at all in the end.

RR probably never reproduced that particular think tank. He would have lacked the motivation to do so (already had a viable plan he just needed to optimize in the ritual), several of the skills Z&Z used to make it happen (notably the mind magic, and dimensionalism skills to turn the orb into a black room), and the background research much of which was done by people we have no reason to believe RR ever met.

*** I think I figured it out. The first time, he stayed in Ibery's compartment to whole ride, was joined by an annoying group of girls, started heading for the nearest exit as the train neared the station, and met this girl there who said pretty much the same things she did this time.

The next month, when the train got to Korsa and he knew the giggly girls were going to get on, he left for a different compartment and so didn't end up near that girl when he went to the exit. The next time he tried finding a compartment he knew would be empty, but found that if he sat there to start with, Bryn would join him. So after that his usual routine was to either start in Ibery's compartment and leave for a different one at Korsa, or start in the other compartment so Bryn would distract Kirielle.

This latest month is, I think, the only time he's been in Ibery's compartment all the way to Cyoria since that first month.

** By the way, someone in spacebattlesforums came up with a pretty consistent theory regarding RR. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mother-of-learning-discussion-thread.349206/page-109#post-52987276][Link]] and transcript:

#+begin_quote
  After a few years away from the story, I just did a full reread over the course of two days. It's been a fun couple of days.\\
  My big thing to near-necro the thread for? I think I may have figured out the identity of Red Robe. Strap in, this is going to be a wild ride. I'll try not to sound like a conspiracy theorist. If you don't want spoilers, I don't know what the hell you're doing here at the end of the discussion thread. Go read the story.\\
  My theory rests upon a central point: Veyers was possessed by another soul before the loop even began.\\
  There is some evidence that points to this. He underwent a ritual to fix an inherited power, and came out the other side with new power, a tendency for wild mood swings, and a loss of control of his magic much akin to a recent large modification to his soul, much like the difficulties Zorian has a simulacrum entirely devoted to keeping under wraps in the recent chapters.\\
  Based upon the nature of the ritual (his inherited power), I believe it likely, but not guaranteed, for this soul to be an ancestor of Veyers. Possibly a soul who had been part of the house wards, much like Murder Mansion. I'll be referring to him as Ancestor from here on.\\
  Everything from hereon assumes this is true, and some later events add supporting evidence without directly corroborating it.\\
  This possession would mean that there were two souls in Veyers's body when the loop was created and they were recreated the exact same way. Eventually, Zach's habit of trying to convince a large number of different people that he is a time traveller bites him in the ass when Ancestor takes advantage of him to find a way to join the time loop. It's likely that Skeletor was involved at this stage for the required manipulation of the temporary marker.\\
  However, something goes wrong for Ancestor. He's possessing Veyers, and the mark is applied to either Veyers alone, who he must piggyback off of in order to loop, or to the both of them as a "conjoined" soul. I believe /something/ must have gone wrong for Ancestor, otherwise soul-killing Veyers would not have been necessary.\\
  Let me explain that thought. Veyers wasn't anyone incredibly special. He's a minor noble with attitude and inheritance problems. He's no insurmountable obstacle, like the soulkill spell was originally intended for. Veyers must have been looping in order for soulkilling him to have been necessary. Otherwise, killing him and letting the loop take care of any problems and knowledge he had or was cause of would have sufficed.\\
  Enter the primordial's offer: He specifically offers to create a body for someone outside of the loop for them to take in exchange for his release. They'll die if he is not released. This provides two-fold motivation for Ancestor as Red Robe's obsessive perfection of the invasion: Both his literal resurrection and his escape from the time loop rely upon it.\\
  Ancestor as Red Robe also explains Red Robe's unusual surprise at a mage with firearms-- he'd literally be from a time where that was unthinkable.\\
  Ancestor not having full possession of his control marker also explains why Veyers was soul-killed when, or perhaps well before, Red Robe left. If he left Veyers's body before leaving the loop so he could get a body of his own, then the control marker might have been left behind on Veyers. In that case, /not/ soul-killing Veyers would mean he would leave a looper behind with full knowledge of his identity, possible weaknesses and nature, a massive grudge to nurse, and years to prepare to unleash a holy asskicking on him, should he also find a way to leave the loop---or take a suicide deal with the primordial.\\
  The main reason I believe this theory is true, or something close to it, is it's the only reasonable explanation I can think of for:\\
  A) So much evidence to point towards Veyers-as-Red Robe.\\
  B) Veyers definitively not being the culprit due to Soulkill.\\
  C) Someone going out of their way to Soulkill someone as seemingly unimportant as Veyers. If it was ever a common solution to a problem, there'd be way more of them popping up.\\
  Apologies if I've explained my thoughts on this poorly. I'm a bit lacking on sleep after marathon'ing the story for the last two days.

**** Ok, time has been applied. There are multiple members of House Boranova with an ignited bloodline at the same time. We know this because it was unplanned that Veyers's father died without igniting his bloodline, and it this doesn't make sense if doing so made the previous ignited person somehow lose their powers. So, how would that work? Is there more than one Ancestor? If so, why do they all seem to give the exact same ability?

Also, no matter whose soul the marker goes on, how can soul-killing Veyers be necessary? If he does that, he has no body. That sounds like strictly a loss to me. Panaxeth can make a new body for someone outside of the time loop, sure, but we have no evidence he could do that for someone inside, at the start of every loop. And if they could just hop into a different body, why have they been limiting themselves to those that go through the ignition ritual? The way I see this playing out, he keeps Veyers's body alive until he reaches the Sovereign Gate and is about to exit, at which point he has no reason to soul-kill Veyers because he thinks the loop reality is about to be shut down anyway.

Edit, one more thing: All ignited members of House Boranova have slitted orange eyes. Briam's fire drake has slitted yellow eyes. This seems like too much of a coincidence for the explanation to actually be some sort of soul thing. I think the bloodline most likely came from an enhancement ritual involving a fire drake or other similar creature.

That being said, I don't think Veyers's loss of control over his magic is akin to soul damage. Every time we've seen soul damage, it caused an inability to cast spells without harming oneself, but Veyers is casting spells even when he doesn't mean to.

*** Having another continent you can get to instantly, that your opponent can't is never a bad idea. It also contains a strong seat of power that's aligned with his brother and the imperial orb. Getting through the gates is essentially their key to having access to the entire planet instead of the small fraction of it they can teleport to quickly.

Also, I'm of the opinion that the angels are already very much aware of what's going on. They wouldn't have told Xlotic to give up their ring otherwise. The time loop was intentionally started early, with at least the angels knowledge if not by their hands. Presumably it occurring just before the time when a primordial prison was going to be opened is intentional, to raise a force capable of preventing it.

As to why the others haven't been brought in yet, it's still the first day. It's possible that messengers have already been sent and haven't been mentioned, for brevity, and the other party simply hasn't acted yet. Most of the other characters take several days or even weeks to come around. Another possiblity is that all of Zorian and Zach's simulacra are currently focused on amassing resources and attacking the most critical enemy power bases before they have time to move. As discussed, the other members won't be willing to act decisively immediately.

Edit: I'd also like to think that Nobody is purposely putting off showing the other characters, because one of them is actually Red Robe. I think that'd be a neat twist. It's probably not the case, but I think it would make for some interesting drama.

** At the end of the chapter Zorian is talking about a big advantage, all they have to do is notify the authorities and the enemy plans are in trouble. Since thats obviously a major problem for the invaders, and would remove a lot stress from the month. We know that won't work in Zach and Zorians favor. So we have to ask. Why? Why won't the authorities help as Zach and Zorian think they will. Is it just that they won't be able to convince Alanic without the loop being ongoing and the spiritual plane being cut off? He is important as he is usually the one that gets the authorities involved. Or maybe Silver Lake has already killed him? Really since he was so important he should have been higher priority for Zach/Zorian. That said I don't think thats the reason it won't work out.

​

I think the problem lies with Red Robe. All the times Zorian involved the authorities in stopping the invasion was after Red Robe left the time loop. Because of this, its hard to predict what power Red Robe will have in being able to stop the authorities from getting involved. Which ties into my main theory.

​

Red Robe is a member of the Monarchy. This gives him excellent position to not only prevent the authorities from listening to zorian but perhaps the ability to make Zorian and Zach outlaws should they try to "stir up trouble." Plus if he comes out to discredit them, they will have a much harder time getting support from their typical allies (Xvim and Alanic).

​

My theory is based upon the fact that Red Robe has the dagger and uses it to soulkill with. It is located in the treasury of the royal family. No one else could get it without causing an uproar. In the restarts when Zach and Zorian just attempted to break in to the treasury it made national news and started a manhunt that would chase them all over with the divine tracker. I think had redrobe gotten the lich to help him take the dagger we would have heard about it. Further red robe didn't have an easy way to teleporting to another continent like Zach/Zorian did so he would have been harassed by the authorities trying to get it back. The easiest way to avoid this problem is if he could simply walk into the treasury and take the dagger and walk out with it.

​

Now for some wilder speculation:

​

I also think its possible that Zach tried to involve the royals near the start in the time loop. The royals were friendly with Zach's family and stole his families artifacts and we know they were interested in the sovereign gate as they were having it studied by their researchers. Since they get involved at the start. They can order the people in the research facility to help zach figure it out and figure out how to bring more people into the loop and modify markers etc. Its possible they could have even played a role in getting it activated.

​

Even more wilder speculation. Maybe that's how Zach got pulled into the time loop to begin with? My thought is his soul marker is part of his bloodline. And they couldn't get the gate to work and in the summer between school years they had Zach working with the researchers trying to get it to work. I'm just trying to remember if the time researchers ever saw Zach's real face. Usually he had disguises on. If that latter part of the theory was right they would recognize Zach if they saw him.

There is also the fact that Zach is something of a public figure, and I doubt Zach would not have had someone remark on him constantly vanishing for periods during the couple months before the time loop after having looped for about for 35 years(I think.

Yeah, this seems like the most obvious course of action. Enough hints and tips given to the right people could easily create an environment where any sort of plan to free Parthanax is at least in the short term, totally unworkable, due to heightened security and paranoia.

Zorian wouldn't even have to work too hard at it - as a mind mage he could easily just edit the memory of the information into people most likely to do the most harm and leave himself out of it.

** So this is now two updates in a row with Silverlake seemingly not having done anything to help Red Robe. It almost feels like the author is setting up a reveal that she /didn't/ make it out of the loop, but that would be kind of anti-climatic. I think this is a red-herring.

Here's my thought instead: She's out, but she isn't working with Red Robe. She's off doing her goals her own way, and she'll show up at the last minute with some completely convoluted plan that no one was expecting. What would this mean? /Red Robe, hypothetically, still might not know who Zorian is./ In their last in-loop encounter, Zorian was careful not to leave a body, and then Red Robe apparently departed without searching him out. Outside the loop, Red Robe attacked Zach immediately, but didn't go after the less-defended Zorian. Combine that with the fact that Zorian has accidentally set things up such that he's going to blend in at school more than he does in the average reset (the non-dupe is the one going to school, and he's keeping his magic use low for various reasons), and we might have a scenario where the first one to discover the other's identity is going to "win".

** Good, Zorian rescues Notchka's bike! That's honestly one of the details I was most concerned about, since I knew it was coming soon. I half-expected him to get it without Kirielle so Kana would end up happier, but this way works too. And Notchka and Rea are conveniently outed as shifters so Zorian won't have to pretend so hard, as a bonus.

Now all that remains is to see if he's careful not to be so nice to Kirielle that she thinks he's been replaced. Plus the whole Red Robe and Silverlake thing, I guess.

After rereading the whole thing yet again for the 6th time or so, I've concluded that Original!Silverlake is probably safe since she was already good at soul magic and loop!Silverlake won't be much better, at least not by enough to force her out of her body (without resorting to some sort of trickery, anyway), and also because Silverlake was mentioned as one of the few temporary loopers who would probably be fine with leaving their old life alone. I don't know how easy it would be for Silverlake to just take someone else's body either, since there's been mention of rejection issues that normally plague possession attempts. Of course, if anyone can overcome that, it's probably her. But anyways, because of all this, I've concluded there's a non-negligible chance Silverlake will actually try to release the primordial.

Quatach Ichl previously had little idea how it could be done, but as he given complete research note he accomplished it in less than 2 weeks *(!)* That implied that he had experience so rich he could understand everything in a single read.

Xvim wouldn't be that hard to kill if he had not practiced his plethora defense magic for years.

Without experience, archmage is not that good. Zorian had about a decade experience with his mind magic, you can safely multiply it to 3 decades worth since he often used it in life-or-death situation. That makes him unparalleled in mind magic (like Silverlake in alchemy). But what about his warding expertise or his dimensionalism expertise? Those are only backed by less than a decade experience.

I regret to inform you that Zorian has referred to himself as a skilled archmage many times, not just an idle thought at the beginning of the story. If you want to bring the real world into it 20 years is more than enough time to be considered an expert in a discipline but it's not the real world so that's beside the point. At this point the only two mages we know for sure are better than Zorian are Zach and QI. He's shown expert level skill in many magical disciplines throughout the story and the only mage that consistently outdoes him is a 1000 year old lich. He can even use Xvim's defensive techniques to the level of skill where he casually backhands extremely dangerous magic projectiles which when first introduced shocks QI. Sure QI is a better mage, he's 1000 years old and he's the most skilled archmage in the story by far as a result. Despite this Zorian can fight him. You can't fight someone like that with some tricks, Zorian would have to have a deep understanding of the many magics he uses in such a fight, anything less would get him killed. That's not really your argument though. Your argument as far as I can tell is that you seem to think that such ridiculous growth would not be possible in the real world so he must be merely a trickster neophyte with no real knowledge. Sorry to say that's not backed up by the story at all and it doesn't really matter what you think is possible in the real world, This is literally magic we are talking about. The author goes out of his way to spell out through Zorian's narration and the various characters reactions to his ridiculous skill that he is an archmage among archmages.

*********** Oh gee, this gonna be long. It's going to be nerd-geek distinction argument, which is pretty worthless. Please do read on only if you have inclination for a reconciliation.

I'll start with a retrace. You said 20 years is enough to be considered an expert in real life. Heck I would even say a single decade is enough. My mantra (LOL mantra), "A single year of solving real-world problem makes you decent, a decade of facing ever-changing problem makes you an expert."

But I said Zorian has *less* than a decade worth of experience in magical field other than mind-magic. Didn't he lived around 12-13 years in the loop? (6 years by ch 66). So, if Xvim definition of archmage to be heeded, which is more or less "outdo a specialist in their own field," Zorian had only exceed specialist in mind-magic field. He's equal to the specialists in others. Well, I missed spell formula which I suppose worth two or three decades of experience (same "life-or-death situation as multiplier" argument). I admit I was mistaken on that part. This correction, as the result, makes Zorian had 2 field that exceed specialist. He's a definitely an archmage. But our point of contention is never whether or not Zorian is an archmage. It was whether or not Zorian placed among the top. I said he's a fledgling, you said he's maybe at the top 5.

The word of neophyte to refer Zorian seemed to ruffle your fur. I stressed you must consider when he said the "made other archmage jealous" notion. I said he was still a regular 3rd year student, his world view is not accurate in the slightest. Yet, you ignored this. Why? On one hand I started to think that you take everything stated in the story at face value (mark of fanaticism), on the other hand, I might be mistaken in my initial believe (because you said you're not a fanatic). So I retraced.

Turns out, that notion was stated by Zorian when he reunited with Zach, ch 53. Clearly I was mistaken. I first thought he said that when he witness Zach fighting Lich, before he started looping. Turn out what he said at the time was "throwing spells like throwing candy," more or less. So I give you that, Zorian is not a neophyte.

But even at that time, had Zorian already had accurate view on what an archmage can do? Let's note his dimensionalism skill. He hadn't able to cast a gate spell. He was not even aware the micro-gate spell (first witnessed it when he's under Xvim 'serious' tutelage). By the time he already mastered gate spell, he still can't cast the micro-gate spell (note his remark about Quatach Ichl micro-gate when they raided royal treasury). See? This explain all my skepticism. The magical field in MoL is deep. Even when he's perfectly capable of doing something (that chapter 53 again), there's still many thing hidden from his understanding. Even at the field he seriously pursue. That's why I said he's a fledgling. A fledgling among the archmages is powerful no doubt. But let's not hastily note that powerfulness as a top 5 or something.

On that note I would like to bring this to your attention, Quatach Ichl may had lived for a thousand years. But did he spend that thousand years finding ever-different problem to hone his expertise? Indeed, I'm a skeptic idiot.

** Was it stated whether there are high ranking cult members that have children in the age range of Veyers? If they had, they would be good suspects for Red Robe as it would explain:

- Their fast accress to a red robe
- Zorian not noticing anything unusal when scanning the minds of the members themself
- The height of red robe
- If they were in a parallel class of Zach he would have told them about the time loop. Or maybe they only knew Zach through Veyers. That would explain why only Veyers is missing from Zachs memory

*** Do you have any evidence for this? The things Red Robe has been doing (attacking Zach, attacking the aranea, defending the cranium rats, evacuating Jornak, Veyers, and cultists and getting them to change their warding schemes) all seem compatible with planning an invasion. From his perspective, what's the cost of trying? Even if it ultimately fails, it gives Zach and Zorian something to think about other than just keeping the primordial contained. At worst it exposes his identity, but I don't think he considers that likely.

***** I see. I agree he's definitely going to try something else as well, but I still think you're underestimating how much even a failed invasion helps Red Robe. This is a game of choosing the right priorities because of time constraints, and I believe stopping the invasion will take more effort from Zach and Zorian than it costs Red Robe, even if they get the government's help. Plus, I don't think it's actually guaranteed to fail, from RR's perspective. We know the cultists can attack and release the primordial on an unexpected date, they'll have demons, and the city tends to underprepare even when informed. Really, if it weren't for narrative reasons, it could go either way. As for Red Robe's main priority of releasing Panaxeth, the biggest weakness I see is that the summoning must take place at a particular location already known to Zach and Zorian. He can't just move it, so he needs to defend it, and having most of Cyoria's defenders stopping the invasion instead of the summoning seems like a good start. The only other thing I can think of would be to perform the summoning before starting the invasion, but that sort of thing is hard to hide, which is why they normally do it during the invasion in the first place. As for clearly not trying, I think that's just what RR being cautious looks like, unless I missed something.

Edit: I think I underestimated the chance of ZZ actually getting the full might of Eldemar to help, and also had forgotten about the last few paragraphs in this chapter.

** On the changes in the real world compared to the time loop Soriano hit on some good ideas at the start simulacrum so are not exact compiles and tend to diverge, the initial copy of the world wasn't perfect with small changes in people that may mean conversations are a little different. With subsequent restarts the world is copied perfectly. As noted there were several things wrong with the start of the simulation such as wrong start of time for the loop.

At least, that's what Zorian was thinking about this chapter. We know Red Robe can't be a simulacrum because those don't have their own soul, which RR would need to get a marker.

This is unlikely because Silverlake doesn't need nor it is her MO to put her in such close proximity to Zorian, well, ever. She can scry from afar. She probably just monitored some key places, like her own house. Zorian's simulacrum went there, boom, she knows Zorian escaped.

  Zorian picked up his bag and went to stand by the exit. The idea was to be among the first to disembark, and thus avoid the usual crowding that always occurred once they got to Cyoria, but he was too late -- there was already a crowd at the exit when he approached. He leaned on the nearby window and waited, listening to animated conversation between three first year students beside him, who were talking excitedly amongst themselves about how they were going to start learning magic and whatnot. Boy, were they going to be disappointed -- the first year was all theory, meditation exercises, and learning how to access your mana consistently.

  "Hey, you! You're one of the upperclassmen, aren't you?"

  Zorian looked at the girl talking to him and suppressed a groan of irritation. He /so/ did not want to talk to these people. He had been in the train since early morning, Mother had given him a nasty lecture because he hadn't offered Ilsa something to drink while she was in the house, and he was in no mood for anything.

  "I suppose you could describe me as such," he said cautiously.

  "Can you show us any magic?" she asked eagerly.

  "No," said Zorian flatly. He wasn't even lying. "The train is warded to disrupt mana shaping. They had problems with people starting fires and vandalizing compartments."

  "Oh," the girl said, clearly disappointed. She frowned, like trying to figure something out. "Mana shaping?" she asked cautiously.

  Zorian raised an eyebrow. "You don't know what mana is?" She was first year, yes, but that was elementary. Anyone who went through elementary school should know at least that much.

  "Magic?" she tried lamely.

  "Ugh," grunted Zorian. "The teachers would so fail you for that. No, it's not magic. It's what powers magic - the energy, the power, that a mage shapes into a magical effect. You'll learn more about it in lectures, I guess. Bottom point is: no mana, no magic. And I can't use any mana at the moment."

  This was misleading, but whatever. There was no way he was explaining things to some random stranger, especially since she should already know this stuff.

  "Um, okay. Sorry to bother you then."

  With a lot of squealing and steam-letting, the train stopped at Cyoria's train station, and Zorian disembarked as fast as he could, pushing past the awed first-years staring at the sight before them.
