** This is the first half of the Lady Liberty interlude. It got a bit longer than expected, and I decided that the rest of the scenario could stand on its own as a second chapter.

The rest should be up within a week, and then I'm going to try to keep up a couple of chapters a month at least through the end of Book 2.

**** It won't. The author admitted it was dropped and posted the outline for the rest of the series form us. I was slightly disappointed that the mystery cause of the necromancer curse wasn't even introduced as a character until later. removed the mystery of who in his love was the cause.
