****** No, this is just a short news article from a journalist's perspective on the series pilot. FIO is its own thing, and not the only [[/r/rational][r/rational]] MLP fanfic out there. I can list two more off the top of my head: Sassaflash the Necromancer (inexact title, rational protagonist in a Lovecraft pastiche) and The Celestia Code trilogy.

*** There's implication that a time traveler (not necessarily Doc himself) killed or staged the murder of Strickland to cover up the existence of teleporting car with working portable nuclear reactor from the feds.
