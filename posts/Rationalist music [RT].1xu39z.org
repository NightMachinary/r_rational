[[http://melodysheep.bandcamp.com/album/symphony-of-science-collectors-edition][The Symphony of Science]], by electronic musician John Boswell. In his words, “/..the goal of the project is to bring scientific knowledge and philosophy to the public, in a novel way, through the medium of music./”

My personal favourite was hands down the Glorious Dawn featuring Carl Sagan. His son, Nick Sagan seeing it [[http://nicksagan.blogs.com/nick_sagan_online/2009/09/a-glorious-dawn.html][commented on it in his blog..]]

Boswell auto-tunes audio samples featuring popular scientists from science series and then scores it in with his original compositions.

Honestly though, I never thought I'd be able to rock out to Stephen Hawkings.. I loved Richard Dawkins' sayings. “/Matter flows from place to place, and momentarily comes together to be you. Some people find that thought disturbing; I find the reality thrilling./” Just had to go get the book itself after that. It really struck me for some reason.

Have you guys come across anything science themed before? I haven't been able to find anything else apart from the Space-ambient genre.


** Well there is always the [[/http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/The+Ballad+Of+Smallpox+Gone/4f7lHc?src=5][Ballad of Smallpox Gone]] that was placed in the 'Sorta Rational Fics' section of the [[/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][TvTropes Rational Fics]] page.

It's interesting to say the least.

** There's a bunch for solstice rituals. The [[http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2000477/BookOfRituals.pdf][text of the 2011 version]] and [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/g0v/ritual_report_2012_life_death_light_darkness_and/][table of contents with some youtube links for 2012]] are online, as are [[https://soundcloud.com/raymond-arnold/][a few of the songs]].

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/66t/rational_humanist_music/][This old lesswrong thread]] may also be of interest.

** More transhumanist than rationalist, with some questionable physics. Really good though. [[https://soundcloud.com/thelisps/singularity]]

** My personal favorite as well. Love the imagery of "Not a sun rise, but a galaxy rise." I think the only 'rationalist' music I've heard besides symphony of science is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtFzV6P4EUs][Nightwish's "Song of Myself"]], and even then, it's kinda iffy. I've heard a decent amount of transhumanist music, but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as rational, although I guess it could be classified as a subgenre.

Actually, forgot about [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U][Tim Minchin's "Storm"]], which definitely qualifies.

** Not strictly rationalist, but science-themed: Loquat's "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjFphY1fMBk][Time Bending]]" ([[http://artists.letssingit.com/loquat-lyrics-time-bending-kgm8wls#axzz2tWbltnQJ][lyrics]]).

Several of their other songs have rationalist-friendly lyrics--"Comedown's Worse" and "Harder Hit" are the two I think of--but aren't science-themed.

** I believe our fearless Eliezer himself referenced MUSE's "Butterflies and Hurricanes" at one point. It hits upon rationalist themes quite nicely, especially for a mainstream song:

#+begin_quote
  Change\\
  Everything you are\\
  And everything you were\\
  Your number has been called\\
  [...]\\
  Best\\
  You've got to be the best\\
  You've got to save the world\\
  And use this chance to be\\
     heard\\
  Your time is now
#+end_quote

A bit general, but appropriate--especially since the titular phenomenon is commonly referenced in rationalist fiction. Personally, I hear this song whenever I think of Worm, HPMOR, or Game of Thrones. And there are other MUSE songs which may be similarly applicable: for instance, Madness, which concludes that the traditional romantic ideal of love--i.e., purely emotional/impulsive *and* fully irrational--is literally a form of madness.
