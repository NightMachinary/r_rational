** I'm mostly just going for "fun" rather than "educational" with the genie's behavior, but so far a surprising number of people have (accidentally or not) gone with the strategy of making a wish which modifies the Genie's utility function so that it /wants/ to be nice, rather than actually specifying a wish.

The rest end up destroying everything, except where dumb luck prevails. One person tried to banish the genie into nothingness but accidentally created an afterlife instead. Only one wire-head, but he seems to be okay with this.

***** I used the phrase 'without bindings or restrictions of any sort' as an attempt to head that off, as well as saying to transfer the power rather than simply give me the power, so I was not immediately turned into a paperclip when the other genie escaped or continued the wish process.

Unfortunately, I've still been ripped off because I forgot to include a method of controlling the capabilities, and I made a fairly incompetent attempt to do that before thinking of about 5 other solutions that would not have a chance of destroying me or not working.

****** To be fair, you /are/ a bit better off now. The genie still has her sensing ability and has to tell you the truth, and you can still implement wishes, so that leaves you where you started. Plus, you now have a bit of control over when to stop the algorithm, which is a step up.

******* True, I suppose. But I could have handled that better. I mean, don't do something that might remove the planet's atmosphere before doing something that would make that not kill you. (this is referring to the second wish.)

** This is a nice metaphor for the problem, and I appreciate that you are making it into something fun and interesting to people. I enjoyed reading your responses. Well done!

** I can't think of a solid way to phrase it, but has anyone tried a fork bomb wish? I.e. a wish that performs and action, optionally stalls, and recursively calls itself.

Something like "Deposit 5 contemporary united stated dollars into my bank account then perform this wish"

*** Done, the US economy collapses due to out of control inflation. The US dollar becomes worthless. Society rebuilds. You have to pay somebody to take all the worthless $5 notes that show up constantly away.

***** This might work. It's only $876,000/year forever in additional inflation, which is probably a rounding error on what the Federal Reserve does.
