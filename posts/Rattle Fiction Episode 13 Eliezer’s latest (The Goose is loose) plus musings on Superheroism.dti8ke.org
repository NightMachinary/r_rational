Doing a narration of a story often gets me thinking about the theme more deeply than just reading it. There's a few superhero tropes that I've been thinking about.

One is that superheroes cause supervillians to appear in order to restore a mysterious balance. Obviously, that's helpful to develop plot, but what could be the rational cause (the film Unbreakable handles this well). And if it were true, how should a trope-aware superhero handle it? Would they need to develop a randomized process of neglecting some, if not half, of situations in which they would otherwise intervene? Then villians will feel less threatened. And civilians would feel more empowered.

Second, from TV Tropes, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact][Villians Act Heroes React]] (quoting an Avengers movie) “Heroes have morals. Villains have work ethic."

How can a superhero be proactive rather than reactive? Superman powering a dynamo comes up sometimes in rational fiction. Bruce Wayne investing his millions in afterschool programs and quality daycare. Superhero stories generally focus on personal violent crime, rather than systemized state violence (aka war), refugee crises, disease, rule of law, environmental destruction, etc, it would be great to see superheroes focus on the latter. And if we want to keep to personal violent crime, then how could super powers be used to develop systems that prevent it, rather than just swooping in during an armed robbery?


** When I saw the part of the title of this post where it says "the Goose is Loose" I was hoping Eliezer's latest fanfiction would be some rational retelling of the Goose Game.

I'm imagining something like a group of noble villagers teaming up to try to take down the goose, which of course is some kind of cosmic Lovecraftian entity.

Actually can someone write this.

** The main way superheroes “cause” their own rogues' gallery is through the shift in expectations known as the Overton Window.

- Once you believe a man can fly, you start looking for his physics exploits. That's Lex Luthor.
- Once you know the sheer power of will, you wonder about the power of fear. That's Sinestro.
- Once you see a masked man flaunting the law and being hailed as “your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,” you want to find out what he's hiding behind that mask. That's J. Jonah Jameson.
- Once you see your stupid strongman brother hailed as a god and hero of men, you want that adoration for your own clever self. That's Loki.

** I'm going to assume that you don't read With This Ring? It's very long, I know, but quite on point.

Proactive measures featured in the story include:

- Contacting the less extreme/crazy villains and pointing them in useful directions. Eg arranging for Captain Cold to submit his work on thermodynamics and get a doctorate. Bonus points for using cold guns to reglaciate the poles and share the environmental prize with him.

- Unlocking the mundane utility of super tech. Electricity generation from a cosmic rod. Mass transit via Dolmen Gates. Recruiting Greek gods to help produce a perfectly conductive metal.

- Getting big business interested in magic. In the DC universe, at least, it has massive utility but it's hardly used, just a few amateurs.
