** A minor flaw in my plan to post these monthly - while the last batch of four chapters came out over the course of a month, the first chapter of the new monthly serialization came out barely a week later, as the schedules lined up. Combined with me posting the last batch a few days late, the interval would have been less than a week.

Thus, with a delay of ~two weeks, here is the first release of World Trigger under its newfound monthly schedule, which readers hope means the author will not have to [[http://chippokenabokura.tumblr.com/post/180950149233/world-trigger-volume-19-extras-part-44-from][cripple himself from chronic neck pain]] for the foreseeable future.

An (almost entirely spoiler-free) summary of the series can be found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a0zil1/world_trigger_chapters_166_through_169/eaw17l2/][here]], and a description of why I think it's at least ratjacent can be found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9rn8ra/rt_world_trigger_chapter_165/e8i53oc/][here]]. The series may be read from the beginning [[http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/World-Trigger-chapter-1-page-6.html][here]], or from the beginning of the current sub-arc [[http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/World-Trigger-chapter-165-page-1.html][here]].

(Translations get less reliable past chapter 164. For people without subscriptions to official versions, the best material is presumably found Mangastream, which currently hosts chapters [[https://readms.net/r/wt/167/5468/1][167]] through 171)

** Surprisingly well rated on bakabt. I watched the first episode of the anime, and read a couple of the manga chapters long ago but it didn't grip me. Mainly because I find governments using underage teenagers as their soldiers and world savers a bit silly, but it makes sense given their target audiences..

Your post on how it is ratdjacent and a few other points convinced me to give this another shot. Thank you ;P
