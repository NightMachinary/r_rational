**** Jane is remarkably introspective and determined, and that's for a female character in the nineteenth century. She is constantly checking on the status of her thoughts and feelings. There is an annoyance with the fact that she leaves Mr. Rochester's "problem" to himself instead of investigating but I'd excuse that as part of the time period. Most of what I would take issue with is like that.
