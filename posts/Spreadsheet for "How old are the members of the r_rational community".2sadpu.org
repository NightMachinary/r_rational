** So I suppose this would really be only meaningful with a comparison to the demographics of Reddit.

*** So, roughly:

#+begin_example
  Age range   Reddit   r/rational

  <18            4%     10%
  18-24         30%     63%
  25-34         25%     23%
  35-44         22%      3%
  45+           20%     <1%
#+end_example

i.e. far fewer over 35.

***** That's true I'm not sure how the Google Adsense works or if clicking on the ad or blocking it change the data collection because that would be sure to skew to the elderly.

Regardless I'd expect this slant as transhumanism and fanfiction culture are certainly more youthful phenomenon.

I think you may have me confused with someone else there. I've been working on improving on both counts. My new year's resolution was to improve my sleep cycle, so that I'd be able to improve both of those items even further.

Admittedly, I may not have figured out which mental-management tricks work best for me so that I can perfectly optimize all aspects of my behaviour to maximize my expected lifespan; but I'm working through the relevant search-space.
