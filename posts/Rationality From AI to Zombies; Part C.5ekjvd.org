Alright: discussion post 2. First post is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5cn7s4/d_rationality_ai_to_zombies_intros_and_parts_a_b/][here]]; second verse is substantially same as the first, the only main difference being that it's only one part this time as opposed to two-plus. Please do revisit the previous thread for comments on anything from the intros thru part b, or to download the book.

Past that: have at!
