***** I wouldn't particularly agree with that; if anything, Pact and Twig fit that description fairly well but Worm rarely seemed to go too badly for Taylor. It is an extremely long story with many arcs, so inevitably there are parts were things aren't going so well, but I still struggle to imagine how someone could come up with that impression.

****** I'm half way in and that isn't too bad of a description so far, 153 chapters in and the Taylor has yet to have a decisive victory, she usually comes out on top (if not in her own mind), but she always loses in some important way, and it's a way that was completely out of her control, so 'getting shit on' is a pretty apt description.

Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying it, the Regent interlude with Shadowstalker is probably my favourite chapter, I don't think I have ever felt that mix of horror and catharsis in a single chapter.

****** Back after getting past arc 21 *spoilers for the ending* what you said really rings true, I reeeally like this book, but in arc 22 it just loses me, it is hard to root for a character who is so obviously doomed to fail, every single coin toss goes against her, she is just so great, but I can't watch her suffer for things not her fault. I could live with watching her suffer from her actions and choices, but no matter the foreshadowing and great reveal, a rampaging god is not her fault, and watching her face it just doesn't sound fun.

***** I like the worldbuilding the most out of all three Wildbow universes, particulary how it doesn't feel (to me) too much as fantasy but as a reasonably believable /what if?/ world, where instead of electricity, technology/research focused on biology thanks to having a supercharged genius (Wollostone) on the field. I liked characterization as well - was creeped out as all hell by Helen, pity and protective feelings for Jamie, etc.

It's two authors, one of which hasn't read Worm yet, discussing the serial arc by arc. They are really good at noticing lots of subtle details, foreshadowing, and characterizations that I completely missed (partly because I read mostly between 11pm and 2am...).\\
It's really made me apprechiate Worm even more.

** I found the ranking in this list weird until I realized that it's the first big example of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting][approval voting]] that I've seen. That is a system which [[https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/aaron-hamlin-voting-reform/][some people advocate]] as a simple system which avoids strategic voting.

EDIT: Sorry I just read more and realised it's a mix of approval and ranked voting (click on the score of any book). But if most people are not aware of the ranking part (like me) and vote in a random order, then perhaps it acts more like a pure approval voting.

But is this true? If it wasn't, the books order wouldn't follow the number of people who voted for it, and vice versa. But it does, for 97/100 - so it's approval voting in practice.

**** I don't think it's a bad thing, but the utility of it is very specific. If you were making a list and ordering it, you would probably want to do it by "quality", and the approval voting list for a very large selection is only a weak proxy for that, on the assumption that the most well known will also be the most popular/good (a pretty suspect assumption).

One thing I'll note is that older works will tend to rank higher on such a list, because network effects and recommendation creep has had a longer time to work.

#+end_quote

The really surprising thing is that he's so good at writing it as normal that when I read it the first time, I completely missed that it was happening between pre-teens. Sakura really comes off as an adult so I keep unconsciously imagining her (and the people around her) doing everything in the story in an teenage to adult body. It wasn't until the second reread that I actually noticed that the age of her body was in reality 12 instead of 18 or up. It took me watching a Naruto episode before rereading Time Braid for me to realize that the characters are 12 during the chunnin exams.

Total mind screw when I realized this.

Other than that disturbing detail, it's still an amazingly well-written piece of work.

***** Just letting you know, while he went a bit crazy with the sex stuff in fanfiction, he made it only between characters of consensual age for his published works on Amazon.

The Daniel Black series and Perilous Waif are really good and I'd recommend them to this subreddit. Granted, there's quite a fair bit of sex, but I liked the books in spite of it.

In fact, he has a new book in the Daniel Black series, [[https://www.amazon.com/Thrall-Daniel-Black-Book-4-ebook/dp/B07JMNZ3TN][Thrall]], coming out December 1st.

EDIT - Actually, I can't remember if there were even any sex in Perilous Waif? All I can remember is some frank discussions about it, but no sex scenes.

****** I looked it up. Turns out I was wrong and she's officially 13 in the story. Younger then I expected, but still not 'pre teen'.

The problem with stories is that in a story age is literally just a number. I'd argue that the main characters in Time Braid consistently think and act like adults. That is also how they are treated by everyone around them. Nevermind the sex, they are literally sent on life-or-death missions by their superiors.

Given that it is very weird that the author gives her age as 13. Especially since she spends most of the story in an older body, and is also chronologically much older after a few iterations of the time loop. So I'm not sure why he uses that starting age.

It is weird. I can see where you are coming from with your objections. Though you still overstate your case. There are no preteens, and like I said, after the first few chapters she's chronologically an adult and also usually in an adult body.

/edited/ because I was apparently wrong about the meaning of the word preteen.
