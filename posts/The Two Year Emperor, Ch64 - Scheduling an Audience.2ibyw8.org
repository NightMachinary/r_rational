** The teleport marbles have a pretty terrible flaw, even if they work exactly how they're described - a single untrustworthy member of your group could teleport everyone away. Hell, a single untrustworthy /enemy/ with access to a marble could teleport everyone away. I am fairly certain that you wouldn't even get a saving throw, depending on how the wording of /Teleport/ is applied to the magic item.

I don't know whether this flaw is intentional, but I suspect that it is.

*** It's true, that could be an issue. Mostly though, it's a question of priorities. Suze was optimizing for "will let everyone escape very quickly as long as anyone can still act" and not so much for "secure".

Also, note that she oversimplified the functionality slightly -- when you drop a marble, you are included in the teleport even though you aren't personally touching it anymore. I wondered if I should call that out, but decided it was too fussy to spend screen time on.

** Jake's smart, but he has had a *massive* failure here.

"I am imagining a magical item called the *Block of Power*. A Block of Power is a three foot by two foot by two foot block of magically invulnerable adamantine that magically weighs no more than fifteen pounds. Along one of the thin ends of the Block of Power there is an adamantine handle to facilitate the carrying of the Block. Upon the speaking of a command word, the block will magically adhere to a single flat, continuous, nonliving, hard surface against which it is placed firmly. It will remain magically stuck to this surface as if held there by sovereign glue. Another command word will release this hold. Neither the affix nor release command word will function unless the handle is firmly held by the one who speaks it. Another command word will activate the Block of Power, causing it to begin producing electrical current that meets the following criteria: [insert appropriate wattage, amperage, and direct/alternating current type]. This power is not transmitted to the surface of the *Block of Power*, which always remains magically at 71 degrees Fahrenheit. When the command word for power generation is spoken, an otherwise inaccessible compartment opens on the face of the Block opposite the adhered face. When a humanoid reaches a hand into this opening, which is always 1.5' diameter they are able to safely retrieve the female end of a well-insulated power cable of up to 200' that terminates in a standard female outlet socket that is insulated properly to prevent someone touching it from being shocked."

Seriously, with Jake's intellect he should be able to create a magical power generator that could power a completely nonmagical device that can read those books. If he phrases it correctly, he could have that device send the output out of the antimagic field. Then *shennanigans* can happen.

Off of the top of my head, a magical device that 'reads' the output of one or more microscopes and writes that output into nonmagical books (or even a single magical book). Even better, it reads them into a single magical book that has an improved version of Scholar's Touch that'll transmit the contents safely to the brain of someone touching it and speaking a command word.

Jake. Has. Free. Wishes. He also has a template for creating items with arbitrary spells, or that can cast arbitrary spells, EVEN IF THOSE SPELLS DON'T EXIST. I really don't get why he looked at the room full of all the information he needs and gave up. He hasn't even /tried/.

That's not a major impediment to using magic to acquire the knowledge within, it just makes it harder. "I'm envisioning a robot with eyes that function as electron microscopes capable of reading the text within the books Loki gave me, contained within that library. This robot moves fast enough to read an entire one of those books within one minute and has enough storage capacity to retain the text of one hundred of those books. It can transmit the data using..."

Wish can create nonmagical items too, and there's a hell of a lot of ways to scan text quickly.

All Jake needs is some easily-describable near-future tech (which he can get via Wish) and a fast, high-capacity printer/binder. Once you have the text taken from the books, it can be interacted with using magic...and then everything is broken and Jake can have all that delicious knowledge.

*** I don't think that's hugely likely.

As Allison explained to Jake, servants in Flobovia were (de facto, if not de jure) at their master's beck and call for any number of 'services'. Sure, "Suze-As-Lich-Queen" could be a possibility. But that would imply that a Lich Queen would be able to bury her own ego and live as a mortal human girl, /serving/ others, for a long period.

Instead, "Not-Quite-Dead-Lich-Queen" could easily have lived as a commoner - or even a skilled craftsman or displaced foreign noble. If access to the leadership was desired, I'm sure there's a dozen ways to do it that wouldn't require NQDLQ to pose as a servant.

Sure, "Suze-As-Lich-Queen" wouldn't have to *actually* submit to serving a master in any unpleasant ways (she could always /Mindscrape/ the desire away or false memories of it in) but she would have to live with the fact that everyone she meets expects her to do so.

For a typical medieval commoner, raised to believe that this is just how the world works? It's absolutely survivable and most likely prefereable to a life of hardscrabble farming or working as a common laborer. For a Lich Queen used to commanding, and able to rewrite parts of reality with a tiny bit of effort and a few carefully-chosen words? It would be intolerable.

This isn't absolute evidence that Suze can't be a Lich Queen, but it's pretty strong evidence against that possibility. Any conceivable goal that could be accomplished by a Lich Queen being Suze (whether that's by replacing an existing Suze or - more likely - by always having been Suze) could be better achieved by another hypothetical person that wouldn't have the socio-economic issues that a Lich Queen would find so grating.

** Is it really a good idea to put the books in the ritual fires?

Even assuming they'll be forever useless, i think that there's a reasonable chance that burning the books will have a negative result.

Because burning a million books full of secrets given to you by Loki in fires feeding a nascent goddess just seems like you're not only holding an idiot ball, you're standing on it while trying to juggle chainsaws.

Those books are pretty good artifacts. Why not have some bookbinders unbind the pages, and have tailors sew the paper into anti-magic armor for the army?

** So, Jake is giving up on getting the information out of those books? Also, who is going to be at the end of the railgun? They could end up forgetting a /lot/, depending on what information is in those books. Given that Jake's sacrifice meant he forgot about the idea of scrying other planets altogether, they may not even be able to function after. Getting an Ice Assassin to do it seems a good idea.

Wait, would it even work to get someone to sacrifice the books when they don't know what's in them? All other sacrifices we've seen had the person write the thing down and sacrifice it, not sacrifice something someone else wrote down. Actually, might the person who wrote it down lose the knowledge lose it in that case? I can see this annoying Loki significantly.

Why is Jake concerned about the others discovering that he enhanced his intelligence? I can't see any reason that they'd care. He's already told them about him having jewels which can cast Wish.

Loki's mention of Expeditious Retreat seems significant, by the Law of Conservation of Detail, but I can't really see why. Neklos' land speed increasing by 30 doesn't seem particularly useful, unless he can stack it or something. And it doesn't do anything about dying.

Jake's plan remains mysterious. It clearly involves doing something to Neklos, rather than just talking, since he needs reinforcements and is worried by Neklos getting an action. But you almost explicitly said in last week's thread that Jake does not plan on killing him, and there was the issue raised about Neklos being able to foresee death. Could Jake Mindscrape Neklos? Does Mindscrape even work on a god? And since they have promised not to harm Melvin, and Neklos will be manifesting through Melvin, I don't think they can attack Neklos. The only use I can think of for the reinforcements would be to cast millions of spells at Neklos until he fails to save on at least one of them, but what spell would be useful?

Icefi's trust in Thomas' word seems strangely not paranoid. He knows that Mindscrape exists, the Landguard has access to it and the Landguard are extremely pragmatic. They would definitely use it on their leader if it let them kill Melvin, let alone Neklos.

He originally concealed from them the fact that he Wished his intelligence higher. Now that he's no longer psycho he doesn't feel that he needs to have an edge to help him with his plan to kill everyone, but he isn't comfortable admitting to having hidden it from them. This gives him a simple out.

Wouldn't that mean that whoever is the one to say the prayer and throw the books into the fire will be forever barred from knowing whatever knowledge, mystical or mundane, is in all these text books?

**** For spellcasters at least, it would be pretty easy to test based on spells per day so long as they know their own level. In theory, they can also take 10 on a variety of skill checks (since they do know their own skill ranks and could calculate from there), but maybe that only applies to PCs.

***** Everyone, even commoners, has skill ranks. It's just that the average commoner, until they interact with a PC is so /completely uninteresting/ that their skill ranks are in a quantum state of bonus.

And some things, like strength, would be really easy to test. Strength determines carrying capacity, so if you know the moment you move from a light to a medium load you can determine your exact strength.

If TYE-verse works like some campaigns I've seen, where everyone gets max HP at first level, it would be easy (albeit painful) to calculate your CON - simply allow yourself to be struck by a shruiken (flat 1 damage, plus STR bonus) until you reach 0 hp. This can calculate your CON bonus, getting you within 1 point of your true CON.

WIS can be determined (roughly) almost as easily: tell someone how you're going to test their CON. If they agree to be tested, their WIS is below-average.

** Dumping the library seems really really, ridiculously stupid. It contains all of the knowledge he seeks on everything he has deemed important in that conversation, it includes things he has figured out later. If he dumps it in the sacrifice pile, he'll lose gained knowledge,and he WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO LEARN ANY OF IT.

This seems by far, his stupidest idea ever.

He can get a minion to dump the books to avoid any possible backlash.

**** sure, if you read it that it is the person dumping the knowledge and not the person actually sacrificing it that loses the knowledge.
