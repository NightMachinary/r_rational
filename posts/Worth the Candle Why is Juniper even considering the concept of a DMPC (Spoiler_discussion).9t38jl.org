While this is true, up to this point we've been assuming the DM is computing the brain states of each party member the same way that he does Joon's, ie, they have qualia.

The implication of calling Vervain a DMPC is that Vervain wasn't even an emulation with his own thoughts and feelings, just Dice Guy self-inserting himself into Aerb and acting out a character.

** Following that chain of logic, all NPCs are also DMPCs, which doesn't quite mesh with what (my understanding) a DMPC is.\\
In a tabletop RPG, one of the differences between an NPC and a DMPC is how the character interacts with the party. While an NPC might have a fleshed out background, things they want to accomplish, goals, desires, etc, the DM roleplays as that NPC to the benefit of the verisimilitude of the world. As a player, you expect the people you interact with to behave like people, with their own lives, and stories, and motivation to behave the way they do.

A DMPC is different. Sometimes they are a character the DM is particularly attached to (either a character they really wanted to play in a game themselves, or a theory crafted something or other that they never got to play), and the DM favors this NPC with lots of "screen time", special magical powers, or other "look at me!" types of stuff.\\
Other times, the DMPC play out an in-game reason for the players to follow a particular path, allowing the DM to subtly guide the players down routes they might otherwise not choose to go down.

The DMPC has an intelligence guiding its motivations outside of a simple backstory or a quest to give. It serves as an Avatar of the DM's will in the world, influencing the only characters whose decisions the DM doesn't normally get to make.

The players.

​

Since arriving in Aerb, Juniper has seen and dealt with a lot of strange things and to "immediately dismiss the concept of a DMPC" and immediately conclude Arthur was mad doesn't really seem consistent with his character.

Just my two cents. :)

** I think it's still a meaningful concept. It's the difference between the DM creating a person and letting them run independently from that start point, and the DM controlling every action of a person. Yes, the DM still controls the start point of that person, and could shape that person to lead to the outcomes they desire, but there's a difference between someone being an independent being with their own thoughts, motivations etc, and them just being a sockpuppet

** A quote I don't think anyone has looked at, from the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/31229865][Amaryllis POV Chapter.]]

#+begin_quote
  he said a small prayer to each of the five gods, and then a final, sixth prayer to the Dungeon Master that Juniper believed was the one true god of Aerb. Prayers to the gods had their own specific structures to them, with motifs and iconographies that the pious were expected to adhere to, even if prayer itself was next to useless. The prayer to the Dungeon Master took some thought, because no standards existed for praying to what was only a theoretical deity.

  Dungeon Master, if I must be on your railroad, let me ride the train with good humor. If I must roll the dice, let it be known that I would not object to you fudging. Place a dungeon before me, and I will delve it. Place a dragon before me, and I will slay it. *I am, above all else, your player.*

** I think there is a level of difference between what Joon considers to be a DMPC, ie someone directly controlled by the DM, and the emulation of a person. Presumably, Vervain wasn't a full person like basically everyone else probably is, more of a vessel for the DM to act through to get Arthur off his ass. It's the level of direct interference that the DM has on their minds and decision-making. There is a lot on Aerb that the DM doesn't seem to directly interfere with after it gets going, even if he's running the software, for reasons of fair play.

** From Arthur's point of view he wakes up in a game that is completely made from Juniper's ideas. Who do you think Arthur would think the DM is? He probably said to Vervain so many times "Fuck you, Joon. Let me out of this game! At least admit to me you're fucking with me." until he lost it and killed him.

When Joon finds Arthur, Arthur is not going to be happy to see him.

Vervain would likely have explicitly said "I'm not Juniper", I think. In fact, there's evidence that either Vervain said that, or Arthur didn't believe that in the first place:

Arthur left Juniper a message, acknowledging that the ideas line up with Juniper's own.

This message was /not/ filled with cussing at Juniper.

**** I agree Vervain would have said he wasn't Juniper. But I thought that Arthur just stopped believing him and got frustrated, hence the killing and the DMPC message.

What message did Arthur leave for Juniper? I remember something about a Juniper tree on Smith's grave or something? But I don't remember that conveying specific ideas.

****** Ah, of course. I went back and read that part of Chapter 109 again.

It's odd how Arthur spoke to Joon. I would have expected Arthur to think that Juniper was for sure the Dungeon Master, but the message he left was more like Arthur knew Juniper didn't make and control the world, just that it drew inspiration from Juniper's mind.

Did Arthur go for many years convinced that Juniper was toying with him in role of the Dungeon Master and then somehow learn that Juniper wasn't behind everything and that it would be possible that Juniper could enter the world in the future?

It almost felt like when Arthur said “I'm glad you're here” that it was like how a prisoner would say it to a warden, when the warden was condemned to the same jail.

  All the party members are DMPCs.
#+end_quote

No, that's... not really true. The difference here is that the simulated NPCs are presumed to be simulated in earnest, with the DM not really micromanaging their behaviour. That's what simulation is /all about/, to take most of the labour off the DM. It's more or less an equal playing field with the DM. A truly simulated NPC can surprise Joon just as well they can surprise the DM (if DM is human).

The DMPC is exactly not that. It's a character that is puppeteered by the DM if not all the time, then most of the time when Joon meaningfully interacts with them.

We don't know why Arthur declared Vervain a DMPC. Maybe he had good evidence (not equals 'Arthur was right'), or maybe he was nuts.

Joon can dismiss any musings about DMPCs simply as something he can't really do anything about. But dismissing the idea as a whole is an obvious mistake.

Why would the set of qualia known as "Mr. Dice Guy" (DM) pretend to be another set of qualia known as "Vervain" when he could instead just instance a set of qualia that IS "Vervain" (rather than one set of qualia imperfectly pretending to be another) and then tweak the variables of Vervain's mind on the fly to make Vervain's goals align with the DM's? The DM's computational substrate is the ultimate method actor because it can instance any mind the DM wishes, and alter it at any time in any way he wishes. (I would say the DM definitely has these capabilities since Jun also has a watered down game balanced version of these capabilities via soul magic.)

​

As far as I can see considering these factors, the definition of a DMPC is just someone whose mind the DM is more likely to tweak than the characters the DM is supposedly hands off from.

Because he confessed to having a personal preference towards one and not the other at least in some cases. Now that could be a lie. Or it may be true. The valid answer you have to consider is still "personal preference".

It doesn't look true to me in Vervain's case, but the evidence is too weak to be anywhere near conclusive.

** Even assuming Aerb is some sort of simulation, PCs, NPCs, and DMPCs are entirely different things. The player character (Jun or Arthur) are actors controlled by the player; the NPCs are controlled by the DM, but are not actors themselves, they can be said to have no free will or perfect knowledge; the DMPC is an actor controlled by the DM. The DM has a perfect or near perfect knowledge of the simulation. If a PC knew every horrific thing that the party would encounter throughout a dungeon, and the perfect solution to any problem encountered, the only moral choice, or logical choice would be to inform the PCs, and even the NPCs. Vervain did none of those things, and Arthur suffered terribly.

I'm not certain of Arthur's contact with the DM but if he believed that Vervain was the voice of god, such as it was, he reacted no differently than Jun, or perhaps even more reasonably since vervain was a companion and friend which had been guiding him into what can only be described as a horrific life. Pretty much the first thing Jun did to the DM was beat him to death. Imagine if it turned out that Grak or Amryillis or Fenn knew everything that would result of Jun's choices, and just let it happen.

** Even if we as readers can imagine the concept doesn't /need/ to have meaning from the actual DM's point of view, Joon has evidence that /Arthur belives/ it has meaning to the DM, and the interactions Joon /has/ had with the DM support or at least don't contradict the premise that the DM /does/ think in those terms. So it's as true as anything else in the game world, really, and there's no downside to thinking the implications all the way through before dismissing the conflict /if and when/ that is the proper response.

The guy can just be a god and have created the whole thing and everything would be real.

And even if it was a simulation, that's not what it means. If you create a simulation, all things in the simulation are created by you, but not directly controlled by you. DMPC means directly controlled.

I think that's a false dichotomy. What's the difference between someone or something that completely controls a simulation of a universe inside a sufficiently advanced computer and someone or something that completely controls a universe?

**** There are a lot of differences.

If you stumbled upon a sufficiently advanced computer and started a simulation of an universe, it would not make you yourself all-powerful as a being. You could probably not even be all-knowing in the universe you created, as you probably don't live long enough to go through everything that ever happens in it, even if you can pause and rewind it and read everyone's thoughts.

Whether or not you are actually a god as your being does matter. Because as non-god your motives and needs and wants would most probably be completely different than if you were an actual god. If you are not a god, someone could maybe trick you, or you could actually just fail in your goal, whatever it was. Like if you wanted to play a grand good vs. evil thing and planned that good wins, the simulation would be so massive and there would be so many rules that maybe the evil just wins anyway unless you start smiting them or restart the simulation or something.
