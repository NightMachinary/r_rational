** The reversal of "escapism" is an interesting one that I think I'll need some time to process. The argument that the Amish live /further/ from reality than I do is ... I don't know. I grew up around the Amish, and the Hutterites, and was raised in a somewhat similar (if more technologically progressive) ethno-religious group. I would definitely agree that they have a more socially and physically focused reality. "More real" is much harder to pin down. I spend the majority of my waking life in front of a screen, either on the internet, writing code, or writing prose fiction. The zen state of computer programming, in all its mathematical/platonic glory, does not seem particularly real to me, in part because it's almost exclusively several layers of abstraction on top of the actual computational processes themselves. I write something like =rdrOrders.Read=, and that's an abbreviation for whole processes and meanings that I'm allowed to remain ignorant of.

I enjoyed the article, but the conclusions are so counter-intuitive that I think they might just be wrong.

*** I think it depends what level of understanding you have about the exact process mediating your experience? I always feel that computer screens are /very/ real, because I have a fairly solid understanding of what the abstractions are built out of. Of course, I also feel that trees and bricks are real, but I would certainly say that tribal rain gods are far less real than /any/ of the above-mentioned things.

It could be a matter of understanding and also /control/. Computers can be turned off, and don't demand that you think of them as comprising the overarching truth of reality. Tribal rain dances, on the other hand, /do/ claim to be the Overarching Truth of Reality, or at least to be part of it. Yet there's nothing physically going-on /underneath/ the abstraction, and the abstraction demands control over your thoughts and your life.

I'm not sure I agree with the article, but it is interesting. I think it could be right sometimes and wrong other times.

**** Is a technology that doesn't exist yet real? Is fiction real? I mean it exists in the universe and inside our minds, so its 'real' in that sense isn't it?

Interesting stuff really.

** Interesting article with some interesting, if philosophically convoluted arguments. However, one thing really bothered me - to illustrate the point of zen-like escapism, the author decided to choose */Bejeweled/* and */Clash of Clans?/* /Really?/ He had nigh-unprecedented choice in choosing his subjective reality - or so he argued - and THAT'S what he picked?

*** He said that Bejeweled gave a zen-like experience by "reduc[ing] you to a hand-eye response loop."

He used Clash of Clans as his anti-zen because it's all about the ego and the social interaction.

**** Ah - my mistake. Looks like I saw a snark target and skimmed that section.

(I think the author is still playing the video game equivalent of greasy junk food, but that's just snobby video game elitism, not really serious criticism.)

No argument from me, man. Go Nethack 3.2.17.patchAA or go home.
