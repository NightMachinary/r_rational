*** The anime has an extra arc, so there's some extra content there. Not sure how filler-ish it is. The animation turned me off, so I ended up sticking with the manga instead.

*** Hoo boy.

The anime was a Toei production, with all the complications that brings. Some of it is obvious, like the cheap animation, drawn-out pacing, and the insistence of churning out an episode every week all year around, which is liable to outpace any manga author soon enough.

More than that, however, World Trigger has always been a mixture of different levels of maturity. In some ways, it's clearly a shonen story, in others, it takes itself seriously to a degree that most of its kin don't. The manga handles this state of limbo reasonably well, while the anime took what opportunities it got to sprinkle lowest-common-denominator shonen tropes over everything. Make no mistake, the (canon part of the) anime is almost exactly faithful to the plot, and in fairness, I myself found the series through the anime. Still, if someone is less tolerant of the genre, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they were less likely to get into the anime than the manga.

There is indeed a block of filler near the end of the animated series. It's tolerable, for a filler arc, but ultimately an imitation.

I don't doubt you could make a much better anime adaption, but at the moment, that's looking like a long shot. Since transferring to a monthly schedule, World Trigger produces about 24 chapters per year - enough for about 12 episodes. This would be alright if it were released seasonally, but Toei insists on making an episode per week or nothing at all, and supposedly aren't prone to giving up rights to material.

**** So if I liked SAO and Naruto I should like this anime, right? Because it seems like those anime are pretty pure shonen.

***** If you have no compunctions about the stereotype tropes of shonen anime, then go right ahead. (The animation is still cheap, but dynamic enough when it needs to be.)
