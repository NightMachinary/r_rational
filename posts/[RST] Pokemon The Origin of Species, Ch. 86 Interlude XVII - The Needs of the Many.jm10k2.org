** The gym battles in this story are so goddamn entertaining. Every single one I'm on the edge of my seat, because I know you aren't afraid to have Blue lose, or have a Stormbringer attack the city mid-battle. I really thought for a second that it was going to be a draw, but that last scene was so...epic, for lack of a better word!

Also, I had a sneaking suspicion Erika was in on the Renegade thing. The way she was acting with Looker really gave off the idea that she wants to brush this whole thing under the rug as soon as possible. Also, looks like she might be onto Red about the whole uh, murder thing.

...God I cannot wait for the next Red-centric chapter.

**** I'm pretty sure it is, except that you don't become renegade when you do. The whole point of being made an outlaw is that the law no longer protects you. So while you can certainly be killed, legally you can't be murdered.

Of course if you are in legitimate custody there are other rules, which would make breaking into a cell to kill a detained renegade definitely illegal, just not quite on grounds as straightforward as murder.

Red's problem is more that if such a use of /sakki/ should get out it would jeopardise Leaf's work and potentially empower renegades everywhere, not to mention annihilate any deniability Red might have about anything unpleasant that goes on around him, justifiably or not. Also, he likely does not want to be known as a killer, nor does he want Blue's friends to know that he psychically transformed their beloved Pokémon into lethal weapons.

That said, I hope Red's able to find /some/ way of appeasing MG's anxiety. Erika mentions this chapter that MG was visibly trembling as she accepted the medals for herself and Glen, and I suspect that's a good part caused by fear of someone finding out her vulpix killed a man (and possibly even wondering where she went wrong in training it) as it is caused by stage fright and imposter syndrome.

** Since I didn't see any other comments on this, I will just note how great the literary trick was to set up Blue to reject a victory on chance midway through the fight, in a way that made him just a bit bitter but knew was the right call - then reverse course at the end & openly stake everything on luck, but in a way that was much more "him" (belief in his Pokémon over pure chance). Its one of those quasi-subtle set-ups leading to payoff that is the hallmark of good structure, and I appreciate how often individual chapters have those kind of structural components over just being a literal sequence-of-events.

** Erika's perspective was interesting. That beginning bit from when she was a child struck a chord with me. Something tells me she never changed her mind about time spent with Grandma. I hate the tendency people have to treat the feelings of children as invalid or irrelevant. The argument of "when you're older" especially annoys me.

I think it is a shame she is working with Giovanni. Even if she's not inducted into his deep secrets like Sabrina, it is still a black mark against her. To make matters worse she is allowing him to continue to operate despite what happened and can't even claim any sort of ignorance anymore.

Good to see Blue get back into things, even if Erika really didn't want him to win. She abused her position in that match in my opinion.

Anyway she is a deeply flawed person, but I enjoyed her perspective. I do look forward to getting back to Red and seeing how he's coping though.

*** Meh.... what's wrong with working with Giovanni from her perspective?[who was instrumental in her becoming leader in the first place, as we learnt this chapter]

Yes, allowing renegades in the basement is illegal, but since there's some kind of corporate shadow-war behind the scenes, it's not unreasonable.Kanto has rule of law of sorts, but leaders, champions, elites and mega-corporations and other high-status people all sorta run around and do their own thing..... for what we've seen so far, good reasons.Are the more civilian, less warlord-equivalent elected mayors any better? Maybe, but Leaf suspects that a conspiracy of mayors might have been behind the Mt. Moon catastrophe.

Bill openly admitted he sabotaged other AI research. Which might mean anything between hacking and deleting/falsifying data, doxxing, blackmail to straight-up murder.Or whatever a super-rich person could pull off to make you stop doing things. Maybe he just gave all promising AI researchers a lucrative scholarships in unrelated fields.

[we also have no good read on what Silph is up to, besides union-busting]

Kanto is kind of a morally grey place, unlike in the games.Giovanni is not a mobster. The Silph Co president is not a hapless victim.

The whole region is a conspiracy theorist's paradise, because there's so many absurdly competent players, that actually pull of conspiracies.

What is wrong is that one of the core Leader duties is passing judgement on Renegades. Very few others can do it. And in exchange for sparing some, they are reaping the rewards of them as labour for illegal activities. Well-meaning, maybe. But it is still flagrant corruption and incredibly anti-democratic.

***** re: Mt MoonYeah, I'm pretty sure I have figured out, who killed Yuuta and who Palmer's source was. But I have no good idea, who ordered/commissioned the Mt. Moon robbery, in the first place. Maybe I'm missing some context from other games (maybe the Unova ones). But I don't think it was Giovanni himself. What would he get out of it? I have a possible motive, but it's a bit far-fetched.

---re: Erika being corrupt and anti-democratic

Kanto isn't exactly a democratic society, though.

It's more like a confederation of free city states, that are locally democratic.I think that the mayors might be elected, but the closest to a federal government would be the Indigo League and CorrNet.Corrnet is like.... a volunteer-run FEMA with local chapter everywhere. Or maybe a large-scale volunteer firefighter organization.And the Indigo league is half corporate wrestling franchise, half semi-professional militia except almost never directed against human threats.... actually, I struggle to find a good real world equivalent for the Indigo league.Their local chapters, the gyms, are more or less in harmony (and often in tension) with the local democratic/civilian elements.

Together this all forms something like the Hanseatic league.And the democracy element is implied to be somewhat recent as pokeball tech used to not exist in living memory, meaning it was probably more warlord- and or psychic-dominated even back then.

So what Erika has been doing is not anti-democratic. She's not acting against democracy/the civvies, she just considered the shady Giovanni/Silph-war to be none of their concern and hides it from them.

I wouldn't call it corrupt or ethically misguided.[maybe it is, but since I have no idea how good the civic/democratic institutions actually are I'm not assuming it]

And certainly we never see conspiracies of that scale work at all.

But in-universe it makes perfect sense.\\
And yeah, if Giovanni's plan is so sensible and the world is more rationalist and more hardcore survivalist in general, the secrecy/murder stuff doesn't quite fit in, but this fiction has to work under the constraints of Giovanni being an elegantly dressed mobster wearing an expensive Italian suit..... so I dunno, I just have no trouble rolling with it.

Samuel Oak alludes to Giovanni being extremely driven, but ultimately getting in the way of his own noble goals, because he just can't help being a cold fucking sociopath with trust issues. [or something along those lines, don't quite remember]\\
I hope that will be explored more, at some point.\\

Mewto turns against Giovanni and Sabrina and goes on a rampage.

Groudon and Kyogre kill each other, but Wallace didn't notice this in time (the sky pillar is far away, after all) and he unleashes the titans for nothing. Surge's preparation for war succeeds too well, and Kanto starts preemptive strikes against Unova using hundreds of Abras (thanks Red!).\\
Aiko survives, accidentally reveals Sakki to Rei and she leads the surviving gym members to form a psychic clan and conquer Saffron and from there Lavender town.

And Erika.... accidentally gets herself and all her people addicted to her Bayleaf's tea. (turns out it was too good!)

** There's something about Erika that I have like a guttural kind of unease about. Like that somehow she's wrong and I'm not sure why like she's totally got this set up for ease of communications beyond current societal norms, she's working kinda around the system rather than arguably the intended way, but I think the thing that I have the most issue with is that she's not really a gym leader for the sake of being a gym leader.

Like it's a position that you're supposed to hold in order to protect the people of your city and region and like Erika kinda just didn't and like for petty personal power reasons which I find less forgivable than the more megalomaniac tendencies of Giovanni who is almost certainly an antagonist if not an outright villain. But Erika kinda just puts people in danger by being the leader both by not striving to be the strongest in a time where personal strength can and does save lives, but is also not enough in comparison to the known and feared threats that are expected. Like i dunno i wouldn't have a problem with her "leading" an apartment somewhere doing mostly the same things, but like there are expectations on her that she's not even trying to live up to.

Also that like if her Third is the battling part of her leadership qualifications of Gym Leadership what happens if/when she dies, which we've seen happen to you know full Gym Leaders in the face of crisis(s?) or like if Erika dies and her little you know rationalist coven isn't seen as something the next Gym Leader wants?

More pedantically the Ferrothorn being returned out of ingrain is wierd. Also i'm not sure that the dramatic finish holds up when Golbat absent any conscious pokemon threatening his(her?) master is just able to wake up given time which considering all of the opposing pokemon are knocked but they are just asleep well... I mean sure in like anime sometimes was considered a knock out in the Indigo League but like that part feels kind of questionable like the enemy was defeated all he has to do wait and his golbat should just wake up.

Within a day of the weather gods' abrupt arrival and departure, it became clear to Erika that any major plans she had for the next few months would have to be delayed or reconsidered. By the next week she realized that her plans for the whole year might not survive the changes taking place around the island, and it only got worse from there as the changes, both ecological and social, continued to make themselves known around the world.

  Now, nearly a month later, Erika has begun to realize that rather than expecting things to go back to "normal," she would have to make her plans around a new concept of what normal /is/.

Since they were on the phone, I'm guessing Giovanni phrased this in a very mobsterish manner, as did Erika when she relayed his needs to the "right sort of people" in her normally subtext-averse gym. Is there a uniform decoration for "doing crimes?"

**** Yeah, but from Rakim's perspective we know that there was a kill-order for sub basement 3. Anyone above those levels would simply be turned around and thrown out. Lizzy didn't see anything apart from generators, which weren't a secret (as far as we know). Rakim was in sub basement 3 and could not reach anybody for guidance on that and decided to apply that rule, thinking that Archer could still be able to hide or spin the existence of the lower levels, if there are no witnesses left alive to contradict that his account. Rakim that got knocked out by Joy was also in sub basement 3 (I think?). So he either reasoned in the same way or he and Roark coordinated at some point.

The generators are in sub basement 1 (that was my conclusion, last I read this, anyway). No kill order there. So the third renegade Maddie would have to have been extremely ruthless and very cool-headed, thinking that she can't allow the girl asking where the generators are, to fix them.Quite the psycho, considering that this would help in digging out her own colleagues and friends (and their Fantasy Indigo League!).

More likely that she got the order from Archer (or maybe even Giovanni), who presumably survived and left Celadon. [or has already been captured by Looker]

** Great chapter, though I'm not a fan of what Erika suggested to simulate the chance of Blue escaping with his Breloom. Guessing fingers is something too easy for her to fake and decide how the challenge ends. If the intended implication is that she's that blatantly abusive of her status, then it works and I like it, but if it was meant as a genuine attempt to give him a coin flip there are definitely better ways imo.

Off the top of my head, she could grab a spare pokeball from nearby and have Blue guess whether it contains one of two species.

  Before. That the word has gained such weight in everyone's collective thoughts and dialogue speaks volumes in itself of the times they're living through. Within a day of the weather gods' abrupt arrival and departure, it became clear to Erika that any major plans she had for the next few months would have to be delayed or reconsidered. By the next week she realized that her plans for the whole year might not survive the changes taking place around the island, and it only got worse from there as the changes, both ecological and social, continued to make themselves known around the world.

  Now, nearly a month later, Erika has begun to realize that rather than expecting things to go back to “normal,” she would have to make her plans around a new concept of what normal is.
