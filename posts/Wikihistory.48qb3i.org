** Is this the original? I remember reading it elsewhere some years ago. Perhaps the site did a redesign.

*** Yep, this is the original.

Well, after all the reverts settled, anyway.

** I like the story, but the time travel mechanic seems to be inconsistent.

SPOILERS BELOW

If killing Hitler would cause time travel not to exist, how is the one person going back to fix it?

Even if you assume that for some reason there's a time limit before the effects trickle down to the present, then that doesn't explain why the character who stopped the Taiping revolution ceased to exist. He should still be around for a little bit, assuming "time" gives some leeway before its effects reach the present time.

The only solution I can think of to this paradox is that the people editing the wiki are doing so from a place outside of space time. So They're free to take an action then observe the consequences without being affected by them. Perhaps only once they rejoin the timeline can the ripple effects of what they've changed catch up with them.

And since asian avenger was in normal space time when he caused the effect that would erase him from history, there was no way for him to realize his mistake before it caught up to him.

I suppose this explanation makes sense in a way, but it takes several leaps of logic to get there and I'm not entirely sure that's what the author intended.

Edit: Taiping != Taipei

**** I generally give a lot of leeway to time travel stories if they're entertaining. But when I read things posted to [[/r/rational]] I tend to hold them to a higher standard.

Even so, I did still enjoy the story.
