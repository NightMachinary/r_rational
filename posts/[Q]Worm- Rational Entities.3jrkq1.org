Spoilers for all of Worm. Proceed at your peril.

The common idea is that the Entities are chasing a solution to the heat death, or at least the problem of overrunning the universe once they inevitably begin to compete again- because of their nature as solitary super-predators that explode population-wise. So they choose to spend their time using minor species to test out their shards (powers) as a sort of experiment. All the low-level (to the Entities) conflict in Worm is essentially a result of the constraints they've placed on their shards and then released them as a sort of social experiment, done over centuries. To what degree the experiments are in earnest expected to lead to a single,ultimate breakthrough or are the result of the Entities' violent psychology simply letting them see genocide as an acceptable cost for minor gains (they have a lot of time) is unknown.

One of the things that often comes up in the fandom is the idea that the Entities in Worm are stupid/acting massively inefficiently. And I was wondering how others on this site would view their actions or what they'd change, keeping in mind their particular

Entities are supposedly just plain old uncreative, by word of God. Even with shards capable of perfect precog or massive feats of computation and inference, they still need to use lesser species to experiment by drowning them in conflict and watching how they apply the powers. Would this really be necessary? With that sort of computational power? Or is the use of lesser species just a hedge against their own biases? Would peaceful symbiosis be preferred?

What would you change to make their story more..palatable?


** The entities are acting stupidly. Really, really stupidly. They built shards to inhibit cooperation in favor of conflict, which means that shards are only getting used by a single person most of the time. As anyone who has posted to even this (comparatively small) subreddit knows, a whole bunch of people working in concert together are going to be much better at finding solutions than a single person working alone.

So if I were a less stupid entity:

- Encourage cooperation, not competition.
- Target shards at people with a high general intelligence factor.

(That's assuming that giving people shards is somehow efficient in the first place, which I'm not convinced of, but we don't know enough about the entity's limits or capabilities, nor about the various costs incurred. It's well possible that they can beat the heat death of the universe with half a second of thought, if we knew what they could actually do. It's implied that every use of energy is just pulling from a different universe, so somehow that means heat death is still a problem?)

Edit:

- Give the host society some sort of feedback on their energy usage. Parahumans currently have no way of knowing what kind of power they're drawing, or even that the energy isn't "free", so why would they optimize for efficiency? They're just going to be blowing through their power stores without fear of consequence, which is the opposite of what you'd want if you were trying to get some novel applications that are good for preventing the heat death of the universe.

*** Yeah, the issues the Entities face is:

1. Though the univere (s) they inhabit are truly stupendously enormous, with more universes than there are atoms in any one reality, they're explicitly finite in number and (presumably) each still subject to entropy.

So when Phir Se launches a giant laser beam or Alexandria lifts a building pillar, they're all borrowing that energy, in one form or another, from another reality.

The entities are trying to get around this ultimate problem, because the other solutions (that readers try to propose as if they're original) like birth control or cooperation, are not long-term solutions at all.

***** Oh yeah, I wasn't attacking your ideas, I was really attacking the common fanon on Spacebattles or [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]], that the issue with entities is that they're not like humans and that they should form societies.

Its like proposing that the issue with people is that they don't cooperate like ants do, so we should adopt ant-like societal structures.

Apologies for the confusion.

I think your idea for cooperation amongst hosts is good, but remember that cooperation does happen. Only in small groups, and large-scale cooperation, absent Cauldron meddling, is extremely unlikely amongst para humans, but it does happen.

Look at the Undersiders, the gangs, etc.

The entities think that that kind of small-scale cooperation is better than societal cooperation, probably because they figure super large-scale cooperation will just lead to orderly societies, which aren't as innovative (so they think) as constant low-grade conflict.

***** But that was something they'd planned for. It should be noted that their plan went wrong here, because the main strategist died.

Part of that strategist's plan involved cooperation, with Tinker shards equipping armies and such. What they didn't want to allow, at least in the first reality they experimented on, was global cooperation or long term peace- enter the Endbringers. And, even then, it should be noted that the Entities had god knows how many worlds to play with. Minor and major variations on their experiments were likely planned, perhaps even cooperation and competition across worlds or the sort of chaos you got in late Worm with the S9000, but controlled.

According to Wildbow to some degree even having static threats that'd just stick in one place like Nilbog were to some degree planned for, though th

So ... it would take a very specific sort of psychology in order to recognize that humans will attempt cooperation with each other and then subvert that, while also not understanding that cooperation is valid for arriving at solutions. Possible, but seems utterly contrived to me.

***** One possible answer: Cooperation tends towards a certain set of solutions - Shard A can do X, Shard B can do Y, but combined they can do Z, Z is massively useful. Perhaps societies, if allowed to cooperate enough, settle into a pattern of certain uses of shards for optimum, which is fine and dandy for them, but annoying if you're devouring universes for science. The best way to work out unconventional uses of shards, then, is to encourage novel combinations of shards as dictated by necessity.

I still don't get why they don't land on a planet, upload a bunch of creative monkeys, and feed in data until something useful comes out, at which point they enact the suggested interaction themselves.

****** I actually think one of the things the entities are being shown as really (sensibly) good at is adding in restrictions in order to steer away from optimal solutions. That's the whole reason that Manton limits exist; if you give someone the ability to use force fields and make them fight to the death, /of course/ they're going to use that force field in order to just bisect the brain of their opponent. If you give them telekinesis, /of course/ they're going to just end the fight by squeezing someone's heart. So the Manton limits are in place in order to encourage creativity by putting a roadblock in front of the optimal path.

So I'm not sure that the entities would have too much trouble with finding a way to restrict the solution space to those uses which are creative/novel. But maybe you do have a point.

**** Its complicated. From the little psychology we get of the Entities we know the following:

1. They originate on a planet where they've devoured everything else, consumed all resources, and are stuck in an endless loop that will eventually spiral into a local lack of usable energy/food.

2. A lone entity proposes an idea-->everyone consume everyone else, or submit if they're too weak to compete, and the 'winner' of this fight, which is really a meal/absorption, will spread from that planet to other planets.

3. This idea wins out, the entities cooperate/eat each other, and spread to other planets.

Obviously Scion and Eden can cooperate, but it seems that their whole idea of cooperation is centered around this original, nearly religious act of combining into a greater whole for a higher purpose. This is why Eden and Scion are both searching for something that will let them transcend the existence they're now in, where thy spread from planet to planet .

On Earth they limit cooperation to small groups, and actively (in Eden's future through her interference and weak!Endbringers) or passively (through shards selecting impulsive/violent hosts and mild psychological fuckery) limit large-scale organizations from curtailing violence.

It seems to me that they made an educated guess, using precog/modeling, that small-scale cooperation and conflict is better than large-scale cooperation.

*** Perhaps everybody's just wrong about the Entities being made for preventing Heat Death through experimentation.

Because if you look at it from that angle, the Entities don't look like they're optimizing for producing practical schemes for combining powersets to reverse heat-death.

They look like they're optimizing for creating individual powers that are really good at keeping the user on top of things in a world of constant, endless conflict, where literally nobody else can be trusted.

What sort of a conflict has those aspects? An invasion by superpowered infiltrator pod-people? A cosmic-level zombie plague? If we follow this train of thought, the implicit 'actual threat' the Entities are preparing for starts looking pretty scary.

*** Reminds me of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mad-science-intensifies-yet-another-worm-cyoa-fic.14968/page-2#post-2924670][this]] CYOA fanfiction, where after hacking his way to godlike power, the protagonist starts dealing with the Entities as a whole:

#+begin_quote
  It was at this point I realized that, given my current capabilities and all the horrors the Entities were responsible for, I might as well go genocide them. However, it was not impossible (improbable, but not impossible) that there were a few entities who might possibly be described as ‘benevolent'. Therefore I would target my extermination of the entities on a case-by-case basis.

  First target: Abbadon

  Verdict: Subject appears to not give a shit about the ‘hosts' either way, and does not actively harm or assist them. Seems to like screwing with other entities however. SPARED.

  By my estimates (and highly accurate multiverse-wide D-scans), there were roughly 2*10^{3010} Entities in existence. This would take a while. Ultimately I just decided to fork my consciousness 10^{3008} times so each fork would only need to deal with 100 entities before re-merging. I had more than enough bodies to do it without needing to grow any further.

  The particular thread of consciousness this narrative will follow had to deal with the following

  Subject: #001

  Verdict: This entity is extremely blunt about its intentions at a given world, blatantly stating that it needs them for their problem solving abilities, and its nature. It does not have a partner, and does not give out powers. SPARED.

  Subjects #002 & #003

  Verdict: These entities are even worse than Eden and Zion. They give out powers to people most likely to sacrifice themselves to protect others, then get their conflict quota by assaulting the target world with an endless stream of kaiju. ERASED.

  Subject #004

  Verdict: Uses standard methodology of granting powers to those who suffer trauma. These powers do not mentally influence host species, unlike those granted by subjects Zion and Eden. Does not use endbringers or manifest an avatar, merely allowing psychology and infighting to produce conflict. Still commits genocide at end of cycle. ERASED.

  Subject #005

  Verdict: Grants 30,000 shards (power granting included) to a single host, who is selected as the one most likely to lead their species to greatness, with them usually becoming a benevolent dictator. It doesn't grant Tinker powers. Ever. At end of cycle, it copies the functionality of the specie's technology, adding it to its own repertoire, and uses shaper powers to copy-paste back all the shards it gave out before leaving. Worth noting is that this entity seems to have taken up the hobby of etching quite intricate designs onto small planetoids. SPARED. CONTACTED.

  Subject #006

  Verdict: This entity is using the Standard Eden/Zion methodology. Analysis indicates it spawned from them about 10 cycles ago, and evolved to go solo. ERASED.

  Subject #007

  Verdict: Uses methodology from subject #004. Will now be referred to as Cycle 4. ERASED.

  Subject #008

  Verdict: Subject is using methodology 2 (endless kaiju barrage). ERASED. Cycle in progress, derailing. Stopping kaiju maker. Re-programming remaining shards to bud to hosts likely to improve people's lives and removing mental contamination.

  Subject #009

  Verdict: Subject is not granting powers per say, but twists target civilizations towards species-wide mad scientist syndrome. Still commits genocide at end of cycle. ERASED. Dub as methodology 9.

** Well, I may be wrong about this, but it seems to me that the only shards that would even have a chance of doing something against entropy would be thinkers and tinkers. Thinkers because perhaps that species would be able to see something in the data that you couldn't, and tinkers because of the unique position of technology wherein it can actually improve over time. It seems that it'd be really stupid to give shards that appear to violate conservation of energy (e.g. Most blasters) but don't (because that would discourage hosts from trying to find solutions). Tl;dr: Few shards would be actively helpful for their goals, and many are probably actively hampering them.

** I played around with similar thoughts a while ago. One interpretation I came up with is that the entities are not sentient, but shards are. The entity is essentially a giant biological bureaucracy of shards, and the shards are all highly selfish competitors. Were the shards to attempt to solve entropy directly, their methods would be determined not by the ideal value of information but by the ease of negotiations, political alliances, unimportant path dependent occurrences, that sort of thing. So using planets as natural experiments and tying each shard to a host that is difficult to manipulate offers a way of preventing biased incentive structures from determining the results of their study, which seems similar to the lines you're thinking along.

** I believe the Scion entity didn't trust itself to be creative. They seek out other life forms because they recognize their own lack of creativity, even though it does seem as if they are, in fact, capable of being creative. Eden seemed like it might be creative after being exposed to Abaddon, but died because creativity overwhelmed it, and it crashed.

On the one hand, we say that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, but what happens when you don't realize that you have, in fact, learned from history, but you don't /quite/ understand that you have grown?

One could also make the assessment that Eden and Scion were approached by a far more successful member of their race. Abaddon was a single entity, not a pair. After it interacted with Eden, eventually Eden and Scion's existence were ended. This indicated to me that Abaddon was far smarter and more creative than Eden and Scion. It set a chain of events in place which led to the death of two of it's competitors, and all their future offspring.

Abaddon started from the same source as Eden and Scion. Somehow, it developed differently. So on one level, the space whale learning process worked. Evolution will now move forward. Eden and Scion were simply unable to compete with the more advanced Abaddon.

Society could stratify around groups of people most capable of providing a habitable environment, competing for the most viable ideas and access to resources. People who can't figure a way to use their power toward this pursuit will still have the drive to make something of themselves, so cape conflicts are still plausible.

How do they survive the heat death of the universe? They don't have the answer, and if they're going to use simulations to figure it out, they need as much data as possible to justify the expense, by the time they reach that point.

The way Wildbow uses "creativity" is something that I don't really get. I simply intuitively don't buy the dualism between creativity and massive, massive processing power of the sort the Entities have shown. My natural instinct is that we focus so much on creativity and consider them different because of the weakness of our computers currently and because we can't really model others' brains that well, so everything gets put down to some unpredictable spark like "talent'. This shouldn't be a problem for the Entities yet they're still "dumb".

While creative beings, such as humans, can look at the question and the results of various attempts to find the solution and then grasp the shape of the answer, skipping over vast fields of solution-space that definitely do not contain the right answer.

The Entities have shown power that would make them need it as much as a plane would need a horse to traverse the landscape, even if the horse had advantages the gap in speed is just too great. Not to mention that they themselves can learn and it would be significantly easier for them to learn the valid human mental tools than it would be for humans to just explode in processing power.

****** Maybe the Entities figure that it's better to be cheap than to be fast, and so linking together a large number of small processors that already exist and need little to no resources to use (and that have heuristics that give them the possible ability to happen upon regions of solution-space that the Entities have a difficult time reaching due to their own mental architecture) is a good idea. Or maybe they do work on the problem on their own as well, and just figure that there's no reason not to take advantage of humans as well while they're at it.

Obviously it's a plot device to force the story to exist, but I don't find it sufficiently distracting to really stop me from enjoying the story anyway.
