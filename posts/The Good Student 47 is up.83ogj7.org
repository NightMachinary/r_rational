** So many answers, ugh this chapter was amazing.

It clears up why either Nic or Dizzy would work out as the person to walk through the door: Nic had the demon who learned how humans behaved and Dizzy was Delcroix's daughter. Also, it's been shown that Delcroix is on a tail end of Arcanum poisoning which would make possessing him so much easier.

Was Nic's obsession with Dizzy magic all along? That's some earth shattering news.

I can't overstate how much I enjoy the fact that a thousand year old demon conspiracy isn't foiled by a school boy, even if it's Nic. My only concern now is that Simole is part of the plan too.
