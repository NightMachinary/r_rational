** */Woah./* GOAT move Suze. Not quite sure how they survived, or what the hell that thing was that she flicked at Neklos, but this might be the most excited I've ever been for a new chapter.

And where are the others? Were Suze and Jake the only survivors from that room?

*** GOAT move?

They survived because Suze totally speedbagged the rules. Specifically, here's what she did:

1. Pull a spell component from her pouch. (free action, takes zero time)
2. Cast Plane Shift (standard action, you only get one per round)
3. Cast Celerity (immediate action, provides a readied action to cast another spell)
4. Using that readied action, cast PAO to create a black hole.

The way readied actions work is that they interrupt another action zero time before that action happens. Because of this, a series of actions and readied actions resolves last-to-first. So, here's what actually happened:

1. The PAO went off, creating a black hole which would have trapped them in time dilation (which is what happened to Neklos)...
2. Zero time later, the Plane Shift went off, dragging Suze and Jake (whom she was holding on to) out of the room and back to the Prime Material...
3. Zero time later, as they were in the middle of Plane Shifting, she threw a piece of antimatter into the room.

Where did the AM come from? Well, every wizard has a [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Spell_Component_Pouch][spell component pouch]]. "[A] spell component pouch is assumed to [contain] all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch. "

The material component for the spell [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/majorCreation.htm][Major Creation]] (which is based off of [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/minorCreation.htm][Minor Creation]] and therefore has the same material component) is "A tiny piece of matter of the same sort of item you plan to create" So, if you want to use Major Creation to produce antimatter, that means that your spell component pouch somehow contains antimatter...but hasn't blown up because /rules/. A spell component pouch isn't magical, so it wasn't disrupted by the Disjunctions that the heroes were hit with back in the Receiving Room.

The reason for the AM was to destroy the gems that were trapping everyone's souls (and material bodies), and then to destroy those material bodies. With them dead, they can be resurrected from outside the hole.

Neklos isn't dead, and he will Plane Shift out of the black hole and back to the Prime Material next round. Of course, what he thinks of as "next round" will be several trillion years (or more) in the outside universe....

EDIT: I should have mentioned: the reason she was able to do all this before Neklos could do anything was because she caught him in a [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/initiative.htm][surprise round]]. He wasn't aware that she was a combatant, so he was caught flat-footed and unable to take any actions.

Im kinda confused as to why Ice Afi was needed though. Wish can teleport people regardless of local conditions across planes. Give 29816 a ring of wish, order him to stand somewhere on the material plane and wish Lich Afi to him in a day. That way Lich Afi only has to /programmed amnesia/ himself to remember when he gets teleported. No worry about losing his soul then.

***** The point was exactly to get rid of his soul. His soul is permanently bonded to the Godshard, which gives Neklos power over him. He had no way of getting the shard out on his own, and no way to get rid of his soul completely. Basically what he did was to make a lifeboat for himself by copying himself into a different body, then destroying the original one. The new one has no soul and so it can't regenerate at the phylactery the way Afi can. In fact, it can't heal /at all/, without the help of a complicated ritual that requires lab tools. Still, it's better than being permanently under Neklos's thumb.

Best of all, Neklos is /absolutely certain/ that Afi is dead; Afi's soul is sitting right there in his hand, after all. He'll never bother looking for a copy of Afi elsewhere.

The Afi-lifeboat-created-by-Mindscrape doesn't have a soul and therefore doesn't have a phylactery, so he can't....

Oh, hang on.

Humans can go through the ritual to become a lich and make a phylactery. So, if lifeboat-Afi PAOs into a human, he could do the enlichment ceremony, which would give him a soul and a phylactery.

************** I don't think the lichdom ceremony creates one, I think PAO does it.

Biggest hint I can see for that is that undead beings become susceptible to spells like programmed amnesia and mindscrape once you PAO them into a mortal body. I think those spells might work by altering the soul along with the mind since they can do things like change alignment. Undead normally can't be effected by these things not because they're /mindless/ (Afi would probably have a few choice words for you if you claimed that) but rather because they're /soulless./ So that might indicate that they get a soul when they're in the right body.

Another bit of evidence: Neklos is using PAO to create humans, and then ghouls to drain them and turn them into more ghouls. The ghoulification process and undead creation in general (especally the creation of intelligent undead like vampires, who probably make up the priesthood of Neklos) probably requires a soul to be consumed/corrupted. So the PAO-people probably have souls.

They do. It was stated a few chapters ago that Mindscrape has a spiritual component, which is why it can change someone's alignment.

Technically /Afi/ is doing that. Neklos wants him to, of course, but needs to keep some plausible deniability. Even the other Death-oriented gods would jump on him if he were caught doing it himself.

************** Well, it may not be impossible to get around. It says it cannot increase those things, not that it cant mess around with what it already has...

If we use the ritual of unlearning/vitality (savage species pg149), Ice-fi can turn himself back into a human (for reals) by losing the lich template he inherited from Afi.

Regaining it is a bit weirder as we will have to use a ring of wish to get around the xp needed for creating a phylactery, but no big deal to a uber lich. Ice-fi gets the lich template and his ecl goes back up to where it started, less some gp, plus a soul(?). Same ecl that we started at, same abilites, no increase.

However, that hinges upon the interpretation that when ice assassin says "more powerful" it means more powerful than at the time it was created. If we want to be mean we could read that to mean it cant become more powerful at all, period. That intepretation leads to weird things though, like being unable to prepare spells or not being affected by buffs, so I wouldnt go there.

However, still not impossible to do. We just have to make sure to never go down in power. Using class level rebuilding from PHB2 Ice-fi can just swap out class levels to get Walker in the Waste 10 which gives the dry lich template. If we are being really pedantic, just make sure the levels we lose are "more powerful" than what we gain so we end up at a net loss. The swap happens simultaneously so it should work. It sucks, but this interpretation leads to worse problems than that.

Also thinking on it, I believe all Ice-fi needs to do to get out of the ice assassin restrictions is move to another body. The spell's effect is "one duplicate creature" so it might not follow their mind/soul if it moves out of that creature. Just as a /eagle's splendor/ targets a creature and doesnt follow that creatures mind if it moves. Of course ice assassin is is literally creating the creature and isnt an ongoing effect so that is a bit of a stretch.

As to the Wish / XP / SLA thing -- if you need to have the XP in the ring, just Wish for a RotW that has XP in it and Bob's your uncle.

As to moving bodies...one of the tricks with D&D is that just having the knowledge isn't good enough. You also need to have the levels, which you only get through XP. Afi switched into an Ice Assassin of himself, so he didn't give up much (if anything) in the way of spellcasting ability (his body had the spell slots). Shifting into, say, a 1st-level commoner? Unclear whether it's the body's spell slots or the mind's spell slots that matter.

********* You really need to keep watching. Korra and the entire cast show great development. It's as if the events in their lives actually mean something to them. There's much less "I'm the avatar deal with it!" and more "Am I relevant in the present world?"

Each season has gotten better and fixed many flaws from previous seasons. I ain't watch TV while doing something else so I tend to not really see the flaws.

**** Won't the time dilation slow down the time to their deaths too? The fastest death they would suffer would be from the energy from the matter-antimatter reaction reaching them in (distance from them to the antimatter when it starts reacting)/c which might be very small in terms of their referential, but would still be slowed down to infinity as it is inside the event horizon.

Or are we using here another definition of destruction due to antimatter?

*** Yeah, I'm not seeing how that didn't just implode the whole pl....

Wait a minute. Plane Shift. They were on a demiplane. Afi's base is on its own demiplane.

They just effectively annihilated it.

And that didn't kill Neklos right away, because if it did he would have seen it coming weeks in advance.

But when you are that close to an event horizon *time slows down.*

So if Neklos can see death 20 weeks in advance, the time dilation on that plane, within METERS of a 1 billion solar mass singularity must be on the order of millions to one at least. Anything inside there won't die - to the perspective of the outside multiverse - for centuries, even maybe millennia.

And the osmium, that was through FIRST, before the singularity took effect. So it will destroy the gems, and perhaps sever Death's hand, but not kill him.

Then the time dilation hits. The Plane Shift was part of the defining action, which Celerity was used in response to, so the Celerity effect happens a plank time length before the responding effect. That's not enough time for the gravity waves or time dilation to propagate to Suze/Jake, so they escape before it takes hold.

Jesus, this is a convoluted combination of real world physics and D&D magic action economy manipulation.

*Bravo.*

************ Yes, the original plan was to use a singularity to time-dilate Neklos; they just didn't think that one person could do it. In part that's because they were contingency-planning for the case where Afi / other people attacked at the same time they were getting into it with Neklos. In part that's because they figured that Neklos would use Celerity to beat the initiative of whomever tried to cast the PAO and might be able to Celerity multiple times in a round, so they would need multiple people with Celerity in order to beat him out.

They did not anticipate that Neklos would take them all out in a surprise round at the beginning, or that Suze would take Neklos out in a surprise round at the end.

EDIT: She knew about singularities because back in chapter 68, just as they were getting ready to leave for their meeting with Afi, Jake passed around a piece of paper telling them what to do. The writing on it was not explicitly revealed, but it was something along the lines of "when I give the signal, you cast PAO 'thingy to singularity of one billion solar masses.'"
