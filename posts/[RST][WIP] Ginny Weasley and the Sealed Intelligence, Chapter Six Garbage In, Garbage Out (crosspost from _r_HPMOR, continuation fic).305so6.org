** Flitwick seemed remarkably un-Flitwick-like here, in his speech patterns and personality - just felt like someone else who happened to be named Flitwick. Still, nice to finally get some explanation concerning wizards' definitions of the different spell classes.

Also, I don't know if I'm the only one, but I would definitely be in favor of a less frequent update schedule if it meant longer chapters. These are more like single scenes, which would benefit from being strung together into a /sequence/ of scenes, which would in turn make up a chapter. I have a hard time getting invested when the story is released in periodic-but-small snippets, rather than less-periodic-but-larger chunks. A personal preference perhaps.

*** Flitwick seems strange because he's clearly Mad-Eye Moody polyjuiced to impersonate him and try to tempt Ginny, the obviously-a-dark-wizard, with strange ideas about dark magic.

***** All joking aside, the time that "Pomfrey" used leglimency on Ginny was 100% Mad Eye Moody. These other mentions, yes, have been jokes, but there's nothing more serious than the threat of a Dark Wizard. We should note, also, that Moody completely called the entire thing (Quirrell being the source of the problems, etc) during Multiple Hypothesis Testing. It's hard to even call the man Mad when he's so 100% right.

** What brandalizing said about Flitwick times thousand.

There is NO way Flitwick knows about logic gates. There is no way he would talk about them even if he knew, as the kids wouldn't know what they are. He didn't even explain them.

How does Ginny know about logic gates too?

*** The logic gate terminology is definitely out of place. It takes months to teach the concept of a logic gate to muggles properly, it wouldn't be tossed into a first year magic class first day like everyone could be expected to understand it.

*** I was assuming these were curricular changes brought by Harry, now that he is a "permanent fixture in the school." Harry likely explained computer theory to all of the faculty over the summer, and figured out how charms and dark magic should actually be defined.

**** I don't think he is going to be able to do all that, explain logic gates and stuff to people who probably don't know what /logic/ means, nevermind gates. :D I don't actually think Harry knows what logic gates are, at least there is no reason to think he does.

I'm half software engineer, and I couldn't explain logic gates to anyone.

Oh /hell/ no. You did /not/ just pull the biggest red herring in the history of fanfiction. How would they even check for possession? The only way I know is the Marauders' Map (that's what that was, right? Although it would have to have been modified by Voldemort), and HPMOR never states that it was recovered from Quirrell's body.

I think that Pomfrey (Moody?) was lying because Harry suspects (or knows, having retrieved the map off-screen) that Ginny /is/ a Riddle and has judged that there's only harm to be had by her knowing (since there isn't anything she could /do/ about it except adapt, like he has), and Molly made up the whole family secret thing because she's terrified that Ginny would feel unbearably distanced from her own family otherwise (isn't it convenient that the only person Molly named who could do it is already dead?).

  (Note to the author: by having Pomfrey literally say it out loud, you make it look like you think your readers are idiots. With the revelation of the wards malfunctioning, the foreshadowing was already about as subtle as a punch to the face.)
