*** I'll take a look. I strongly disagree with you on Echopraxia, he took the Cthulu of Blindsight and implemented it in small obvious steps along my favored primrose path of transhumanity, and even after reminding me why I only want third generation tech I can explain and build myself, he still hit me with an eldritch horror that is the type of logical conclusion I'd build if I decided to be less sporting or forgot to value lesser intelligences across deep time, but still remembered some of my manners.

***** What happened was that he went far in one direction with Blindsight, and some people complained, so he tried to move in the other direction, and...well, there you have it.

He's hoping that the third book will strike the right balance.

**** Yes I referenced them in my first post, and f you look at the linked thread, where the author does comment, he's planning on finishing the sunflower series and treating firefall as a trilogy (which IMHO will be both a deeper ending than *Accelerando* and more depressing than the original *Evangellion*, and probably as revelatory, valuable, and painful as watching *Grave of the Fireflies*)

*** Double posting but I want to posit a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8omjxm/spoilers_discussion_of_the_freezeframe_revolution/e07i7ks][theory on the big reveal]] the drift is because the singularity drive has the fast AI and it's a aside effect of the uncompensated (spin?) effect of its processing . I'm weak on the various singularity processor models, but I'd bet it was an update via the gates, maybe the soap bubbles or something published via a gravity anomaly of a gremlin pointing it's fangs at the ship and I bet there is a breadcrumb in the specific phenomenon/numbers based on watts biblo, but I dont have the time or energy to dig for it at the moment.

** Something I found after I ran out of new things to listen to on audible and went digging. Watts, our eminent lord of evolution as Cthulhu, has a series of short stories about spam in a can human spawning wormholes for humanity's progeny/successors through deep time. It is very in line with both Accelerando and Blindsight/Echopraxia, just taken from the original assumption that a sufficiently paranoid NASA planner having read the aforementioned, and the Bobiverse, went about designing a black-hole powered von-neumann wormhole generator, with the desire for it to survive until heat death, and chose primates in a can as a fallback intelligence to boost to a generally sub-human but narrowly focused mission AI.

​

Edit: I found this thought provoking, and as existentially terrifying as you would expect from Watts. Feel free to comment on the series, or recommend things similar ( In addition to the above I've read Glasshouse, Saturn's Children, Neptune's Brood, Aurora, Diaspora, Methuselah's Children, Orphans of the Sky, Seven Eves, Passages through the void and the Prime Intelligence Series; and find them similar enough to not want them as recommendations, but do suggest them as points of comparison)

*** Hey, I'm curious and have failed at googling. What's the Prime Intelligence series? Thanks

**** My apologies the proper title is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1tgho0/the_metamorphosis_of_prime_intellect_bear_in_mind/][Metamorphosis of the Prime Intelligence]]. I've linked the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] thread because there's a lot of icky (snuff play, wireheading, ect) you get in an otherwise Wargames level (low fidelity, but good insight) story about a hard takeoff by a dumb AI making everyone immortal. Additional warning: it is strongly in the realist camp.

***** Ah, thanks. We have similar tastes, I've already read this one. I thought it was a good read, but the AI was less bright than I thought it should be.

** I really enjoyed the freeze frame revolution, so few books are willing to give deep time all the weight and existential force it can have.

As a standalone story though, I found it had a really bland resolution, even if it was a good example of an uncommon ending type.

The book would have been stronger it it had been published with the other three stories bundled into it, but even then the part that really holds me is the teaser for the next story in the universe, where there's homes of actual answers and real resolutions outside of "the crew are slaves to an insane ai doing a pointless job for eternity".

** Thank you for this. I didn't realize there were any more stories past The Island.
