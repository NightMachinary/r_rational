Thanks for all the encouragement so far, folks. It really makes the difference.


** To add on to the past encouragement, it made my night when I saw the notification about the new chapter. Keep on writing please!

** There is /no/ chance that they didn't at least glance inside that book, so what are they going to do in response? Did they change the Sequences to make the book less helpful in unmasking them? Are they going to up their game, and make Seahaven seem more rational? Or are they going to gaslight Truman, and try to make rationality itself seem irrational by giving him a world that doesn't conform to rational experiment, to discredit the Sequences?

*** Good thinking! I'm guessing They didn't make any changes (They hadn't planned to give them back at all)--I hadn't made the connection yet about the murder mysteries maybe being Their reaction to the Sequences rather than to Truman's different way of thinking directly.

I'm now imagining a spectrum of how-well-they-understand-the-Sequences-themselves, with the far end being "Time to use our best Rationalist thinking to outwit Truman who's now become a Rationalist like us!" and the near-side being "Geez, a corny self-help book about doubting everything around you is really NOT what we'd rather this guy have.". With the murder mysteries, I'm now imagining something in the middle on the lines of "So, this means he likes 'deducing' things, right? Let's set up some story arcs where he gets to deduce some things, then? --Wait, he just deduced US too HOW IS HE DOING THAT.". Speaking of which, the 'Mayor' was a nice tidbit about where his life goes... <having fun imagining>

** This was enjoyable! Thank you very much for writing it!

If I remember correctly, the first two chapters were wholly setting up the premise, with Truman firmly in Their palms--this chapter now has the incredibly satisfying clash-between-the-masquerade-and-the-Truth that makes the original /The Truman Show/ so enjoyable. <happy>

** "L. Ron Hubbard shoppes" shit this just got a lot darker. Is it all a scientology cult?

my other thought from this chapter is that it's REALLY hard to keep kids in on this kind of conspiracy. they just suck at keeping secrets and can be emotional, even trained child-actors.

*** Yeah, I've noticed that it's easier to write characters who give Truman clues when they're all ten. But he's just not ready to catch those clues.
