Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

Yes the word "blog" is in the URL, but also "the scientists who signed this appeal arguably constitute the majority of experts on the effects of nonionizing radiation. They have published more than 2,000 papers and letters on EMF in professional journals."

I really want 5G to /not/ kill us because VR stands to benefit /massively/ from it, but as the article says, in the 10 years since the advent of 4G "we are seeing increases in certain types of head and neck tumors in tumor registries, which may be at least partially attributable to the proliferation of cell phone radiation. These increases are consistent with results from case-control studies of tumor risk in heavy cell phone users."

Patent leaks for the PlayStation 5 and PSVR2 seem to indicate a high likelihood of the console using a personal 5G transmitter to allow the PSVR2 to be wireless like the Oculus Quest but without the graphical limitations of a mobile chipset. It's likely that all of the second gen VR headsets (Rift S and Vive Cosmos and Valve Index are all still first gen headsets, fyi) are going to try to go down that 5G path, and I think I might no longer feel comfortable with the idea of wearing something like that on my face for extended periods of time.

*** I read the article, and the author's position is also that all the other forms of cell phone radiation cause cancer as well. Given that the consensus is that exposure to other types of wireless transmission doesn't cause cancer (or at least, increase risk only extremely marginally), I'm inclined to believe the author ia misrepresenting the science and the consensus about cancer caused by 5g use. Not for malicious reasons, just out of motivated reasoning. He's been trying to prove cell phones cause cancer for a while now.

  Numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life.

Those sort of contradict each other. I'm sorry, but I really can't help but feel that one of them (yours) holds a lot less weight than the other.

There were a bunch of "experts" paid by the tobacco industry to talk about how allegations of negative health effects from tobacco were just ridiculous conspiracies and fear mongering, and that went on for decades, literally as long as it was physically possible for them to keep denying the fact that tobacco causes cancer. It could very easily turn out that the neo-'30s will be just chock full of brain tumors, and people will look back like they did with tobacco and say "how did they not realize that was going to have negative health effects?"

My main concern is that The Future^{TM} hinges on widespread adoption of 5G and so people are skipping to the bottom of the paper to write "and /therefore/, 5G is nothing to worry about." Like, Google's got Stadia coming out soon, and Microsoft is working on xCloud. There's big money - /unfathomably huge money/ - invested in the future of low-latency wireless streaming, y'know?

These aren't contradictory. Virtually anything can cause cancer under the right conditions, probably including [1-5]G transmissions. But it sounds like the consensus is that the increased risk is pretty minimal. If the risk was higher, you'd see news articles in the vein of "proximity to cellphone towers correlated with increased mortality rate." I can understand the concern that special interests are suppressing more research into the subject, or even just that wishful thinking makes us want to ignore the risks. But given the rapid increase in the ubiquity of these transmissions across the developed world, and now the increase across the developing world, we'd already be seeing extremely clear population wide-trends by plotting cancer rates against rate of adoption of these technologies.

Um, no, it doesn't. I had written off "cell phones might cause cancer" years ago as nonsense because I assumed it was the case that there was a consensus that the risk is negligible or else they wouldn't be mass manufacturing the things. But it sounds like that /isn't/ the case, based on a huge collection of people whose career is researching electromagnetic fields and non-ionizing radiation. When you say that it sounds like it /is/ the case, what are you basing that on? A quick skim of one section of one wikipedia article?

I don't know that we would. Like the article says, there's been little research into the effects of 4G. I smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for 10 years. I'm good right now, I lift weights and do cardio four days a week, but who knows, maybe twenty years from now I'll come down with a bit of lung cancer when I'm in my 50s or a spot of emphysema or bronchitis.

4G has only been around for 10 years. That's nowhere near enough time to be making definitive statements like "people who live near cell phone towers would be dropping dead by now if they were harmful." How many decades could you spend ten hours in an office building or an aeroplane without ever taking a breath that didn't contain tobacco smoke? Obviously the entire population of people who lived through the heyday of the cigarette didn't die despite the ubiquity of secondhand smoke, and obviously everybody knows somebody who's got a grandma who rocked a pack-and-a-half a day habit for multiple decades and she still lived to the ripe old age of 97.

  Asked why the company wasn't considering a 5G streaming approach, I was told that HTC is essentially erring on the side of caution when it comes to concerns about cellular radiation and opting not to introduce a product where a 5G radio is essentially strapped to the wearer's head.

  [[https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/htc-debuts-project-proton-concept-vive-headset/]]

  --------------

  Beyond positioning itself as a rival in one or both of the increasingly important mixed reality markets, HTC apparently doesn't want to place 5G hardware directly next to the user's head.

HTC is one of the three biggest players in VR, tied with Facebook and Qualcomm. They could make a ton of money by putting out a completely wireless headset that streams over a 5G connection, and they're not. If a major corporation is showing caution in the face of profit, I don't think it's unreasonable to be concerned about the technology.

It would indeed be useful as a prestige project, but if even a single article comes out with the headline "5G causes cancer," that would destroy faith in HTC and their headsets, even if the subtext of the article is '5G linked to increase in cancer risk...smaller than the increase caused by eating beef once a week.'

****** That's just the thing. A majority of headsets sold right now started off as Qualcomm reference designs. Qualcomm is "secretly" the driving force behind VR right now, and they've already got 5G wireless headsets working. Companies are expected to start making consumer products based on the Qualcomm reference design around late summer or early fall of this year.

[[https://www.roadtovr.com/ces-2020-qualcomm-chips-in-30-xr-headsets-xr2-release-date/]]

The 5G headsets are probably going to be in the same price range as the Oculus Quest, around $400.

Regardless, there's not much point in discussing it now, but I'm pretty sure this issue is going to be getting more public attention over the next six months to a year, so we'll just have to wait and see.

******* With regards to article one, while qualcomm does indeed provide the chips for standalone headsets, and standalone headsets have been extremely successful, there's not really a use case for wireless standalone headsets. The thing they're most likely to connect to is a 5G smartphone, except even a highe-end 5G smartphone isn't likely to be significantly more powerful than the headset itself, while also having a cost comparable to a desktop pc capable of using desktop vr. So the same kind of rich enthusiast I mentioned in my previous post is the target market here, and therefore the same concerns about bad press from 5G apply.

Meanwhile, the second article is written in a manner I find indicative of irreputability. There are naked appeals to authority ("We the undersigned, scientists and doctors," "Over 230 scientists from more than 40 countries"). There are plenty of italics thrown around, and even bolded italic passages. There are attempts to emotionally manipulate the reader by listing harmful things potentially attributable to EM radiation (e.g. "Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans.") without any critical analysis or comments about the relative severity and plausibility of these claims.

The article appears to be well sourced due to the prevalence of bright blue links, but of these links, the majority were

- Non-scientific sources like news articles and procedural documents, that support some tangential point but don't reinforce the central thesis that phone Em radiation causes cancer.
- Scientific sources that, from a skim of their abstracts, use emotionally charged or underspecified language that make me suspect motivated reasoning on the part of their authors.
- Scientific sources that reference thoroughly debunked topics, most notably "Electromagnatic hypersensitivity " which falls into the same class of bullshit as windmill sickness and people believing they have psychic abilities. And yes, "bullshit" is emotionally charged language on my part, to the point of being an ad-hominem. But I hope you can understand how disappointing I find the use of a syndrome of such a psychosomatic nature in what claims to be an evidence-based argument. It's entirely possible someone already predisposed to agree with the authors will read this and start feeling anxiety that they'll blame on "EM hypersensitivity," thus making this article actually harmful.
- Scientific sources that claim causation without properly eliminating correlation.

It would be a pain to list every hyperlink and categorize what kind of disreputable I found it to be, but the ones I found to be relatively reputable were as follows: [[https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2017/9218486/][1]] [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-011-9307-z][2]] [[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/26/055699.full.pdf][3]] [[https://publications.iarc.fr/126][4]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376454/][5]] [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061815000599][6]] [[https://www.spandidos-publications.com/ijo/51/2/405][7]] [[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/26/055699.full.pdf][8]], so you can ask me about why any link not in this list was excluded. From these links, I see a lot of "X causes a specific kind of brain cancer in rats," and while I wouldn't dispute the science done, I would dispute the relevance. I find it entirely plausible that there is a strong correlation between EM radiation and cancer risk. But that is not the same thing as a strong effect. Model organisms like rats are good for establishing correlations, but since 1992, [[https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/brain.html][brain cancer rates have remained steady or even fallen slightly.]] Even if phones are increasing the risk of cancer rates, they aren't doing so by much. And yes, obviously cancer has a long lag time, and 5G will require higher levels of EM radiation than currently. But in effect, we've already put into practice the precautionary principle by gradually introducing higher levels of EM radiation over long periods of time, to see minimal or even nonexistent effects.

This was obviously a paper written to be catchy and eye grabbing to the layman, rather than one intended to advance a serious argument against 5G. And while it's entirely possible to have people poorly argue in favor of good points, I find it conspicuous that while this paper refers constantly to "substantial increase[s]" and statistically significant increase[s]" in a number of bad things, including the word 'risk' which is repeated 12 times, the words "percent," "proportion," "likelihood," etcetera aren't used a single time.

Hard numbers sound threatening; If I can say, "eating beef increases risk of cancer by 5%," I'm going to say it, even though it's small, because that's a definite, hard number. Especially if there's a good way to make it sound bigger than it is. Take a look at this article about the cancer risk of [[https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/21639/cancer-prevention/diet-exercise/nutrition-diet/fruit-vegetables/meat-and-cancer/][red meat]] They mention that "one in six (or 2600) new bowel cancer cases in Australia were associated with consuming too much red meat and processed meat." That's not a huge increase; if an scientifically literate person reads it, they'll think "oh, so someone who eats a lot of red meat, which is likely comorbid with other cancer-causing activities, has a ~17% higher (or less) chance of getting certain forms of cancer. But it is still pretty eye grabbing, and you can bet plenty of people have already used that statistic to argue in favor of vegetarianism or pescetarianism to their families.

In the end, I still find it likely that the benefits of 5G will massively outweigh the health drawbacks, because the economic acceleration caused by the entry of 5G will enrich everyone through knockoff effects, and the one thing almost universally correlated with better health outcomes is higher wealth. From a utilitarian perspective, a marginally increased risk of brain cancer is a small price to pay for many people to put themselves into a financial position to have better healthcare availability. And of course, the fun of wireless VR is nothing to scoff at either; quality-of-life adjusted average years of life will almost certainly still increase, even if overall years of life decreases slightly.

** It's surprisingly difficult to translate a godlike character's abilities into a powerset while still remaining true to who they are. I've been imagining how Nightmare Moon would fit into the Wormverse if she were just teleported there because it seems like an interesting scenario, but there's so little information on what she can actually /do/. Illusions, dreams, creation of sentient life, solar system level telekinesis---all these things are canon, but then she's also not the best combatant in canon, especially if we take her sister as a model. So she's either incredibly weak as a Worm cape, or on the level of Scion. So far I've decided that if I were going to go with this idea, I'd have her theoretically able to perfom Scion-level feats, but be limited by a supply of magic that she can sap away in small amounts from capes to keep herself sustained and perform bits of magic, and then have her overarching goal be to touch the moon, which will generate her a supply of magic from then on. If I wanted to go further I'd make her individually claim every star after that for an incremental increase in power. That way the story naturally scales up as events progress, from street level to Scion level.

It's easy to put the dreamwalking in. The illusions. The usual pegasus flight, cloudwalking. Low-level telekinesis. Beams powerful enough to knock down buildings. All of that fits in quite neatly (especially if there's a mana limit, or if her powers are somehow weakened under sunlight).

But there's another side to Nightmare Moon; she's two personalities. Princess Luna, hiding deep inside, filled with anger at the world for ignoring her and remorse at what she did to the world in the grip of that anger. And, on the outside, surrounding and encasing Luna... the Nightmare. A psychic parasite that feeds on Luna's anger and self-loathing, encouraging both, transforming some of that emotion into extra power and subsisting off the rest. Controlling the body.

And... who says that the Nightmare isn't ready to give birth? The Wormverse is, by its very nature, /full/ of the sort of personality that would fall swiftly victim to some new Nightmares...

It's so light one might worry about silent low-oxygen asphyxiation where you're giddy and then you're dead (since the "oh no, I can't breathe" sensation is triggered by CO2 buildup, not lack of O2). Failing that, the helium would dissolve into your blood, proportional to the helium's partial pressure in the air you breathe (is that how that works?). So you'd have iron dust, some carbon, some paint -- dissolved into your blood.

But maybe it's the wrong question to ask how much helium gas you get. Because when it turns back, be it much or little helium, it's still going to be a filing cabinet's worth of matter. If you can fit say 3x16x20=960 humans into a smallish room, that'd be like grinding a 10%width x 10%height x 10%depth chunk of the filing cabinet into super-fine dust and mixing it into your blood (and a bit for your lungs) -- and possibly the helium may have entered into cells and interstitial fluid as well? I don't think I would care to try that.
