** Picture a grassy field.

In the center sits a small, pale, big-eyed creature with the power to escape from any visualized scene and move freely through the brain that imagined it.

It glances around nervously and-

-whoops, where'd it go?

Sorry about that! Keep an eye out for it in your daydreams.

** Ah, but the ability of the basilisk to brain-travel is dependent on its form being maintained by the brain it is in. If the brain is not actively thinking about it (i.e. it's thinking about literally anything else), then the basilisk cannot travel as it lacks incarnation. It may also wind up lacking agency permanently if it is forgotten about.
