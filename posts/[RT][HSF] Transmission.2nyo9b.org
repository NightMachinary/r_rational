** Obligatory grumbling about people eyeballing the odds of success when landing an interstellar ship. Surely they would have the capability to calculate some kind of quantitative estimate of the dangers involved.

** I found this to be a profound display of irrationality by both characters involved.

*** You'd think the crew would be a bit better trained on such a mission. A random captain of a modern airliner would probably prove to be a more suitable crew member.

**** It seemed to be a bit of straw man arguments re the value of an uploaded life vs. the value of species survival. Do we have any consensus as to what we think the rational answer was?

***** The rational answer is to shut up and multiply, as it always is. The complication here is the method of assigning value to the survival of the species, since you have to take the vast potential future impact of the civilisation into account. Still, I think we can agree that the utility difference is not infinite between choices. If the risk was sufficiently small, I would slow down to pick the transmission up, but it'd have to be pretty damn small. Trying to invent some kind of ftl and catch the transmission later on is an option as well.

** Nope. Good try! But nope. Both characters and the presumed civilization did not think this out. You sacrificed reasonableness to tell your story, which is bad for scifi in general and anathema to rationalist stories. You asked "how do I set up..." not "what if..."

While there are many indicating flaws, I'll stick with three:

- Why would you /ever/ design your colony ship to land completely? Aside from practicalities and design compromises for doing both interstellar travel and atmospheric landing, you'd making it that much harder to reach the bounty of space.

- In space, there is plenty of space. Not only would you know, to the millimeter if not the micron, how much room the receivers would require, why would you do it inside when there is infinite space outside?

- Everyone's dead. Take the dozen kilobytes to say why, first, and one repeat. Hell, take the space of a million of that billion to say why. What answer could possibly not be worth taking the transmission time to describe the problem? What answer could possibly give you the time to upload everyone, but not enough time to repeatedly describe the problem?

Thanks for trying, please do so again!
