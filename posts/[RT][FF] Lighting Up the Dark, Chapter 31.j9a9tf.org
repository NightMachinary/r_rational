** IT'S BACK!

Oh how long I have longed, how wait I have waited. Sweet nectar of divine narrative, it's back.

I'm sorry for Sakura (if she truly lost, we haven't seen that). I'm worried for the whole setting (being that if Hinata dies, Naruto will have to undo reality, and also fuck you overpowered homicidal Gaara). But most importantly I'm excited to get new chapter*/S/* (wink wink, nudge nudge)!

** This fic is back?

I cant, believe it! hahahahahaha

Anyways good stuff, had to reread previous chapter to remember story for this fic, after Waves Arisen and so many other fanfics it all jumbles up.

Overall cool stuff, maybe not have the cliffhanger from last chapter get skipped over, but so far so good.

**** If you've ever watched Naruto and gone 'why doesn't anyone test how momentum interacts with substitution, because either way it's abusable', well. Naruto does in this fic. But it's still well written and has sane power scaling so this doesn't turn into a fix-fic romp where he beats up Madara with the power of Science or whatever.

**** I just found this subreddit, like it a lot, but I'd like to see more links to first chapters and brief synopsis in the threads, at least every couples threads. Most of the times its like 20 posts either hyper focused on the chapter or vague discussions about how the last arc wasnt that great.

Sorry, just saw your post and felt this might be the most relevant area to post.

*** Not especially, no. This fic is always in the back of my mind, even if I don't spend enough time on actually writing it.

*** Summary: If you hang out on this sub and you like Naruto fanfic, you will probably like this.

--------------

The summary from chapter 1:

/Twelve years ago, the Fourth Hokage gave his life to seal Kyubey, the Nine-Brained Demon Fox, into the infant Naruto. Now, the time has come for a smarter, more creative Naruto to take on a world in which quick thinking and a solid grasp of strategy are worth a dozen rare techniques, and a brilliant mind can challenge even the deepest darkness./

/Inspired by an omake in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality./
