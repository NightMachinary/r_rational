*** Sweet, or Antonio Darling, is the Bishop of the Thieve's Guild, a publicly recognized and protected--but mostly disliked--religious order whose mandate is to fight corrupt abuses of power. Sweet is the quintessential people person: he's everyone's friend, he knows everyone by name, and they know him.
