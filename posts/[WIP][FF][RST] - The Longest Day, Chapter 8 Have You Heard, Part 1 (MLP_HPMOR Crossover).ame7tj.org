** One thing I can tell you is that this story is not actually a giant setup for a "Better Nate than Lever" joke. */OR IS IT?/*

*** I enjoyed the conversation between Dash and Applejack, though I was extremely confused by... whatever the hell was going on with the Defense final. If confusion was the goal, then yeah. Well done.

I have a three-year-old kid who occasionally watches Friendship is Magic, but I haven't paid enough attention to the episodes to really appreciate any in-jokes or references. I'm guessing Fluttershy being unintentionally creepifying is one of them?

**** Most of the chapters I had planned out originally were meant to be roughly 10-15k words each, including this one. But I've broken a lot of them into two chapters just so I can release content a bit more consistently. The remainder of the defense final (and its initial explanation) will be found in Have You Heard, Part 2. The short version though is that an enchantment has been cast for the duration of the battle so that Rainbow Dash and Applejack can't understand Harry's army, and vice versa.

**** As for Fluttershy, the joke is more that she's just being normal Fluttershy and the Slytherins are reading /way/ too much into her actions. Usually when a Slytherin is nice, it's a red flag that they're up to something dangerous. And Fluttershy is almost always nice.
