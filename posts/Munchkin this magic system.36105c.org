For a while, I've been working on the background for a roleplay. The fundamental caveat is essentially, that each character requested the enchantement of an item (creating a "talisman") from a magic-imbuing object when they were sixteen (the age wouldn't actually matter, it's just when the fictional society feels its citizenry are mature enough to make a responsible request.)

Now, the caveats of the talisman system are as follows-

- Each person can only get one talisman enchanted, period. This is a fundamental restriction of talisman-granting object.\\
- Talismans are transferable (can be bought, sold, or stolen.)
- The magic-imbuing object is not any smarter than a human, and talismans that require information greater than that which a human can comphrehend cannot be created.
- The power of any individual talisman is auto-balanced by the talisman granting object, so no individual talisman is objectively any better or worse than any other talisman. Balancing almost always takes the form of either limiting how often a talisman can be used (ex. Once per day, or once per moon), or inserting a prerequisite to use the talisman (will only work on blue moons, will only work for a user once, will only work once period, will only work in the presence of a blood sacrifice, etc.) how a talisman has been balanced isn't immediately apparent. It may take some testing to find out, and for talismans with particularly large drawbacks, may never be found out.\\
- Drawbacks to a talisman cannot be requested. Any drawbacks requested are treated as a feature, and require even more drawbacks.
- A broken talisman will result in one of two things. If the power of the talisman is intrinsically tied to the talisman itself (for example, a talisman that gives a sword the ability to cut through rock), the power of the talisman will vanish until such a point as the talisman in question is repaired to functionality.\\
- A talisman ceases to function immediately after the brain death of its creator. In the rare cases where that person is somehow brought back to life, their talisman will remain nonfunctional and they will be unable to create a new talisman.\\
- Talismans violate conservation of energy, because magic.

For some examples of talismans (to demonstrate their general power level):

A talisman given the general power to create fire may maintain a candle flame indefinitely, or briefly summon small fireball. Alternatively, it may serve as a flamethrower, but only on every third day.

If the talisman levitates objects, it may be restricted to a certain class of object (ex. Furniture, wooden objects) or have a usage limit (any one object, but only once per month, or only for ten minute periods, followed by 20 minute cooldowns.)

In any case, the exact effect of the talisman varies based on the intentions of the creator.

Now, how do you think a /society/ can munchkin this system? Individuals can't do so, because of the inherent balancing, but a group of talismans can be a lot more than the sum of its parts. For example, I already plan to have a clockpunk guild where the requirement for entry is to have a talisman be a perpetually rotating key, in order to run, the infrastructure of the country.

Keep in mind that this civilization is a few hundred years less advanced than our own, so stuff like batteries and rockets aren't well know. For the sake of argument, assume about early renaissance technology.

Edit: after some feedback, I've decided to create a more consistent approach to balancing. I'll post it ASAP, but it'll take a while because I just got my wisdom teeth pulled.

Edit 2: here's a slightly better balancing system, based on feedback:

- The super talisman is as intelligent as the human requesting the talisman. It will balance based on two factors how that person interprets the possible uses of the talisman (so if someone smarter than you thinks of a really powerful talisman, and tells you without telling you about the exact application, the talisman-granting object will underestimate the true power of the talisman.) The second factor is how powerful other talismans with similar abilities are- if you ask to create a fireball creation talisman, it will review other fireball-creation talismans for their drawbacks and how useful they've been. That is to say, the talisman granter will adjust the power of the same class of talismans over time. centuries ago, a fire-granting talisman would be a lot more useful, and therefore have larger drawbacks. With easier access to firestarters, fire granting talismans are comparatively less useful, so they lose some of their drawbacks.
- The super-talisman takes 12 hours to "think" about each talisman before granting them. It can think about an number of different talismans in parallel, each talisman with the intelligence of the person who requested the talisman.
- while the super talisman is only as intelligent as the person requesting the talisman, there is a single caveat to this- the super talisman has all information on how talismans have been used in the past, and can take that into account when reviewing drawbacks to a possible talisman. Furthermore, being willfuly ignorant about the potential power of the talisman is useless- if the talisman, given you knowledge, your intelligence, your capability at reasoning, and its information on talismans can determine the possible overpowered uses for the talisman that the person who formulated request of the talisman intended, it will take that intent into consideration for balancing.
- note, however, that the super-talisman isn't infallible, nor will it consider how people who didn't formulate or speak the actual request would use the talisman. If you tell your dumb friend to ask for a device wave to emit light waves at any point in the spectrum, the super-talisman may or may not figure out that the device can be used in an x-ray machine as you intended, but unless you thought of it yourself, it won't realize you can make an ion drive for a starship. (note: example is anachronistic with stated time period.)
- The super-talisman interprets wishes in terms of how the person asking for an enchantment would interpret them, but in a restrictive matter. That is to say, wording matters, but intention will still carry through. If you ask for "a shirt that improves speed" and you think that a shirt that improves speed just make you magically a faster runner, wearing the shirt will improve you speed, but because you'd realize speed =/= velocity, your speed would only increase in a straight line, so you couldn't also change directions or slow down faster. On the same thread, if you received instruction from someone else to make a talisman where you don't properly understand the talisman's function, because the intention is to create a new form of overpowered talisman where neither the talisman requester or talisman creator could deduce the method in which it would be overpowered, the super-talisman will give a best-guess interpretation, which rarely functions the way the person who created the talisman request intended.
- "Balanced" is determined by how people would perceive owning the talisman. That is to say, it's a cultural definition of fairness, which can be manipulated (and, invariably, is) I can't give exact definitions of balance, because this is intended to be a narrative tool that I can manipulate so that my player can't make their characters too powerful. For a general idea of the state of balanced, however, consider the following things: the most common "balanced" object is an indestructible key in an enclosure that rotates so that it produces a constant torque enough so that 2 of them, attached to wheels and axles, can move a small cart of produce at 10-15 miles per hour indefinitely. (note that the key needs to be removed to stop the rotation, or manually blocked from rotating, a key with on-off capability would produce less torque.) Furthermore, consider that the technology level is approximately early renaissance. (I'm going for clock punk.)
- Based on feedback, I'm changing the age where a talisman can be obtained to 16 and later. (or rather, it's between 15-16, as they're first able to get a talisman a set amount of time after conception, but 16 is the age used so assigning talismans is less of a logistical headache for the government.)

more feedback is welcome!

How again?

Doesn't this mean you can explore the fundamental nature of the universe by comparing examples of manipulations of forces and phenomenon against an objective ruler? By simply having citizen scientists ask for and measure arbitrary physical effects against each other, don't you have something that would allow you to explore the very nature of consciousness (for mind altering talismans) against something like boiling water?

How does altering minor electrochemical states in the brain compare to creating self-sustaining chemical reactions (fire) from nothing? Seems like creating elemental fire is a lot more energy intensive, and actually violates fundamental physical laws. So things more concrete, like turning tons of sugar into smaller quantities of hard drugs and mind controlling hundreds of people by tweaking conceptual memory formation while you talk, should be "balanced" against creating a fireball from nothing once per day.

This talisman granting object seems bigger and more complicated than the magic itself. I think you need a different way to balance things than simply *declaring* them balanced.

Oops. Slavery worse than has ever existed on the Earth is now not only possible, but easy and desirable. Might want to make a change there, like that they don't work /at all/ for anyone but their creator. Even then...slavery seems like a very good option. 15-year-old soldier conscripts seem inevitable, even with a non-transferable plan.

Best part is, these will be the "best" kept slaves ever, living long, long lives of absolutely nothing. Create food, create water, minor healing, and webs and stuns for everyone 24/7. Bonus points for hibernation effects keeping everyone in magical stasis.

Keep the over-16s healthy but in chains and pregnant for their entire lives. Promises of instant death for entire families from slavers holding hordes of actually useful combat talismans if anyone steps out of line.

Seriously, don't allow transfer of power if you don't want a crapsack world ruled by the first guy who comes up with a mind control device, or makes a cave full of stunned, former talisman owners.

And that's if brain-in-a-jar /isn't/ possible. If it is:

*** Crapsack world, that was my first assumption on reaching the point where talismans are transferable.

In that world the only rational thing to ask for is a talisman that confers a benefit only on the creator. The only way out is if the talisman-creator is not unique or is an attribute of the world, so competing societies can develop, and so liberal/enlightened societies where people can feel safe asking for talismans that can potentially be stolen or coerced would have a long term advantage.

That also leads to more interesting stories, set in the early years of the growth of the great society. Or stories set in a world where a society has started a slide back towards totalitarianism, where the belief in the values of the enlightened society keeps people generating socially responsible talismans for a generation or two before the general realization hits... you could even toss in an Aesop for contemporary America and corporatism. :)

*** To get a crapsack world like that I think you have to make some assumptions about how powerful a talisman actually is. Keeping a person alive is expensive, even if you're just doing the bare minimum. If you're keeping someone in chains, you still have another mouth to feed. Because you can't be cavalier about their death, you have to take at least moderately good care of them, which means some overhead associated with this operation.

If the costs associated with keeping a person chained up in a dungeon aren't exceeded by the benefits of their talisman, a rational person wouldn't keep people locked up. If you can just take their talisman for yourself, then there's not much point making them slaves anyway; better to have them as laborers working the fields, because it's not like they can get their talismans back from men in suits of armor, sharp swords, and a talisman monopoly.

So sure, if a talisman's upper limits allow it to produce enough food to feed a handful of people indefinitely, maybe you get people in dungeons. Otherwise, I don't really see it - keeping people in prisons is expensive, and labor is valuable.

Buying is better because if the expectation is that any talisman you make is subject to confiscation people are just going to make talismans that aren't useful to the powers that be.

**** I think powering talismans down to the point where one talisman can't feed and water two people per day is a little silly. Compared to D&D-level effects, that is really very little effort. And at that point, keeping factory farms of people becomes a reality.

Assuming talismans aren't worth a dirt farmer's lifetime work output is another huge stretch. I can't see how reality bending magic wouldn't be worth a single peasant locked in a tiny jail cell compared to them working a field. And if you already have an overpopulation problem, the opportunity cost is even lower.

Also, allowing them to continue dirt farming, with the associated dangerous and relatively short life, could mean a magic item disappearing at a very inconvenient time. Much safer and easier to stuff them all in holes, get /other/ peasants to work the fields, then with farmed talismans cast simple healing spells every week and feed and water daily. Magic restraints or stasis would be nice, but not required. Especially when you can build and excavate with magic.

/Modern/ prisons are expensive. Magic, inhuman, medieval prisons, if at all possible, are almost just the cost of labor.

As for the second part of your post, there is an in-universe reason for why that doesn't happen, but it's not applicable to this post.

As for the "extend duration of talisman after death idea" that's a pretty good idea. The drawbacks to something like that would be pretty big, though.

**** I suggest making the power granting talisman as smart as the smartest person who has ever used it. That keeps developmentally retarded or intentionally damaged people from being taken advantage of, while leaving it as a "good genie" for creating talismans. Also, this prevents simple yet powerful instructions from being hammered into compromised users by brainwashing, indoctrination, and drugs.

--------------

I also suggest the magic effects be limited based on how much work is required to reproduce the effects without magic, roughly including all iterative cultural developments required to produce and support it.

For example, creating a tame horse to ride or a magic fireball would then be orders of magnitude easier than creating a steel sword from nothing. Horses were tamed relatively easily, and raising and training one requires not much more than time and a stable of horses to breed. Basic fire is long mastered by humanity and a flaming ball of pitch is physically possible and doesn't require much cultural knowledge or personal skill. Steel is expensive and requires a huge tech base of knowledge to invent and create.

Creating a wall of earth would be similarly possible and even easy, while creating a rock made of radioactive elements as a Renaissance-era user would be flat-out impossible. Even for someone who knows how a cart works, creating one would be much more powerful an effect than creating that tame horse, even if currently buying a horse is harder or more expensive than buying a cart. The chain of effort, historically speaking, is much longer for the cart than the horse.

Creating a /thinking, talking/ sword (or horse) would therefore be impossible. No one has ever done it before, and the talisman couldn't cobble together one from scratch without the person using it having some idea how it would work.

That would make talismans force multipliers, not universe breaking levers.

--------------

Overall, making the talisman fallible and driven by historic precedent is a good idea. But, as a thinking device, it needs a goal. What is it trying to balance against? Excess damage to other people? Satisfaction of users? Imbalance compared to human endeavors? Other talismans and their effects?

Once you have that goal, I think you'll have a working magic system as well as a good plot hook.

** The key is probably figuring out how this balancing system works and then exploiting its weak points. Can the balancing system make mistakes? The implication is that it doesn't take into account how two (or more) talismans can be combined, so that's at least one avenue of attack. Finding the function by which power is capped is supremely important; utility, lethality, energy output? There's some intelligence behind the handicapping, which means that it can be gamed to some extent, at least if we assume that the talismans are reasonably consistent in how or what they limit.

Leaving that aside (because that's not your actual question), I would expect a society to:

- Create an index of "known talismans" which most people are encouraged to draw from, to lower the costs associated with people trying to figure out the limitations of their talismans, and prevent them from creating "dud" talismans whose limitations are so restrictive that they're never known (and the talisman is thus never used).
- Create standardized talismans. If there are a hundred talismans that all operate effectively the same, training people to use them is easier, and a replacement can always be procured. A prerequisite for quickly teaching people how to use something is ensuring that the tool always functions the same way.
- Put talisman creation and distribution under control of the state. It's all well and good for people to want their own talisman, but there's not much practical reason to allow that. Have people create a specific talisman at the age of sixteen, then take that talisman from them and hand it over to a soldier as part of their "kit".
- Because they stop working on brain death, talismans can be used for long-distance communication, though only in simple binary, and then with a bit of noise. Still probably useful.

****** To be honest i think such an issue is inherent in arbitrary wishes, to fix the issues i raised specifically you could a. impose limiting maximum power, so max energy\radius of effect\etc. b. set only specific set of base powers, so for example only energy based \physical properties augmentation\etc. basically think of a few base classes of powers and limit to those, and only enable the power to be based on them in a way that the user defines, so you could make logic circuits etc. that can do more "complex" actions, but they will no longer be arbitrary(this is kind of similar to the demons in EYs "Precisely Bound Demons")

limiting the talismans only to "simple" powers would prevent a lot of the possible power cheats, but would also make them much less "fun" and "magical", so a lot of clever-but-not-overpowered tricks will be lost as well.

******* maybe something along the lines of having a directly accounted for "complexity penalty," like first defining that all possible actions of a talisman have to be possible by expelling power through predefined ways (whether through, say, EM waves or increasing the strength of gravitational fields, or creating matter or increasing kinetic energy, etc.). How hard it is to make a definition is then correlated with the restrictions the super-talisman puts on the individual talismans For example, a talisman that just puts out heat energy is the simplest possible talisman, then a talisman that only puts out heat energy when the closes person to it desires that it does so, then a talisman that puts the heat energy out in a pre-defined pattern on command, and so on. A talisman that "makes the user lucky" by making the user constantly stumble into people who can and will help them with their problems would need massive predictive powers to determine how to use its telekinesis in such a way that it's always beneficial for the holder, but would be less complex and therefore have fewer penalties than a similar talisman that functions by implanting subliminal suggestions by expelling EM waves that affect the brain, because even though it would take less energy, accurate mind-reading /and/ mind affecting is a lot more difficult that just mind reading.

I'm not sure how I could quantify that in such a way that PC's could understand and have control over their talismans, though, which is, as always, the major problem.

That being said, my intention to begin with was to make talismans mundane, even to the reader, to reflect the fact that they're old hat for the people in the RP, and balance the system around making talismans more useful in the long run for everyday tasks rather than slaying monsters. The sense of "magic" would come finding information about the mysterious surrounding polities (which have their own talismans), and the origins of the top-level talismans.

But once you can do that kind of stuff with the talisman directly it has the potential to be overpowered, especially with the ruleset you defined which is based on the number of humans that exist, and what they think. Anything that could directly effect one or more of those two will be overpowered.

  Talismans are transferable (can be bought, sold, or stolen.)
#+end_quote

The common individual will never own a talisman, and the nobility will own millions. Individuals will be given very specific direction, on pain of death, as to what talisman they will be requesting and giving to the nobility. The age of granting is not 16, it is the youngest someone can reliably repeat their noble's order for a talisman. It's even younger in a failing state when the nobles get desperate.

The nobility will be incredibly powerful, because they'll have a super-powerful once-per-decade talisman for each hour of the day. Nobility will be immortal, if the talismans can affect longevity at all, otherwise hereditary.

The talismans the nobility request, however, will be so trivial they can be tested instantly, probably a mood ring. Think of old monarchies making alliances: they'd either explicitly swap family members as hostages or implicitly by marrying them off. The sending family would keep the hostage's talisman as a way to check in that that they're alive and in good health (or maybe even spy a bit).

Nobles will live like dragons on hoards of talismans. There will be a lot done to ensure that their guards are loyal (eg. talismans to detect and punish theft). Because they'll want use of more talismans than they can hold, they'll rarely leave. But they might lend out a large part of their hoard to their armies to go seige another noble for their hoard. Actually, yeah, seiges will probably never happen if (as you say elsewhere) meta-talismans are rare. Offensive talismans will be more powerful than defensive talismans, much like nowadays artillery is more powerful than castles - so nobody builds them. But a hoard of talismans is so dang useful... yeah, really turns on how many defensive talismans you can accumulate. If a lot, castles. If not, endless total war.

Fertility, reliable food, and maybe medicine (but not medical talismans used on plebs) are important to the nobles. Gotta keep the talismans working. You don't say if it's obvious look at a talisman if'll work or its creator has died, but that's a minor inconvenience for the noble: have a meta-talisman that detects dead talismans every so often.

They'll have telegrams, too. It's hard now to imagine life when major news moved at about 4 mph (see The Discovery of France for an exploration of this), but it took a lot of time for major news (death of the king, war, etc.) to pass by rider and minor news could take much longer. This society will just require some kids to get talismans that can be used as telegrams. Even if you find some way to tweak your setup so talismans are tradeable but there are no god-kings, every farming village would want this.

Actually, why not an assassination talisman? A noble orders a talisman that, when used, kills a specific named person to bump off a rival. Even if it's only useful once ever, that's fine, you get to kill that pesky rival without an invasion and then your guard puts the requestor to death - why waste fifty years of grain that could go to the peon who requested the talisman that keeps your fingernails manicured?

etc, etc, etc. Total crapsack world.

*** Trust me, there are in universe reasons for stuff like this being averted. I'm not going to into the majority of them here, but think- if people are afraid of nobles stealing their talismans, all they need to do is specify that only people who posses only that talisman can use it. Given a few years/bloody civil wars as the nobles lose the power of their talisman as their subjects get killed, and pretty soon power isn't so concentrated. Of course, the rich and wealthy will still hold disproportionate amounts of talismans, but not so many as to be able to transform the culture into a dystopia.

In the past things like this might have happened (haven't thought of much background) but the society has spent quite a while with talismans, and as we see in the real world, the living standards of the lower classes does have a tendency to improve over time.

**** So you explicitly asked for folks to munchkin your rules and then left out rules? Thanks for wasting everyone's time.

And you're wrong. When I say "noble", don't think "prince", think "living deity". Nobody would told they can restrict their talisman to themself. Let's have a story:

You're a young man growing up in the city not too far from the capital. Your whole society worships one god, Phil. Phil is a loving, wonderful god, not like the scummy, wretched gods of faraway states. Your parents worship Phil devoutly. They bring you up to love and respect Phil. They tell you stories of when Phil visited the local cathedral (I mean, Phil laid the capstone three hundred years ago, but his /latest/ visit) and bestowed blessings on the people: Phil cured a blind child, gifted wonderful crafts, and righteously slew a murderer with magical fire. This visitation was one of the highest moments in their entire life.

You are looking forward to your talisman ceremony more than any kid has ever looked forward to a bar mitzvah or christening or thread ceremony because Phil is so obvious, so real, you can still see the scorch marks on the wall of the cathedral! It's a few feet to the left of the gallows where they hang the wicked children who fail in their talisman ceremony and have to be ritually sacrificed lest the entire town be tainted by their curse.

The ceremony is a mystery - I mean, everyone knows that afterwards you'll get your adult name and be of majority and you'll go to heaven after you die (which won't be for a while, Phil's really looking out for you). But what happens in the talisman ceremony? Nobody talks about it, but you know you and the other kids your age will go to the church where the priest (who performs minor miracles by the grace of Phil, peace be upon him) will lead the ceremony.

Finally the big day comes - for the first time you get to wear the robes all adults wear to church. Your father saved up months to buy the cloth and you've seen your mom working late into the night to sew them. They're obviously not blessed yet, but you're excited just to be wearing them - maybe you run down to the town's mirror to admire yourself, careful not to get them dirty. But still, you arrive early to the cathedral, can't be late for the big day. After the week's usual ceremony you and your friends are all called up on stage and everyone makes a big fuss over you. Then you head downstairs, and the priest tells you that it's time to make a special prayer to Phil. Flavio, that annoyingly preachy devout kid, gets to go first (and the rest of you go in The Order of Asch, which just means most-devoted first, for some reason). He reads the words over a talisman and after the priest listens and receives the talisman, he bestows the blessing of Phil and Flavio glows with a miraculous, unearthly light! His robes are marked by the light, recording his blessing for all to see at church every week. Flavio is sent upstairs to be received by the congregation, who will see proof of his devotion to Phil - why, you can already hear their cheering!

Now it's your turn, and you receive a scroll to read, asking for - I don't know, something about manicuring fingernails? But you know it doesn't matter what it says, it's time to prove your devotion by reading it. Your whole life has been leading up to this moment and you're about to become a man! What do you do for your god Phil?

I fail to see how people are unable to munchkin them. autobalancing effects individual talismans- an "indestructable" sword might only be indestructible between 8-10 pm, but, say, an indestructible cup might be indestructible all the time. I've mentioned that meta-talismans are inherently powerful, and therefore get autobalanced based on how strongly they interact with other talismans, but that still allows your indestructible cup and a magic-fire-generating talisman to combine into a directional rocket engine.

That being said, your story is pretty interesting, and I can definitely see the existence of cults based on a single person whose acquired a great deal of talismans. Here's a link to the planning document I wanted to use for the RP for you to get a bit more information on the talismans. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15SnoRbLM1PhhqzCdjbviO4h9njcqJleNRr38QI-XoW4/edit?usp=sharing]] You have raised some good points, and I've admitted myself that the balancing system needs to be re-evaluated, so i'm looking for advice.

So I just punted on the balancing thing and thought about how someone would build a culture around it.

In the doc you link you talk about there being a single super-talisman the rest are created from. Why didn't anyone build a wall around it and charge admission? Or sit on the road and rob people on their way out?

A talisman is /valuable/. Pople want and take valuable things from each other - not just by trade but by force. You have an economic/political problem, not a magical one. :)

  alright, I've revised the balance system, but I'd still consider it incomplete. Could you tell me any other ways to make it better? Remember, my reason for making this is to keep players from creating OP talismans, but I'd still like a way for them to get a general idea what constitutes as "powerful" and what kinds of drawbacks their request would be likely to get.
#+end_quote

(just reposting this statement across top level comments.)

As for the super-talisman thing, the general idea is that there are multiple top-level talismans which each do different things, one of which is the super-talismans used to create minor talismans. The implication is that they have been taken and warred over, and the reason each polity corresponds to a top level talisman is because polities without a top level talisman inevitably are out-competed by societies with a top level talisman. Note, however, the fact that i never implied that the top level talismans are balanced across each other, which implies that the societies with only one top level talisman that have stood against societies have comparatively more powerful talismans.

I admit, though, that I haven't really thought about international relations. I'm sure that polities would try to get people across to use gain the strengths of other talisman, although that'll naturally be mitigated by stuff like people having their appearances affected by which talisman they gain power from, and the individual restrictions of the top-level talismans.

Phil the living god has five thousand soldiers willing to die for him, each carrying their own magic missile taslisman. Phil also has magical artillery.

********* You misunderstand. There's only one super talisman that makes new talismans. The rest do stuff like, for example, significantly increase the longevity of people who use them, or, I don't know, give +2 to intelligence. The talisman-granting talisman is in the hands of a single nation, so if they notice an internal threat, they can just prevent anyone with a connection to Phil from obtaining talismans. Sure, phil can gain a lot of power, and potentially (with careful planning) institute his own phil-ocracy, but he wouldn't do it unopposed, whether by others in the nation who would rather "Bob" be the great leader of the nation, by the current government (which, instituted by people sick and tired of people named phil trying to take over the world, would naturally have countermeasures) or by the simple fact that a talisman who's purpose is exclusively to negate the effects of a single other talisman is by definition less useful (since the change in utility of the person who possesses the talisman can only be equal to the potential utility of the talisman, and is invariable smaller because the person with the specific-talisman-negation talisman first has to find the original talisman) and would therefore have fewer (if any) restrictions on use added for balancing purposes.

Thanks for making me think, though. This is definitely turning into a useful discussion :)

********** I've been turning it over in my head, and I think maybe we've talked past each other because talismans are such a fun idea and you want your clockpunks, so they don't seem like a commodity. Let's get more obvious:

Imagine a world in which every 16 year old is given $10,000 by visiting a super-talisman in a specific place. They can request the form it'll take: maybe gold bullion, dollars, a check, a jewel, etc. There may be tradeoffs: maybe they end up getting $1,040 dollars once per year for ten years (or whatever, I'm not doing the Net Present Value calculation), or maybe their jewel is unpolished and needs finishing, whatever - the magical system autobalances it so everyone gets exactly $10,000 worth of value. In other places with other super-talismans maybe you can only get specific money-related things like an +1 point on your checking account's interest rate or -5% to your credit card's rate. Through some magical handwavey process (capitalism), even these limited bonuses can be transferred to other people.

Now let's imagine how society incorporates this phoenomenon, and keep in mind that the value of these compounds: if I have ten people's $10k, I can offer you more for your "$10k over 10 years" and have a tighter profit margin (or just hire more guys to take it from you).

What percentage of these 16 year olds have their $10k ten years later? A year later? A week later? The society will extract that from them, fast, whether it looks voluntary ("throw yourself an adulthood party!", "buy your guild apprenticeship", "make the down payment on your house", "you get to pay off your childhood debt today") or mandatory ("it's a tribute to Phil", "your money or your life", "we're going to borrow your kid for a week and take them to the super-talisman"). People don't just leave valuable things in other people's hands, especially not in the hands of inexperienced kids.

Your talisman system has 90% the same problems as this setup (that 10% is the "it stops working when you're dead"). Getting talismans compounds how easy it is for you to get more talismans. In a medieval low-tech low-institutional-trust world, this looks like warfare, religion, theft.

Extra credit version: in /our/ world, every 16 year old is given this commodity in the form of their future labor as soon they are no longer considered restricted child labor. Explain how society has commodified and extracted this talisman with an eye towards our stunning inequality in wealth. Course textbooks: On The Wealth of Nations, Das Kapital, Samuelson's Economics.

**** What's the conversion rate? Would an amulet whose function is to recharge other amulets get the drawback of receiving any remaining cooldown on the recharged amulet, or more, or less?

For example I could imagine the following interactions:

- Recharging a once-ever amulet renders the recharger inert

- Recharging a once-per-person amulet makes any future amulets recharged by this recharger unable to be used by the people given another chance at the recharged amulet

- Recharging a twice-ever amulet with one charge used permanently halves the power of this recharger, making it unable to recharge once-ever or once-per-person amulets, but, for instance, restoring an unmodified number of charges to all amulets described in these cases where the maximum number of charges was doubled. Example:

  #+begin_example
     fresh recharger -> ((5/6)->(6/6)) -> ((0/2)->(1/2)) -> ((1/3)->(2/3)) -> inert recharger
  #+end_example

Edit: Hmm, up to this point it can be modelled as having a mana pool per person that can be temporarily or permanently reduced. Can someone throw some more example amulets at this recharger to see what drawback the recharger would accumulate?

(Yes, of course requesting all this makes it even worse, but I'm asking whether not specifying the above would produce an amulet with balancing roughly in line with this, to see whether equivalent exchange applies to meta-amulets.)

By the way, I'm interested in joining. Is this online?

***** From comments on this thread, I noticed that the balancing system is pretty poorly defined, so I'm going to think of a better definition, post it on the OP, and notify you. The balance system was primarily intended so that I could stop mary-sues in their tracks, so I didn't make it as specific as I should have to allow smart players a greater modicum of control over their powers.

Those are some pretty good suggestions though :)

As for the RP, it's not out yet- I've been working on the wordbuilding for quite a while, but don't quite have a story to put my players through. Note that the rp would actually be a fantasy kitchen sink, though- humans (which all PCs are required to be) get the talisman granting super-talisman, but other species will get super talismans that grant extreme longevity, or extreme hardiness. (in general, other talismans are more powerful in a specific area, but the human supertalisman has more versatility than most other super talismans.) I'll be posting a thread on this subreddit when I finalize it.

** Do talismans last forever?

I can imagine that there'd be ancient ultra-powerful talismans, from before people realized how powerful it would be. For example, perhaps someone asked for a weather control talisman for what little effect the weather has on hunting, and then later on farming was invented. Or maybe someone decided that they want to be able to move stars around so that they could write their name in the sky, and then later people find out those stars are gigantic balls of fire.

Now that I mention that last one, I suspect someone would pick something stupid that gets everyone killed. Like maybe they wish to be able to take stars out of the sky, not realizing how big they are.

** I request a Talisman of Instant Best Immortality. On activation, it grants the bearer (or the target, possibly) a form of immortality that lets them retain the physical age they most prefer and allows them to commit suicide. This would naturally have many limitations -- perhaps it could only be used once every hundred years, for instance. However, if everyone requests one until there's enough immortality to go around, we'll be golden.

If the restriction requires certain circumstances, like it can only be used during a solar eclipse, then there's going to be some interesting scheduling going on, and people will have to take that into account when choosing to give birth. So we'll probably also need contraception amulets.

  A talisman ceases to function immediately after the brain death of its creator.

  That is to say, the talisman granter will adjust the power of the same class of talismans over time. centuries ago, a fire-granting talisman would be a lot more useful, and therefore have larger drawbacks. With easier access to firestarters, fire granting talismans are comparatively less useful, so they lose some of their drawbacks.
#+end_quote

We can use various rejuvenation, disease-curing, and injury-healing talismans to reduce the cost of the immortality amulets. If you're mostly guaranteed not to die of a disease or a not-instantly-fatal accident for three to five hundred years, immortality isn't quite as valuable, comparatively. This is going to be a small effect.

Sure, if you're speaking in physics jargon. If you're speaking in common English, speed and velocity are synonyms. So is the talisman going to choose the least convenient or most precise jargon available and assume you're speaking that? Or is it going to deliberately screw you over with potentially not-quite-synonyms?
