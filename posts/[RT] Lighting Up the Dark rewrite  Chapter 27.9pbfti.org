** Just re-read the whole thing over the course of the day while I should be doing real work. Still as quality as ever.

Two things: one, who the hell is Raijin, who ctrl+f only found four times but apparently took care of Naruto as a kid?

And second, wow, I forgot how frustrated reading that fight with Shikamaru made me. What a condescending prick with his super-Bayesian fighting style and throwaway koans, Sun Tzu-ish quotes, and references to solipsism. It's like he's only there as an object lesson that Naruto's not the smartest guy in the world whole while epitomizing some of the exact same character flaws, only without the protagonist's depth.

If I ever wrote Naruto fic myself I'd feel obligated to write a scene where Shikamaru proclaims he's, "ten steps ahead," and gets his nose broken immediately after by someone just plain faster and better than him. Laziness as a ninja vice should have real consequences beyond just social ones. Just once I'd like to see him be a little too slow to put one of his genius plans into action and watch things go wrong instead of coasting. Which, granted, happened in canon with Asuma, but still. It'd give me wicked schadenfreude to read.

** EVEN NOW THERE IS HOPE LEFT IN MANKIND

I held out for this fic, keeping it in bookmarks, checking occasionally, but now Now it was all worth it.

So what is the rewritten? I will have to do a reminder read either way but want to know if it big or editing or cut outs.

*** There are a few completely new scenes, and a bunch more rewritten to a single POV which gives a quite a bit more insight into the character. Plus things sprinkled throughout which aren't huge individually but enrich characterisation a fair bit when taken together.

To be honest, it's been so long since the original that I can't remember all the changes, but some examples that spring to mind are Chapter X (the Hokage conversation), the opening of Chapter XI (Kakashi and Naruto's self-reflections) and Chapter XXIII (the Sakura/Ino fight).

**** Wonderful, just finished last chapter (saved my self over a couple of days lol) and its still great, one thing im not sure anybody mentioned is the humor that reads like physical gags in animated medium, which works pretty great.

Anywhooo, feel free to write more, NO PRESSURE.

Or was the whole purpose to obfuscate the level at which Hiashi was playing?

** "The mood in Wave as a whole was changing. After initial disbelief that Gatō was really gone, there was general jubilation. A parasite rather than a ruler, Gatō had been smart enough to leave much of the Wave bureaucracy intact, albeit with overseers (now fled or dead) to make sure his ruinously high taxes were collected on time. Now, that bureaucracy was able to make use of the money Tazuna's supporters had originally gathered for mercenary hire, and start rebuilding the country's infrastructure and economy. Though Wave's rebirth would be slow and by no means easy, there was already a sense of hope blooming among the people."

​

This goes against the main thesis of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolution_Betrayed]]; the bureaucracy would expand to soak a big chunk of the new available ressources, and the people's hopes might be unfounded.

*** Informative, thank you, and there are two answers to that.

First, I struggle to think of a single parallel between the Russian Revolution and what has just happened in Wave. I hesitate to even call the latter a revolution, beyond the minimum requirement of a change of power accomplished through force.

Second, even were Trotsky's thesis applicable, Naruto certainly wouldn't be seeing this to be true a mere week after Gatō's downfall.

**** Not many parallels to the Russian Revolution, but I can see some parallels to decolonization.

In countries where the colonizers set ruinously high taxes, the bureaucracy took on a more extractive role and that remained the case even after the colonizers left.

Countries like India have relatively good institutions because many Englishmen lived there and didn't see the place as merely a tax base. Countries like Haiti on the other hand were left with extractive institutions because the colonizers didn't want to live there, only wanted to collect taxes.

If Gato was a parasite who lived far away and not a ruler who lived among his subjects, the bureaucracy he set up would be more like Haiti than like India.

I got that analysis from chapter 10 of the book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Economics][Poor Economics]], by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo.

***** Thanks for the explanation! +1 to reading list.

I think the main advantage Wave has there is that Gatō ruled for a matter of months rather than years. He may be better modelled as a temporarily successful invader than an enduring coloniser capable of perverting a nation's institutions in the long term.
