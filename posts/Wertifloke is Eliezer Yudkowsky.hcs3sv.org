** That's been widely suspected for a long time. Am I missing something where you think you have new evidence?

**** So, you don't have any conclusive evidence?

**** Ah, gotcha. I saw this right after it was posted, and spent a few befuddled minutes trying to see if there was a new post, or hidden acknowledgement.

**** Not only does this border on "common (suspected) knowledge", but it is really unfair to make as strong a claim in your title when in fact we do not /know/ it to be true. If Wertifloke later decides to reveal their identity, and it is not in fact Yudkowsky, you will have done them a great disservice. I think you should take this post down, and if you must, replace it with something more careful.

** I think this title should be renamed. There's no new evidence linked here. I got excited and thought there was a reveal or something.
