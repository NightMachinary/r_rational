So, after binge-reading [[/u/DaystarEld]] 's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][The Origin of Species]] and wanting more, I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions][The Game of Champions]] by L. Lamora, recommended in one of TOoS's headers.

Anyways. I enjoyed both a lot. Here are some thoughts.

- Pokemon seem to have human-level intelligence. At least [[#s][SPOILER]]. They can understand language for sure. Why haven't they taken over the world yet? Guess this is not a rational fic.

- What happened in Chapter 11? [[#s][SPOILER]]


** Speaking of /Game of Champions/ here:

They* are incapable of speaking human languages, and their own sign language (?) does not appear as sophisticated. They* do not seem to understand abstract concepts. They* do not appear to have much ambition or capacity for long-term planning. They* started out at a huge technological and organisational disadvantage and do not seem to have the ability to bridge the gap. Add a layer of speciesism and it's understandable that they're not fully integrated into human society.

And here I'm talking about the few smart species/individuals. The vast majority of pokemons seem to have animal-level intelligence. Pikachu is /maybe/ ape-level. I've read dog stories with dogs portrayed as similarly intelligent.

(*With a few exceptions, and those do leverage those abilities into higher status. Mistermime is more like a butler than a pet. Trident Lead is higher status than a military officer and, to the extent of his communication abilities, can make demands that humans will obey. The Ninetales - who is above human average in every way - managed to, if not conquer the world, at least carve itself a nice slice of the pie.)

/The Game of Champions/ definitely isn't, for unrelated reasons. (tldr: it's almost never a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit][fair play whodunnit]].) It still have elements that appeal to much of the [[/r/rational]] audience though.

Well, for instance the awesome battles. Which, like you said, are not fair play, but damn they are flashy and show off clever tricks.

Alright. However, psychic types are said to answer questions and be able to communicate, [[#s][Chapter 3, paragraph 2 after the intro]].

Maybe Pokémon are on average only as smart as stupid-ish humans, which would indeed erase the organizational take-over-the-world capabilities, while also having a few more intelligent individuals. Pokémon are still /quite/ a problem for humans too.

*** Slightly off topic, but linking to the TVTropes article made me imagine how deep into the TVTropes vortex Red from TOS would fall? He would be prattling on for days afterwards about articles like "Dark Types Are Evil" and "No Squirtle, This Is /Dragon/ Fire." It would be hilarious.

All good points, though going by the terminology on the sidebar that makes not "rationalist", but it can still be "rational".

As for powerful beings not taking over the world: I really don't think that would play out in reality. Even leaving aside that power and motivation/ambition don't go hand in hand, most of the beings mentioned do a fair job at meeting their goals. Trident Lead: I don't know what he wants, but his squirtles seem well cared for. The Ninetales Gary interacts with had a pretty good gig, and the art ninetales was presumably effective in its own sphere. I don't know about the other characters mentioned; it's been a while since I read it.

** My stance on Game of Champions:

The story is very well written, and the world very well built. It's very internally consistent both with itself and explaining the game canon, and most important characters are (to use EY's terminology) Level One intelligent or above. For these reasons I'd say it's Rational.

It isn't "Rationalist," for reasons Roxolan pointed out. The story's not a puzzle and it doesn't try to teach cognitive theory.

Regardless, I highly recommend it to this crowd. I liked it much better than Origin of the Species.

** Well, prompted by this thread I've now binge-read my way through the story so far, and /holy crap/ is this ever not the usual tenor of a Pokemon story. Fast, dark, and utterly brutal.

Had a few moments where the accelerated pace makes the timeline seem a bit unreal, but maybe I've read too quickly, missed the description of time passing, and there are actually more days/weeks that have gone by than I realise.

And I suppose my accumulated playtime on Pokemon Gold only really amounts to a couple of weeks, maybe a month tops once you add in time to sleep, and that was enough time to go from zero to world champion, win 16 badges across two regions, almost fill a pokedex, and casually bring down a major criminal organisation in the process.

As to the questions...

[[#s][On the topic of pokemon taking over the world -]]

No idea about Chapter 11. Didn't really understand the mechanics of the situation, just accepted them as presented then moved on.

*** I got the vibe it was always updating sporadically. I saw a single update or two a long while after I discovered it. So, I haven't given up hope.

*** As far as I know, the author's still serving in the Air Force. So probably not much time for writing lengthy chapters.

He's still semi-active on the Dark Lord Potter forums though and hasn't given any indication that the project's abandoned.
