** Remember this little recommendation from Eliezer Yudkowsky? I thought /rational was going through a frankly indecent amount of time without fic recs thus..

For those who haven't come across this before it starts off fairly lightly exploring the series' sci-fi premise. But the genre shifts gears soon enough making a turn for darker and edgier and interesting use of physics concepts. I confess though, I skimmed through the first bit. The story starts to really kick off around Chapter 6 -- or better yet, Chapter 9. Skip ahead if this doesn't feel like your thing..

Also, the synopsis:

Hatou Gaku has a very odd friend at school named Marii Yukari. Yukari has purple eyes and a bizarre way of looking at the world: she sees all living things as robots. This has not always worked out well for Yukari, even costing her a best friend when she was younger. However, Yukari insists that the things she says she sees is true, and her vision seems to give her insight into the abilities of others.

Gaku thinks she's just weird, but she soon realizes that Yukari has unexpected talents. It seems she can fix anything, and even the police come to hear her insights. It turns out that Yukari's purple eyes are not unique in the world! However, there is one important distinction among those who see humans as other objects. Do humans appear as unimportant as objects, or do those objects appear as important as human beings?

Isn't that basically psychopathy?

Still, sounds like an interesting story.

** I read all the way through when Eliezer recommended it, and it was pretty good. I'll probably read it again later, considering it's not astonishingly long, and I enjoyed the idea.
