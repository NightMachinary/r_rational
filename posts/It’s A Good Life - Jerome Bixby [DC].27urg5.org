** From the guy who gave us The Man From Earth. Written in 1953, a day in the life of a small town under the thrall of an omnipotent three-year-old. Also adapted as a teleplay for The Twilight Zone.

*** This is one of those topics I tend to raise when attempting to explain why so-and-so on the LW email list shouldn't just build an AI that implements his personal utility function.

** If I was a character I would try to ask Anthony to grant me omnipotence, or switch bodies. Worth a shot

*** Might have just worked if Anthony was a little older..

I could see him granting Administrative access to the first genuine peer he makes - whether they want to or not.

As time passes he would develop a longing for the interpersonal relationships he observes everyone else having. And then decide after many, many mindrapes that he needs someone who he can't edit on a whim. Or establish something so that he can't easily read their minds. And maybe create a scenario where they can interact like normal friends. Just so er, he could experience the novelty of the situation? If he can develop a strong enough emotional connection and trust with this person, he'd eventually turn them like him too.

You know, that sounds like some prime fanfiction exploration there.. !developingGod

*** Oh man, that sounds like such a great way to get turned into something horrifying.
