Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow [[/r/rational]] fans...

- Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tropes]]?

- How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

- Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

- Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

- Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  This is a really hard problem to solve, by the way. I struggle with it more than any other, actually. The clash between the ideas you get in your head and what ends up being true when you actually try to write it...that's my bane. I don't have a solution, sorry.

/yeah i quote myself/

You ever do that thing where you have an awesome idea for a really rad scene, and then you try to write it, and it just...doesn't come out that way? Like you have this idea where...

#+begin_quote
  Jane struggled to free her bound wrists. "What do you want, you son of a bitch?"

  Dr. Evilus smiled coldly. "I want you to die."

  In his hand was a gun. Oh no! He could use that to shoot Jane.
#+end_quote

It's going to be really tense and exciting. Great action, snappy one-liners, enough tension to snap a rubber band. And then you try to write it, and...Jane doesn't say that. Dr. Evilus doesn't do that. And now the scene isn't doing what you wanted it to do, and you're not sure why you were writing it, or how to make it do what you wanted, or what to replace it with....

Does that happen to you? What causes it? How do you deal with it?

*** I roleplay more than I write (and in fact a lot of my story comes from roleplayed skeletons), and I find it's very common. Me and my partner say that the cause of this is the characters and situations being /real/, having actual motivations and not being puppets on strings that perform what we want to see.

The way we deal with it is we let it happen. Usually, the end result is better for it even if that's not clear at the time.

(For example, in my vampire/human romance, the characters end up breaking up. I pictured an argument over whether slavery is a good idea resulting in the human raising his hands in the air and declaring that the vampire was stupid and cold and the breakup happening immediately and relatively explosively. Roleplaying it out we realised the characters actually care for each other and are nice to each other, so the conversation ended with some animosity but no breakup, and then the human thought it over for a week before finally deciding to declare the breakup. This is better, even if you lose the dramatic "THAT IS IT, WE ARE DONE, I DON't WANT TO SEE YOU EVER AGAIN" scene, it actually makes more sense overall since Real Breakups Don't Work That Way).

I wrote another scene where everything kind of went off on a tangent. I just deleted it and wrote it again, changing the initial conditions slightly. That was enough to make the conversation more closely resemble what I wanted.

Hope that's helpful!

*** I've had similar thoughts about dreams, actually, but from the opposite direction. My impression is that when your dreams invoke a certain emotion, let's say fear, it cobbles together things you fear and tries to present them in a coherent fashion, but actually cheats and doesn't let you evaluate your reaction but instead just enforces the feeling of fear.

So you'd be hiding, afraid of something and feeling trapped, but when you wake up you realize you totally should've been able to escape easily, or the thing you were hiding from wasn't even /worth/ hiding from in the first place. But your dream cheated and told you that you were feeling afraid and trapped anyways.

So what I think is that your imagination's cheating there, with that scene you can see the emotions of so clearly. Your brain cobbles together the core pieces of the scene and, from your desires, cheats and tells you that it's actually dramatic and tense and witty, even though as it is the scene isn't as dramatic, tense, or witty and if you write it down you'll quickly notice the difference between the scene's actual quality and what your brain told you.

Of course, I have no certifications in this sort of thing at all, so my speculation on dreams may be entirely, eye-rollingly wrong, but so far it seems to match what I've seen.

** Okay, here's some of my questions from this week:

- Request for specific feedback: I don't like the way my story starts. I don't think it makes you care, and having read fiction online I know that if I am not interested in the first few paragraphs I'm not going to read it. [[http://pastebin.com/72WudD2c][Here's my first chapter]] (2.5k words, but it's divided into two halves). How do I make this more interesting? I was considering some prologue vignettes about the two characters before they meet, but not sure if that'd be more interesting or not. (human: being overwhelmed by the fact he's about to be sent to war and running away like a coward; vampire: finishing watching an opera about a human-vampire romance and in a flight of romantic fancy deciding he'd like to spend a decade or two courting a human). Alternatively I can start the story partway through chapter 1, or even start it at like chapter 2 or 3 where the fangs come out so to speak and then get flashbacks? I don't know. Structure is hard.

- I've been calling my story vampire yaoi because it's got two dudes, one of whom is a vampire, and they kiss while they have adventures (which entirely revolve around them being different 'species', really - no "storming the castle" type stuff here) and try to make their relationship work. A friend jokingly told me that if my characters are not riding on horseback shirtless a lot, it's not yaoi. In more serious language, she said that based on my description, it doesn't sound like yaoi. So, my question is: are there any guides for trying to figure out what genre the story is? I suppose you could say mine's maybe a general YA romp, but the romance element is far heavier than a typical YA book (well, maybe not Twilight). So maybe it's supernatural romance and the fact it's a man-on-man romance is not enough to get to the yaoi?

- I've made my story [[http://pastebin.com/eiMBRWnW][pass the bechdel test]], but I'm not sure if it's enough, especially because at the end of the dialogue I mention one of the two main (male) characters.

- My personal failing: now I've put my story onto google docs, I'm constantly going through and adding "comments" of things I want to edit and change rather than actually spending time editing and changing things.

*** I like the very start. It's immersive, gets us into the character's head. People are interested in themselves, so if I'm immersed in the main character's perspective, then I probably like him. Things like the transition from the second paragraph to the third paragraph do interrupt that a bit though.

The writing's good, if a tad inconsistent, but that hardly matters at this stage and is to be expected. For me, though, it just lost my interest around the time the "Australian" guy showed up. I couldn't find a clear hook or point of tension. The only thing that qualifies is that the guy is apparently a deserter, but what is the threat? That this guy is onto him and will blackmail him into being his porter? It just doesn't feel that way.

The "Australian" guy, the vampire, I assume, has some secrets, presumably, but I have no sense of why I should be interested in those secrets. /You/ know. But I don't. Compare to, say, Quirrell's secrets about his zombie status or his history with Dumbledore, which have direct, demonstrated relevance to things Harry experiences.

Here's the real thing, I think: your hook is that a vampire and a human have a gay old time together. But there's no mention of vampires in this chapter. Were there any clues? I didn't read too carefully; the typical reader won't. Your description of a vampire who "finishing watching an opera about a human-vampire romance and in a flight of romantic fancy deciding he'd like to spend a decade or two courting a human" sounds really interesting. I'd like to read that story. But your first chapter doesn't give me that /at all/.

The story starts where it starts. If you find yourself reaching for prologues when you realize your first chapter isn't working, that suggests to me (based on my own experience doing the same thing) a certain lack of detailed, object-level understanding of the appeal of the story and how to transmit that appeal in prose. Gay vampire who thinks he's living in a novel and deserter soldier gaying it up together in WWII Europe is exciting. Why does the first chapter deny me that? Give it to me. I want it.

Expectations are really, really important for a story. In a sense, storytelling is about making promises and then delivering on them - that is, setting up expectations and then satisfying them. If you tell me this is a vampire yaoi story, I'm expecting softcore erotica. If it's actually a YA adventure with a heavy relationship/romance theme, then that's very different. There's such a thing as a teasing hook, but...look at HPMOR, some people felt they were being promised a story about Harry doing science at magic and uncovering its secrets, and they didn't get it, and they complained about it to the end of and after the story. As for what the genre story is, only you know. What does it seem similar to? It's not even that important; you can query multiple agents.

Passing the Bechdel test doesn't matter. It's interesting on a society-wide basis when many/most mainstream books, films, and TV shows don't pass it, but passing it doesn't make a story good or feminist /at all/, and failing to pass it doesn't make a story bad or not feminist at all. (E.g. a story that only has one character, a female, won't pass the test even if it's amazingly good and extremely feminist.)

Fun fact, Hitler actually posted his first draft of /Mein Kampf/ on pastebin. Remember, if you post on pastebin, you post with Hitler.

**** Wow, thank you so much for taking the time to read the chapter and to give me such wonderful, detailed feedback!

You're right that it's not softcore erotica, so maybe yaoi is the wrong word. Ah well, that's details!! I need to get this bloody thing in a state that resembles finished.

What do you propose instead of pastebin? The entire thing is on google docs at the moment - I can PM you a link if you'd be interested in honouring me with more in-depth feedback as I rip this thing apart and tape it all back together (what it feels like I'm doing at the moment. Passages need to be put in different places where they'd fit better, it all needs to be massaged and put into place, etc).

On the subject of prolog / vampire's point of view / etc, my first draft of the chapter was from the Australian vampire's point of view, but I wrote it on like 4 hours sleep and wasn't terribly happy with it. Also, I realised that if you enter a vampire's head for this story, all of a sudden it becomes less romantic and more... exploitative. So I switched to the human's. But maybe I should lean into how horrific the vampire's "love" for the human /actually/ is? How he can make these huge, grand, sweeping gestures but at the same time not particularly care if the human lives or dies? How the human feels like he's the centre of the vampire's universe, but really he's a tiny detour in a 1500 year long jaunt through the best the planet has to offer? (Ultimately, the vampire ends up falling in love in the truest sense of the word, and 1000 years from now they're both vampires, together, living in a spaceship or whatever; but the first decades of their relationship are more like the affection one has for a pet than for an equal)

But it does mention the opera, the romantic notion, etc. Perhaps it's a better viewpoint, even if it's less polished, prose-wise. (I feel it REALLY DUMPS exposition, like WAY TOO HARD. An easy fix, though). And I /do/ rotate the viewpoint of the story just a little, so I could potentially formalise this and have the viewpoints alternate with the chapters....

Anyway, here it is, on the evil pastebin: [[http://pastebin.com/kdRXTkME]]

***** No probs.

You shouldn't call it yaoi for the same reason you shouldn't call a movie about the personal and societal difficulties faced by a polyamorous relationship of people of different ethnicities an interracial gangbang. ...If that helps to explain.

Pastebin is fine, I just hate reading on it. It's not a big deal.

This first draft from the vampire's perspective is kind of like the other draft: I like it up until the two main characters meet. Maybe if I was looking for gay erotica and had the expectation of gay erotica I'd be intrigued, but I'd then be ultimately disappointed by the lack of gay erotica.

Why does their meeting bore me? Making because it's not communicated why I should be interested. There's a bit of gay in the way the vampire admire's the guy's naked chest, but I know there isn't going to be gay erotica, and I'm not looking for it anyway, which might mean I'm not the target audience. But aside from the hint of gay...why should I care about their meeting? Because they're the main characters? Because /you/ know why their relationship is actually really interesting? It feels sort of arbitrary. I just don't feel the cause-and-effect in the vampire's interest - why is he stopping and talking to this human? Because his mind is on romance and this is the first hunk he saw? Then why does he invite him to be his porter and not, say, proposition him for sodomy?

Ah, so here's what it is: when your main characters are talking to each other, I'm not immersed in the viewpoint character's perspective. In the beginning, before they meet, I am immersed in the viewpoint character's perspective, and that's why the story is pretty readable and engaging early on and drops off /instantly/ when the characters meet. This is true for me for both versions of the first chapter, by the way.

So why does the story lose the immersion when they meet? Probably because their internal logic doesn't have them behave at all the way they do when they meet. It probably doesn't have them meet at all. It's not /what happens./ It's what you want to happen. But in the story-as-real-events, it doesn't happen. That's my guess, anyway.

This is a really hard problem to solve, by the way. I struggle with it more than any other, actually. The clash between the ideas you get in your head and what ends up being true when you actually try to write it...that's my bane. I don't have a solution, sorry.

Arrrgh. Yes. The meeting is contrived. Very contrived. That's exactly it and I hadn't put my finger on it. Thankyou so much for making it so crystal clear!

My favourite way to brainstorm is to come up with 10 ideas, no matter how good or how bad, just come up with 10 of them. Usually somewhere around 3 or 7 I come up with something that works. Human's overall motivation is he needs money. Vampire's is he wants to mac on some cute human.

So, /how do they meet/? Let's completely take the place and time off the table.

1.  Vampire actually monitored him for a while, decided he liked him, stalked him, and then chose to present himself as an employer

2.  Human is responding to job ads. Vampire has legitimate job for the human (what on earth could it be?), or has decided to let fate decide who he hits on

3.  Later in the story, Human demonstrates aptitude with shopping for things that vampires like. Instead of physical labour, he's making a living as a stallholder in a market. Vampire thinks a human who is drawn to vampire-valuable items would be handy to have around.

4.  Human gets kidnapped (by other vampires) and used as meal /during/ the opera intermissions (refreshments included in the ticket price for vampire attendees!). Vampire, amid the feelings the opera, decides to take pity on him, looks after him - probably buying him off the opera guys.

5.  Human is actually /on the run/ from the army and hasn't get settled into having a steady job or income stream. Vampire finds him when he impinges on his land / property / hunting grounds?

6.  They happen to meet randomly as the wall scene (I was reaching so here it is...)

7.  Someone sets them up - Vampire has a.... friend???? who thinks he's getting a bit out of touch with humanity, so hires him an "assistant". They are set up as like mentor/mentee but then end up kissing

8.  Human is so hard on his luck he ends up working as a prostitute. Vampire hires him, takes pity on him, etc.

9.  Human is working in Vampire's hotel; Vampire courts him.

10. Human finds something that belongs to the vampire (e.g. a passport on the street). Returns it for reward. (Or: doesn't return it. Vampire tracks him down).

Yeah................ the way they meet in my story (#6) is by far the least exciting of the 10 options I just came up with. #1 is functionally identical but at least is a bit creepy if I really want to trade on "vampire boyfriend is creepy".

2 is boring. Number 3 is interesting and relates to stuff that happens at the end of this volume.

4 is a bit too... sad, though at least it's dramatic and interesting enough to get the reader intrigued - but I don't know if the rescuer/savior dynamic is what I want out of this.

5 is OK but not great, and would still require Vampire to have a reason to approach Human - unless he Saw Too Much?

7 is pretty bland, requires a new character. 8 is strictly worse than 4 because it hits the same power dynamics but in a really hard-to-get-right way.

9 is boring, but at least is more "romantic" than the current version - being forced to see each other, slowly building a rapport, etc without having to offer a job. Can even use a lot of the same scenes as the Vampire can ask the Human to do "hotel porter" type stuff when he is an actual hotel porter.

10 is OK, but at the "returns it for reward" point, we don't have a reason for them to keep talking to each other.

So.... from that brainstorming session (thanks for encouraging it), making Human a hotel porter, or /maybe/ making him an intermission snack, is going to be more likely to get me where I want to go, or keeping what we have but making it from the vampire's point of view and saying "the vampire had been monitoring the human for weeks. He liked him. He wanted to smooch him a lot" somewhere.

Do you have any thoughts on this?

** Crossposted from the #writing_discussion channel on the Discord server:

From past conversations, I think I've picked up a general sentiment that writers find it hard to accurately judge their own work.

Is this generally accurate, or is it just that people who don't have difficulty judging their own work feel no need to comment on it?

Okay, since for the moment I'm apparently alone in here, I'll get on with it.

I have an idea for a fun experiment that would give a rough idea of whether a typical writer is prone to over/under-estimating their own work, and, more relevantly to the participants, how much they themselves over/under-estimate their own work. However, it would require enough effort on the part of enough people that this would basically need to be an epidemic for enough people to want to put in the (not insignificant) effort to make the experiment worthwhile.

So, if the people I've been talking to are just outliers who stick out because they're outliers, obviously the idea is pointless.

That being said, if a medium-sized group of writers took a body of work, including one by each writer (and possibly some third-party, though each additional one could well lead to more reading on everyone's part if it isn't especially well-known), privately ranked them best-to-worst, and then revealed the listings, it'd paint a really interesting picture, immune to the tendency of ideas to converge when discussed.

For example, if everyone else's list puts Alice between fifth and seventh, but she put herself third, she now has an idea both of how good she is (because she has works that have been judged equivalent to hers - of course this is contingent on accuracy) and of how much she's overestimating herself. And, naturally, if Betty put herself dead last and everyone else put her middle-of-the-pack, she knows that she's underestimating herself.

...

Anyway, if four-five people want to try this, that'd probably be enough to get a decent effect, provided we add in something like a half-dozen third-party stories to fill out the numbers. The ideal would be if everyone had already read the same stuff and just had to read the other participants' work, but realistically (and since we'll have to use stuff of comparable quality, which is going to be much less universal) we'd all have to read a bit of mid-tier fiction.

***** Thinking out loud - it might be hard to control for things like genre. People would have to try and be impartial, so that way a randomly chosen My Little Pony fanfiction would be held out on its merits the same way something "high prestige" like HPMoR or a generic sci-fi story would be. People might be inclined to rank on the quality of the /story/ rather than the quality of the /writing/.

I guess you could do subcategories: overall, story/plot, writing, spelling/grammar, level of rationality, "want to read more of this", "similar to the sort of thing I already like". Wouldn't make rating much harder, but would be more useful feedback to the authors.
