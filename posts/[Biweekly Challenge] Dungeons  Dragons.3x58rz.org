[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3v8b1j/biweekly_challenge_deal_with_the_devil/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Deal with the Devil". [[/u/kishoto]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3v8b1j/biweekly_challenge_deal_with_the_devil/cxnt9hz]["A Cursed Blade"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations [[/u/kishoto]]!

This time, the challenge will be "Dungeons & Dragons". Give us a rational story set in the world implied by D&D rules, a munchkin romp through rules-as-written, or the sort of insanity that comes from someone playing the game in a logical way. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, December 30th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]], and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][in the meta thread]]. Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "Paperclipper". A paperclip maximizer is a hypothetical superintelligent AI which has maximizing the number of paperclips in the universe as its utility function. More generally, it refers to any superintelligent AI that's doing things contrary to human values even if it's been built without malice or incompetence (though sometimes the concept stretches further than that). Don't be afraid to get creative with the idea.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 12/30.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]].

If you are familiar with DnD 3.5, you can probably read most of that just fine. I do however think that a bit of an OOC explanation after reading makes sense, so I'm including that in a reply to this comment.

***** I'm on Chrome as well and it works fine. If you have RES you can view source to read it or disable the subreddit stylesheet.

If you don't have RES you can right-click on the spoiler and press "Inspect" then read the HTML. The spoiler is the title attribute of the =<a href="#s" title="..."></a>= tag.

****** Oh, goddammit. It doesn't work for me because I disabled all subreddit stylesheets by default then forgot about it. With stylesheets disabled you have to hover over the spoiler text to read it, and there's a limit on how many characters that will display.

***** When I first wrote this, the idea was that he decided on the flow chart because the descent into evil was gradual, and he would be able to hold on to the plan through sheer will, especially since it's not really a Good/Evil thing. But last week I realized that there is a better explanation. Harbouring the Mother Cyst does not protect against being infected with a normal cyst, so he made one of his monsters infect him and now uses Suggestion on himself to maintain the obsession with the flowchart. He couldn't use it to force himself to be Good, since Suggestion is limited and using the spells is actively corroding his moral compass, but maintaining an obsession he wants to maintain is within the scope of the spell.

It felt inappropriate to change the text more than halfway through the contest, so I left it as is.

Story takes place roughly 1500 years after traditional D&D, but it operates under the 5e system if it were realistically constrained. (It is also set 15 years after my entry on "the Matrix". Even though I haven't published any of my web serial yet, the events of this short story take place during the second arc. I was just too excited to let yet another weekly challenge pass me by!)

/edit: I've been sick for the past week and I'm Christmas vacation with my family. After some of the initial feedback, I realized that my 'short story' is lacking an ending, so consider the story only about 2/3rds complete at this point. */edit 2: a few introductory components to the characters were added and I wrote a real ending

*** This feels less like a story and more like a worldbuilding infodump. It also doesn't end in a satisfying place. The runes are also bothersome -- they are clearly important, but I can't read them. I have a feeling that this is just a special font and that if I wanted to go out on the net (or do some basic cryptography) and search I could figure out what it says. That's too much to ask for a short story though.

**** Yep -- it's an interlude worldbuilding infodump for sure. When I go back and integrate it into my broader story, I'll make sure to space the background out more so it doesnt seem so annoying. I only compressed it for the Rationalist take on D&D.

***** I think it could work well as part of a larger story although, as you say, I would still spread it out a bit more. As an individual short, though, it wants a little more.

**** I agree... It was a pain to write and it does feel like a random insert. When I write a gnome and dwarf interlude, hopefully it will be more worthwhile in seeing their perspectives on physics, chemistry and genetics.
