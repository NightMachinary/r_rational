** The prompt's "I" refers to the player. What does the kid like the most? In JUROR's case, the potential of a blank canvas, incompletion, so an accidental empty answer sufficed. Remember, he's illiterate. For Chili, he might win just by not participating, since he values the refusal of hope the most.

  The point is that what those people who are guessing want is not the same as what JUROR wants. Juror wants an empty canvas - and an empty <input> box is pretty much the same as an empty <canvas>. [[/r/rational]] readers should be familiar with the artificial intelligence trope that defining one's desire precisely is nigh impossible - except for the null case, a malicious genie can always misinterpret. No guess whether the prompt will accept "my coherent extrapolated volition" as a valid answer for everyone, though.!<

*** I like him. The idea of someone who reads not out of love, but because hate is cheap and fueling in a different way, like some Anti-Matilda, is great.

I am also fairly sure he's a Dio reference in some way- his portrayal here is too similar to S1E1 Dio's background of "Asshole waiting for guardian to die out of spite". I'm hoping it doesn't go to far, since I'm sick of Jojo references, tbh.

** First of all, hi Teddy! Glad you're feeling better.

Second of all: [[/r/rational][r/rational]] seems to have been nerd sniped by the game, but nobody seems to have dug into the lore yet.

Charlie and the great glass elevator appears non-canon

Zamboni apparently manufactures hypersonic transcontinental aircraft, and operating them is cheap enough that news agencies can use them.

That reference to Wonka being secretly horribly racist but ultimately probably just an accident of statistics is probably a reference to how the oompa loompas were originally african pygmies, before they were changed to the orange things we know today.

Apparently there were multiple attempts by corporations to secede from their parent nations. Urkel conquered Philidelphia? The fact that Wonka is a sovereign nation explains how they haven't had to deal with inspectors, and apparently they have enough power to enforce "And if anyone ever attempts to steal your ambrosian confections or in any way threaten your copacetic candy consumption, you may also call me and my delightful drones will proceed to erase them from the face of the earth."

There's probably stuff I missed, but that's just what jumped out to me reading it.

**** Charlie and Wonka haven't been seen since he went in, except for when Charlie buried Wonka. On top of that, everyone has no fucking clue what is up with the factory. I feel like "Saving a space hotel from aliens" would be a rather notable development in the wonka/charlie saga, you know?

Possibly their involvement was covered up, but... how would all the rest of it be explained? People were rescued, the hotel was destroyed, aliens existed... there was a lot going on. People would talk, explanations had to be written. The great glass elevator is much less popular, and doesn't really add much to the whole "magic chocolate factory" angle, so there's not even much reason to include it.

They've made no official public appearances, or well-attributed private appearances; their presumptive off-screen dinner at the White House could have been kept quiet (at Wonka's request, I imagine). Both Charlie and Willy would have been fairly nondescript in normal clothes, so it's not like they had to /stay/ locked up in the factory all the time.

#+begin_quote
  People were rescued, the hotel was destroyed, aliens existed...
#+end_quote

Charlie did not know about the aliens; thus, they are probably a state secret. (I imagine that if aliens were not a state secret, they would be such common knowledge that everyone would recognize them). Same thing for the hotel in space.

Honestly the whole sequence of events is nearly an anti-meme. "You're telling me that Willy Wonka, the chocolate guy, rescued the President from space aliens during a visit to his secret space hotel? Pull the other one, maybe I'll turn in to a Reptilian."

The people who were rescued were on the POTUS' staff, and thus accustomed to keeping Top Secret stuff, you know, secret.

I wouldn't be surprised if the fictional public is less competent than in real life. It's also possible that there are adults who put in the right answer or tell it to the kids, but there's some magic that can tell if it's an adult or a kid who didn't figure out the answer themself.
