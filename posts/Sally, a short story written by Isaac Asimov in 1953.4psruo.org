*** And then give that faster, stronger machine a power supply that runs out in only three days. (It can come back to the factory on schedule to get said power supply replaced if it's still needed after three days). Then, if the worst comes to the worst, at least this particular problem will go away fairly quickly.

**** Watchbird solution: differentiate murder from state killings, differentiate people from non-people. Problems: things that look like murder but aren't /by some people's definitions/ such as abortion, execution, policing, self-defense; things that don't look like murder such as starvation, kidnap, bullying, economic actions...

Problem: people seem to want to kill.

***** If that had been done /from the start/, it might have helped, yes.

A simpler solution: Ignore the learning algorithm entirely. Respond only the the hormonal trigger that predicts 70% of murders, and be satisfied with just stopping /70/% of murders (let the police handle the remaining 30% as before).

**** Thank you, although I haven't done much to deserve this compliment yet.

Now if I ever get around to translating some of my favorite sci-fi into English, /that/ would be a miracle.
