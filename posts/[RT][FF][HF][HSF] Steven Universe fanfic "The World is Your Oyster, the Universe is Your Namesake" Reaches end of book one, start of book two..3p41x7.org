** Minor Nitpick:

I was rereading the first chapter and the font's off in this sentence,

#+begin_quote
  “Yes. *Meta-', Greek prefix, means about or after, so* metacognition' is to think about thinking. Self-awareness.”
#+end_quote

If you meant to only use it for part of the sentence where part of it is bolded, then I think you shouldn't include 'so' in it as well. It broke my immersion in the story very abruptly.

*** I'm terribly sorry, that technical mixup has been remedied accordingly.

It turns out my migration from a custom markup language to markdown had a kink right there. Thanks for spotting it.

*** Another reason would be massive foreshadowing/lore solving. There are plenty of secrets revealed in the show by plot, and many of them have foreshadowing in previous episodes.

It's sort of like a mystery to be solved. Sort of.

***** This is such a stupid attitude towards serialized fiction that, though some number of serialized fiction creators contribute to, is often inaccurate and a terrible thing to assume. I can assure you that the major reveals made thus far on Steven Universe were planned in advance.

******* The biggest twist thus far (IMO) was basically hiding in plain sight, and I think a rationalist would have predicted it well in advance; IDK if the fanbase caught it or not since I stay away from the fanbase. A lot of the other "twists" aren't really Shyamalan-esque things so much as gradual plot development and exposition.

** The lack of conflict is kinda depressing, but otherwise this is enjoyable. Thanks for sharing it, i guess.
