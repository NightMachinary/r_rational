** I wish you hadn't titled this submission with the premise. The whole story is structured as a reveal for it.

*** I'm afraid the premise was so clear to me at the end of the first scene that I didn't consider the author might not have intended it that way!

Wish I could change the title now.

** The concept is funny. That said, I thought the prose was kind of clunky and difficult to follow.

** Why is so much fanfiction written the same way?

#+begin_quote
  As the noun verbed, Noun verbed blah blah blah.

  Noun verbed as the noun verbed.

  Gerunding blah blah blah, Noun verbed as the noun verbed.

  Noun verbed, gerunding as the noun verbed.
#+end_quote

It's like when someone says "you're now aware of your own breathing and you can feel your tongue sitting in your mouth," once you notice it you're done for. I feel like more than half of the fics I look at have the word "as" or a gerund phrase or both within the first paragraph. If it pops up that close to the beginning, it's almost always a sign that that's just how the author writes. It's not something you can unnotice, and that makes it unpleasant to push through a story written that way.

"Dumbledore sighed as he verbed the noun, feeling blah blah blah blah." I feel like I've read that sentence a billion times. Most of the time I'll immediately close the fic if it opens with a sentence like that (this is mostly hyperbole - if it were strictly true then I'd never read fanfiction, but I /do/ almost always immediately close a fic if the first sentence starts like "Feeling like he was ancient, Dumbledore sighed as he blaaaah") but I pushed through this one because you posted it on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] with the [RT] tag.

I personally don't feel like it was really worth reading, but it /definitely/ shouldn't be marked as "rational." I thought it might have a spark of rationality hidden behind the bog-standard fanfiction-quality writing, but it doesn't, it's just a "clever" idea that isn't actually clever because the only reason why the pieces (all Death Eaters being captured, the Wizengamot being controlled by "Dumbledore's faction," a sentence of "community service" being a thing in the wizarding world) were in a position that allowed the idea to work in the first place is because of authorial fiat, and only reason the pieces /stayed/ in a position (the premise is that the Death Eaters got "community service" instead of Azkaban, so there's nothing stopping them from running around killing people or running away to hide in Australia) that allowed the idea to unfurl is because of authorial fiat.

*** Only responding to the first bit here: do you particularly dislike the grammatical structure? What do you prefer in its place? I don't /think/ gerund phrases particularly stand out to me over other constructions, though I can imagine they'd wear out their welcome if I saw them /everywhere/. Maybe you're reading the openings of too many fanfics? XD

**** u/ElizabethRobinThales:
#+begin_quote
  Settling down at his desk, he allowed Fawkes to step...

  Resigning himself to his fate, he reached out and grabbed...

  Leaning back in the chair, he closed his eyes and thought...

  Shrugging, he figured it wouldn't hurt...

  Walking up to Harry, Voldemort used a finger...

  Abandoning stealth, Harry dived over the gravestone...

  Rolling and ignoring the flash of pain, he ran like he had never run...
#+end_quote

There are fanfics where that construction is even more frequent than it is in this story. There's nothing inherently wrong with a /participle phrase/ (idk why I can never keep that straight, these aren't gerund phrases at all). Participle phrases are just parts of a sentence.

...

Alright, I've already been here for over an hour, I'm just going to link you some articles rather than spend any more time trying to synthesize my own original explanation:

***** As an author who uses this structure a lot, I think I endorse the point being made, here---I have a ping to try pretty hard not to do this twice in a row, or at the start of every paragraph, or anything like that. It's important to mix up the length and style of your sentences.

** There was another fic with this, it was sorta cloud cuckoo lander Voldemort Harry, forget the name but it was hilarious and well written, over the course of the story one of the background things was Dumbledoor getting ever more blatant with using the curse to get death eaters that he doesn't have enough evidence to convict.
