** So that's why the name didn't work the second time. Very good, I did not see that coming.

The part about Aaron's fanfics really cracked me up.

So, if Sarah still can reach to other machines through the internet, I'm guessing she didn't lose her "computer" powers in the new body and can still talk super fast.

*** Technology works differently now, so I guess it's not impossible that a computer in a person's body can still connect to the Internet.

** Things I anticipated:

- There are not 3 more books still to go, with titles "Leviticus," "Numbers," and "Deuteronomy." We're too far into the narrative for 3 more books, plus those are terrible titles.

Things I did not anticipate:

- Sarah made Aaron forget the ensouling name. I had firmly rejected Aaron's hypothesis that the reason the name had ceased to function was because he was saying it wrong.

Hallelujah only has four verses, so I'm guessing there will be four books total. I had wondered how the naming was going to work.

*** I never considered the possibility of him saying it wrong because that would mean having unclear spots in his mnemonic. All that talk about never forgetting a name and being a super mnemonist? He'd never mangle such a vivid mnemonic, which he must have been rehearsing the while day.

The solution in the story is even more problematic: Sarah had to not only to change his memories but also plant a crystal clear mnemonic consistent with the new name... If the confounding name is that powerful, then it is a memory rewriting name and completely game breaking. I had gotten the idea that it simply made you forget things.

I feel we have been a little misled about the capabilities of the confounding name...

** So, Sarah is a computer with body dysmorphia which causes her to undergo an operation to give her a form which matches her self-image of being female.

Does that make her a trans-sister?

** Well this feels like an ethical rats' nest of issues... inadvertently creating a brand new person, who is born kinda pre-programmed to be obsessed with all the detritus of your life, and also in love with you, and also willing to have kinky sex with you.

It's really only the "inadvertently" that saves it - if it were intentional it would be desperately creepy.

Then, separate issue, she's sufficiently "plugged in" to turn all the ATMs and card readers and cell phones into an impromptu surveillance network? That sounds awfully like a Skynet singularity just waiting to happen.

Edit: /Still further issues/; there's no guarantee that the contents of this email are at all sincere, and oh dear it's a not-necessarily friendly AI that is entirely not in a box. "And that's how I caused the apocalypse", indeed.
