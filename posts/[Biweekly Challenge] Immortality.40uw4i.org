[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yuejk/biweekly_challenge_paperclipper/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Paperclipper". [[/u/ZeroNihilist]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yuejk/biweekly_challenge_paperclipper/cyj6t42][Satisfaction]], edging out a close field (close enough that reddit's imprecise vote totals made me refresh the page three times to be sure). Congratulations [[/u/ZeroNihilist]]! You are now tied with [[/u/Kishoto]] for most all-time wins!

the challenge will be "Immortality", one of the transhumanist goals and also one of those things that popular media tends to frown upon. It's a wide open field that ranges from Dorian Grey to the Fountain of Youth, emulated minds on fully redundant systems to angsty vampires. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, January 27th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

  "Let me ask you a question. How many neurons are there in the human brain?"

  "Uhh. Ten billion?"

  "Close. Eighty-six billion, but let's round that to a hundred. Ten to the eleven. And how many different ways are there to network those neurons?"

  My head began to spin. "I have no fucking idea. Wait, it's a graph problem, right? A hundred billion nodes, and each node can connect to any other. So for every pair of nodes, you have two possibilities, so it's...two to the power of a hundred billion choose two?"

  "Yup. About two to the two-hundred ten. And that's what's stored on there."
#+end_quote

You've dropped an exponent somewhere. A hundred billion nodes, 10^{11}. Square that for the number of connections - so, 10^{22} connections. And each one can be on or off, so we need 10^{22} bits /to store a single brain/.

Storing every possible and impossible brain is actually closer to 2^{10^{22}} bits.

***** The password concept is fundamentally flawed. If it is randomly generated, then there will be brains in the collection for every single outcome of the random generation, because it contains all brains that ever could be. If it is not randomly generated, at best it's a stand-in for life experience questions, and at worst, it's dummy information because of human's inability to be random.

To specify one exact brain among all possible brains, you need exactly the information the brain contains. Passwords replace some of that information, but say little or nothing about the part you care about. (What is said is, for example, 'chose to memorise an x length password').

**** Suppose you set up a device so that after a quantum event, there is a 1/2 chance of you being killed.

In the multiple worlds interpretation, both (you being killed, and you not being killed) happen.

Then (the living you) runs the experiment again. The dead you does nothing... he's dead. After this experiment, two of y'all (that's the correct plural form of "you" right?) have died (the death from the first experiment, and the death from the second experiment). Only one out of the three of y'all have lived (the one who survived the first and second experiment).

It continues from there.... Each time you run the experiment, there is another universe where you die, and another universe where you live. This happens /regardless of how many times you run the experiment./ So, even if you run it 1000 times, and your "probability of surviving" is only 1/2^{1000} , you're still guaranteed to survive (as well as die a 1000 times in different universes).

There will /always/ be someone who survives the experiment, and from their perspective, they're un-killable.

It's like "The Prestige." Every time he makes a clone, he has an equal chance of being the drowning clone, or being the transported clone, but /there's always a transported clone who doesn't drown./ The transported clone /feels/ like they're invincible (or really lucky), but there was no other option. Their existence was inevitable.

******** Ignore all quantum whatever and ignore many worlds for a moment, and let's talk about one totally mundane timeline. Imagine a universe in which the protagonist's life continues as it did before, say, they build the machine. Then at some point they get into a car crash, enter a coma, forget about the crash, and proceed to build an insane, delusional quantum killbox. They fantasize (within the coma) that they are immortal, the events of the story happen, suicide attempts are made and fail (within the coma), then eventually, after one of the attempts, they wake up. None of it really happened since the crash; they've been lying in a hospital bed. They retain their memories because why wouldn't they? After waking up from a coma, the internal events you experience might lose focus and become blurry, but it's implied that the narrator is losing their grip on reality and losing count of the number of breaks.

Does it seem to you that this is a possible and self-consistent chain of events?

If so, then in the logic of this story, that's sufficient for there to be a timeline in which it happens. That means waking up from a coma is one conceivable way to survive a suicide attempt, in the framework of quantum immortality.

I had no idea why you thought comas were relevant to anything! (I still don't, actually. Why aren't normal dreams sufficient?)

When I first read it, I interpreted it as though they attempted suicide resulting in brain damage that left them in a coma, such that when they recover... they still attempted suicide. And I had no idea what they were talking about with "wiping the slate clean", except that apparently it worked anyway? The train/car discrepancy just read like nonsense.

This may be due to my own thoughts on quantum immortality. I think that brain damage is obviously the most likely outcome of most quantum-failed suicides. I never thought that in the story, that might not be true, which may not be your fault.

It's unlikely as all balls, but flipping the bird to probability is kinda the whole point of quantum Immortality.

********* 'If you're still alive, then you're alive in a reality where you didn't die'--in the coma version, the coma dream must match the protagonist's experiences up until that point, but why does the level above match your dreamed past to such a degree? Looking at it slightly differently, if you have a three-level state where you go into a coma in reality, you have a coma dream, and then within that you have a second coma-dream which mirrors reality, then why should the middle-layer coma dream mirror reality as well rather than being something completely different?

From yet another direction--if it's a coma dream anyway, then given the unlikelihood of a suicide attempt actually freeing you from your coma, then why not 'you survived stabbing yourself because it's a coma dream, you're still dreaming, and the metal knife just bent like rubber in your dreamworld'? <thinking about the consistent propensity for death of the protagonist's loved one>

(<contemplates Yudkowsky's 'The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover' (regarding breaking upwards) and Greg Egan's 'Permutation City' (minds persisting through random dust)>)

(Without the coma break option, I note that the endeavour would be subjectively ended by unsurvivable things, similarly to natural lifespan if attempted a number of centuries before a bypass could be acquired... though who's to say whether some incredibly improbable universes out there have benevolent AIs spontaneously forming from random pair creation and rushing to save people's lives...)
