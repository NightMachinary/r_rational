Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Is there a way to make a rational version of "your name" without it becoming kinda horrific? IDK I cant see body-swapping as anything but horror.

Edit: swapped shaping with swapping

*** I think there's definitely a way to write a rational version of the movie's premise, but the twist wouldn't be preserved if the characters tried to contact each other directly. Using experiments to get a handle on the limits of the phenomenon, reduce its impact and figure out the source is a ready-made structure for a ratfic.

The twist also creates a window of opportunity for exploitation of the bodyswap mechanic, sending information backwards through time. Paradoxes seem to be allowed.

** *ROOM OUTSIDE OF TIME*

I was tinkering with this plot device/scenario:

You find an old doorknob. Whenever you press the doorknob against any surface, and turn it, it opens a door of the size and shape that you want. The door leads to a room outside of time.

- only you, or inanimate objects can enter the room. No other people or live animals

- when you are inside the room, the time does not pass outside

- when you are outside the room, no time passes inside

- the room is 100x100x100m, with walls floor and ceiling made of infinitely thick concrete

- the room has all the amenities (sewer, water, gas, electric) that seem to come and go towards infinity (there is no known end to the pipes and cables, and they never run out).

- the room is otherwise empty

- you do not age in the room, cannot die within it, and are healed within seconds from any injury (healed to perfect state not previous state)

- there can be only one door leading in or out.

- while the door is opened, the time in and out is unified. It only disconnects while the door is closed.

**** Interesting ideas, with a lot of practicality behind them. Personally, my first two thoughs about it was that the Room could be used as a personal gym, and as means to commit various crimes (since the doorknob essentially works like a giant bag of holding).

*** If the sewers and cables go on forever that seems to be an infinite source of material, even if you don't strip the fixtures one could farm arbitrary quantities of food effectively immediately, this along with the endless water could allow you to support a moderate community with stuff you take out. It could also be used to supply an interplanetary voyage, even without using it for supplies it seems to violate conservation of momentum, by opening the door at the end of a rotating tether and moving a large weight out of the room for half the rotation and back in for the other half one could get free energy and thrust. There's an incredible amount one can do with a nigh endless source of time, one can learn new skills, work on things without the stress of deadlines, take time to become at peace with things, of course one does need to socialize but having the door would help on that front by giving more opportunities.

The healing aspect might be the most valuable, you'd be able to perform experimentation otherwise banned on safety grounds.

And of course performing arbitarily large amounts of computing in moments is valuable.

**** thanks, this was the kind of an answer I was looking for. Can you expand a bit on the interplanetary voyage angle?

***** I thought I replied to this but it seems not, anyway. The infinite propultion idea comes from this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnvh08GBOII]], It couldn't be exactly the same but the same principle could be used to violate both conservation of motion and conservation of energy by pulling out a large weight while the door in a room on the end of a tether is going the right direction and put it back in and closing the door when it's going the other direction. Even without this an infinite source of water as reaction mass would be incredibly useful. A nuclear reactor could provide heat and the coolant being launched out would make cooling it easier.

It would make getting stuff into orbit much easier as the ship would just need to carry you and the doorknob regardless of how much is in the room.

It'd also be possible to use it to grow food, I'm not sure but it might be possible to grow more than enough food for one person and that means that having you act as a farmer could support any number of people although the time spent literally watching plants grow might lead to psychological issues over long term.

*** This would be an issue of hereditary conditions, not infectious diseases. We already have similar systems set up in our world--whenever two people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage want to have kids, they get tested for a suite of conditions commonly carried by people of that phenotype.

If this is a magical fantasy world, might very wealthy crossbred couples seek healing for their kid if it's born with a debilitating condition?
