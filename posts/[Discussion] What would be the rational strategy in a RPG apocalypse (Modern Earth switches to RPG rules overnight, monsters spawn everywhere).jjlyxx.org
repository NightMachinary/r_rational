Assume that the RPG system works similar to Dungeons and Dragons or an MMO inspired by it. So you get the usual tanks, DPS, healers, etc.

Everyone starts at level one, with stats that accurately reflect their capabilities, can choose their class (though some classes may have restrictions; Elizabeth II can pick Queen, most people cannot), and you can't luck into rare and powerful advantages. If you start with advantages they'll have an obvious source based on your background (E.G. Elizabeth II).

***** I'm not sure I agree. Real life is much more complicated than RPG rules, and I think being more of a generalist in real life is probably better, unless you can be /extremely/ specialized, which is relatively rare and difficult. But with RPG rules, specialization is usually easier, and is highly rewarded, and being a generalist means grossly underperforming your character level, so if you're encountering enemies that are determined by your level and not your actual stats, that's a major problem.

A determined nerd can probably also memorize the DnD ruleset in a couple weeks (maybe less? or a bit more? I've never actually played paper DnD), whereas I think it's probably physically impossible to memorize real life laws. DnD rules, and RPG rules in general, are also more internally consistent. I think all that makes rules-lawyering much more practical in RPGs than in real life. In addition, RPG rules implies a DM or enforcement mechanism that's much more omniscient, powerful, and consistent than any real life law enforcement (mostly fortunately, in both directions), so rules-lawyering is less likely to be overridden by simple violence.

In fact, barring the existence of an unusually helpful AI-type "System" behind the RPG mechanics that not only gives you all the details of the new rules in a humanly-interpretable format, but is additionally willing to listen to your complaints about said system and make adjustments on-the-fly in response to those complaints, rules-lawyering seems more or less impossible.

** I'm not a particularly notable individual, so my main goal would be to survive over adventuring or the like. To that end, I'd think that the average person would want to aim for what's effectively a production class, or a support one. It's a far safer job to stay home making magic items than it is to go and joust with a beholder.

As a group, I think you'd want to establish community interactions very quickly to gain group access to niche abilities. You can change the dynamic of a community very quickly by trying to push magic users to high levels quickly, granting access to things like creating food and water or resurrection.

If we're working off /very/ D&D rules, I'd think that a good goal would be to train up a large variety of magic users and a large variety of artificers, hence allowing you to mass-produce magic items and enact the RPG-apocalypse version of the dawning of firearms. Producing magic items en-masse would increase survivability among the low-levelled, young, or weak to a massive degree.

*** Yeah, you absolutely hit it on the head. The specifics of builds are impossible to determine, we don't have a system described so we can't say things like "go Summoner/whatever". What is universal in such settings and rulesets is the concept of specific builds having counters and weaknesses, and the importance in most cases of building at LEAST a small team to balance out those weaknesses.

Sure you may luck into an OP build (which OP is specifically trying to head off) or circumstances (maybe you happen to be in an area that doesn't offer a diverse array of threats, so a single builds weaknesses aren't very important as long as those aren't the things you'll run into. For example if you live in a swamp and pick some feature with poison immunity you may be OP in your very local area and not have to worry about things so much), but in most circumstances you need a minimum level of diversity.

At a bare minimum you'll want a couple different damage types, healing, and some crowd control. Depending on the details you'll want more variety. In 95% of systems the monsters are largely melee, or there are video game style damage-sharing or super gamey threat-generation mechanics, so you need Tanks and a front line. Sometimes that's not as true and everyone needs to be able to take at least some hits because you can't count on aggro. Another possibility are stamina issues (like with Delve, or touched on in City and the Dungeon) where you may have to choose in your builds between really going strong in one encounter, or being able to keep going through multiple encounters.

The last thing is crafting. If it's something like most MMOs or Culling of Man and everyone gets combat classes and then can pick up a few crafting skills on the side, then great (Or if it's a system where pre-system equipment matters, great, but I don't think I've ever read a Litrpg where the rusty daggers level 5 characters pull out of a rat's anus can't slice through a Main Battle Tank). If it's something like System Apocalypse where people only excel at crafting with specific non-combat classes then the minimal community size for fielding effective people with level-appropriate gear grows a lot larger.

A Dynamo working at an airport may be able to clean 5 planes an hour for a straight 8 hour workday, while another build may only be able to clean 5 planes total in a workday, but if those other people are 8 times cheaper/more plentiful then that's fine, especially considering they can do other labor during the 8 hours.

In the scenario where everyone is awakened that doesn't necessarily mean everyone is level 5 and has a class, but the overall volume of people would still lead to a lot more Cleanse out and about. Cleanse is a fantastic utility skill, so in a universe like ours where MOST people would largely want utility skills because monsters aren't eating us every day, I think a lot of people would want it.

Even if a lot of the people that have Cleanse only use it for a couple bursts that's still a lot of Cleanse to go around.

*** To summarise a strategy, we'd need some basic axioms. Everyone starts at Level 1, roughly normal stats (a D&D average of 10~11), and can choose a class. We'll assume a rough D&D-like system, with things like fireballs, levels, resurrection, healing, and magic items. No version specifics like BAB or proficiency.

Firstly, I'd hold off on picking a class. I'd contact as many people that I'm friendly with as I can. For those who are familiar with RPGs, I'd have them as what's effectively colleagues. For those who aren't, I'd write or prepare a quick explanation of my plans and what they should do. If possible, I'd get most of these people to be near me. If not, long-range communication will do until then.

Once I have a group to work with, I'd see what kind of range of stats and class choices I'm working with. I'd aim for, at minimum, one of a few key class types in my group. I'd want a healer of some kind for certain, be that an Alchemist, Cleric, Priest, whatever. I'd want some sort of mage-type, preferably more along the lines of a D&D Wizard who can share or invent spells rather than a Sorcerer. I'd explain and justify myself to the group as to why we should have our particular class makeup. As for myself, I would likely be something along the lines of a Wizard or Artificer, preferably the latter.

With a group and classes established, I'd then aim for a safe base of operations. Pick someone's house or something, and focus my early efforts on fortifying it to be a safehouse. Ideally, there'd be no monsters in my city, but it pays to be safe.

With a safehouse established, I'd go through the usual apocalypse routines, gathering food, water, and supplies. I'd figure out which of my Level 1 friends could have any method of producing such supplies; D&D typically has /create food and water/ or similar, which can be invaluable. If the system has resetting traps, we're laughing and I'll just go through the Tippyverse motions as supplies become a dime a billion.

Once things are established, I'd work from there. Provide magic items to the vulnerable if able, thus adding them to our community; tabulating as much information about the new system as possible and providing this to whoever asks; finding out how to level up and develop class abilities.

Essentially, I'd try to get a safe basis to work from, and then would try and develop the new world into a stable, functional life, ideally enhanced by magic. Magic items would make this notably, notably easier in every aspect. Food and water could be solved by magic items. Defense against monsters could be solved by magic items. Get high enough levels and even death is immaterial.

Just gotta be safe and able to survive, then you can start exploiting the system.

True, but on the other hand, the rewards would be /massively/ higher, and the moral complications to wrestle with much less. A few years of dungeon diving could make you rich beyond your wildest dreams and powerful as a demigod.

**** In a sensible world this should probably feed back into itself too. The moment you've got a couple of high level clerics known to the general public someone is going to think about using a life insurance policy to pay for their resurrection. Standard economic rules should probably start making the risk of death while adventuring less of an issue over time.

in a few decades most people will have some tier of resurrection insurance and people with the resources to do so would essentially twink their way into capstoning faster by paying a group of high level adventurers to carry them through appropriately over-levelled encounters.

Presumably pretty much everyone would be some shade of full caster due to the greater utility offered. Probably mostly Clerics or the like who can swap out spells every day.

** The answer is that pretty much everyone dies.

The answer is almost always that pretty much everyone dies, in these kinds of scenario.

We, and by we I mean the vast teeming masses of humanity in our billions, rely upon a Just-In-Time delivery system of food and supplies in order to live. Every city, every town in the world does. You have to go down to the level of villages and rural census tracts to get anywhere in the vague vicinity of self-sufficiency, and even then the self-sufficiency is predicated (in the first world, certainly; and often even in developing nations) on access to parts and tools which aren't produced locally.

We all starve to death. The electrical infrastructure can't handle a blackstart. The transportation infrastructure has absolutely no slack in it. All of our clever tricks and systems which were designed to allow very precise carvings away of every bit of resiliency and buffer in the name of quarterly profits wind up becoming our undoing, and we die.

You say that Elizabeth II can pick Queen? Who gives a shit! Britain imports /EIGHTY PERCENT/ of its food. Much of the food it grows relies on imported tools. Elizabeth II will be a carrion queen for long enough for the destabilization and turmoil to set in, and then she will die, along with most of Britain and probably seven billion people along with them.

What's the rational strategy? Take your family and head to a Costco store, where the people who beat you there will shoot you on sight, because their only chance of living long enough for the situation to stabilize is to turn a day's worth of groceries for a thousand people into a year's worth of groceries for a family.

What's the rational strategy? Steal a boat, head to the water, and get killed by monsters while trying to get fish out of an ocean that we have near-completely denuded.

What's the rational strategy? Disappear into the forest, only to find that sustainable forest living is impossible without a long list of skills that you don't have or a support network that doesn't exist anymore.

There is no rational strategy. You just fucking die.

Well, there's at least three assumptions in this that may not be true:

1. Previous physics and our logistical support networks all break down. We're not necessarily all dropped into medieval hamlets being ravaged by dragon gods, though at least /some/ disruption of society is implied by the presence of monsters.
2. Said monsters don't have drops, like food and water. Adventuring might be how people stay fed now. There might be foraging skills and classes that provide limitless food from thin air. Random chests might contain 1000 year old tomb apples & cheese.\\
3. People still have normal biological needs instead of only needing food & rest for regaining HP lost in combat. You might be able to get by fine for eternity greeting adventures at the town entrance and telling them how much you like pickles as an eccentric NPC with only one line of dialogue.

Heck, even if we /specifically/ use 5e D&D rules, any first level character with Goodberry can feed ten people every day with a single spell slot. Create Food & Water is a 3rd level spell that creates abundant food & water for 15 people for a day, without rationing.

That doesn't even count that Survival skills can produce 1d6+Wis /pounds/ of food and gallons of water on a successful check, every day while traveling. Under those rules (which are inconsistent with the previous spell), all a 5e character needs is 1 lbs of food and 1 gallon of water each day to survive. Completely untrained, average people have a 50-50 shot of finding enough food for several days, and the main effects of not being able to eat in D&D is exhaustion, and it takes six levels of that to kill you.

If we go with an MMO or other video game system, the odds are good that you can expect food to just be an HP recovery system, because almost no one enjoys actual starvation mechanics.

**** Because all of this stuff is incredibly fragile.

In the developed world, it's fragile beyond belief. Farming is an industrial process where hydrocarbons (petroleum for transit, natural gas for fertilizer; a lot of farmland would be worthless for a couple growing seasons without fertilizer) and the end-products of a vast array of production lines (various types of machinery, roads, all of the vast dizzying array of transit infrastructure) are turned into crops. The whole system is JIT (Just-In-Time) on many, many levels; the labor is only present when it's needed, the tools likewise, seeds likewise (and hey, why not throw in some no-self-germinating/terminator genes in there), everything only shows up when it's needed because storage space is expensive and these are massive, massive businesses where any cost savings is a large amount of dollar profit. (This also means they mostly ship out what they grow as soon as they harvest it. See also, storing less is more profit.)

These food production chains are vulnerable at every stage to any unpredicted disruption, and nothing says unpredicted disruption like monsters spawning everywhere, widespread economic turmoil, and a sudden decrease in imported (or in the US, often effectively slave) labor (because of the monsters, because of the new opportunities, because of a lot of things).

Farms that are worthless without two seasons of fallow, normally farmed by seasonal day laborers who have better things to do than get eaten by monsters, transported by trucks that no longer have petrol and whose truckers are getting eaten by monsters, you'd need to have a godlike AI constructing your new paradigm in order to have the food-production systems keep working, at which point prediction is useless.

--------------

Here's what I think will happen. There will be panic at first. But despite the fact that storage is expensive, some food is stored (how do you think you get some fruits massively out of season?) and every step along that pipeline /has/ stuff in it at the start.

So yes, there might be a warehouse somewhere from which food is sent out to a city's worth of shops. Maybe there's some problem with some of the trucks - so they send out the trucks that /don't/ have a problem. Maybe there's monsters on some of the roads - so they find /other/ routes. (Monsters on the roads are either able to survive being hit by a car, or won't last long). There will be bottlenexks and shortages for a while, yes; and maybe some of the drivers will go off to find sudden new opportunities. But I think that the only reason why we're likely to see food shortages in the first week is because of people panicing and buying out /all the food they can/. (Which means that those panic buyers won't starve).

Now, international transport will be a bit more of a pain - /particularly/ over the sea, as sea monsters are likely to be /big/. England, in particular, will have a problem, and a massive one (with little more than a week or two to figure out a solution). Other countries will have more minor problems. But humanity will survive in all the countries that have a net /export/ of food; which implies that the first step in a rational strategy is to get into one of them.

** This might be an odd answer, but I think I'd deliberately go for something weird.

Like, the way that I see it is that with a system like this, your first though is gonna be munchkinry. You pick wizard or whatever, because you want the wish spell so you can commence world-optimization. Blah blah blah.

But there are people more suited to that than me. Most people will probably go with either intelligence based shit so they can abuse the system, or combat stuff so they can survive.

But my logic is that if a class exists, it's probably balanced against the other classes, right? Especially in a real-life world altering system. Presumably there wouldn't be anything like "oh this class wasn't popular so we didn't put much effort into it". So therefore, any choice is theoretically valid, and I should just pick something that basically nobody else will, on the off chance it offers something unique. I mean, I know that you said I "can't luck into rare and powerful advantages", but if I'm purposefully going for something odd, I can presumably at least bring /something/ unique to the table.

This of course could make survival early on pretty hard, but again assuming it's at least sort of balanced, I'll probably have SOME way to fight. And I live with my family, and in an area with a decent population, so I see no reason I couldn't rely on others to keep me alive as I figure out whatever weird shit I picked.

(Unless I'm just immediately attacked and don't have time to go over my list of available classes. In that case survival takes priority, and I'd just pick whatever the easiest melee combat class I can get seems to be.)

The OP /literally says/ "you can't luck into rare and powerful advantages." "1% of classes are super OP" means that those classes are, by definition, (a) rare and (b) powerful. They must therefore be available to everyone on equal terms or else gaining one of them would be an act of good fortune. (To be born in a specific place, to discover the mystic McGuffin, etc) Unless you're asserting that the vast majority of people would be idiots and not bother reading the whole list?

#+end_quote

You are confusing the burden of proof. You are making an assertion and you need to support it. I see nothing in OP's post that suggests awareness of classes is instinctive or that the choice can be made casually. You need to demonstrate that this would necessarily be the case.

#+begin_quote

Balance, for one example. Also, why do you assert that this is a 'sense' in the same category as sight or hearing? Why wouldn't it be written information that pops up when you say a specific word? Or an exposition fairy that comes to each individual adult, verifies that you are compos mentis, explains the details, and gets your decision? Or a series of training halls that pop up all over the world and accept applicants? Or a mystic ritual that requires eating the souls of a thousand lemure?

You are taking a nigh-infinite possibility space and saying that it must definitely be the one that you want and no other possibility could exist so there nyah. You need to defend your assertion.

********** Before we continue let's just quote my comment:

#+begin_quote
  The best decision would *probably* be to avoid choosing a class until most people have so you can choose the class that will be most in demand so you can sell your services for maximum profit.
#+end_quote

So quite clearly I am suggesting that most people will probably rush into the decision with very little if any consideration.

#+begin_quote
  The OP literally says "you can't luck into rare and powerful advantages."
#+end_quote

Right, and having some classes turn out better than others is not a rare and powerful advantage. It is the case in almost every RPG that some classes spike at different power levels (and some are straight up worse in nearly every realistic situation).

#+begin_quote
  "1% of classes are super OP" means that those classes are, by definition, (a) rare and (b) powerful.
#+end_quote

Yes having a 100 classes means every class will be rare, or more likely people will gravitate to familiar or cool sounding classes, hence my position

#+begin_quote
  They must therefore be available to everyone on equal terms or else gaining one of them would be an act of good fortune. (To be born in a specific place, to discover the mystic McGuffin, etc)
#+end_quote

Yes, I have no suggesting anything differently

#+begin_quote
  Unless you're asserting that the vast majority of people would be idiots and not bother reading the whole list?
#+end_quote

Indeed, or even that they would read the whole list (if at all especially if they're being immediately attacked or are driving or are surprised or choose one accidentally as a reflex upon gaining a new sense) they would still not choose the "nose-picker" class over "cool warrior awesome guy".

I don't know why you think that every, or even most, people would read the entire ruleset, carefully analyse each individual class (of which there could be thousands), look at every level of the class (if that's even revealed), compare and contrast unbiasedly their own qualities with what makes a class good, estimate the different level spikes and how difficult it is to level in this new world (how would they possibly know this information), and more. I don't really think it's crazy to suggest that a) most people wouldn't wait and b) waiting for more information to make such a crucial decision is probably good.

#+end_quote

Honestly I don't know what's up with you in this post eagle. Are you deliberately misreading me or just wake up on the wrong side of the bed or what? I literally wrote "if". There's nothing to suggest that the choice can only be made after 10,000 hours of important thought where you analyse everything to choose. Hence why I said "if". You at the moment you are granted this sudden decision along with everyone else in the world, have no information at all. Your position is that this makes for a justified headlong dive into immediately choosing. Maybe it does. For example *IF* everyone is immediately attacked by a level 1 mob 5 minutes after the option appears then probably choosing instantly is a good idea.

#+begin_quote
  Balance, for one example.
#+end_quote

From what could you possibly assume within two seconds of receiving this choice that balance would exist or be relevant? You are just making the same guesses as I am. I didn't assume anything, that's why I said

Really, because all I said was "probably" and "if". You asked why would it be sense based and I said why wouldn't it be sense based? As you've correctly deduced there is literally no reason to think the other so this critique of my "if" statement is completely unfounded.

Where are you getting definitely from? This is what I'm talking about. I wouldn't expect you to go in with bad faith and put me on a position I never made any hint of suggesting. Every post I made I have couched in ifs and probablys and maybes.

****** I disagree. Locking yourself in early is very likely to be a mistake if there are many options, and people who haven't chosen yet (and so can become anything that's needed, within reason) may themselves become in high demand. Your chance of "setting the new societal power dynamics" is about the same either way.

I think you're kinda forgetting this isn't a story. People will work together, and if something is OP they will focus resources on training someone they trust up in that. "Going solo" or trying to be a frontrunner is the absolute worst thing you can do for your survivability.

As an example, try finding a roguelike ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/][examples in sidebar of /r/roguelikes]]) you've never played before and win it on your first attempt without using any external resources. This is approximately what you're expecting, and it's not going to happen.

That's a pretty good analogy, except in addition you don't even know if it's a roguelite or if it's permadeath or if it's anything. Basically you don't know nothing, and while in some cases randomly guessing when you know nothing can be better I'd say as a rule you should probably avoid doing so, especially in this case when even the tiniest of delays will give you vast amounts of information.

For example, rather than choosing immediately, turn to the person next to you and see if they have reacted to this sudden choice. If they have well, then it's not just you. Do they look like they are turning hostile to you and are you turning hostile to them? Well maybe it's PVP if they are and you better choose ASAP

*** There's a priority to these things which seems to be consistent across DnD-derived games that feature permadeath. Things usually happen like this as you progress:

1. first, improve your ability to kill things and rely on environment, tactics, strategy, knowledge, consumables/equipment, and patience to kill things without dying. Your source of progression is killing things, so if you can't do that, it doesn't matter how "survivable" you are, you'll eventually die. A dead threat isn't a threat.

Conceptually, when you have nothing from progression, the impact that other resources have is relatively large. Later you simply won't have the damage output to appreciably hurt things, and strategy, tactics, etc often have known optimal solutions. The only way of improving from that is improving the resources you have available: levels, items, etc.

- For example, acquiring modern weapons (if they still work) on top of any system-derived stuff. You'd naturally try to get as many useful items & resources as you could before fighting/putting yourself at risk.

2. Once you can reliably kill things, improve worst-case survivability. This means improving max EHP (assuming you're sensible and go into any fight in peak condition), ways to escape from situations where you're uncertain whether you'll win - you never want to be in a "win or die" fight - and to prevent "special" attacks that are outside the norm and high danger. (Examples might be poison (status effects), putting you in locations/situations you don't want to be like melee with a monster, removing your ability to act (CC), and so on). Average case doesn't really matter because it only matters if your HP hits 0 or not, provided you're not being permanently weakened every encounter.

3. Once the risk of dying from a direct encounter is sufficiently low, then you can think about things that might cause problems in the future. This can be resource-efficiency (including item, time, and EXP), preparing for more than one thing to go wrong at the same time, things which you may be relying on now but may not be available later, and so on.

Basically, killing things instantly or before they get a chance to act is ideal, then ensuring you have a definite out if the situation goes bad (regardless of the actual size of the risk; improbable things happen), then maximising the amount of shit going wrong it will take for you to lose. Though if you start finding yourself in the third situation, it's time to stop fighting because your days are numbered.

Typically you have to constantly evaluate what your priority should be at any given moment; you have to judge when your ability to kill things is "good enough" to know when to switch to max survivability, and the inverse. (To be clear, you cannot reason "my survivability is good enough, I can focus on something else;" you can only switch if it is no longer the case that your ability to kill things is "good enough" or if not preparing for future problems now will cause issues.) Not enough resource/time/EXP-efficiency usually isn't an immediate issue but can cause severe problems in the future, so can also overcome the other two considerations in priority. Standard strategic stuff of course applies like achieving multiple objectives with the same action, putting yourself in situations where every outcome is favourable or acceptable where possible, etc.

Doing this will not put you at the top of the progression ladder, but those who are at the top will be there by luck, and you'll be alive rather than dead.

So I guess in a long-winded way I'm agreeing with you, it's just that it's more complicated than "spec into vitality" :)

**** That you can't have a rational strategy without a utility function. The statement "you are in an apocalyptic rpg" does not provide a utility function and therefore can not be optimized.

If you said "you are the character in fallout 1" you could say "You walk west then make a series of arcane statements about the fertility of super mutants, take the water chip from the master's vault, then return home not truly understanding the magnitude of what you have done only wanting nothing more than to never leave the vault again" But without the goal of getting the water chip and stoping the master there would be no way to optimize.
