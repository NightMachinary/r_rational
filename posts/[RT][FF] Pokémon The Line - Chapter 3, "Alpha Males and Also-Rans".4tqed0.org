** Haven't read the latest chapter yet but I feel a need to acknowledge that /holy crap I'd given this story up for dead and now it's back, this is awesome/.

Anyway, here's hoping for a swift and resounding comeuppance for Blue the traitor and thief.

Edit: Have now read it, good solid entry right there. A shame his squirtle is kind of an ass, but I guess that's more characterful than having every 'mon be perfectly sweet and compliant.

*** Was very momentarily confused until I realized that this is a different fic from The Origin of Species. Just automatically assumed while not reading the complete title.

** Well, it looks like the holy trinity of badass rational pokemon fanfiction is finally complete- after Game of Champions and The Origin of Species, here's The Line. Cannot wait for more.

****** Well, the author's update rate has drastically dropped since he joined the Air Force. There might or might not be some correlation there!

****** I'm generally hesitant to suggest that, as I've heard from various folks that while monetary supplement makes it easier to find the time to write, it also reduces motivation to do so.

**** I believe it still is. The author posted a little excerpt of the latest chapter for beta reading on misc authors forum on darklordpotter back in december, but nothing since. So, its still alive just being updated very very slowly.

** Loving the rivalry between Blue and Red. It's one of the things that Game of Champions did fantastically well, and it looks like this story will too. Looking forward to the next chapter!

** Nice story, pretty solid. One minor correction, the Apricot in the pokeball should be an Apricorn I think? As apricot is actually a fruit in real life.

** u/Sailor_Vulcan:
#+begin_quote
  I looked at the nidoran, and I knew his name. "Your name is Nidoking."
#+end_quote

OMG! I remember how real people did this too when playing the games when I was a kid. It was really funny to see things like a magikarp that was nicknamed Gyrados, or to see someone with an entire team of ordinary pokemon nicknamed after legendaries. nowadays i might want to do something like nicknaming my butterfree venomoth and nicknaming my venemoth butterfree. speaking of which, does Daystar have any plan to explain the whole butterfree/venemoth thing in Pokemon the Origin of Species? why does metapod evolve into something that looks so much like a venonat, and venonat evolves into something that looks so much like a metapod?

** Typo: Ch 1

a hint of sparkle in his eye and /spoke/ (I suspect you went a little too happy here with the replace function)

Fantastic first 3 chapters. Looking forward to seeing your next update. On my watch list now :)
