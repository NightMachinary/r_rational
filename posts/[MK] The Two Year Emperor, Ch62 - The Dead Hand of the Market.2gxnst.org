** Hammond's story was filled with so many remarks upon the lines of "that should have been impossible", that I am made extremely suspicious. The ability to command a goddess especially seems implausible for a non-deity. He could've been getting help from Neklos, I suppose, but this doesn't really sound like Neklos' style, and I am uncertain if he would have had the ability to so easily convince a goddess to give up such a valuable worshipper.

We know that Afi has access to spells which alter people's memories, with which he could easily achieve a memory like that with comparative ease. If it seems plausible that he could summon all the Lich Kings, it ought to be plausible that he could find a way to get them into a scenario where he can hit them with a mindscrape. A memory whose effect seems to have greatly benefited Afi. So, Afi has both the means and motive to Mindscrape such a memory, and seems unlikely to have the means to actually do the things detailed within

It seems far more likely to me that he Mindscraped the memory into Hammond rather than actually doing the things detailed therein

EDIT: I am also suspicious of how Hammond could possibly know that "There is nothing like the presence of a deity, no way to fake it", since he has no way of distinguishing there being a secret way to do so from there being no way to do so

EDIT2: Apparently mind affecting spells do not work on undead. However, my hypothesis could still work, albeit in a more complex manner. If Hammond was PAOed into a human, Mindscraped and then PAOed back, the Mindscrape could still work

It is anything but trivial to sex a skeleton at a glance, and liches can and do make themselves new bodies, making it utterly impossible. The entire war was a gambit to establish a new persona with an even scarier reputation, and without her old entanglements. That provides a reason for the goddess to lie, and she wouldn't need to fake the destruction of the phylactery - no true way to identify who's phylactery it is in that situation, so she could just help an barely-qualifying mage through the process, then promptly betray said mage before the thing was hardened beyond the base level. This doesn't make her much less scary. 3: Illusionist breakthrough.

** I don't think it's /Mindscrape/ - on a meta level, because HPMoR already used that trick several times and it's becoming overused in my mind. If the whole event was fake, then all the details we're given about it are literally meaningless, they don't even work as red herrings. Red herrings still have to be explained - the silhouette on the hill was Watson out for a walk, the butler's scar is an old war wound.

If the events Hammond saw were /Mindscraped/ into him, Afi could have revealed that Manghild was actually two midgets in a robe, and that the entire D&D universe was magically created from the subconscious of Twilight Sparkle and will end when someone learns a lesson about friendship, and the scenario would have otherwise played out in exactly the same way.

If we start calling out "Memory hacking!" every time something impossible happens, we might as well dismiss the entire story up until Chapter 57 as Icefi's fabrication.

I'm enjoying it but I regret that my knowledge of D&D isn't quite strong enough to solve the puzzles. I played a lot of Baldur's Gate and I played D&D itself once or twice with various people, but that's it. I know nothing of all this version 3+ nonsense, hehe. Is there a list of spells somewhere I can look at? I would help a lot.

I was toying with the idea that undead is relative: every so often a bunch of undead swarm and take over the world, then a group of beings that are undead relative to them take over. This is incompatible with alignment, but I never liked alignment in the first place. It's all well and good as a starting point for a character, but if you really look at the definitions, "evil" just means selfish. If there were some sort of "smite evil" effect, it would work just as well on selfish people as maliciously evil-in-the-classic-sense people which is counter-intuitive.

I assume the main reason for the gods being persnickety is because of the supergods, and the supergods are persnickety because of the supersupergods and so on forever because this assumption amuses me.

With this many high-level people around, would the resurrection engine be feasible again?

Just as a brief note, it is nearly impossible to describe how much of an understatement your description of Graham's number is. Merely 2^{2^{1000000}} is more than can be expressed with a digit per elementary particle in the universe. Graham's number is, of course, much much bigger. A lot fewer people know about the Busy Beaver numbers. The short version is that BB(n) grows faster than /any function computable in any finite amount of time whatsoever/. Busy beaver numbers utterly stomp any other number sequence that isn't based on similar principles.

They didn't actually use this strategy, but what did you mean by "one level maze" for the wall following method? It only works in very simple mazes. There are one z-level planar mazes it won't work on.

When they rearranged Grofhamr with a commoner railgun? I believe this was to reorganise Grofhamr to make it more efficient and so that people are closer to the exit for the Herrun ritual. Grofhamr is essentially a tree, with each node being a portable hole and each edge being the connection between a portable hole and the holes inside of it. Its start node was at the entrance, and each node led to up to 3 other nodes, but pre-reshuffling it was extremely disordered, with some nodes extremely far from the start. The reshuffling made it so that each node led to 3 others, which led to 9 more etc, so that if there are less than (3^{n+1}-1)/2 nodes, no node is more than n holes from the entrance

So, in D&D utilitarian calculations are explicitly evil? I don't see any provision in here for "... or through inaction allow people to come to harm". So ... is there an Evil God of Good? Maximizing the cause of Good through possibly-Evil means?

[edit] So I've been reading through the SRD and it looks like the creators simply didn't /anticipate/ acting Evil/disrespecting lifes and dignity out of altruism. So .. does that mean utilitarians fall into Lawful Neutral? It seems like the catch-all alignment ("act according to some personal code [that we didn't anticipate in our Good/Evil spectrum]"). Sort of the alignment of Blue and Orange Morality?

So.. do the Gods strictly operate on SRD RAW re Good/Evil anyways?

It seems pretty clear to me that utilitarian calculations are based on a respect for life and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good doesn't mean Stupid -- Good people are allowed to choose the lesser of two evils.

#+begin_quote
  People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed to others by personal relationships.
#+end_quote

Serious utilitarians have the commitment to make personal sacrifices for their beliefs, and their code operates on a high level (concern for all humans / all life), even if they don't have a personal relationship with the people involved. Therefore, utilitarians are not Neutral.

Everything else I'm coming up with is either a non-created magical being (e.g. elemental) or was once human (vampire), or doesn't really have a mind (zombie, skeleton).

Ah, and the SRD says that golems are animated by a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth, so they aren't actually AI. That just leaves intelligent magic items.

Anyway, magic items are created by humans using magic which clearly works off of intent as much as literal interpretation -- when you cast Move Earth, you don't have to understand the structure of the earth or the different amounts of force required to shift clay as opposed to loam, you just wave your hands and it DWYMs. Ditto for Wish. Under those assumptions, it's not unreasonable that AI in D&D would have a human basis.

Also, since the only way to modify a magic item is through Wish (can you do it via the car acting process? Not sure) then it's unlikely for an intelligent sword to be able to self-improve. Most magic items lack significant ability to influence their environment, providing anothe defense against paperclippers.

************ Outsiders.

Natural outsiders are the definition of alien intelligences. Allison is an example in system, as she likely has different values - although she approaches human norms - but for alignment based outsiders?

Infernal and Abyssal, the languages of devils and demons, literally /do not have words/ for concepts like 'mercy'. These beings are literally made of evil and law/chaos. What they think is part of their being. Demons are, in general, Omnicidal Maniacs because they are trying to return things to the primal chaos that spawned them. That they take pleasure in suffering is almost incidental.

Devils are basically tyranny personified. Angels are the opposite - Celestial doesn't have words for torture or anything like schaudenfreude, but it has dozens of words for mercy and joy.

Imagine a group which literally cannot conceptualize (in most cases) the thought patterns of the other side. Who feels their morality in their very being, because their utility functions are representative of their makeup in the same way our genetics defines ours, only moreso.

That's alien in my book.

This isn't even getting into Far Realm outsiders. That stuff gets really weird.

************** I may have confused it with the Dark Speech, which is the precursor language to Abyssal and Infernal in the same way Latin would be to our English - BoVD page 32:

#+begin_quote
  There are no words in the Dark Speech for good concepts such as kindness, mercy and purity. However evil characters can speak of misery, anguish, hate and betrayal with an accuracy impossible in any other tongue.
#+end_quote

And on it's flip side, the Words of Creation, the precursor language to Celestial, BoED pg 32:

#+begin_quote
  It [The Words of Creation] has no words for evil concepts such as misery, despair, hate and betrayal, while the subtlety of it's terminology for beauty, kindness and mercy is astonishing.
#+end_quote

So, while it is possible that Abyssal/Infernal and Celestial adopted those concepts out of necessity as those languages evolved, older demons and Angels likely learned with the basic forms of the Dark Speech and Words of Creation, as their precursor tongues, so their minds would have been formed with those understandings of the world.

As an aside, in a world where Angels and Demons are canonically birthed from the minds or powers of Gods, created wholecloth from nothing, can we really say they are not artificial intelligences? The Modrons and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitable_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29][Inevitables]] of Mechanus would certainly qualify as AI, likely in form as well as origin.

They were created to enforce universal law on the planes, existing only to do so. There are ones who serve Justice, Death, Time/Space, Divinity(as you have the gods do directly here), and Oaths. They hunt down transgressors like the Furies of Greek mythology hunt down kinslayers.

The Words of Creation ability for Bardic music is especially valuable, as it flat doubles the bonus provided from Inspire Courage (an ability that is already eminently exploitable in the 3.5 ruleset) can be used even by nonmagical characters to get a +4 sacred bonus to Craft checks or to automatically Extend a Conjuration (Creation) effect.

The Dark Speech can be used to weaken physical objects, permanently reducing their hardness by half, or to create (and this gets overpowered fast) a hivemind of insects which gets mental stat increases and *Sorcerer caster levels* for free as it gets larger. The hivemind can also /ignore spell components/. Including expensive or rare ones. So, they could for example Ice Assassin a God without having the requisite piece of the God to do so.

They have Int/Charisma based on size. 500 centipedes have a Charisma 14. 1000 have Charisma 24. 5000 have Charisma /104/. They get 1 Sorcerer caster level per Charisma over 17, so my last example is a level 87 sorcerer with spell slots per day of....

0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9

6/26/25/25/25/25/24/24/24/24

And it just gets crazier from there.

************ The idea of an intelligent sword wanting to be the best sword there ever was and desperately seeking to power Wish spells for self-improvement is a pretty amusing premise, though. Maybe it gets the Extraordinary "Charm Person" ability and sets about trying to convince anyone who comes across (who's still low enough level to fail the DC check) it to enroll in Wizard School, urging them along the path towards getting Wish.

Basically a ridiculous take on the AI-box thought experiment.

** Hey, here's a thought I had: Is there a maximum level you can reach in D&D? Within the 2YE ruleset, I mean, where you can keep going up levels past 20 but there's no epic rules.

I can't find the "player level \ monster level -> XP gained" chart online, but I recall from Order of the Stick that if you're so many levels stronger than the enemy that they literally provide no challenge to you, you gain 0 XP for defeating them. If that is true, then it suggests this: once you've gotten to the point where the strongest monster in the entire game can't challenge you (or at least, the strongest monster that you can find in large enough quantities to train against), then you'll hit a level cap. You'll only gain XP at all when you fight other people who've had the same idea as you, which is not exactly ideal level-grinding material.

Any idea what the hard limit on levels might be? Less than 50? More than 1000? Or are there creatures in the outer darkness of arbitrarily high power that could provide decent XP even to a level googoolplex character?

(I wouldn't try actually hitting this level cap unless I were a god, or an Afi, but it's still useful information.)

*** The XP charts aren't part of the SRD; they are only in the books. (I believe PH, but not sure.) You can find PDFs of the books online if you look.

Power levels cap out on classes - a level 20 wizard gets the exact same number of spells as a level 1,000,000,000,000 wizard, all else being equal. (Which it wouldn't be due to increasing ability scores, but you take the point.) Beyond this capstone, the character only gains minor benefits such as a few more HP.

You're absolutely right about an effective limit due to inability to find a challenge, but that wouldn't happen until quite late. I'm not sure how late though.

It's an interesting question; if anyone more familiar with the monster lists wanted to poke at it, I'd be curious to know the answer.

** About the Grappling Run (wrong chapter but meh), Shouldn't they still be unable to run through enemies? Or at least those that take up all the corridor space? Bull Rushes don't become stronger through speed (i.e range of the Bull Rush) and in any case Initiative still applies as normal (although the raids Dex should be far beyond average so that might often not be an issue). If 2 Iron Golems stand next to each other in a tunnel you cannot run through them according to RAW. And if you cop-out is that they get knocked aside by Mach 7, well that would be real life physics in which case Mach 7 also squishes soft humans all bunched up in a 5 ft square.

Also, isn't it possible to fire conjuration spells into an Anti-Magic Field as long as the casting of the spell happens outside of the field? Damage dealing conjurations actually summon a non-magical projectiles as far as I know. Or in RAW words:

  "The effects of instantaneous Conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result."

*** [dealing with creatures]

They didn't Bull Rush anything. As per canon, they killed it.

My take on it is that they get a surprise round because they're traveling hypersonic. During the surprise round they run up to the enemy, stab it with five or six dozen daggers, then continue running past its bleeding corpse. (Assuming that it bleeds. In any case, corpses do not block movement AFAIK.)

[conjuration spells into AMF]

That's how I read it, yes: conjurations that manifest outside an AMF can still go into it. Fireballs, Lightning Bolts, and Manyjaws (the things that Hammond was asserted to be using) are all Evocation spells, so the AMF nullifies them. If he had had spell traps that:

1. Used Conjuration spells...
2. Which did not require targeting or manifesting inside the AMF...
3. Could reasonably affect the Meatball by RAW...

...then yes, Hammond's traps could have affected them.

** Can Mind Affecting spells affect sentient undead in 2YE? [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Undead_Type][The SRD]] say that they can't, but Icefi says in Chapter 57 that

  Then he Mindscraped the memories out of himself so that the next time His Bossiness decided to manifest through him, the memories wouldn't be there to be noticed.

Mindscrape seems pretty clearly mind affecting, and none of the people there seem to think anything is amiss by that statement. Besides, it seems a logical continuation of your rule in chapter 10 that undead can be knocked out if they have a mind
