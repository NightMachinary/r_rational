** Interesting, at least. Definitely not terrible, but I think I'll withhold judgment on meh/good/great until a few chapters in, seeing as that's only going to be a few days from now.

*** Agreed. Has potential, but with only one chapter it's hard to say more.

** I'll be impressed if the author actually manages to finish a novel-length story in about 20 days (read 50,000 words). Either the author already has the whole thing written, or has the story planned out in extreme detail and this is a NaNoWriMo-like challenge for himself with plenty of free time to do it in.

I'll read the chapter tonight and post my criticisms on the site then.

Good luck [[/u/Wertifloke]]!

... /Later Comment/ ...

Does it qualify as an 'acasual trade' if I used my model of [[/u/Wertifloke]] to understand that he's holding future chapters hostage unless his readers leave reviews, as a reason to leave a detailed, hopefully insightful comment?

Does anyone know of good sources on Game Theory? Preferably online, but books are good too.

*** Chapter 2 is up, [[/r/rational]] isn't showing it in the "new" section, though.

Chapters will not be held hostage, naturally. Defectors are free to defect, but if they do, they may find themselves stranded in a desert by Derek Parfit.

*** You can actually take [[http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159][Yale's Game Theory class]] online, with all of the lectures in series (Youtube, HTML transcript, MP3), all the course materials, handouts, blackboard notes, etc.

You can also check out the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/dbe/introduction_to_game_theory_sequence_guide/][LessWrong Introduction to Game Theory Sequence]].

Not an expert here, but this seems like ordinary causal trade to me; you did something that your model of the world expects to causally cause them (or make it more likely for them) to post.

Now, if they had originally posted all the chapters at once with the expectation that people would comment /anyway/ - now, /that/ has a chance at being acausal. Not really, because your model is nowhere near detailed enough to actually make acausal trade possible, but at least that would be the kind of thing that could work if the models were better.

Hope that answers your question.

*** [[https://class.coursera.org/gametheory-004][This one]] is pretty good, goes into good depth and I think there is a follow up class.
