** If it's just one gene it should be pretty easy, at least in a decade or two, to use gene therapy on anyone who didn't have it. Also, isn't self-awareness different from qualia? Self-awareness is just awareness of your own thoughts and existence. I don't think anyone who didn't have self-awareness would be able to operate on the same level as ordinary humans. Even some animals can pass the mirror test and all humans pass the mirror test after infancy.

*** Why would you want to make people have qualia, though?

**** I certainly don't know. Qualia doesn't seem to actually do anything as far as my understanding of it can tell, and I doubt it actually exists. It seems as useless to me as the concept of a soul, created by people who would like to believe we are something more than biological machines but aren't satisfied with just self-awareness. But gene therapy would make a lot more sense than generations of discrimination or rounding people up in concentration camps like some of the responses to the prompt suggested, and it probably wouldn't hurt to have qualia, at least. I suppose people who got the therapy would be able to describe the difference it makes. In real life, of course, very few people seem to actually care about these philosophical issues except when it gives them an advantage to pretend to.

** I read the story, read some explanations on qualia, and I'm still confused by the concept.

*** The author of /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ wrote pretty extensively on the topic in the sequence of the same name:\\

(and, to a lesser extent [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/r9/quantum_mechanics_and_personal_identity/][here]].

ETA: Reddit hates links ending with parentheses, so I separated out the Zombies sequence link. Does anyone know a better fix to this?

Check the source for what RES suggested, looks like you need escape characters.

*** Qualia are pretty confusing. When I've tried to nail the concept down concretely, it's wriggled out of my grasp every time. I can't point to any aspect of reality and say that that is definitively an example of qualia. As such, I'm provisionally a qualia non-cognitivist.

** The obvious lesson from this is that zombies are evil and should never be trusted.
