** I feel like this is super-extra-ultra-levels ill-advised. Why not record a waveform of himself saying the divine name that grants the Divine Spark, and then play it back, to see what happens on the Windows PC, first of all, before jumping straight to "let's wake up this laptop while it's saying unknown Names"? I appreciate that this character is not super cautious or conservative or properly paranoid, but I really think his actions this chapter will /explode/ in his face really soon.

The software Llull seems like a giant POTENTIAL TRAP to me. I mean, if software and nonliving/unsouled things can't invoke Names of God, then that should have been discovered with tape recorders and playing back digitalized recordings of human voices and so forth approximately as soon as the first names of God were discovered. Initial feasibility tests would discover it's impossible, and then the high-speed ultra-optimized version that could compete with the entire world off of an aging laptop would be spectacularly pointless / useless to actually write. And then, writing Llull at all to be as functional as it apparantly is would be a gigantic, colossal waste of time because everyone would know it wouldn't work before they really started. However, if I was a totalitarian organization (/cough/ UNSONG /cough/) worried someone would come up with the Divine Name that gives souls to things and not tell me, as people have already predicted that name's length apparantly(?), I might put out a lot of effort to create a bunch of software that would be a singer's dream if they ever come up with the name to awaken souls... and I'd set it up to seem to work perfectly /except/ it would /also/ repeat a known name of God that I'd be monitoring for every ten minutes or so, so my agents could quickly home in on the computer as soon as it was granted a soul and running Llull.

PS: Do parrots repeating names of God have noticeable effects?

I thought it would be a mild, hobbyist's waste of time, myself. All it is is a speech synthesizer plugged into a word list and given odd parameters for speed.

I don't know how the discovered Name logging works, so that may be a lot of effort.

**** As noted [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-4-tools-were-made-and-born-were-hands/#comment-571][here]] saying a name the first time isn't dangerous, so discovering it should be OK.

It's not explained /how/ Llull knows a divine name from random syllables, so that's another problem.

****** A human knows to stop talking since divine inspiration is a END command. An algorithm has no contingency for that, and I can't think of a way they'd program one in without knowing about the Vital Name.

...Unless the Vital Name creates a ghost in the machine-like entity that can, in fact, reach around it own programming.

******** The problem is that the Vital Name may flip the switch that tells the universe to turn whatever comes out of the computer's speaker into a magic effect, but it presumably won't change the computer program's flow. If up until now it always outputs that the name didn't work, then there's no reason for that to change now, unless the computer program observes its surroundings for the effects of magic.

** Prediction: The number four will be prominent in this chapter. Chapter 3 had many threes, including being set 40 * 3^{5} days before the discovery of the Vital Name in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 had many twos, including references to duality. Chapter 1 had many ones, though that's hard to separate out from the high base rate that I would expect (but that isn't a coincidence!)

Off to read the chapter...

EDIT:

"...he were to buy a second computer? What about a third computer? What about +a giant Cray supercomputer...+ *A fourth computer*"

"Knowledge brings discord (1), knowledge ripens (2), knowledge is poisoned (3). Men greedily devour the exterior of knowledge, but the core they do not reach (*4*). "

"Knowledge was first domesticated in southern Turkey (1) or northern Mesopotamia (2), from which it spread to the rest of the world, although some scholars claim its modern genome owes more to various European ancestors (3). Most historians believe it was first brought to the New World by colonists, but this ignores the existence of native American varieties (*4*)..."

"I stood up...I placed my hand above it...I started...and I ended"

This is four sets of four, but that is /probably/ a coincidence, as I think I missed at least one thing.

*** The problem with human pattern-recognition is that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia][it works even when there is no underlying pattern]]. It works in-story because it's just that sort of story. Trying to apply "there are no coincidences" to the real world, such as the text of a web novel, is considerably less well-advised.

**** I agree with you for real life, but I think that applying "there are no coincidences" to a web novel /specifically about/ there being no coincidences, with an author that I believe could pull off meta-level references of this scale is a much better idea.

I suppose we'll see if chapter number = significsnt number /in/ the chapter within the next few weeks.

***** Chapter 5 is out. Let's see what numerical references we can glean from it, shall we?

Okay, I think I've proven my point. There are plenty of numerical references scattered throughout chapter 5, but none of them are overwhelmingly more prominent than any other.

Remember [[http://hpmor.com/chapter/8][the number game Harry Potter played on the train in HPMOR.]] It's not enough to find evidence that supports your theory. You also have to look for evidence that /disproves/ it.
