Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Any advice for dealing with negative feedback? I keep finding myself really bummed out by it, to the point where my wife was asking me why I was in such a bad mood.

I've been trying to disassemble what's /really/ bothering me, and trying to split it out into different categories, but they're fuzzy categories, because things like "this is bad execution" and "this is not to my tastes" can have a significant amount of overlap, and there's also a good chance that the person responding hasn't actually identified their real objection, which results in this confused negativity.

(I think it's usually a mistake for creators to respond to criticism, especially in terms of prose fiction, where there's a large amount of interpretation. 99% of the time it comes off as defensive (which it is, because a work is being defended) and when it doesn't, it brings in too much that's outside the work itself -- you can't patch a plot hole that exists within a work through WoG, in my opinion, and you especially can't/shouldn't reveal the message that you intended to convey but were unable to.)

*** Do you do the thing where negative feedback registers as meteorites impacting the soil of your soul, but compliments are merely a pleasant breeze blowing by? I struggle with that--with being much more willing to doubt complements than criticisms, or (similarly) with spending much more time attending to negative feedback. Positive feedback is less actionable, after all.

If that is what you are struggling with, it might be a good idea to spend more time contemplating the positive feedback you've received. People love your stories. You could approach it like complements are mysteries to be solved--their true reasons for loving your works are in many ways as mysterious and poorly reported as criticisms. I also want to add that if someone likes your work for a reason different than the reason you wrote it, that is still something worth celebrating (I think). Having a positive effect on another person is remarkable, especially if it is apparently by accident.

As for responding to criticism... Hmm. I think you are right, but still... discussing your intent with at least a few people is probably beneficial. You can go to a trusted third party and ask them if they understand a criticism of your work, or if the criticism has merit in the first place. That would allow you to detect spurious criticisms and also reduce the emotional strain of figuring out legitimate criticisms.

That's all I've got, I hope it helps. Ah, well, you should also know that your excellent writing made me (and probably others) hesitate to offer advice. It feels like a rowboat advising a cruise ship, and it's not like I really know how to handle negative feedback either.

**** It sometimes feels like I'm making this giant mural on the side of the road, ten feet tall and eighty feet wide, with these big, complex, dominating shapes, a woman draped across the forest floor, a fox slinking by her, a boxy generator covered in moss, all in huge proportions.

And then someone wanders by, spends a few seconds taking it in, and says, "The proportions on that woman are kind of wonky". And it's just /so/ deflating, because I spent all this time, and out of everything that I was trying to express, that was what they saw. And if I think they're wrong, then there's nothing that I can actually do except try to figure out what made them say that, and sometimes there's no good answer -- and I'll just feel like I'm trying to fix a problem that's not actually there. And if they're /right/ then I either have to redo the whole fucking thing, or just scrap it and then go paint a different mural somewhere else, because it's going to take nearly as much time to fix the proportions as it did to just paint the woman in the first place. Or finish it, and live with the fact that it's imperfect, and hope that every time someone new sees it they don't circle back to the woman and her slightly off proportions.

Or someone will come along and say, "Eh, I don't really like foxes" as though I've wasted their time by painting a thing with foxes in it, and out of everything that I've made, their focus immediately went to the fox, and that was the thing that they chose to comment on. I want to shake them and tell them that I'm not making this mural for /them,/ I'm making it for people who will see this thing that I'm imperfectly trying to express, or failing that, at least for the people who can enjoy a fox.

Or someone will say, "I'm normally really into this sort of thing, but it just didn't do it for me, I don't know", and that always feels like failure. I only managed to transmit a fraction of what I wanted to that person, and that person is likely to be the exact sort of person that the mural was /for/ in the first place. It was put up where everyone could see it, but it wasn't for everyone, and of the small group of people that were actually meant to enjoy it, I lost this one person because I screwed up somewhere at doing the thing that I feel like I was most driven to do.

Except it's not just one or two people giving their complaints, it's a bunch of them, and some of them are coming to the cafe and sitting down at my table when I'm not even working on my murals, because they want to tell me directly how much they didn't like my mural.

--------------

Some of it is helpful -- maybe even most. Sometimes someone tells you that the proportions on the woman are off when she's just an outline in pencil, and you can fix it. Or someone will point out that the fox has a reflection in one eye but not the other, and you can fix that in a matter of minutes. And other times it's stuff that can't be fixed, or can't be fixed easily, or is just a matter of taste.

And sometimes people aren't even talking to me, they're talking to other people they're viewing the mural with, and it only feels personal because they're talking about something personal in such an impersonal way.

--------------

I think last time I calculated my writing speed for prose, it was about 500 words per hour, though it kind of varies depending on what I'm writing and how intensely I'm in the zen of it. That means that something like /Worth the Candle/ is quickly approaching a thousand hours of my life (so far), which breaking down the math, seems more or less accurate.

If the average person reads 300 words per minute (probably low-balling it), that means that they can get through 400,000 words in about 22 hours of reading.

I think about those numbers a fair amount -- how comparatively easy it is to consume, versus how hard it is to produce.

And then I look at 22 hours, and I think that's actually still a lot of time, and it feels even worse when someone says that it was a waste of their time. I don't understand the mentality that allows people to sink that much time into something that they're not happy with, and it makes me feel weird and uncomfortable to know that I had a small role in that terrible decision on their part. Wasting a day of your life on something that only kind of interested you, that you kept churning through because you felt like you had to get to the end, when you were under no actual compulsion to do so, when there are millions of other things out there you could have been trying instead ... I don't know. It gets to me sometimes. Like I'm a rock that ships are dashing themselves on for no clear reason.

***** Thank you for the thorough reply. The metaphor was illuminating in particular, but I'm going to address the math first. Incidentally, the math really proves the "rowboat vs cruise ship" thing I was talking about.

It looks like you need at least 36 readers to break even on 'time spent writing' vs 'time spent reading'. I think most of the time you can trust readers to quit reading if they aren't enjoying themselves, but in those cases where you can't, for every reader above number 36 who enjoys your story you can justify one reader who doesn't. That's a bar you easily pass. Hundreds of people upvote posts of your stories on the [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Your stories are a net positive.

Beyond that, I don't think it makes sense to judge your writing this way. You probably gain some things from writing it independent of readership, so it's not like time spent writing is a pure cost. Furthermore, the readers who claim to hate it probably enjoy hating it. They are getting exactly what they signed up for, so I wouldn't worry about them too much. They aren't ships dashing themselves on the rocks, they are surfers who don't fear the violence of the waves. You can't feel responsible for them being in the water, or for them not being carried along by your work--the former is their fault, the latter is an inevitable accident of the circumstances they willingly accept.

You've made something apparent to me. I only write short stories thus far, and I only let five or so people read them before they are complete. I trust those five people, a lot, and I take their criticisms to heart. Your ongoing fiction allows people to provide feedback much earlier in the process than I would allow, and I can see that it has a cost. Thank you for making your incomplete work available for us. You know, most people making murals set up ropes to prevent passerby from interrupting. Perhaps you really should stop looking at criticisms?

I really like the mural metaphor. These people who chase you down to insult your mural aren't standing in front of the mural. They ran away from it. It looks like they aren't interested in the work, they're interested in the artist's reaction to their opinion. They have to run quite a ways to be heard, or so it seems. The artist, in that case, is likely the only person listening to them.

Another thing: long after you've gone onto bigger and better murals, and indeed even if you ever quit making murals, this mural will still be there. It will catching the eyes of passerby and inspiring discussion long past the time you are paying close attention to what people are saying.

Finally, it's valid to feel bummed out when people don't like your work. But, in the interest of evenness, why not be joyful when people like your work? I'll note I read each chapter of /Worth the Candle/ two or three times and not once have I felt the need to criticize it. It's really good.

I didn't say anything about the mural I went out of my way to walk by so many times. It was really good.

***** Unless I'm misunderstanding, it sounds like you are reading negative feedback and trying to translate it into critique. Have you considered picking up a few beta readers, or even after the fact readers, just some people you trust to give you honest and helpful feedback? There's probably something virtuous about always listening to negative feedback about your work, whatever spirit it's offered in, and trying to take something useful from it, but it's not clear that the tiny marginal value of the actually useful feedback is worth the cost in being upset or bummed out. Where hand-picked readers/crit groups let you find people who have a high usefulness/harmfulness ratio.

Some people who give negative feedback are genuinely trying to help and are bad at it. Some people are just trying to express that they Didn't Like Thing--I don't think people see much difference between going on [[/r/MarvelMovies][r/MarvelMovies]] and saying "ugh Black Panther sucked I hated the CGI!" and saying something similar about a web serial where the author is literally right there in the reddit thread. Listening to the latter group seems like a recipe for frustration and failure.

***** Is this generally criticism that you feel is important to read, where your issue is not being able to be dispassionate, or is this a case where filtering it out before you heard of it would be an acceptable (if not ideal) solution? If it is a mix, how would you partition it?

I think it's obvious that, at least on [[/r/rational]], your work is overwhelmingly viewed favourably. It is not obvious to me that your aversion to responding to criticism allows you to have significant direct impact on the critic in most cases, though I did appreciate [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vxian/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_7274/dtwnxut/][that time you replied to mine]]. It does not seem to me that this sums up to the advantages of exposing yourself to the minority critical view being worth your discomfort. You are certainly an exceptionally talented writer; you don't /need/ a correcting hand.

***** On the other hand, imagine thousands of people staring at your mural for 22 hours straight because they enjoy it. Sure we don't say anything - we're just lurking in the forest. But, at a minimum, we enjoyed it enough to spend 22 hours on it. Hours we could have spent chatting, watching, or reading millions of other things.

It's pretty natural for critics to take up your attention, but if you turn your attention to those thousands of people instead, you'll see you've made an big impact.

Hmm; I don't know about that.

If someone has bothered to read your story up to this point, rather than giving up after a single chapter, well, they've almost certainly had /tons/ of thoughts about it. 99% of people won't ever "hate-read" a text; they continuously measure the effort required to continue reading vs. the reward they're getting out of it, and if the reward isn't /still/ worth it, they stop reading, /and/ stop participating in the related community. They just drift away.

So, when one of these people finishes reading everything you've written so far, and all they have to say is some superficial critique about something they noticed in the latest chapter---that's not because that's /all/ they have to say. That they're still here, by itself, says a lot.

No; what's happening is that you've emotionally affected them, and they're now too /shy/ to share their real feelings about your work, because those feelings feel too fresh and deep to be something they're comfortable talking about with anyone, let alone the creator.

Look at the average fandom of a work on Tumblr. Those people talking to each-other gushing about how much they love a work, squeeing and dying and whatever else? Those are the small percentage of people who are somehow immune to the entirely-normal human reaction of "reverence anxiety." They're exceptional in that way; we think such behaviour strange enough to point it out.

But for every one person who consumes art and then shares their feelings about it, there are many more people who consume art and then hide their feelings. For every one Beatles "fan", there are hundreds of people who have Beatles songs on their phone.

What would one of those people who has The Beatles on their phone say, if they were asked about a particular song? They wouldn't tell you their /feelings/ about it, surely. They'd maybe share trivia about it, or some little thing they noticed.

And if, instead of The Beatles (who society says "is good" whether you think so or not), it was a local indie band? And you were /at/ their show, and they had just performed a new song? Well, you don't know any trivia---they just performed the song for the first time---so you've only got things you've noticed. And, since they're not universally venerated as above cultural reproach, some little /negative/ thing you've noticed is on the table. It might help them! You'd sure love to help them! Because of all those feelings you'd never tell them in a million years!

Or, to put all that another way: a priest will never be told he's doing a good job by the members of his congregation. But he will almost certainly have it pointed out if he has his collar untucked. Because you, as such a member, would want him to look his best for the other members. Just as if you were his mother.

I prefer [[/u/wassname]]'s mental imagery above. I think when you're already in a mopey mood, it's easy to fall into negative perspectives. But if you tilt your view a bit, the net enjoyment created by your story outweighs /by far/ the net disappointment of a few naysayers who stuck with it. Say we used the unreliable stat of Kudos on AO3: even if we account for the unreliability, that's likely more than a thousand people * 22 hours of enjoyment = a lot of time people have spent on something you created. And you've already reached more people than the hours you've spent writing.

Neither is it your responsibility to satisfy everyone who /chose/ to invest their time into reading your story. It's kind of like saying that "not everyone in the world likes me, but if I were just slightly different in this way, then maybe they would like to spend time with me." I'd say it's unhealthily egotistical to feel that guilt. After the latest WtC chapters, I can even see vague parallels between this and Uther's dilemma. It's a treacherous road when you have to worry about every negative consequence (however minor) to something you've produced with positive intentions.

(so I was a little surprised when it turned out you were the one writing it)

And... I dunno, I'm glad I didn't stick by it? I know if I had, I would be perpetually annoyed by it and have the urge to criticize and nitpick everything, and not in a fun way.

*** Not an author, but as a reader: Whenever I see somebody bluntly criticizing/shitting on an author's work in their own subreddit/thread or one they've just taken the time to comment in ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/7y5u38/shade_46_parahumans_2/due10hh/][this recent one of Wildbow's comes to mind]], or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bakker/comments/7st55f/entertain_us_not_yourself/][this thread posted to R Scott Bakker's sub]]), I get really angry. I have to imagine most reasonably empathetic people have a negative reaction to people who do that. So I would suggest something which may not on the face of it appear healthy, but which I think maybe actually is: Get annoyed; or get irritated; tell yourself "this person is socially inept, or a troll, or the kind of person that leaves YouTube comments, or at the least an uncomfortable embarrassment to many people reading this." You'll almost always be correct, except in the rarest instances of delicately phrased, positive feedback.

Think maybe despite the poster's social miscarriages there's useful feedback somewhere in there for you? - maybe. But it won't be useful to you if it gets you down, and unsolicited and read when you are not mining comments for it, there is no reason to derail what you were getting from comments to switch tracks to those laid by this idiot commenter. It is a kind of crossing of boundaries, to come into an author's space and say unwelcomed things which would be rude to say in person. In person you may be hesitant to say "Yeah thanks, shut up." But in your own head, it just may help you improve in disregarding these people's words.

*** How about making a metaphorical processing factory for the reviews, and only paying more personal attention to the end-result of the said factory, instead of the reviews themselves?

The reviews you're interested in get dropped into the first sector of the factory, where they get decomposed \ disassembled into component units; and these units themselves get sorted into specific categories. Biggest categories being “positive” and “negative” review sections, with smaller categories \ sections like “boring writing style”, “insightful”, “motivating”, “plot holes”, etc.

From here on out, an individual handling approach can be devised for each of the smallest categories, depending on its specific properties.

For instance:

- toxic criticism → just discard them

- unfixable plot holes → 1) keep them in mind for future works and 2) discard the new incoming review blocks like this about this particular plot hole after stage 1 has been completed

- fixable plot holes → look for ways to fix them and fix them

- vague criticism → 1) collect them together to try and synthesize them into something more meaningful, using them all as context for each other. 2) show them to other writers for fresh qualified opinions

  - vague criticism of the "I'm normally really into this sort of thing, but it just didn't do it for me, I don't know" variety → collect them together and show to the active interested audience for some possible insight, every once in a while

- positive review parts → 1) use them as “eye bleach” after working with negative review parts 2) look for unintended positive outcomes and try to replicate them

- negative review parts the accuracy of which is hard to determine due to their subjective matter → view them as statistical data \ audience response polling data

And so on.

There are only so many things that a review can be talking about, and once enough reviews get disassembled like this, it should become rather easy and quick to deal with new incoming reviews. /And/ it will not require as much energy emotionally, since there are specific protocols in place for “handling the potentially hazardous” materials.

  Any advise for dealing with negative feedback
#+end_quote

Personally, I'm an inexperienced writer, so I respond to all feedback /period/ with the intention of getting people to feel "heard" so they give more feedback in the future, negative or positive. The idea being that even people somehow less experienced than me provide valuable data that I can use to improve myself.

On the flipside, you're not [inexperienced]. Also, you have a fairly large readerbase. So there's going to inevitably be "noise," where you have feedback that purports to be helpful (and indeed, may even be polite, well thought out, and given with good intentions), but isn't. So instead, excluding the genuinely high-value pieces of feedback from other experienced writers, treat feedback as more of a statistic. One random complaining about how plot point x didn't make sense is just one random. Several randoms doing that likely indicate that there's some structural deficiency in how you presented x, even if x itself actually made perfect sense because of reasons y and z.

And while there's no accounting for taste, people who "just didn't like" something still have valid opinions. Not in the sense that you should have changed that something to be what they wanted (because then you'd just have another contingent of your readership complaining), but in the sense that these people aren't feeling catered to for whatever reason, and if you think you can identify what that group of people want to see, and can afford to cater to those people without pissing off everyone else, maybe you can slip in some discrete fanservice (so to speak.)

You have the genuine "haters" who aren't constructive and generally just want to make a mess. There's always the danger, as an artist, of getting your head stuck so far up your ass that any and everyone who disagrees is a "hater," but I doubt you personally are at risk for that, so if you assess someone to be a "hater," chances are you're probably right.

*** Patrick Rothfuss's /The Name of the Wind/ on GoodReads: 4.55 / 5.00. #1 "most popular fantasy", beating the #2 /LoTR: Fellowship of the Ring/ 32k to 23k "points". Here are five reviews from the first page of 30 (sorted: Default). These are not the only negative reviews on that page.

#+begin_quote
  1/5. I have no interest in imagining I'm someone who is stronger, deadlier, smarter, sexier, etc. than myself - a famed hero in a milqtoast world little different from modern North America. I read fantasy to immerse myself in strange worlds ripe with danger and conflict. To uncork primal wonders. And there is none of that in Rothfuss' book. [...]

  1/5. I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfuss. For realz, actual sorry. Honestly. I tried giving your book two stars out of pity, since I so wanted to like it and I'd feel bad about giving it one star and dragging down your average rating. Though you don't appear to need my pity. Your book has the highest average GR rating (4.49) of any of the book I've read. I finally dropped my rating down to one star because it's just a steaming pile of crap and I couldn't take the embarrassment of having posted a two-star rating [...]

  1/5 Okay. Wow. Let's back the hell up here. How is this so highly rated? Are those genre-establishment reviewers who're thrashing about in paroxysms of fawning five-star NEXT BIG THING OMG joy wearing blinders or just so used to mediocre fantasy that this book actually comes across looking good in comparison? Why do these high fantasy disappointments keep on keeping on? [...]

  1/5. [...] I had to downgrade this from 2 stars to 1. I have a very visceral negative reaction whenever I am reminded of this book. I have blocked this book's existence from my mind and whenever someone mentions it, I want to foam at the mouth. [...]

  1/5. "I really, really wish I could give this negative stars."

However, given some of the clarification that OP later provided, "unreasonably negative feedback" seems less directly relevant.

** I just had a potentially-interesting (depending on execution, of course) idea.

A lot of mythology has ageless, extraordinarily long-lived, and even straight-up immortal characters. Imagine being one of these characters at the dawn of civilization. The humans are creating all sorts of neat things, and spreading over world, and waging wars, and telling stories, all all sorts of cool stuff. So you start interacting with them; giving out divine boons and choosing favored avatars and maybe sleeping around

But after a few thousand years of civilization, it starts seeming old-hat. Sure, the humans are still creating new stuff, migrating everywhere, and waging wars. But there's a cyclical pattern to it, and you're beginning to get bored. Maybe you make deep emotional connections with specific humans, but they die after only a few decades, and eventually you're just humaned-out, and retreat to the spirit realm, or heaven, or hell, or the space-between-worlds, or wherever you're from.

Not every mythological being does that at the same time, and perhaps some never truly leave. But after hundreds of years, the vast majority disappear, and humans are left in a world of (mostly) pure logic and cold reason.

And then, the singularity.

Suddenly, things are getting really, really weird, really really fast. And that piques your interest. Plus, this "biological immortality" thing means individual humans will actually be around for an appreciable timescale...

--------------

So we have a post-singularity world, and also there's magic. There are infinitely many possible cool stories to write in such a world, but we have finite time (barring immortality and the removal of entropy) so what kinds of stories would you want to hear?

*** I think you could tell an interesting story about humanity confronting something cosmically larger than itself, and also having to reconcile how that has influenced its own development. It'd be a story where the Singularity ceases to be the ultimate goal and becomes just the new status quo that faces disruption by unexpected revelations.

Honestly, I think it could make a really interesting satire of modern philosophical conflicts. We've built a civilization and culture that seemed reasonably good and continuously optimizing, only to confront new problems that we hadn't considered and realize how little we still know about ourselves. Many are no longer confident that civilization has been on the right track.

The reappearance of magic after the Singularity could be a good metaphor for how many of us feel that the world has turned upside down over the past few years and so much of what we believed about the world, including our place in it, turned out to not be as clear as we thought. Now we have to figure out what to do with what we have before everything we built falls apart.

** Something I'm struggling with recently is kinda feeling like humanity doesn't have much of a chance at an extreme long future. Anything past the end of our solar system. There are various reasons for this, but the basics is a combination of worry around the great filter and a general feeling that extremely destructive tech is getting cheaper and easier to use.

Basically how do we get through the next couple thousand years without either killing all of us or destroying civilization. I'm confident that if we can manage that humanity's probably destined for at least another million, but I'm not happy with our odds. Do we need to actually move to avoid certain technology. Is there bad information? I'm generally pretty optimistic but I'm feeling like I'm loosing that optimism. Any advice from anyone? Should I just not worry about such distant dangers? I feel 50 to a hundred years is probably going to continue with an upward trajectory so maybe it doesn't mater that humanity will probably never make it to the stars.

*** Our odds improved somewhat with the end of the Cold War. Nonetheless, there are some practical ways in which the odds of humanity's continued existence can be improved.

- Remember that history is made by people. Pick your favourite historical character, someone who had a dramatic effect on the world - whether Albert Einstein, Mahatma Ghandi, Nelson Mandela or J.R.R. Tolkein. Each of them was /just one person/. Now, remember that when anyone tells you that /just one person/ can't make a difference. Exactly /how/ you can do that in your current circumstances depends a lot on what your current circumstances are.

- You're looking at the long term. In general, to best improve the odds of people surviving over the long term, the aim is to ensure that future generations of people are educated, intelligent, and generally content with their lot - that is, they have their basic physical needs covered. If you have some way of helping to ensure this, then go for it.

- Small remarks can have a surprisingly large effect. One possible way to encourage humanity to move to the stars is to start and push a suitable meme - this might encourage more people to move into space-related fields, or study relevant technologies. It's a small thing, but it tilts the odds a little more in the desired direction...

** I have a basic question about an inference problem I'm working on -- if I have a prior of 0 and a likelihood of +∞ am I ok? To simplify, let's say the model I'm fitting has 3 continuous parameters with two normals and one exponential for priors. When the first two parameters have identical values and the third has value zero (so positive prior densities all around) I get singularities in my likelihood surface. But the set of these combinations has measure zero, so despite infinite posterior density (?) at infinitely many points I think I'm still good? Obviously in ML-inference you'd be in big trouble but I think Bayes is ok (i.e. I'm semi-confident-ish that region of the posterior integrates to some small finite value but sadly my math background is v. lacking so idk quite how to formally demonstrate that -- edit, to clarify, through calc 3, diff eq, linear algebra, real analysis, though quite rusty. Understanding of stats/prob theory is very cobbled together lol from different papers, seminars, non-rigorous machine learning/stats application-focused books, etc. Really need to sit down some month with a proper textbook and have at it)? I'm also approximating the joint posterior numerically via mcmc (there's no analytic solution) and the chain never even wanders into that region of parameter space, but even if it's not a practical concern I'm worried it might be a theoretical one, despite brief assurances from a few math/stats PhD friends that it's not. I'll ask them for references when I next see them but figure I could ask here first. Does anyone know of any good papers or book chapters I could read (or cite)?

edit: actually, come to think, this would be an issue in any regression problem with a normal likelihood where the variance is a free parameter, right? Even ones that don't allow measurement error, since you only need one infinite log-likelihood for their sum to be infinite. Although hmmm I guess then all the others would be -inf, so accommodating measurement uncertainty /would/ be necessary? So now I think there has to be a name or paper for this... although come to think would that mean maximum likelihood can't accommodate measurement error for those models?

As that variance goes to zero the univariate normal pdf becomes the Dirac delta, which when all sampled observations are on your mean gives you a likelihood of +inf. The set of all points over which this holds has, I think, measure zero. You can circumvent this by excluding 0 in the prior but you'd still get arbitrarily large likelihoods with the bog-standard normal pdf. I'll try to work out a case where I can exploit conjugacy tomorrow and see if that sheds any light.

My logic behind the specific request was due to the American-centric nature of what I'm writing (the human love interest is American and has a family history as like "civil war heroes" and whatnot), I'd appreciate the perspective of people who have a more first-hand knowledge of the social issues that remain in American society/etc.

Also, it's unlikely that actual victims of slavery would read my novel unless it got to Harry Potter levels of fame, but pretty likely that an African-American would.

I'd like to help, but I'm struggling with self loathing over being a product and enabler of a culture of wealthy straight white men abusing, exploiting, discriminating, and otherwise dehumanizing people so I'm not sure how useful I'd be or how healthy it'd be for me to confront this source of debilitating anxiety in this way.

**** Completely fair, I wouldn't want you to review it if that is your headspace, either!

I didn't really think much about content warnings in my story but I really should have a content warning for "discussion of slavery" or something. The book doesn't have racism, at least I don't think it does and have tried hard to make sure it doesn't, so I suppose I should explicitly say like "no racist content" or something?

Thanks for the subreddit suggestion. I'm not sure what view I want changed though, so I'm struggling to think of a way to post it on the forum without it being "change my view: slavery is awesome". I mean I suppose I could do... "change my view: i should write about slavery in my novel".... still doesn't seem to be what the forum is for though.

***** You could ask them about the appropriateness of the particular portrayal you're putting forth and whatever warnings you put before it. For instance: “I don't need to add a trigger warning for a fiction book that mentions real world slavery” or “it is acceptable to have a viewpoint character with a neutral view on slavery in a fictional story about immortals living in our world”, then add the specific passage below.
