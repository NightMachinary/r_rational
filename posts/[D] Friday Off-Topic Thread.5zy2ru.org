Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Brag: this is the first (UK tax) year where I donated a full 10% of my income, and as such I'm finally taking an official GWWC pledge and should soon show up on [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/][their members page]].

In the end since the end of tax year was approaching and I still wasn't decided on where to donate, I chose to put 5/6 of the total donation budget towards [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/trust][GWWC Trust Fund]] (i.e. basically 'givewell-chosen charities'), and 1/6 towards existential risk ([[https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/][FHI]], because they get gift-aid and so my donations are immediately 20% more valuable).

This actually took quite a bit into my savings - maybe not half of what I saved this year, but probably at least a third. Seems like I wasn't anywhere near my 45% saving goal; I'll have to start watching my spending much more closely.

** Anyone knows examples of works of fiction with complicated yet internally consistent time_travel-based conflicts? I know /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer][Primer]]/ is supposed to be one, though I didn't watch it yet; anything else?

From my experience, time travel in fiction is either:

1. Inconsistent. The time travel mechanic is vague, and used as Deus Ex Machina which can do anything/can't do anything as the plot demands. The story's plot is either /intuitive/ (and therefore easy-to-follow), no matter how meaningless if you stop to think about it, or reduced to non-TT-based conflicts. (Example: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho][Doctor Who]]/.)

2. Underused. The characters who have time-travel devices forget to use them, or use them incompetently. Again, the plot is either reduced to non-TT-based, or intuitive yet meaningless. (Example: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary][Mirai Nikki]]/.)

3. Restricted to reduce complexity. Only one side of the conflict has access to the time machine (example: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MotherOfLearning][Mother of Learning]]/), or the time-travel devices' capabilities are restricted, by the mechanic or by the society (example: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality][HPMOR]]/). Basically, in the end it's /not/ a story about time-travel battles, the time travel isn't central to its main conflict.

The works that can't be fit into the three above categories are very rare, which is understandable: their plot would get ridiculously complicated, hard to both write and follow. Alexander Wales' /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]]/ would be on the /simpler/ side of the spectrum, to give an example.

Which makes it all the more interesting, doesn't it?

*Edit:* Thank you for the recommendations, everyone.

*** It's admittedly been a long time since I watched it (and it's played for laughs, so I can't promise how /consistent/ it might be, but I remember it doing time travel better than most), but /Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure/ is a movie where a duo of hedonists is bootstrapped into completing a closed time loop to uplift humanity into a golden age inspired by their ethics and example, involving multiple precommitment-triggered acausal strategies (including a precommitment fight over which side would defeat the other and set up both sides attacks once they had control of the time machine) and characters realizing that 'wait, we're not good enough at this, but we have a time machine' and going back to train and vacation and party with historical hot babes for a few years in the middle of an important challenge. My favorite part is that these characters are lovable idiots, but it's /still/ really obvious to them (when they take a few seconds to think about it) how useful time travel is.

***** It's not exactly that 'events are fixed' which bothers me, it's more that said events are so human-level. It's not even "X dies in Y circumstance" it's "X dies" and any circumstance which results in X dying is allowed.

Even /that's/ not fundamentally bad, because it could've made sense if they talked about souls and said that a soul is a fundamental thing which time travel does care about, so if a person dies Time makes sure their soul ends up leaving their body even if you go back. But they /didn't/, they just sort of said the death is a 'significant event' somehow and sort of assumed we'd be okay with the fundamental laws of the universe working on macroscopic, human-intuitive rules.

If you had certain, arbitrarily-defined areas of time and space (as in "Within this volume from time A to time B") where things couldn't change even through time travel, that could make sense where Time acts as an agent to cause minute changes to the world such that, in a reverse butterfly effect, events there happen in exactly the same way. Even if you attach it to souls as fundamental objects and have Time say 'yeah, this soul's dying at this time, butt out time-travellers' it could still make sense. You just have to not shove it all off onto 'well a death is a major thing, don't think about it too much'.

  We do not allocate anybody to problems like [identity theft of kids in foster care, food stamp distribution, the immigration process, federal pensions, the VA]... This is just a handful of things that I've been asked to staff in the last week or so and do not have adequate staff to do...

100,000 people [≈ population of Virgin Islands] received an engineering bachelor's degree in the U.S. last year. There are at least 100,000 people, every year, looking for an engineering problem to solve. I have my own plea to all such people ---

Climate change is one of the problems of our time. It's everyone's problem, but it's our responsibility --- as people with the incomparable leverage of being able to work magic through technology.

In this essay, I've tried to sketch out a map of where such magic is needed --- systems for producing, moving, and consuming clean energy; tools for building them; media for understanding what needs to be built. There are opportunities everywhere. Let's get to work.

What do you mean by /progress/? In any case, it's most definitely not /just/ politics. Politics steer people towards certain tasks; you still need boots on the ground skilled with those particular tasks to solve them. You can't, as a single person, change the world. But you can make the world a brighter place for some people (games and other entertainment), or build tools that make other people's work easier (business service/product development), or make personal life easier for some (personal product/services).

*** Do you need to actually get graded? MIT has a few of their probability and stats courses on EdX.

**** Seems like Edx has /way/ more classes than it did a little while ago. I'll have to go through them to see if there's anything that's interesting that I haven't covered already.

*** Not sure which is best for high level, but there are a heck of a lot of classes online these days. I see stats courses at Coursera, Udacity, MIT OpenCourseWare, Stanford Online, and EdX. [[/r/statistics][r/statistics]] or [[/r/askstatistics][r/askstatistics]] may have helpful info.

Also if you have the time and discipline to focus on learning without the carrot/stick of a degree, worth noting that most college professors won't chase you off if you sit in on their classes. [[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/the-man-who-snuck-into-the-ivy-league-without-paying-a-thing/386917/][This guy]] apparently sat in on Ivy League classes regularly. The main advantage of doing that over online courses is that you could make social connections typical to a university experience (and become socially acclimated to the types of people who graduate universities). I imagine the social/networking benefits of "ghosting" at a high end / ivy league university would be higher than at a local community college or state university.

For getting college credit on stuff you've learned, there are various options like CLEP, DANTES/DSST, AP (which is supposed to be high school, but has no actual age restriction), and various other options like portfolio evaluation and challenging the class. One possible way to graduate high end school without paying as much tuition would be to get most of the requirements met at lower-end schools and then transfer the credits to the high end school for the final semester.

** Holy crap, trying to install/run/understand Ogre3d is a pain in the ass. Well, time to switch to Irrlicht or Unity.
