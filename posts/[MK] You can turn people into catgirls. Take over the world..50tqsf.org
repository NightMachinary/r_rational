Your powers are as follows: on direct contact with someone, you can turn them into a catgirl version of themselves. Mass and energy are conserved, entropy stays the same.

Cat-people are treated, from a genetic standpoint, as a perfectly ordinary race of humans, although having the cat ears/tail is autosomal dominant. Children of cat girls may be either male or female.

Becoming a catgirl cures all body/gender dysmorphia issues, although new ones could later develop.

Your goal is nothing short of world domination. You don't need to be an absolute dictator, but you need at least comparable power to the president of the US, except with the entire world.


** Obviously having the power means you're the protagonist in a harem comedy, so you already have more power over the entire world than the president does in the US.

** If I touch myself can I become a cat girl?

Well, at the very least, I have undeniable miraculous powers, and can turn anyone female and adorable. Money wouldn't be an issue since I can charge obscene amounts of cash to help trans people.

But does that let me rule the world? I think this plan needs a phase 2, my best bets are to hire a PR team to leverage Identity politics relating to the newfound catgirl race, while also formulating a cultural religion writing me as the holy meowsiah. I have an edge here over all other social justice movements and religions, since I can legitimately convert people that want perspective on being a catgirl, and /obviously/ actually have holy powers ordained by God.

My goal is to create mounting social pressure until even the world leaders convert. They let me have my own vaticanlike nationstate, and standing army, and they treat my word with religious significance. Pope Style.

Not necessarily. It's a cat girl version of the original; if they were fat before, they're still fat. If they were ugly before they're still ugly. If the had a snaggletooth... etc.

But the more catgirls there are, the greater the comparative advantage in being male. That means the rich and powerful elite are strongly incentivized to not become catgirls, being predominantly male.

**** Ah, certainly there's a comparative genetic advantage to being male. But if most males maintain the intellectual and nurture-based elements of their sexual orientation, then upon catgirlification the majority of them will be lesbians, which actually increases the practical benefits of becoming female. And the genetic benefits of maleness and desire to be a genetic father can be maintained by using a sperm bank.

Also a fat ugly snagletoothed catgirl is still strictly cuter that a fat ugly snagletoothed not-catgirl. So I stick to at least a looser version of my original claim.

****** Most of those are already female though. Ah I see your point. More men converted into catgirls means less competition for the original set of straight females, this is true.

That said, if men becoming catgirls is to the benefit of powerful men that want to stay men, then they still have all the more reason to support my system. And I only really need them to convert religiously, or at least give lipservice to having converted religiously. My political power is the end goal here, their beliefs don't necessarily matter too much. And It isn't a big deal if they don't convert physically.

What might become an issue is backlash from firmly straight women that dislike the idea of their prospects shrinking.

But on second thought this all assumes I'm significantly altering the world's M/F balance in the first place.

My core plan doesn't really require that. In fact identity politics might work better as long as we remain a minority group.

As a side note, now that I think about it. At it's most efficient, I could probably only convert at around 2/second, 12 hours a dayish, so what, 30 million a year? Probably way less if I want any security, and any time to recover. So even after 10 years I wouldn't have really changed things by more than 4%.

Unless of course I could munchkin the definition of "Touch" with skin grafts or something.

I begin peaceful, setting up commie/amish like societys to establish a base of operations; focusing heavily on "free love" in the form of prostitution and a thriving for-pay porn scene(real catgirls are still rare at this point)

however a few years of this I shift tactics drastically, I start hiring highly trained mercenarys with the gift of a new identity and cat girl orgys they should come relatively cheap, my cults should have grown into a fairly large religion(given the fact there is a new source of magic in the world and believers may indeed have easier access to sex)

** The first question here is how one might try to take over the world. There's the obvious 'legions of soldiers overthrowing the government and spreading across the world like a plague' actual /conquering/, but just as valid is diplomatically bringing all of the governments under my influence.

The first thing I would want to do, I think, is form a devoted core of catgirls most loyal to me. People with severe gender identity issues or other people who have nothing to lose whose problems I can fix by turning them into catgirls. Since this is a rather small group, I'd take each one and explain my goals, at least my short term ones, before getting them to agree to help me.

Thus I become king of the catgirls. The small core group I build affirm my authority to rule the species, and I seek to make headlines and spark discussion on the topic, maneuvering to an end result of accepting my sovereignty. If I'm lucky, I might get a reserve or something given to me and the catgirls, but I'd be willing to accept having no clay of my own if the wold at large still recognizes me as king of the catgirls.

During this whole episode, there will likely be an amount of people seeking to turn into catgirls, meaning my ranks will grow swiftly. I'll want to set up some girls in specific roles to ensure the functioning of my country. Depending on my country's level of autonomy I might need to figure out imports and exports and police and the like, so I'd need to recruit the help of economists, lawyers, politicians, and other specialists. If I'm in such a situation, I'd also likely be in a position to collect taxes to support all of that. If I don't have that kind of autonomy, I'd thankfully need much fewer things set up, but still things like passports or identification.

So how do I go from 'subject state' (effectively what I would be no matter the autonomy) to 'world leader'? Definitely war is out. I'm not a strong country, I don't have nukes, and I live by the mercy of the actual government. So I need to gain influence.

I'm thinking what I would do is look at a country with few diplomatic ties who is struggling (something like Venezuela comes to mind, but I'd need to do more research), and start focusing operations there. All voluntary, I freely offer to turn people of the target country into catgirls (and thus also citizens of my country) in exchange for loyalty. Next up, I try to get into power. Again, varies greatly by country, but if I can get the loyalty of a politician there I could orchestrate the country into having a catgirl in charge. From there, I think I could manage accumulating influence over the country's government as king of the catgirls until such point where I can assume direct control without too much fuss. If my governmental policies are better for the country's people, they might even thank me.

Once I have an entire country under by control, and not just some reserve somewhere (if that), it's time to bunker down and gain influence in other poor countries. I'd want to devise a system to maximize catgirl conversion rate while also keeping myself safe from risk of assassination, and with legions of catgirl followers I could worm my way into power of many third world countries. If I'm lucky, I could even get people to see it as humanitarian, bringing western values and economy to these struggling countries. It would not be easy by any means, especially with the rampant corruption I'd have to handle, but with dedicated experts on my side I think I can keep things together, especially if I have direct authority as king of the catgirls.

Once I've established a strong global empire across places like South America and Africa, I'd turn to the wealthier countries. Wash, rinse, repeat, and I have precedent for this method so as long as I make sure to avoid outright condemnation by the more powerful countries. With luck, I could bring the entire world under my influence within my lifetime.

** Start by auctioning your talent through hospitals and medical clinics. People who are dying of something incurable now have another option to live. Not everyone will take it, but some will. Rich old people who don't care about society's response will take it just for being able to wipe away a lifetime's accumulation of disease and damage. Being an old /yet perfectly healthy/ catgirl may well have an appeal.

Given that you are the only source of this lifesaving ability, you can charge pretty much someone's entire fortune to save/extend their life. For those who are or were politically connected, you can charge favors. You now have money and a degree of influence.

Make the changes to the rich and powerful while they don't know you're there or how you did it. Have them stand a long way in front of a laser scanner or something, then stay at a clinic for 24 hours. Initiate direct contact while they sleep, or via a handshake while pretending to be a receptionist or assistant. They go away not knowing how you did it, and not associating any complex procedure with the conversion. Let them talk about it with other people. Let the intelligence community believe that the process can be initiated without the person's consent and ideally at a distance.

Find people in positions of power who have built up cults of personality or connected their career to their looks. Televangelists, politicians, businesspeople, Hollywood actors. Have someone contact them, claiming to have stolen your catgirl technology, and threaten to turn them into catgirls if they don't do what you say. Again, more money and influence.

I would note here that quite possibly a large proportion of current politicians on all sides would not want to be suddenly turned into a catgirl at the worst possible moment. Even better, it's quite possible that various people in their retinue, family, or circles /would/ but haven't told them for fear of retribution, so having those people suddenly become catgirls would induce fear and anger in the primary target. If the people who got transformed (and wanted to be) start expressing joy at the change, you can further threaten the primary target by mentioning that the change affects people's minds, too.

Against a threat to personal power which apparently can't be defended against in any way, and with a lot of old, rich, connected people having voluntarily undergone transformation and thus not putting up with any attempt to demonize the process or result (and simultaneously culturally connecting the process with being rich and somewhat selfish), quite a lot of politicians might be able to be coerced, giving you extensive behind-the-scenes power.
