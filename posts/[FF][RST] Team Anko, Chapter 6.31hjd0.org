** That last author's note makes an interesting point--I don't think I ever noticed the oddness of the phrase "forehead-protector" until you pointed it out.

So I guess you could maybe use "headband", if it bothers you that much.

*** I'll just stick with the Japanese. It's more true to the source material.

** This chapter was good. Nice portrayel of how...problematic, we'll say, Hinata's mental state is, as well as how her team-mates are concerned over her. And how she keeps mis-interpreting said concern as embarrassment, disappointment or coddling. Sadly, to the point of personal injury and collapse.

The little bits of lore sprinkled in were nice as well - the reference of a specific jumping style for tree-branch travel, along with how genjutsu can still effect folk with magic eye Bloodline such as the Byakugan or Sharingan. Finally, the mention of some sort of 'is this all a dream' belief which has formed from Genjutsu use, which I believe actually has some analogue in this reality...

Oh, and the surprise Orochimaru attack. That wasn't expected at all.

EDIT: Also, how do I get the emails when you update on your website again? I think it involved registering the forum you post the story in manually, but I couldn't figure it out when I tried. I'm vaguely concerned I'll miss updates when you stop updating the FF.net version.

*** You need to be registered for the site. Once you are, go to the bottom of the page in the forum and you'll see a giant link saying "SUBSCRIBE FORUM". The default version of phpBB has it as a tiny little thing that's easy to miss, but I jacked it up into high visibility.

** It feels like there's a chunk missing between chapters. Chapter 5 ended in town, after gathering equipment, and there should've still been another day in town before anything else happened. It's jarring to find the group suddenly getting ambushed in a forest. Sure, some of that was the intentional "this is Genjutsu" thing, but since they seem to have actually left, to continue on with their mission, it'd help to have some kind of transition explaining that. Possibly in Chapter 5 itself, which I understand was cut short when it was originally posted.

Also, typo:

#+begin_quote
  "ATTACK!" she yelled, surging to her feet and sending /foot/ spilling everywhere.
#+end_quote

*** It's genjutsu. It could feel totally plausible to spill your feet everywhere.

I don't think it likely that you can simulate anyone fighting that well in genjutsu. That would be the ultimate training technique probably, especially against Orochimaru, whom she knows well.

*** Because the guy who was renting my apartment moved out, meaning that instead of having a comfortably positive income I now have a significantly negative one. Ergo, I need to ramp up the various money-making activities I'm working on.

On that subject, would you use the following:

A site that does raffles as a complement to Kickstarter. A creator uses KS to fund their product, then periodically runs a raffle afterwards for prizes like "early access to next chapter" or "cameo in next chapter".

A friend and I have been talking about building this and we're trying to get market validation.

**** The thing you're looking for is called Patreon. Its monthly pay what you want version of Kickstarter. I haven't read exact details on their policies, so I could be wrong about all of this.

*** Yeah, I've been lazy/forgetful about updating the ToC because the forum is, you know, /right there/ and it's going to be a while before there's enough threads to roll to a second page. And even when they do, you can just hit 'Last Page' to get to thread #1. I might just end up deleting the ToC because it's pretty redundant.
