** I like it! The incredulity, empirical inquiry, and quick propagation of new beliefs to change the entire mental map remind me more of the HPMOR opener than any other rationalist fanfic I've seen. Keep them updates coming!

** One small error: Little Tony says they were robbing a bank, but then Lex says that they were in a jewelry store.

*** Thanks - originally had it as a bank robbery and changed it later, but forgot to remove that reference. Pointing out typos and errors is always appreciated.
