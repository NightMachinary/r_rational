I stumbled upon Greg Egan's "Orthogonal" series some time ago and I must say I was absolutely stunned that something so specifically tailored to my tastes even existed. I don't even know how it feels to read that if you're not into physics (I have a PhD and still had to do multiple takes on some of the most convoluted passages) but /damn/, the entire fictional science system he developed is so good. I read "Zendegi" afterwards, which is a very interesting and realistic take on a possible road from machine learning to mind uploading - I could at any point believe this would actually be somewhat feasible in 20 or 30 years from now. I would like to read something else from him I guess, but as it often happens with writers I love, I also tend to sort of avoid binging all of them because I don't want it to be over so quick and then having to wait for their next published book!

Any suggestions about him? What are your favourite works of his?


** His best books for me are /Schild's Ladder/ and /Diaspora/. The first chapter of /Diaspora/ was originally published as a short story and is available online as [[http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html]["Orphanogenesis"]].

I would be careful about /Distress/, the first chapter was really disturbing and it doesn't lighten up all that much. It's really good, just, pushes boundaries about personhood and bodily integrity. And of course has an underpinning of weird physics, like always...

/Quarantine/ - there's like three or four stories in this one, all entangled together. The primary arc really plays wicked games with the Copenhagen Interpretation, taking it way literally.

[[http://www.gregegan.net/INCANDESCENCE/00/Crocodile.html]["Riding the Crocodile"]] and /Incandescence/ take us to a galaxy that's as far beyond the world of /Schild's Ladder/ as they are beyond us, but where people are still people no matter how much of what defines us has become optional.

[[https://archive.org/stream/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07_djvu.txt]["Dust"]] and /Permutation City/ combine strange physics and strange computational neurology in odd ways. A large part of the story involves an experiment that Egan later decided was horribly unethical, and he returns to it with a whole different viewpoint in [[http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/]["Crystal Nights"]].

Still, design isn't just about being pretty, it's also about readability, which is a practical need. As you mentioned, some colour schemes are horrible. Ditch the animated cubes in primary colours please. The font could be picked better, and there could just be more free space here and there. Just by organising the page better, giving the text a bit more breathing space, and picking a better colour scheme (all doable with very basic CSS), I think it'd improve by leaps and bounds.

Dunno, I understand why when looking /under/ the hood a lot of this stuff can be horrifying - personally every time I try to get into the more modern trends in web development I feel like screaming considering how much shit people pile on top of each other (often writing pseudo-code that then gets compiled three or four times before becoming the final JS, complete madness). But with stuff like simple sites and blogs, default templates provided by things like WordPress are /the one/ thing I really appreciate. Spaced text, good font choices, sensible colour schemes. I mean, even something like Reddit is very simplistic in look but also very clear and readable. That site to me isn't very much.

Of course it's a matter of taste, still, I think one can conjugate simplicity and looks without falling into the trap of "just another library!" that web developers often seem victim of.

I've designed my girlfriend's professional site and keep track of it with Google Analytics, and I can tell you, /a lot/ of people visits it by smartphone. Many more than do by PC. The audience here may be different of course, but I don't think mobile readability is a bad thing. Of course I'm not saying to use Bootstrap or some other sophisticated framework, if you keep the content simple (just text and images, basically) you can do that with pure CSS these days. In fact most sites will simply work well in mobile anyway if you don't go wild with content and formatting.

You can make a much better looking site with absolutely zero JS. Only HTML+CSS. JS is unnecessary altogether if you don't want any interactivity or some fancy resizing options.

I was talking about template, font and colour schemes, mostly. I'm not saying a good site needs to push cookies or have some super-hi-res hero banner that takes 5 seconds to load or some WebGL effect constantly playing while you visit it. That'll go down in history as the most annoying aspect of 2010s web design, like MIDI tunes that play automatically are for 1990s one.

Truly. I went into Poul Anderson's "Tau Zero" hearing from everyone how it was hard sci-fi and stuff, then rolled my eyes multiple times at the blatant nonsense that happens in that book (despite it being often entertaining nonsense).\\
Then I went into Egan's works and I realised if I wanted to pick anything he said apart I needed to sit down with a few textbooks, a computer and a stack of paper.

** Quarantine and Permutation City. His later works kinda went anti-emotional and/or ran out of truly relevant interesting premises. Quarantine has no anti-humanism/hope/light, Permutation City has some but a powerful enough premise to make up for it and become one of the great peaks of SF, and then it starts heading downhill. "Could not cast a Patronus" summarizes a lot of the issue. Similar progression to Iain Banks; if you can still like /Excession/ you'll like late Egan too.

I don't like Orthogonal though, because it has too much physics with too thin characters, at least for a non-physicist reader, and its alien social narrative is profoundly unimaginative: aliens progress towards human 20th century liberalism. Along with Egan's rejection of superhuman intelligence this is too parochial for my tastes.

** Personally, I must disagree with the sentiments people are expressing. So far I find Egan's books to be... hollow. Lacking a soul. I've only read Permutation City and Diaspora, and although they were great bingeable hard sci-fi, the characters were morally empty. Where's the virtue? Where's the eudaimonia? Where's the humanism? Instead, everything is reduced to a checklist of meaningless hedonic experiences. Even the characters find the world soul-crushing: there is a disturbing trend of characters copying themselves and the copies committing suicide (this happens in /both/ Permutation City and Diaspora!).

Reading Egan books is both extremely fun and extremely draining. I'm drawn in by the hard sci-fi, but afterward I'm mildly depressed and need a drink.

*** I haven't read either of those. What I can say about the two (well, four, as Orthogonal is a trilogy) I /have/ read:

- in Zendegi, the story is very human, but it does indeed feature a situation similar to what you describe, of a character being sort-of copied and that ending not too well. He's not a great writer of characters, mind you - a lot of feelings are conveyed in really unsubtle manner. Still, I found the topic of that book - a man coping with the death of his wife and his own impending demise, and the wish to leave a trace of himself through his son - to be extremely human.

- Orthogonal features absolutely non-human characters, but is also the one that perhaps gave me the strongest emotions, mostly towards the women, who in this world undergo the horrifying fate of being able to reproduce only by dying (as they basically undergo mitosis). Again, the individual characters are perhaps relatively simple, but the overall portrayal of the emotions and social consequences of this mechanic is very vivid and believable.

I think in general Egan is a writer that shines when talking about science and society, and less about individuals. I think that's fine, not everyone can be talented at everything, and in fact I'd say that's a common thing among sci-fi authors. In fact at least his social analysis tends to be much more deep and thought out than what some others do. His characters are, mostly, means to an end - the end being advancing a plot that communicates its themes through collective, rather than individual, action. But he's surely no poet, yeah. His prose too is rather dry and, in itself, unremarkable.

*** If you want to be really depressed, try /Distress/.

In Permutation City, Paul Durham's copy tried to commit suicide but failed, and he had a good reason for trying... and Peer's original is the one who shut itself down after he learned that Kate left him. Thomas Reimann rewrote himself and his whole universe by rerunning his defining moment over and over again until he made the "right" decision... that can be seen as somewhat self-centered but on the other hand he did save his lover's life in the end.

Orlando was a one of a kind five-dimensional version of himself, there were never going to be any more 5d people, so he'd be alone forever. He could have made a snail-bot version of himself to go into the 5d world with, but he'd already done that, and didn't feel that was enough himself to saddle with a few more hours of 5d-humanoid versions of himself.

And it's really less than suicide when there's lots of other versions of you that you're within a few days or months of in memories, it'e more like losing some short-term memory than dying.

I've tried something else by Greg, don't remember what it was, but I just couldn't keep reading because of the level of abstraction and the density of the ideas. I usually skip a lot of filler in the books I read, and with Egan's books you can't do that, or you don't know what half the words even mean.

It's like the modern problem with companies not hiring women for fear they'll get pregnant and thus cost them money for maternity, except multiplied times 1000. There is a fundamental biological inequality and injustice that exists because Nature doesn't give a fuck, and the obvious way society deals with that is by rolling with it and trying to maximise efficiency instead of individual happiness. It's not weird they'd come to those conclusions. In fact the very assignment of who counts as a "woman" and who as a "man" in their species is completely arbitrary and basically done, for our convenience as human readers, to map with the social roles we experience every day. In the amoeba people, the "men" are for example traditionally the caregivers for the children.
