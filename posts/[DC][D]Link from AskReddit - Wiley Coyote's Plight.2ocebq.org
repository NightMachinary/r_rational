** I wouldn't mind reading a story about Wiley working incredibly hard to exploit the physics of Looney Tunes somehow in order to secure his dinner. Also available for discussion: the ethics of eating fully sentient beings when you're a carnivore, metastuff about how he's clearly a fictional character being tormented by dark Gods for their own amusement.

*** Is roadrunner sentient? He seems very animal for a cartoon.
