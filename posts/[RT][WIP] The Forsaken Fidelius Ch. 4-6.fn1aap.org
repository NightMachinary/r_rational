In which Peter faces the consequences of his actions.


** It's pretty well-written, but so far it seems to be an alternative explanation/version of canon events instead of an actual divergence, which... isn't really my cup of tea. To me, it makes the story feel pointless.

Still, that's a matter of personal preference - objectively speaking, it's well-written and makes sense, so I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't feel the same way I feel about this style of story.

** Oh that is clever, if he really wasn't trying to be a traitor it explains why he's at the weasleys as well. I really like this, might be my new headcanon. Gives peter some depth he never really had in canon.
