** Not sure I'd consider this rational, but I followed it as it was being written and enjoyed it. People on this sub might also enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9408516/1/Hit-The-Ground-Running][Hit the Ground Running]], by the same author.

** tl;dr: Ginny gives the Diary Horcrux to Hermione instead of trying to throw it away. Hermione does her best to penetrate the Diary's mysteries. 27k words, complete.

I was thinking that this story was at least a /little/ rational(ist). Hermione does a /lot/ of research in the library in order to check what the diary tells her, and she consistently engages in intellectual discussion with it--including some stuff on the classification of spells as "dark". She also explicitly calls out the Hogwarts staff and the Ministry for incompetence.

So, another fan mouthpiece, then.

**** Well, that's the whole point of fanfiction in the first place. Some are longer than others, and so have the space to develop their fundamental points; it's just that this one is only 27Kwords.

Haven't read it yet; will have to see if it uses those 27K well enough.

***** True, but, er, calling the ministry out on its incompetence is kinda done-to-death at this point. Still no less true, but there it is.

(I'll give the fic itself a whirl later. Thanks for posting!)

Agreed.

Note that as nerdguy1138 said, you can't really even /use/ the Ministry in a story without calling out its incompetence. That would be like using Superman without pointing out that he wears his underwear on the outside. The subject will /always/ come up because it's /right in your face I mean come on what is that I don't even/.

Also, sometime I feel like binge-reading Ministry-bashing. It's like Kuno-bashing; sure the horse has been dead for two decades, but it just feels SO good.
