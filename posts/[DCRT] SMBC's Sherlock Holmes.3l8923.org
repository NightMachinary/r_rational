***** Doyle was a pretty sharp tack, by all accounts. I'd be willing to bet if we were able to ask him "You know Sherlock's deductions are mostly bullshit, yeah?", he'd respond something along the lines of "Where the hell am I? What year is it? Give me that glowing device you're carrying, I'd like to inspect it. And yes, of course the stories are over the top. They're stories."

***** Doyle was a physician who modeled Sherlock on one of his mentors. However, he wanted to stop writing stories about him and killed off his character in the Reichenbach fall. The general public were so upset about this that they bugged him for years afterward and he gave up and wrote more stories with the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

****** That one doesn't fall particularly far from the tree, though. Holmes/Watson become House/Wilson and the detective is a drugged-up sociopath sick of life but fascinated by mysteries. The formula branched after a few seasons, but House isn't CSI: Princeton-Plainsborough. It's the medical adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

#+begin_quote
  To date, Sherlock Holmes has sent 439 innocent men to the gallows.
#+end_quote

As a detective, Holmes wouldn't have had the power to send anyone to the gallows.

Responsibility lies with the courts (judges/juries?) who accepted his broken evidence.
