Well, at the cost of sleep and sanity (but are those things really necessary? Really? I don't think so, and the toaster agrees with me) I managed to get this concluding half-chapter of Ascension's 52nd chapter up before the week went nuts on me. This battle will set the course for events in Galhemna. Victory is within both sides' grasp, but the jaws of defeat are wide, and very hungry. If the Compact succeeds, then everything Jirrico, Adrianna, Red and Echo have hoped for will come crashing down. All those lives, all those resources, all those ships and all that time... lost, and for nothing. Only slowing down the juggernaut, and weakening themselves proportionally more than it. If they succeed, then there are only a comparative handful of defenders left... it might be enough to stop the invaders from torching every shipyard and factory... or it might not.

But before all that... first, they have survive.
