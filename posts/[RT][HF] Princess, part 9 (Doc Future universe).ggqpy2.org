** Chapter done, finally. Lots of physics drama, and the true reason why Flicker's first trip to the Moon turned out the way it did. Some foreshadowing for Fall and a few puzzles as well. Probably another 2 chapters to finish up Princess, no I'm not good at keeping stories from expanding, why do you ask? Thanks to all my readers for being patient through a period of slow writing. Enjoy. 8-)

*** Nice to see this again. Flicker is one of the things I always look forward to seeing on this sub.

**** Thank you! I spent a lot of time fiddling with physics stuff that only ended up affecting a few words in the chapter--like the fact that Flicker need to run in a great circle in a plane that intersected the Earth, because she was moving so fast in a circle while ionized that she turned the Moon into a giant electromagnet. 8-)

***** I think it might have been a little too much on the physics front. In some places it read more like a word problem than a story, and the part about the probability manipulator felt tacked on and under-explained. I enjoyed the potential there and I know that you were constrained by the fact that this is a prequel, but a little more development would have been good.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the chapter and I'm delighted to see you're still working on it. It simply didn't measure up to the awesomeness that was Flicker taking that interdimensional trickster to prison.

****** One of the problems with a serial is pacing the chapter breaks--to the Moon and back ended up about 6k, and the only good end spot for quite a while longer was where I put it. There will be a lot of what was up with the attack, the post-mortem, and what Flicker does while convalescing in the next chapter. There will be a few surprises 8-)

** Now I need to review what variations in plank's constant might do, and that one SCP that could do it. I kind of want to see flicker try it but the monkey side of my brain also has a whispering whimpering fear my intellect labels as "could that cause a false vacuum propagating at c?"

  Each of SCP-536's dials alters the value of one of the fundamental physical constants within the chamber. The dials control, respectively, the speed of light 'c', the gravitational constant 'G', Planck's constant 'h', the fundamental charge 'e', and two other constants represented by the Greek letters lambda and theta (/Memo: After testing, Foundation researchers have concluded that these two constants represent the coupling constants for the weak and strong interactions, respectively. See testing logs SCP-536-‚ñà‚ñà and ‚ñà‚ñà/). All constants are measured on their respective dials in modern SI units, with the exception of the dimensionless lambda and theta.

*** Doc believes the vacuum in our universe to be stable, otherwise he'd probably have ended the world when he was 18. He /could/ be wrong. But here are some other interesting things to think about: The assumptions that go into error messages--like old programs that ask to 'insert CD' on a computer that doesn't have one. The error messages from Flicker's 'Untranslated01' are implicitly making at least one wrong assumption: That the number of macroscopic spacetime dimensions that she lives in and the number that are important for local physics are the same, and they aren't 8-)

** Always happy to see you update :)

So, let me see if I get this right. Flicker starts speedtest at time 0, and speedtest ends at time 1, which is how far away the earth is from the moon. Due to timey wimey, you only get one chance to affect the outcome, because by the time light finishes a round trip speedtest is over. The options available to the seer are either blindly interfere in speedtest, so that you have a say in what the outcome is, or choose from the natural deck of speedtest outcomes. The wanderer, obviously chooses to try and fuck with Flicker, and it works better than she planned because she hit natural limits and it messed with her timing (and also because she was more confident over her control than she had a right to be). Which, I mean, considering she survived dumping ~300000 kg of mass energy is still saying something. If I'm working my intuitions right.

After looking at the orders of magnitude energy wikipedia page, 10^{21-23} joules is right in line with geological events like earthquakes and volcanos, so that provides a good meterstick for how surprisingly effective lithobraking would really be.

*** Thanks! And pretty close. Speedtest starts at time X, and finishes after time X+1 but before X+2, and may or may not be the 'risky' version. The attacker already knows what happens if they don't interfere: Flicker gets back, exact details unclear. Same if they show up before X-1 or Flicker doesn't choose risky. They know she might--it's possible, because it's what she wants to do. But it's not causally connected to the worldline where the attacker shows up at X until X+1, which is too late to change. And the attacker already needs to use prediction to find X, won't have time to make another one after they show up, and cannot see the conditional future given 'predict X, show up on Earth at X, and attack' if they actually want to do it, because Flicker turned it into a Schr√∂dinger's cat problem by relying on plasma noise to decide whether to choose risky. There are some other nuances, but they are spoilers for the next chapter 8-)

** Glad to see this up! I love this story and setting.

I do have a slight quibble with one point though:

While length contraction will make the moon /act/ like a pancake, delay from lightspeed measurements (which include Flicker's gravitational sense, right?) will have it still /look like/ a sphere (i.e, still cover a disc, though not a uniform density, anymore, IIRC, nor the right distances). There used to be a few animations of this sort of thing on the web, and 3+1-d raytracers out there that would allow you to simulate this sort of thing, but I can't seem to find them at the moment.

EDIT: Ah, I found one. [[https://www.spacetimetravel.org/fussball/fussball.html]]

*** Glad you like it, and thanks for the link. Flicker's ability to see using spacetime curvature is not limited to the speed of light because it already exists in the space she is running through--she doesn't have to wait for it to propagate like she would with light bouncing off objects. Her sense is only subject to lightspeed delays from changes--but the Moon isn't moving or spinning significantly compared to Flicker. It /is/ getting more massive in her frame as she accelerates, but that is proportional to change in gamma rather than gamma, so is relatively small and shouldn't change the shape, just the 'brightness'. That said, I did give up trying to estimate some higher order effects, and it's been decades since my last grad school discussion with a General Relativist. I do remember a ray tracer/simulator that showed how a teapot would look as you zoomed by, but that was years ago, and I was unable to locate it again.

Edit: That 'seeing existing curvature using GR' is one of the main reasons it works better when Flicker is moving, because otherwise she has no direct way to distinguish between curvature caused by a close small mass and a far away large mass other than the tiny bit of parallax from her body. When she moves, they change at different rates. It works similarly to how someone might tilt their head back and forth to try to get a better estimate of the distance of an object partially obscured by tree branches.

** Wait. Why was this her first trip to the Moon? The various warning messages should have clued them in to the fact that she'd get a bunch of weird data just by going to the Moon and back, so why didn't they separate it into two trips?

The first trip would be "jump, circuit the Moon slowly while checking the alarms, jump back" and the second being Speedtest proper.

*** Tradeoffs. She was not expecting the volume of warning messages--but she was expecting (correctly) psychological trauma associated with the journey in space, which went away when she got to the Moon. So she decided to gather as much data as she could--she picked the 'maximum data return' option for what was intended to be the first trip of 2. As per Fall, she had originally planned to go back for Speedtest 2, but Doc advised against it.

Despite everything, the frightening part of Speedtest for Flicker was the time in transit, far from mass.
