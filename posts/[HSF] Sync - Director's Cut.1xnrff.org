** Made by the excellent Corridor Digital, it's a film about "The dawn of the singularity, hyper-intelligent AI, and how good you can get at a gunfight if you have infinite respawns" and it's worth a watch. The portrayal of said AI might not /quite/ be up to HPMOR/LessWrong standards, but this is still a solid piece of low budget, high quality indie filmmaking.
