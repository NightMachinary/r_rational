Exactly what it states on the tin.

I've been working on a worldbuilding project on my own - partially inspired by Watchmen, Worm, and other stuff. And I feel like I've hit a brick wall because I realise that I'm not actually sure how to justify my characters having superpowers.

I've got two groups of characters so far, one group having more munchkin-y superpowers, and those more similar to traditional comic-book superheroes. And I realise that I've no good ideas on how to justify them.

So far, my idea is to have some sort of ... I don't know, a bleed of sorts in between worlds, which happens to be semi-sentient and is attracted to minds. So its found itself attracted to human minds, and has patterned itself off us, and has connected to us somehow based on cultural archetypes of heroes and whatnot. Except I'm not sure if this is a good solution.

Thoughts?


** Superpowers can come from magic, or it can come from technology so advanced it might as well be magic. I don't think the actual source really matters (unless that source ends up being part of the plot like Worm) as long as the application is consistent.

To use Worm again as an example, Taylor didn't just receive powers because she was the main character. Because triggers required immense trauma to occur, characters in worm always had their powers tied up to their histories and personalities, which made it easy to justify actions and world building.

If you don't want to tie powers to direct character details, another good example is Super Minion, another popular superhero story. Super Minion demonstrates how super powers can be intrinsically entwined with world building. Powers are caused by an event called Odd Summer, in which any living organism can become empowered at random. Because of this, humanity has had to retreat to a few megacities, as super animals roam the wild, and are under constant threat from super viruses and super bacteria. Though it doesn't do well at explaining why super villain groups are just allowed to exist, it's a good example of how super powers can go beyond just being a character trait.

** I like James Nicolls old idea:

Super powers can be learned. The techniques were once the province of secret cults, sacred monasteries and so forth, but post enlightenment, and the printing press, all the paths got leaked into the public domain good and hard, and in the modern era, every power anyone ever mastered has its training path laid out in excruciating detail on the internet.

However.. every power you want to learn is a major, major effort. We are talking a "A bachelor degree" in terms of hours put in per power. And how good the version of the power you get is, is also rather like that bachelor degree. Put in superlative effort, and cut no corners, and you can learn to fly so fast that the limit is not killing yourself with wind-chill right through your biking leathers (No required secondary powers. Sorry, those have to be trained separately), half-ass it, and you can fly around at like, 80 kilometres per hour.

Some powers are, of course, straight up a professional qualification. If the local law pays well enough, the cops have between one and three powers, a degree in medicine is half learning some useful technique, ect. But anyone can learn, and some powers are just out right popular. Particularly flight.

*** Sounds like how wizards are /supposed/ to do it in just about everything. Though it usually ends up just as a bit of fluff instead of showing in the story/game as it's more interesting to throw fireballs around.

** I wouldn't justify them in any depth.

Consider, for comparison, the question of "why is inertial-mass always proportional to gravitational-mass?" as it exists in our world.

What happened was that, decades before we were born, some extremely smart scientists worked on the problem. They pushed the explanation back a few steps ("well, things are made of protons, neutrons and electrons, and those have the following properties...")

Then, after a few generations of science, all the easy stuff was solved. There are some difficult-to-test potential explanations, but work moves slowly. And eventually there's some stable mental model that non-scientists use.

If you lived in the Worm universe, something similar would happen with your understanding of powers.

Some of the easy stuff would be known ("powers come from this brain structure!") and past that, people would know a vague 'guess the teachers password' style explanation for how the brain structure works.

But none of your characters are going to be casually pushing the limits of human knowledge, for much the same reason that they're not solving my question about mass.

So, your onscreen discussion might happen, but it would reach a stopping point once the functional questions are answered

*** I think I kinda understand where you're coming from. I just think that it doesn't feel very 'rational' or sufficiently analyzed enough, or original. Well, then, I'd have to write it first (which may well be the hardest part).

**** If we're being honest about it, superhero powers are not rational, period. Anything we construct is not an analysis at all, it's an arbitrary justification for our fantasies. If you want a rational magic system, decide on some modification to physics, do the math to determine what effects this will have, and conclude that the result will not be a world full of superpowers. You could create something like Worm did, but it's honestly not necessary for a satisfying system at all.

I'm sure you've found magic systems that are fun and interesting that don't explain everything. If you want to make your magic /feel/ rational, then don't even bother explaining the troublesome parts of it. People, by and large, HATED when star wars introduced midiclorians as the explanation for the force because

- It brought the problem to attention of viewers
- few people cared about how the force worked, and the explanation using midiclorians did nothing to alleviate their concerns.

They were fine when they said nothing.

Instead, start with something useful that is assumed true, and make everything past that rational. eg. "sometimes people awaken a power, many causes are speculated, but no consensus exists", Then make sure your powers all follow some interesting and unique rules, and it'll feel satisfying.

For example, you could say that it's been this way for the last dozen or so millennia (or perhaps all of time), and show how that shaped the course of history. Put enough effort into building up a world that is integrated with your magic, and less focus will drift to the mysterious cause of magical powers.

YMMV, but actually not so for me. Hmm. Regarding the midi-chlorians example - well, I watched TPM first, and honestly, it never stood out to me, and I was surprised when I heard that it was very very controversial.

Oh well. Thanks! I'll have to go back to the drawing board then.

****** Thinking about it more, there are some ideas that you might like.

At least one way to make a fully hard magic system is to set everything in virtual reality. It may be a disatisfying answer, but work on it enough and you could make it interesting. Eg. There's this russian vr novel where under certain circumstances ppl get stuck in the game they're playing. Many people who are close to dying decide they would actually prefer getting stuck in a game where they won't die from old age. MC does the same.

I had this idea with sounds a bit like yours: there are spirits which grow by collecting xp from their surroundings, and from the corpses of other spirits. Due to their competition, they find an effective strategy is to symbiotically attach to another creature. The spirit can offer its abilities to the creature and when the creature comes across another spirit (or a creature with a spirit) then it can hunt them to feed the symbiotic spirit xp. This is nice because it means that the humans or animals in the setting can be baseline normal, and it's only the spirits that contain all the magical elements. It also answers why humans would have access to magic. Unfortunately though, this just pushes the question of how magic works back another step.

Dungeon Engineer by hoophy does a cool thing to generalise magic usage. Runic inscriptions are used to cast magic, and the mc finds out that animals have 'learnt' how to use magic by evolving to create molecules in the shape of the runes. Which just makes perfect sense in every way. I think it's implied that the runic patterns are baked into the definitions of the world.

Hmm. I've actually been thinking of extending it the other way. I did a little reading about idealism in philosophy, and I was thinking of some sort of Universal Mind or Super-Mind leaking into the multiverse. Which actually is great in justifying 'weird' dimensions - how else do you justify Jack Kirby-eque dimensions with physics?

**** Of course. Beyond that, though, is the source going to turn out to be part of the plot, or will that never be addressed? If it's the former, it may need certain additional aspects in order to be interacted with by characters in ways other than granting powers. If it's the latter, it can be very nearly anything as long as it doesn't change.

That is Worm.

Why not make them dark matter or string theory extradimensional robots built by ancients which activated by DNA password. Which some humans accidentally got by viral transduction.

You could always make it on purpose. What if a group was kidnapping people and doing something to their brains and dumping them to watch the results? Maybe one of your groups is getting a chip, and the other is getting a gene spliced chunk of brain?

Side note, I was looking through Unsong recently and was thinking about placebomantic magic, and I suppose it could work in here - just convince the worldwide Genius Loci that it works, and then it does.
