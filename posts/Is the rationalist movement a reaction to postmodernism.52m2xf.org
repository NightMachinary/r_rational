I'm currently taking an English literature class, and they make it sound like every literary/cultural/philosophical movement/era/paradigm shift they talk about came about as a reaction to the previous one. I'm kind of skeptical of this, it sounds too cookie-cutter to me. I mean, it does seem to go in a bit of a vague back-and-forth between emotional/system 1 or unrealistic/unpragmatic ideology and logical/system 2 or realistic or pragmatic ideology, but not in any particular pattern as far as I can tell. Like, you could probably chart such eras by whether they were largely steps towards sane epistemology/ideology or away from it. Middle Ages-, Renaissance+, Enlightenment+,Romanticism-, Transcendentalism-, Victorianism-, Naturalism+, Realism+ Existentialism-, Modernism+, Postmodernism-, Rationality+--at least as far as I can tell. Is this directly tied to the rate of technological advancement? But the Victorian era had a lot of tech advancement too didn't it? I vaguely remember that the industrial revolution began around that time...

Thoughts?

** I don't /think/ so.

I think it would be an easier argument to claim that it's a reaction to 1960-ish sci-fi, with their knowledge heroes, Hari Seldon, etc. If you want to coach it in literary terms, calling it a resurgence of classic sci-fi themes makes more sense.

Pure 30's era modernism, which postmodernism is a reaction to. It's just carrying on that tradition, because it never fully died.

But honestly, it's like [[/u/FugeofAnotherWorld]] said

#+begin_quote
  To my knowledge the rationalist movement is a reaction to insufficiently good truth telling methods, and the inherent fuzziness of normal human thinking.
#+end_quote

Postmodernism doesn't really come into it. Although one could argue that "restoring a naive view of truth" is a direct reaction to postmodern theory. Still, most rationalists didn't get on the postmodernism bandwagon to begin with.

Do you think postmodernism affected the sci-fi genre a whole lot?

In reality postmodernism is so ill-defined as to be nearly meaningless. Show me a list of post-modernist tropes.

Well sure, you're putting a very simple argument in the mouths of people working in a very messy field. I suspect that no serious scholar of English literature would defend the argument you're skeptical of, at least without tons of (interesting) nuance.

I mean, they all occurred in a literary/social context, plus causality is a thing. Of course any new movement (that gets widespread/academic acceptance) will be aware of the context of the previous dominant one, and in some way a reaction to some features of it.

Also, it's an idea that divides the world into "good" (progressive) and "bad" (regressive), and then puts you and the people you're talking to into the "good" category. You should be careful with that kind of thing -- in general, the idea that you and your self-identified groups are awesome and wonderful and on the right side of history should be treated as though it's covered in big glowing red 'MEMETIC HAZARD' warning signs.

A less bad way to approach this might start with first creating a measure of "progress"/technological improvement, and then graphing it's rate of change against a measure of popularity of literary movemens/paradigms over time, /then/ calculating their correlation. This way, you start with the facts and work towards an (unknown) conclusion.

** I've seen the term 'metamodernism' applied to what seems to be congruent with the lesswrong kind of rationalism (which is more about intelligently applying empiricism + rationality to get correct results and win at life, not the older idea that everything can be divined by reason alone). Postmodernism is skepticism of modernism, which is in turn a sort of naive progressivism. Metamodernism critiques both.

The terminology is /really/ confusing, because 'modern' is (in the common vernacular) synonymous with being up to date and reflecting the latest state of technology and knowledge. Which is not precisely how the ivory tower intellectuals mean it when they talk about 'modern art' or 'modernity'.

** Not at all.

The "best" (in my opinion) version of post-modernism is actually pretty convergent with rationalist / lesswrong-y ideas.

The rationalist movement is pretty much people re-inventing everything, including post-modernism. That's not a criticism, the rationalist movement reinvents things in ways that are much more clear and concise than mainstream philosophy.

** I would say that the more rational philosophies are less a reaction to non-rational philosophies and more just a continuation of where the last rationalist left off. Yudkowsky based his sequences off of modern cognitive science and AI theory, but he also based them off of the writings of people like Feynman and Francis Bacon. He likely would not have had the opportunity to do that writing if he hadn't been raised in a post-enlightenment country.

I don't know about the other authors (if I remember right, it was Hanson that first started this on Overcoming Bias, and Yudkowsky joined in later) but Eliezer has written freaking mountains about what sources inspired him. The only other rationalist-sphere blogger I follow is Scott Alexander, and I think he was driven to rationalism by his anxiety and nerdiness.

** No. If it were a reaction to postmodernism, you would expect rationality to talk about how bad postmodernism is. As it is, it just ignores is, except where it grants that certain writers make good points.

If anything, rationalism is a sort of resurgence of Modernist or Logical Positivist thought that incorporates the objections of Quine in its approach to science and is similar to certain postmodern writers in how it regards the arbitrariness of many symbols relative to what they represent. Of course, rationalism is different in some other ways, too (e.g., the goal-directedness implied by the phrase "rationalism is systematized winning"), but these others don't strike me as deep philosophical characterizations. That's my take on it, anyway.

English literature is best regarded as art, and in art, one of the best ways to demonstrate that you are new and exciting is to cast yourself in dramatic opposition to the old ways. So it isn't true that every movement arises as a reaction to the previous one, but it might well seem that way if you're examining it through the lens of literature.

Meanwhile, it's probably unwise to think of the history of thought the way you've laid it out. For example, Romanticism really stressed the importance of feelings over intellect, but more technological advancement happened in the Romantic period than in the Renaissance, despite how you've categorized them. (The message to be taken here isn't that Romanticism+ and Renaissance-, it's that modeling history how you've done here isn't especially useful without a great deal more nuance, and so the model should perhaps be discarded for now. I would be happy to elaborate, if desired.)

But you're obviously engaging in motivated cognition to find ways in which they do.

For example, I'd propose post-rationalism is a better candidate for the "reaction" case against postmodernism, of which rationalism is the tail end. And that the action-reaction model is a poor fit to begin with.

** This is quite a late response, but one thing that is left out of some early-level/entry-level (undergrad) English Literature courses is just how small the 'movements' were. Something can only be reactionary against something else when the latter is widespread enough that people will be influenced by and/or push back against it for what is seen as flaws in that approach; or points of interest that can be expanded upon.

To take Modernism as an example; the Modernist 'movement', at least in Britain, was literally a style espoused by one small group of educated friends who all happened to be writers and publishers. Because of the circles they moved in, they were 'influential' as such, but more because of monopolies and a lack of a diverse market at the time than because the movement unanimously seized public interest. And even then, their readers were largely from a similar, /niche/ background to themselves - leisurely, upper-middle-class, not dependent on work for income, and able to devote plenty time to literary criticism and airing their opinions. It's only in the more recent decades that such Movements have been teased out and put onto a timeline, and treated as if they were definitively influential and read by a large and broad amount of people from different backgrounds.

In terms of Postmodernism; although classified as a Movement, I personally think a large number of factors (educated society, less judgement, emphasis on personal choice, emphasis on people's choices and lives being shaped by variable outside forces beyond their control but of the natural rather than supernatural variety) that affect our lives in society has resulted in it being in many ways a default logical human position in our society, rather than a deliberate form of thought or thinking cap that one can put on. Although postmodernism is identified theoretically with deliberate criticism of institutions, I think it is also symptomatic of people of all classes' ability nowadays to engage with and criticise institutions that before seemed to be innate and unshakeable. But I can understand how to people /in the bubble/, such criticisms now levelled at them can feel like they must be deliberate and calculated to shake them, rather than expected as people try to rationalise unfamiliar institutions and modes of behaviour very different to their own lives. Whew! That was a long one.
