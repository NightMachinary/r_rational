***** He probably didn't level up yet. He's had his cap increased but will need to earn the XP for the levels. That's pretty trivial for him, since he gets XP simply for spending mana. A few days at most and he'll be at his cap, regardless of what his cap is.

** In a world of people with superpowers, Amelia has the ultimate superpower of being able to switch around her entire build. Yet galaxy brain Amelia still refuses to swap out her fire based build in a fire biome.

I'm sure the Message "nice shot" was also a necessary and calculated expenditure of mana mid battle.

*** This was addressed a chapter of two back. She doesn't want to swap her build around because it takes too long -- 8 hours per point, I think? Her fire damage is reduced against fire creatures but she does so much that it doesn't matter.

Additionally, she doesn't get to swap randomly, only to things she's unlocked. None of the non-fire skills we've seen her use in the past are damage-dealing.

Finally, I'm not sure how much mana Message takes but I doubt it's very much, and she's got Rain using Essence Well on her. She can afford to waste a handful of points.

**** Yeah, so she would need to change fireball and meteor. She could keep chanting and triplicate and airwalk and brace, and literally everything else we've seen. If she's a jack of all trades who hasn't unlocked ANY other damage type besides fire, then she's even dumber than I thought. Just change the damage spells.

Good thing the aberrants they ran into in the fire biome weren't fire type aberrants, huh? What a lucky break. Because they didn't want to take the time to do the vastly more intelligent option of switching to a better damage type.

I'm sure it would have been great comfort to the person she's supposed to be protecting down there that they saved 1 day of delving time as he roasted to death against a level 24 blue fire elemental that Amelia can't even damage.

***** You might have skipped the part where she's loaded with a bunch of fire boosting skills (Fire affinity, Heat Mastery, etc, etc). Just switching Fireball with, let's say, Rockbomb, would be a waste without the various metamagics she has to boost that type of magic. And for higher leveled spells like Meteor it's even worse, since she also needs to worry about the prerequisites. I do think she should've taken the time to switch to something else, but they decided time was of the essence and since the Rank of the area was just 15, it shouldn't be a problem for her to just overpower everything with with the Force aspect of her fire spells. It's been a recurring thing in the story that areas keeps turning out more dangerous than they should, at some point they should start taking that into consideration.

***** For context: She kills the thing in about 1 hour to 1.5 hours of fighting. Rain is in barely any danger at any point in the fight, especially compared to what happened to him when we've seen other blues around.

Sure, just waste a week per biome shift switching builds around, just in case they run into something where supereffective damage helps one-shot it instead of requiring some strategy and reflexes. Even in the level 15 zone. And then do it all again on the way back while the company waits for them missing multiple leaders. Yup totally sensible.

And totally wouldn't make this into a vacation or anything.

****** Do we have numbers on how long a change would take? Why do you think it would take a week? Do you think it takes an entire week every time Amelia change spec?

And they wouldn't need to do it every time they changed biomes. Just whenever the biome is literally counter to their main damage dealer. And sure, it took only an hour to kill this one. But that's because the author decided to make the fight take an hour. And DIDN'T make the fire biome boss be a fire monster. And DIDN'T make their characters suffer for poorly planned choices.

******* She need uninterrupted hour for one skill respec, so changing build in the depth is days is least, probably week if she would need to level skills in process.

Their main damage dealer severely outlevel this zone and power scaling is exponential. Only reason monkey boss was nontrivial is because it came from deeper biome, if boss was from this fire biome they would have rolled it with higher numbers and went on.

I'm all for bashing this story for stupid character decisions, but that is not one of them. Respeccing here would waste days for marginal benefit.

******* That's how long it took to change from geomancer to pyromancer. But if you want math, she's over level 30 and it takes 8 hours per skill point.

8*30/24 isn't hard. that's 10 days.

As for why she should change in every biome? Don't ask me that's your argument. Without knowing beforehand what's in each biome it's either all, nothing, or some half-ass bs that is as good as flipping a coin. She killed every fire type there without even having to stop flirting.

******** I didn't ask why they would change every biome. I said they would only need to do it if the biome literally countered their damage, like this one did. Luckily for the characters, the author didn't make a fire biome boss be a fire biome monster. Because rain would have died.

*30 is a fucking dumb thing to say about changing specs. I've already specified she wouldn't need to change any of the utility spells. Only the damage spells and boosters.

Does 8 hours mean nonstop concentration? Does she get eating and sleeping breaks? How many actual skills would need to change to go from fire to something else?

*********** You were saying she needs a day. (24hours/day)/(8 hours) gives her up to 3 skills in total.

(31-10)*8/24 gets us back to the 7 day figure I previously quoted. And this doesn't even cover the recovery time from not sleeping for a week or the prep time of building a fort that Rain can defend solo while Tallheart is busy getting food or watering the pebbles.

I also didn't address your first paragraph up there so let's fix that - Aneliah had no trouble against anything in this biome, except things that weren't supposed to be there. The claim that she was countered by everything in the biome is just flat out wrong. She literally one shot everything they found and had expected to find.

*** Isekai is just the japanese name for Portal fantasy, which has existed since the 80s iirc. BTW since when is RR and webfiction are synonyms with quality ? Really bro ? You want good stuff you read highly rated, award winning books, not RR or webfiction.

​

Nothing wrong with RR or webfiction they are a wonderful source of popcorn, fun fictions. But they aren't necessarily where you go to when you want high quality writing, although there's some of it there also.

#+end_quote

Wait what? I'd be really interested in a clarification of this opinion; How can anachronism be used to "attack" younger audiences? And your first argument is wrong both as an argument and as fact: 2 stories in the top 6 of RR are Isekai's and 5 are Isekai's out of the top 20. That's 25%, for a subgenre of a genre that is ridiculously good? According to this metric Objectively speaking Isekai's are one of the best forms of fantasy lol?

But its a moot point, because correlation != causation, Isekai is a genre, its irrelevant how many bad ones exist, that has no baring on the quality of the good ones nor their quantity.

But WTH are you talking about with the anachronisms? How can pop culture be used to attack young people?

Edit:

If you meant "attract" instead of "attack" then that makes more sense, and sure, maybe that is one attribute of Isekai's which appeal to people, doesn't change what I personally find attractive about them: that we get to skip all the build-up of character and knowlage I've read thousands of times in each story I read which I am now bored by and get to skip immediately to the my favorite parts of fiction: the MC using that knowledge and intelligence to do cool things.
