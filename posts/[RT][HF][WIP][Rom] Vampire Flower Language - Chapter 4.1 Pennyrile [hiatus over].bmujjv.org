** About this update:

I really enjoyed writing this short section. As you can see I tried to make the language very evocative, I hope it had the intended effect!

--------------

This is only a short update (500 words) but hopefully will whet your appetite for next week's addition which will be 3,300 words and advance the plot a lot.

So yeah, we're going to post smaller updates weekly. I've got enough runway that I can do four whole chapters (perhaps 6 months of content with the smaller, more frequent updates? This chapter alone is 6 weeks worth).

It's been almost a year since the last update so I'm going to spare you all the drama and apologizing...

Oh, who am I kidding! Summary of the drama:

- Coauthor's writing is now significantly less present in the story.

- Editor's editing is now absent, so there will be a lot more mistakes.

Combined I feel the story isn't going to be as good as it would have been with the level of support I had the first three chapters, but at the end of the day, done and low quality is better than never sees the light of day and low quality, so here we go :). Apologies in advance for the extra typos you will find!

** Another of the unusual stories we haven't seen in a long time returns.

Good to see it's back, though I hope our next update will have some more plot going on than just the main character having dreams!

*** Don't worry, the next part-chapter advances the plot a lot! But part of the fun of a weekly update schedule with part-chapters being released is that you never know when you're going to get 800 words of content and when you're going to get 3,300 words of content :)

I hope you enjoy the rest of the story!
