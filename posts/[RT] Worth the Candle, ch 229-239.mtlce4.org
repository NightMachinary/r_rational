--------------

One of the things I love about /Worth the Candle/ is that it tends to avoid shortcuts and oversimplifications. If there's a way to generate disposable timelines and get information from their far future, the characters are going to use it, and we'll get detailed description of what transpired there. If there needs to be legal drama, we'll get an incredibly in-depth courtroom scene. An inhumanly proficient manipulator conducting therapy on a sentient house? The logistics of a necromancer's or a clone-maker's exclusion zone? D&D gameplay? The down-to-Earth reality of a depressed Kansas teenager? Any number of high-concept battle scenes? The story doesn't shy away from complexity, doesn't skip what needs to be described, and doesn't change what's happening to be easier to manage or present. It adapts to everything, and it does it right. (I didn't think Juniper fucking the deer could be presented in any way that wouldn't be farcical or weird, and yet /WtC/ managed that.)

So when the characters are venturing into the heart of the domain of the entity that has absolute control over biology and uses it to create things most depraved and monstrous...

I am a fan of horror stories of all kinds. I have read thousands of creepypastas. The in-universe journey through Fel Seed's exclusion zone was /exactly/ in line with my expectations, and I dare say I'm something of an expert on the subject. The gradual increase in horror, from corpses to tortures to monsters to torture-monsters to personalized torture-monsters. The token resistance from them, necessary to keep the characters /actively engaged/ with what's happening. The grimness of the journey, combined with a small hope of a success. Everything designed to maximize misery by presenting it in digestible, slowly escalating chunks, so that each new bit is appreciated. And, crucially,

#+begin_quote
  The front gate was open a crack, and I imagined that the whole thing had been built while we were on our way over, the gate, at least, if not the wall itself. The whole purpose of that front gate seemed to be the enormous doors, upon which were nailed effigies, one of each of us. They were all nude, as nearly everything had been so far, and there was writing below each of them. Bethel read it first, to examine it for suspected memetic content, and then I took a read of my own. It was name-calling, nothing more, and none of it was particularly true to each of us, nothing that cut straight to our hearts at our smallest insecurities.
#+end_quote

For all that Fel Seed breaks the rules, the /domain/ of his rule-breaking is limited. It's a failure of many horror stories when the horror breaks constraints that keep it interesting, that preserve the suspension of disbelief. A haunted video game that inexplicably gets access to your personal details. A conceptual monster that suddenly affects physical reality. A slasher villain that won't die despite sustaining lethal damage. It could be done well^{1}, but all too often it's done in a lazy, predictable way.

Like everything else, /Worth the Candle/ nailed the Fel Seed exclusion zone. The decision to not describe the horrors in detail is an understandable one: it's not, after all, primarily a hardcore horror story.

Another thing I love about /Worth the Candle/ is fight scenes. In most stories, I tend to find them boring: repetitive, low on interesting and novel developments, impossible to usefully analyse, something I've seen a thousand times. In /Worth the Candle/, with its numerous and unusual magics all used together with esoteric effects in intelligent ways against strange and appropriately powerful foes? They're truly /gripping/.

And the resolution to the Fel Seed battle! It somehow both conformed to my expectations and surprised me, in the best ways. I expected it to be hopeless. I expected them to put up a fight. I expected them to fail. I expected this---

#+begin_quote
  “You can go,” said Fel Seed. “Leave the girls.”
#+end_quote

--- sort of offer. I expected deaths, I expected no deaths, I expected some sort of separation between Juniper and the rest of the party. Somehow, I didn't expect /all of that simultaneously/, and for the story to /continue past the Fel Seed failure/. This felt like the final stretch, that any continuation except into the Long Stairs to Uther would feel wrong... and yet, it works. It really does feel like the protagonist failed, died, and the story continues past that. Even though, presumably, it'll still continue "as usual", with Juniper the narrator.

Impeccable.

I think /Worth the Candle/ might be my favourite story ever, at least by the sheer scope of everything it does right.

** Thread title is wrong, it's 229-230. My bad, but there's no way to change titles on reddit, so.

Note: the next six chapters are written and being edited, and should be out at a saner pace than usual for this serial (and will also likely be split up a bit for pacing reasons).

If you'd like to add something to the "Post Game Statistics" section, you can add it here and it will likely go in, with the caveat that I reserve the right to refuse anything I find sufficiently unfunny or against what I'm going for, and you would need to do any calculations to find the relevant number, because the math is the main thing that stopped me from making that section three times as long. Also note that it should include things that happened off-screen. If possible, show your work.

(Things I didn't do, because they seemed like they would take too much time to calculate: blood lost (in drops), urine produced, bones burnt, mana used, HP lost, entads used, time spent sleeping, etc.)

As always, much thanks to everyone who supports me on [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]].

*** I don't know if you saw in the #earlybirds channel, but I came up with a couple of ideas for post-game statistics: loyalty increases and entads acquired.

Just looking for the last loyalty increased notifications from each character, I see:

- Mary: 27 (started at -1)

- Fenn: 26

- Grak: 20 (started at -2)

- Doe: 23

- Val: 28

- Bethel: 18

- Raven: 5

So with that count, loyalty has been increased by 150 levels.

For entads acquired, I imagine you could just have something like "Entads acquired: [some absurdly high number indicating Bethel stealing a bunch of entads, plus Mary's huge inheritance]"

*** Another stat idea is "Unicorn Bones Burnt" or "Quicksaves Made", which I think should be +12+ 14:

ch 133:

#+begin_quote
  As predicted, it was the ability granted to me by level 30 Bone Magic, but I had only a single test run with it, back before my conversion, out of a desire not to run through what was a terribly limited supply.
#+end_quote

Plus one more use of the bone in this chapter. 2 uses total

ch 156:

#+begin_quote
  That was when I began burning one of my three internal unicorn bones.
#+end_quote

3 uses total

#+begin_quote
  There was a second rat, because of course there was, and as soon as I got to my feet, stumbling among the broken and bloody finger-hair, I began burning one of my precious unicorn bones.
#+end_quote

4 uses

#+begin_quote
  I began burning my last unicorn bone at once, dividing my focus again.
#+end_quote

5 uses

ch 183:

#+begin_quote
  I started burning one of the three unicorn bones at the same time I pushed vibration magic hard enough to give me warder's sight.
#+end_quote

6 uses

#+begin_quote
  the unicorn bone was being drained way too fast by the repeated deaths. I started burning the second when I felt the first's power start to slip
#+end_quote

7 uses

ch 193:

#+begin_quote
  He tossed the leg he'd been holding to the side and lunged at me, moving ungodly fast, and as soon as he had grabbed onto my wrist, I tapped the ring on my hand three times, then began burning a unicorn bone.
#+end_quote

8 uses

#+begin_quote
  I waited until I thought I was close enough, then started burning a unicorn bone, touching it in the bandolier with my maimed hand. I had no idea whether it would actually provide any benefit, but fuck if I didn't have to try.
#+end_quote

9 uses

ch 212:

#+begin_quote
  I popped a unicorn bone from Sable and began burning it, worried that I was one wrong move from getting a roasting that I wouldn't be able to come back from.
#+end_quote

10 uses

ch 221:

#+begin_quote
  I didn't know how one was supposed to go about killing Rove, but the way I did it was to crash right into the enormous mound of junk as fast as I could go without killing myself, while burning a unicorn bone.
#+end_quote

11 uses

#+begin_quote
  I started burning a second one exactly as soon as the first was done, wanting to have extra chances to escape, or to react to whatever shenanigans he had waiting for me.
#+end_quote

12 uses

Plus 2 from this most recent batch:

#+begin_quote
  He attacked again, slow and languid by the standards of the speed he'd used earlier, and I had just enough time to pull out a unicorn bone and start burning it.
#+end_quote

13

#+begin_quote
  I reset the loop for a final time, dropping the bone as soon as I did, then pulling another one from the same extradimensional space. This loop was later, after the vorpal sword had broken Grak's major wards, but I was hoping that we weren't past the point of no return
#+end_quote

14 uses total.

Also, in chapter 50, he technically burns 2, but doesn't use their time powers, so I don't think they should count towards the stat:

#+begin_quote
  I threw the void rifle, which had been sliced through, to the ground and touched a unicorn bone just as muted pain began to reach me, and pulled on END as hard as I possibly could, then moved on to the next bone before the feeling of health and wellness could even begin to fade.

*** Perhaps "Achievements Unlocked" can be a stat? Juniper unlocked 37 different achievements onscreen if "Helldiver" and "Game Over Man, Game Over" count, or 35 if they don't. +I don't think there's any mention of achievements received off-screen.+

Edit: He gets an achievement off-screen for unlocking Velocity Magic. Thanks to [[/u/BaronVonPwny][u/BaronVonPwny]] for pointing this out! From Chapter 225, "Runination":

#+begin_quote
  From my perspective, it was a matter of stepping into a tube, feeling weightlessness, then some time later, getting a little notification from the game layer before stepping out a few minutes later.

This brings the total up to 38, or 36 without the last two achievements.

*** Total Deaths: 20

Ok, 20 is actually innacurate. There were 8, plus "about a dozen times in rapid succession" from c.183, so its up for you to decide if Juniper guess the count correctly or not. Anyway, from Juniper's perspective, this stat is only increased through the incredibly specific ability of unicorn bones, but given the save feature and non-perma-death settings exist, it makes sense to include it. There was also one moment were he might have died, but it didn't explicitly state so (brain damage from mome bats made him auto-reset), but I didn't count that.

Total Companion Deaths: 14 (Fenn 1, Raven 4, Valencia 5, Mary 3, Grak 1)

Same idea as above. Interestingly, most of these happened in the Fel Seed fight, yet they all seemingly survived in the end - while Juniper didn't die at all during the loops, but did afterwards. This does not include Solace (1) and Pallida (3), who weren't companions, but kinda were.

Total Skills Unlocked: 36

I could be wrong on this one because I only did a quick scan and may have missed one that happened off-screen and didn't show bolded text for it, which is what happened for Velocity Magic, but I don't think there were any others.

** Hyped for a Hell Arc, thank the DM it's not being skipped straight to the endgame!

Though regarding other Arcs that might be skipped... I'm still pretty convinced that the *only legitimate avenue to tackle Fel Seed* that's been thoroughly introduced but not explored yet, is *p-space / The Outer Reaches.*

I genuinely believe that Goldbug's insistence to threaten /a God/ with p-space, plus the Layman's recent appearance implying the DM has a pantheon, and everything else we know about the Plane of Concepts (not to mention Joon's likely affinity to such a place) are all implying that it's the best way to defeat a *"conceptually unbeatable villain."*

Because that's what Fel Seed really is, a concept. Not a consistent, physical or biological entity - He's just written to always win so he does. Don't bother fighting him, just go delete / alter the file directly.

The "Helldiver" setting in Juniper's options menu was always something of a Chekov's gun, but it's the specifics of it that I really want to see. If Juniper doesn't keep his buffs, or worse, if his still living companions (especially Valencia) don't keep /their/ buffs now that he's dead, this could be rough.

** Great chapters!

Random thoughts: * Uther = Fel Seed theory seems very unlikely * Fel Seed seems pretty unbeatable, whatever his weakness is it's going to be weird, probably not combat orientated * We don't see much of what Val is doing in the final chapter - presumably she just isn't that much use? * Gold magic wouldn't have helped, so not a great loss * The game over screen was pretty final, maybe implies the game system will stop working in the hells

Hell Arc: * What powers do you keep in the hells? I assume none. They have their own magics though. * Valencia can probably locate him after a while. Communication from Aerb isn't really possible, apart from by killing infernals * Uther never went to hell and back, but the infernals somehow managed to come up en masse with the Apocalypse Demon. Also via possession of non-anima. So there are a couple of ways out maybe. * The others could follow him down as there's a way to send people to a specific hell (says Captain Blue). So all companions (or just Fenn!) go to hell to help him out and Valencia watches over them from the outside. * Val can eat mortal souls as well as infernals. Confirmed whether she can eat the soul of a mortal in the hells? If so, her eating Joon could kinda bring him back up.

You keep all pseudo magical abilities (bladebound and elon gar), but per the WB doc "magic is almost completely non-functional". Either all magic is weakened substantially, or only some specific magics work at all.

My guess is none. He's genuinely unbeatable. So the thematic question is how you deal with something you can't defeat.

He appeared in 34 FE, but ... we're not sure that there wasn't some kind of incubation period, that he hadn't gained his power, or that he was in hiding, and ... there were rumors.”

  If you die in the game, you die in real life. Once play starts, Diamond Hardcore Ironman cannot be disabled.

  ◻ Helldiver

  When you die, you will be cast down to one of the nine thousand hells of Aerb to be eternally tormented. Supercedes the death restrictions of Ironman modes.

  ◻ Dead-man's Switch

  If you would suffer a fate worse than death, you die instead.

  ◼ Verisimilitude Mode

  Turns off most game features which break immersion. If an Ironman game starts in Verisim Mode, it cannot be disabled.

  ◻ Mini-map

  A map of the local area extending to one mile, subject to the fog of war. Disabled in Verisim Mode

  ◻ World map

  A map of the world, subject to the fog of war. Disabled in Verisim Mode.

  ◻ Fast Travel

  ◼ Achievement Logging

  Shows achievements and achievement progress.

  ◻ Hit points

  A numerical representation of how far you are from dying. Has no gameplay impact.

  ◻ Mana points

  A numerical representation of your ability to do more magic. If you gain access to multiple types of magic, each will have their own numerical representation. Has no gameplay impact.

** Okay, time for me to post my bullshit Fel Seed theory.

1. Juniper created pretty much all of Aerb. Everything in the world is representative of some aspect of Joon's personality.
2. Given #1, the most likely aspect of Joon's personality that Fel Seed can represent is Joon's own mindset (depression, cruelty, doing shocking things just for the sake of shock value) after Arthur died.
3. Joon is no longer in the same mindset that he was after creating Fel Seed, therefore, that mindset is not necessarily permanent.
4. Joon knows that Fel Seed is not in an enjoyable state, having experienced it, and he knows how to escape Fel Seed's mindset, because he did so himself. This is what is being referred to when the interface/DM says "you know his weakness."

So, the question becomes, how did Joon escape his cruelty and depression, and how can he apply that lesson to fixing Fel Seed?

She can talk him into suicide, but only if Joon talks to her about his own depression which should mirror Fel Seed's.

As for the Vorpal Blade, it has two functions: one is whatever it does to whoever it hits, and one is the /vitality drained from its user/. The latter function allows its user to choose a degree of drainage as seen in the campaign in the real world, so Fel Seed can end himself if he chooses to spend all of his vitality. Even if they don't go for the suicide angle, it might also be possible to provoke Fel Seed to drain himself completely provided they give him a target that needs such power for him to kill plus the rage to make him do it.

*** Devil's advocate: Fel Seed is the polar opposite of Joon. He's everything Joon isn't so he's having a "good" time, and has been for hundreds of years. He's an anti-depressive small world self actualizing god, only serving himself, and content to be "alone". He doesn't hate himself, get bored, or do really do things to shock others. He just does what he wants without much regard for it's impact on others, as seen by his actions towards the party even after being in contact for a long amount of time.

1. He's anti narrative: he doesn't enjoy making ever expanding or complex worlds. He enjoys his exclusion and turned it into boring desert. He makes terrible stories (torture, more torture, etc) and intensely railroads players in them for no payoff.

2. He's anti-system: there's no deeper tricks, hacks, or exploits to figure out. He just absolutely cheats and gets away with it. He doesn't investigate how it works or how others do theirs, he just wins.

3. He's anti-narrator: he doesn't try to be a outspoken villian, he's short on words and to the point. He actively stops Joon from speaking in the end by force.

4. He's anti-development: stuck in the exclusion for so long and no signs of evolution, not even doubling down like Blue. He's accepted that he's trapped, can't open the stairs, but is omnipotent besides that, nothing else to see here.

It kind of lines up thematically, but these could all be facades over the theme of him as Joon's mindset projecting strength/"normality" like Joon.

** It seems like the conversation tree with Fel Seed was a bit under-explored... but given the 10 second limitation of Unicorn bones and the way that Fel Seed only cared about talking as a means to gloat and revel in his supremacy it didn't seem implausible that they didn't manage more of a conversation. I am a bit surprised that Fel Seed lacked a counter to Unicorn bone... perhaps he did and was hiding it, or the DM avoided giving Fel Seed a counter to let Juniper see how out-matched he was by replaying the battle over and over.

If the Key required was in fact the Key for Seven locks quest... well that just shows how arbitrary and gross the DM is. And the password was some BS as well...

I think Raven's comment about religious thinking hit the nail on the head, Juniper and Amaryllis went in with a detailed map of contingencies but ultimately hoping the DM either had some grand payoff or at the very absolute minimum subverted the original construction of Fel Seed as Rocks Fall Everyone dies BS, when in fact the DM had no master plan and let Fel Seed be exactly as BS as he was originally.

*** It seems likely to me that what happened in the Fel Seed encounter was the DM's desired outcome - e.g. the DM was railroading a bit. I'm operating on the assumption that the DM isn't some Fel Seed-like sadistic fuck, and has certain encounters and plot points in mind for Joon for some "positive" purpose. He gave them the meta hint that they should go forward with their Fel Seed plans with the Earth uniform, he can know what kind of plan Amaryllis and co. will formulate, and he could tweak how Fel Seed fights to get his desired outcome. The outcome of them getting to examine the gate and learn they need a password while being able to withdraw, without causalities, except for Joon, who goes to the Hells, which is the one big outstanding Plot Point not in the party's path, seems so unlikely to me that I suspect the deck was at least stacked a little in that outcome's favor, and perhaps a lot more than a little.

** I loved the chapter. That said...

Fel Seed was mildly underwhelming compared to the sheer /presence/ of actual cannibal Shia LeBouf.

We've seen you write good horror, so I think this was on purpose, but I still want to outline the difference in perceived value for your readers between these two confrontations.

Fel Seed's first mention*s* are all name drops. No detail. And when we did get detail, it was dry. Necessarily dry, sure, but dry.

Actual cannibal Shia LeBouf's first mention is panic and an infodump; followed by a gradual trickle of information as His existence continues on as a relevant threat in almost all of the party's confrontations against sentients.

Then there's the issue of foreshadowing.

Fel Seed's probably going to win, barring deus ex machina literal or not, which is a possibility. That Joon died here was the only mildly unexpected outcome.

But Fel Seed was never presented as or presented as having a purpose as anything other than a road block.

** FS Brainstorm.

It's the dumbest thing, but 'You know his weakness' -> may relate to Juniper knowing that FS has the Vorpal Sword, and is its master, and how that thing relates to your character sheet.

Using the Sword takes the merest fraction away from you, across all timelines and basically everything. FS's connection to it is unbreakable.

Fel Seed's sadism and cruelty may be truly limitless, given a challenge, he may be literally unable to relent, even unto his own destruction. The rape monster cannot ever not rape, kind of thing.

Thus, terrifyingly, Operation Zap Brannigan (they had a preset kill limit, and I sent wave after wave of my own...) may be the solution.

A. Juniper discovers a way to return from Hell.\\
B. Working with Val/Bethel, Juniper makes that way routine.\\
C. Challenge FS over and over, falling to the Vorpal Sword again and again. (As perfect evil, FS cannot/will not ever not use his signature weapon.)\\
D. Ultimately the Vorpal Sword consumes FS life force, across all possible timelines and realities.

Unicorn bones or the equivalent may be able to make part C/D easier. 'FS spends a trillionth of his life force on the blade, not realizing that he is doing so in a trillion timelines' , kind of thing.

Main point of this plan is that FS would be beaten by his own cheaty bullshit, rather than any other entity bound by the game system. The Vorpal Blade, I'm theorizing, is 'on his level', as far as being malarkey goes.

You wouldn't expect dying - and being sent to the afterlife - to fix your brain damage unless that afterlife also had some method of retrieving your pre-damage mindstate. Afterlife mythologies and systems, when they think about it at all, usually ascribe that function to the immortal soul (i.e. your memories and core personality are somehow backed up or expressed within a soul object, and that soul is later resleeved in the afterlife, like an ontologically basic cortical stack).

That's the same thing, though. Changing someone's body through their soul and changing their soul are the exact same operation, because the soul is the data structure which backs up of all of a person's attributes, and the world's physics engine moves to bring soul data and physical implementation into alignment over time.

Remember how the elf who taught Joon soul magic was able to make someone else into a physical simulacra of himself? And turn his servants into monsters?

That's also, for a more specialized example, why people without souls are ineligible to benefit from certain forms of magic.

It was a rare/special poison, IIRC, but if the people of Aerb didn't have SOME moral objections to sending blank-slate souls to hell, then they wouldn't need to minimize and cover up accidents in the soul gestation and bottling plants that they use for power generation.

- Seems like the only possible weakness he's shown is not being able to see through the unicorn bone loops

  - “You're doing something with time” x3
  - He was also happy to exchange a few sentences, so over time they could milk him for information
  - We need bigger unicorn bones. Grow a giant unicorn under time dilation.
  - Parallelise Amaryllis clones thinking by having her sit in Bethel under dilation and sync with clones to give them info or use entads to send them information. Then send out clones to report + die.
  - None of this actually helps unless being able to think carefully a lot helps

- The acid actually worked, *more acid*
- Why did they approach at ground level instead of flying straight down like they did with the portal guy?
- Manipulate Joon into a forge frenzy to make a counter-entad
- Breed more Loci
- Level up more

  - Bone magic for better use of unicorn bones
  - Every other combat ability he just eventually cheats
  - Increase companion loyalty maybe?

- Summon Shia Le Bouf

  - The other monster who cheats

- Is Fel Seed confirmed an enpersoned exclusion, or a person using a form of magic that is excluded? If later, Joon could learn it maybe.
- Use Spirit to mess with him. If hard to make contact, use Bethel to kidnap an avatar and restrain it, then use Spirit under time dilation.
- Find the soul magic exclusion and use it to respec

*** Nuclear weapons are excluded (at what level is unclear -- would it also apply to fusion or antimatter reactions in addition to fission?), but Juniper knows that those levels of power could be brought to bear. Why not just spend a decade constructing some sort of kinetic bombardment + death laser + moon-based railgun etc. type of structure to raze the EZ a hundred miles down and five hundred across?

(what was the source of the time pressure here, again? Was it concern that narrativium would scale Fel Seed up to whatever higher reaches the party might yet grasp? If the story has taken place in under a subjective year, it seems like they could have spent a few more maxing out all the skills or whatever before trying to take him on, especially if they suspected his level did not scale)

That, or more esoteric conceptual stuff -- forge a spear that's the material embodiment of victory, or work metamagic up until you manage to modify the boundaries of exclusion zones and squish his down to the volume of a marble. Chuck the gods of Aerb at him. Maybe explore the possibilities of some sort of intelligence explosion, and let that post-singularity being figure it out. It's hard to imagine something like a Culture Mind doing anything but trivially brushing off Fel Seed's mountains of flesh, say. Speaking of, I wonder how the hells of Aerb will compare to the digital hells of /Surface Detail/ (that's generally how I've been picturing them so far).

**** There are three narrative/meta concerns: First as you said, Fel Seed will likely be arbitrarily scaled up to keep it arbitrarily unbeatable. We kind of already saw this: they brought Bethel moving at hypersonic speed with time-dilated reasoning and planning, Fel Seed got the capability of exploding rock with matching accuracy and speed along with near unlimited void weaponry. If a Culture Mind came at Fel Seed, it would probably reveal biologically based anti-effector field fields at a critical moment.

Second, anything good enough to beat Fel Seed entirely risks exclusion. The rune magic anti-matter trick would probably get excluded after one usage and might break the rune spikes required to bottle souls in the process. Anything recursively self-improving (like the sort of stuff you would go for in an intelligence explosion) is clearly going to be prime targets for exclusion. Maybe if you pre-committed hard enough the DM would let a few exploits fly just long enough to use them in one or two fights before excluding them, but the DM probably wouldn't let you spend years stockpiling tricks and inventing stuff.

Third, stalling in a boring way will likely see new threats and challenges thrown at them, for instance see the timing of them finding out about the Cannibal. They stall and avoid the Fel Seed Fight too long, and the DM probably retaliates by adding some drama and/or time pressure.

Overall, the DM has done just enough to keep them barely alive and the fights interesting, so Mary and Joon were hoping (literally praying in Mary's case), that moving the plot forward would lead to something worthwhile. As Raven points out, this is practically magical/religious thinking, but when a literal god is manipulating things, this form of reasoning that is normally a logical fallacy might be your best bet.

***** Ah, true! I do wonder if exclusions need to actively threaten to destabilize the setting, or if they just need to have the potential to do so -- IIRC Doris Finch wasn't excluded until she'd really gotten to multiplying, skin / soul magic until they'd had a chance to taste the game-breaking exploits each provided, etc. Holding all your phenomenal cosmic powers in reserve to be unleashed at just the right moment feels a bit like pulling a fast one on the DM... but conversely, a DM that sees you prepping something really sweet and house-rule's it away 90% of the way into your prep time, before it can ever be unleashed, would be a massive wet blanket lol.

It does seem like relying on narrative too much leads you to a sort of calvinistic determinism where all outcomes are pre-ordained... and I feel the party erred to much in that direction, here, because they kept expecting to find that One Weird Trick that every DM includes in a seemingly-but-not-actually-insurmountable boss that would prove Fel Seed's unraveling. As it played out, though, it does seem like they stumbled into the exclusion zone massively underprepared. Similar to deciding what to do in dreams, I think the expected pay-off matrix would favor almost always erring on the side of "act as if there's no narrative force driving events", since if there is a narrative force, you're boned or victorious whether your prepare or not. I guess a third option could have also been to try switching the genre -- orchestrate a series of underwhelming lesser villains whose payoff lies in the genuine comedy of their defeat -- and then Fel Seed might also fall by the power of slapstick and wordplay. But that seems much less unreliable than good ol' fashioned preptime.

I'm skeptical of an "arbitrarily-scaling" Fel Seed, though, since it would make history and power-levels wildly inconsistent. If Fel Seed had the potential to reach Culture-Mind levels of offense or defense, he'd have already subsumed the earth in femtoseconds back when, pre-exclusion. Narrativium seems very NLF-y, as [[/r/whowouldwin]] might say.

If so, you may have a beginning of a plan.

Assuming Fel Seed genuinely can't bullshit himself out of Unicorn loops the way the Cannibal did (and so far it doesn't look lile he can), you can use bones to brute-force approaches.

Use a communication entad to communicate with someone from the Doris Finch EZ, who uses and unlimited supply of unicorn to try different approaches.

** A few thoughts (tl;dr, I think he let them go so they would open the door for him):

- How would things have played out if Joon had just died and gone to the hells earlier, skipping straight to whatever this is? (My guess is he wouldn't have known that the door needs a password and a key and wouldn't have looked for them in the hells)

- Fel Seed was explicitly unable to open the door; this feels like it's saying something about "doing that won't bring him back" in terms of how the original campaign came about. It might just be a narrative necessity, though.

- The vorpal blade, despite being explicitly shown to still have the "conceptually dismember whatever it hits" property, merely cuts Joon's head off. This is probably as simple as Fel Seed deciding that sending him to the hells intact is the worst thing he can do to him at that juncture, although there remain issues of "he doesn't get to actually witness the suffering" and "it's hard to believe that he legitimately failed to catch anyone else given all the other blatant cheating that went on" (especially given the literal speed of light attack that occurred right at the start, which honestly should mean he could just dismantle everyone in an instant if he wanted to). The whole thing has an air of DM fiat (or Fel Seed fiat, if this is for some reason the outcome he wanted) to ensure exactly this outcome; similar to how the original campaign went, but with a different result. It also MIGHT be possible that some other form of metaphysical damage was done to him (or just plain meta; perhaps the game is not supposed to be "over" but the blade has severed him from it) but I get the impression that the disassembly is all-or-nothing.

- Concluding from a few points above...if Joon going to the hells is required to get the information to open the door, and Valencia and the team providing support is necessary for this to happen, I could believe that this is all being orchestrated by Fel Seed to get them to open it; that being the one thing we've seen that he explicitly CAN'T do himself. The behavioural oddities could be explained by the fact that he actually needs to use these people for something, when in the original campaign he wanted for nothing.

- Joon DID give up a bit of himself to the blade, an action whose consequences persisted despite the following time reversal. I have no idea of the implications of this; it might affect how he manifests in the hells, it might just have been for flavour (although I am loath to believe that given how thorough the story has been about everything else), or it might become relevant in some other way.

Here's how I would have approached Fell Seed:

- Find group clone magic, try a Fell Seed run w/ clones first. That way you might be able to find out about the door ahead of time.
- He takes his time when he's enjoying himself. Ask Valencia ahead of time to craft dialogue designed to get him to spend the most optimal amount of time monologuing. While he's doing that try breaking down the door. (probably won't work but he does enjoy playing with his prey so maybe?)

If he could uber-charge Gold, Velocity, Stilling, Bones... is there a real chance he would've been able to blitz around the Palace, killing clone after clone before retreating out of the EZ? Or are Fel Seed's unspecified ultra-powerful defences capable of forcing him to die no matter what?

Not unless you're the DM

You're still thinking of Fel Seed as a monster that runs off the same rules that every other monster does, and he just... doesn't work that way. He's explicitly DM fiat, he's "rocks fall, everybody dies" personified. If you get the upper hand, he pulls out a new trick. If you think you're stronger than him, then it's revealed he was holding back to toy with you. If you think you killed him, then it turns out that was only a puppet and the real Fel Seed is somewhere else entirely. He cheats constantly and shamelessly, that's what he /is/.

Keep in mind, we have more than just Juniper's attempt to go off of here. Remember this bit, from chapter 130?

#+begin_quote
  When the losses began to grow, when too many warders were dying trying to remove the wards throughout Thousand Brides, the Fifth Empire called in their ultimate weapon of last resort. They tore a hole through space and time, destroying Thousand Brides utterly and killing thousands of their own. Someone, somehow, convinced Aarde to get off his butt and confirm that there was no living thing left in the entire zone. I don't know who got the god to owe them a favor, but that was what they spent it on.”

  I frowned. “Okay ... so what happened? You already said it was a failure.”

  “Fel Seed came back,” replied Pinno with a humorless laugh. His eel-beard wriggled. “They had reason to think that Fel Seed would be completely dead if he couldn't regenerate his avatar, or move himself into a new one, because the explicit magic that's excluded doesn't appear to come with any governing intelligence to it. Fel Seed the entity is just ... well, someone or something using that magic for effective immortality and to take sadistic pleasure from the world. Even if another person came into the zone later on, once the magic was back, and began to practice it, they might turn into a monster, but they wouldn't be Fel Seed. Only when he returned, that's who he was, the same entity he'd always been, ready to retake the battle zone and rebuild his City.”

****** To be a devil's advocate, maybe he came back from one of the planes parallel to the exclusion zone, like the ethereal plane, and if you nuked all the planes parallel then you could stop him for good.

Practically speaking I agree with you though.

****** Note that I did not say "destroy Fel Seed", I said pseudo-win by which I meant survive the encounter. If you survive, you can come back again or get stronger or at least not be tortured for eternity in the hells, which is surely something weighing on people's minds in this universe. Stalemate is just not losing everything.

My interpretation of optimising for living another day fits with what Joon wanted. He didn't want to fight, not really. He wanted to get to the stairs and find Arthur. He was explicitly trying to avoid Fel Seed and divert around him.

** So how does fel seed cheat? Is he now a god that works outside the system? If so, how'd he get there? I don't believe he works inside the system anymore because stronger than inviolability doesn't make sense in that case. Where does all this power come from?

*** Maybe biological engineering can grant pseudomagical skill (blade bound techniques but for natural weapon, armor skill perks but for natural armor, dodge skill perks, etc.)? Of course the meta answer is the DM looked at all of Joon's abilities and plans and retroactively made Fel Seed strong enough to beat them but in terms of implementation biology with pseudo magical skill seems probable.

** Wow, this was a long time coming, and yet, im still surprised we got here. Jun spent so long hyping up this encounter that it started to feel like a mythological encounter rather than a part of the world. Glad he got splatted by his own bs though. Finally got his comeuppance. And oh boy now for the DLC postgame content! Woohoo!

** I love this story and these two chapters had me on the edge of my seat and were interesting to read. But they were also mildly traumatizing. I'm debating if I should read the next chapter batch or have someone summarize it for me.

I'll recover just fine on my own, but it will take at least a day or so and there was stuff I was hoping to get done tomorrow which I'm not sure if I will or not. While I've been traumatized in worse ways than merely reading chapters like this from a novel so it probably will only take me a few days to fully recover at most. But that's probably going to cost me *time from my schedule* which I was hoping to spend on other things.

This would have been a good place for content warnings, because I think a LOT of people are going to be affected similarly. Something like "these two chapters are interesting and gripping but also may be mildly traumatic even for people who wouldn't normally be triggered by such content in any other stories. You should consider blocking out a day or so from your schedule to recover emotionally, even if it doesn't take you anywhere near that long to read and even if you don't expect to be triggered even after seeing this warning."

**** You may, but I certainly would not be able to help skim them enough to be spoiled about torture/hell/murder/rape/violence.

[the same glance showing me an area of the screen is trigger warnings is is enough to read the salient words for me]The chapter started without any of this, so there was actually suspense for me, whether we'd see any of that. So trigger warnings should be in spoiler tags.

Even if there's nothing triggering, they should be there and say nothing, no trigger warnings for this, so nobody will be spoiled implicitly.

** Fighting Fel Seed is like arguing with an alt right douche online. Don't. Block ‘em, move on, and save yourself the trouble. Build a wall around their shitty torture porn dungeon. Never look at them again. Nothing they have is going to be worth any of your time or effort.

And if you need to argue with a neo Nazi to get your friend back...maybe it's time to appreciate the new, better friends, that you made since that one fucker left.
