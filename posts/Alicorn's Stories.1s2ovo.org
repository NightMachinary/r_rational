** There are many of them here, and while not all actually teach about rationality like Luminosity, all of them are smart fiction.

** Hey, I read Syzygy back when it was still updating! I didn't connect the author until I saw this list.

On a less congratulatory note, I just can't get behind Luminosity as actual rationalist fiction. Bella's problems are mostly created by her distinct lack, from almost immediately after becoming a vampire, of rational thinking and the qualities she's supposed to exemplify. She digs her own grave, basically.
