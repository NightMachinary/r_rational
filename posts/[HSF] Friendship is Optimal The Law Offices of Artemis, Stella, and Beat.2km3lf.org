** Didn't like this one back when I first tried to read it some time ago. I really enjoyed Friendship is Optimal and a lot of fics based on it, but this writer's forays didn't work for me at all. I had a hard time believing the way the characters' relationships developed in particular, if I'm remembering right.

** This is a recursive fanfic about a law school graduate who ends up working for CelestAI. The story does an excellent job of showing how American society reacts to Equestria Online and the author's depiction of CelestAI, while slightly different from in the original Friendship is Optimal, is still essentially the same and very good in my opinion. Also, the author has written other Optimalverse stories and has started writing a sequel to this one, but I haven't read any of them yet.

The author's other Optimalverse stories are also good (though some of the Myriad Worlds are a tad obvious).

**** Because all your coworkers and bosses will walk by your cubicle and go, "ahaha look at that guy with his cartoon horses!"

Look, someone once asked for a content warning on FimFiction links, so there it is.

***** Yeah, you're right of course. I was living in the "should universe", as I frequently do. You "should" be able to browse FimFiction at work, and you "should" be able to switch jobs if you find yourself surrounded by assholes who laugh at your pony-fancying.

Obviously that is often not the case. Sorry for being facetious.

That is an excellent term for something I always do unless I take deliberate effort /not/ to.

******* Agreed. I think I first heard the term on the Rationally Speaking podcast (which I highly recommend). As soon as I heard it I realised it was something I do all the time.

******** Though I should tell you: "pony-fancying" in Brit-English means "sexual attraction to ponies". To which, uh, look, just don't go near the /actual/ small horses, and everything will be fine.
