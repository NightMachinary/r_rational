** If anything, Amelia is much more [MK] than [RT]. Find all of the ridiculous power synergies, exploit them, acquire more members, repeat. Not so much on the 'deal with each other in a sane way' -- that's as unreliable as you would expect in a team composed almost entirely of teenagers.

(In the presence of OP Thinker powers like Lisa's, it's also often hard to tell what is rationality that the reader can observe and dissect and what is just the shard being rational 'behind the scenes')

*** I pondered this, but I thought [MK] was more about exploiting rules in a game setting. I think you might be right, though.

Just as a warning, this fic progresses pretty far, so you might get cross-spoiled with some of canon!Worm's later arcs.

**** thanks. I am almost finished with Worm anyway... Past the gigantic timeskip, at least. Still going to hold off reading this until everything is good.

** While I like some aspects of this fic, it's not at all rational except insofar as Amelia decides to ignore her previous rules about morality. But even the rationality of that decision is questionable, given how bad she ultimately could turn out to be. I haven't looked at it for a couple weeks, but last I read her sanity was kinda shaky given the nature of her relationship with Taylor.

*** I think you might be confusing "rational" with "smart". Amelia and Taylor both made decisions that, while in-character considering their hangups, were really, really dumb. Dumb enough that the team's village idiot called them out on it. Characters are allowed to be dumb, however, as long as they're that way by characterization rather than plot (i.e. not temporarily holding idiot balls). This was something I pondered during that arc, and eventually came to the conclusion that, yeah, it would probably actually happen that way, so I can't complain.

Similarly, I think most of us would disagree with [[#s][Chapter 141]], but it still ultimately makes sense. The characters probably would not have been exposed to the knowledge we have, so there's no reason they would think the same way.

I remember thinking that Miss Militia seemed oddly weak in one chapter, but can't think of much else. Feel free to tell me about any examples I've missed, however.

** Horrible fic. I couldn't continue once they played Starcraft for new ideas.

There's actually a saying about Worm fanfics "They either die young or get long enough to see themselves become Amelia." Referencing of course the tendency of fics to just start fixing everything, munchkin powers just for its own sake and just avoid all serious conflicts and challenges for the protagonists.

*** Before I say anything else, I do agree that [[#s][General spoilers]] Some of it might be plausible, e.g. [[#s][Chapter 96]], others might be considered too convenient.

That being said:

First of all, you can't /possibly/ be objecting to serious uses of power. This is [[/r/rational]], not [[/r/perpetuatingdrama]]. If the serious use happens to outclass most of the enemies from canon!Worm, that's simply how it is.

That being said, aside from the weakness I've identified (and possibly others I haven't noticed), your characterization is counterfactual. Yes, some of the earlier canon!challenges get curbstomped... and the threats later on continue to scale up. Very often, the characters don't emerge from their encounters unscathed (despite, as a very sensible precaution, keeping [[#s][Chapter 141]]).

Yes, some of the issues they face are naturally different from canon!Worm (both in-combat, social, and eventually, [[#s][Chapter 222]]), but that's not a bad thing.

I'd hate to say this, but given that you've only read up to an early chapter (and stopped for as dubious a reason as a character showing off game units, most of which are quickly dismissed as unrealistic), I'm simply not sure you know what you're talking about.

** Amy Dallon is pushed by the S9, hard enough to actually fight back. Diverges from Worm 14.2 onwards.

This fic shows some promise at treating Weaver Nine withdrawal.

Notes:

- You may notice confusion in the first few chapters.

- You should use the index, rather than scrolling down to [[http://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.916/#post-186582][Chapter 1]]; some of the first-page posts contain spoilers.

** Not a fan of the way minors are sexualized in this fic, though nothing will ever be as bad as Panacea Quest.

This actually shouldn't be on reddit.

*** I normally wouldn't bother, but for Christ sake, the story survived /Spacebattles/ moderation up until some dumb joke by Zach that no one in or out of universe took seriously. If you're that sensitive, maybe just avoid reading any story without an all adult cast, just in case.

*** Ah yes, moral panic about works of fiction dealing with adolescent sexuality. Just what I expect from someplace like [[/r/rational]]. Except wait no that's entirely wrong.

***** Thank you for that insightful response! I now understand why I was wrong to use that term in this context. Clearly, I should have spoken more generally about the absurdity of being bothered by teenagers having a sexuality in a work of fiction, instead of resorting to the use of a buzzword that didn't fit the context.

Truly, I cannot thank you enough for that constructive and useful reply, which was absolutely not a useless shitpost that served no purpose whatsoever.
