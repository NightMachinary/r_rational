I sort of get what the author was going for in the last paragraph by writing in reverse order, buit it needs a bit of work to make it smother.

But in other words here is Bastion and expected behavior for a PTSD robot.


** Piggybacking off of my earlier comment...of fucking /course/ Athena was there and Mercy had some sort of backup scenarios set up. I'm an idiot. Considering the competency and forward thinking she's displayed, it's glaringly stupid of me to assume she would have such an obvious vulnerability.

** It's... Bastion! I do love the chapter titles. Holding down M1 for Bastion is the way he gets POTG, but I thought it was Symmetra at first because she can too. I wonder how long this has been planned because I think this story started before the Bastion and Torbjorn thing was revealed.

Also, Athena appears to be blue team, but oh boy she's scary.
