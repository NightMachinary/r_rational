*** Thanks for writing, I really thought it was dead! Do you update on a regular schedule or just whenever you have time/inspiration?

**** At this point it's time and inspiration... /mostly./

When I first started writing that basically amounted to a 2K+ word chapter a day and I was trying to keep it going for nanowrimo. But as time went on and the number of plot threads I was sorting through started to mount, my pace has slowed. I also picked up a Beta/Editor who I have looking over my chapters before I post them instead of just posting and crossing my fingers. It means better writing (I think?) but it also adds time to the process. Another upshot is that trying to explain to "Amy" why I'm having writers block usually causes me to have ideas so I can now trade time for inspiration. I haven't found a way to use inspiration to gain more time tho.

I copy paste a cleaned up chapter over to FFN on Tuesdays now, so I'm hoping that I can manage to keep up with at least one chapter a week.

***** That's completely understandable, and to be honest I'm just happy there's more to read. Write at the pace that makes you happy! After all it's only a hobby (..I think)

****** Yeah. A hobby I'm enjoying a ton more than I expected to. I started the story as a joking question in a brainstorming thread... and now I'm almost to 180K words.
