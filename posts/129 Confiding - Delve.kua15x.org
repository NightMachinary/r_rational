*** Are you asking if it's worth reading?

It moves the plot forward. It builds the relationship between Rain and Ameliah, establishes better how Rain /feels/ about his soul damage, and shows us a new character who will presumably important to the coming conflict with Crimson Gar (Hegar).

No numbers go up. I don't really understand people's obsession with them though, since the numbers aren't the point of the story. Rain is continuously making forward progress, even if it isn't reflected by his level.

**** The obsession with "numbers go up" is probably because /the first half of the story was mostly about numbers/. Half of the chapters was Rain doing math, with the other half being the consequences of him doing math and figuring out what math he should do next. It makes sense that a disproportionate amount of amount of the audience cares about the thing that was given a disproportionate amount of attention in the narrative.

To flip it to another genre to try to explain it if you don't get it, imagine if you were reading a book and the first several hundred thousand words focused almost exclusively on romance. Then, after a while, the author decides to entirely abandon romance and barely ever mention it again. The new direction the story is going might not necessarily be bad, but the existing audience will have a large portion of people there for the romance so you're inevitably going to upset them by abandoning it.

***** Exactly. The author already selected out everyone who doesnt like NUMBERS and in depth looks into the system. Now we have almost none of that. Closest we're getting for the next while is soul shit which reads as barely coherent mess about chaos and disorder

****** It is a newbie mistake from amateur authors. If we are bashing delve, i would point at the shallow characters and the fact that the author remembered that people have feelings and internal struggles after the 50 first chapters. Dont mind me though, i'm waiting for the pirates to update the last 2 chapters.

******* I do like math and would probably love being in Delve-world. Don't care to follow someone else's train of thought when doing math, though. That's just tedious and basic algebra is not super interesting, if it doesn't give YOU superpowers.

So yeah, I skim and skip, till plot and/or dialogue happens.

**** I don't care about numbers go up. Ameliah x Rain is boring, we've had a half-dozen scenes of Rain and his soul, and the introduction of a character who might be useful later isn't worth reading the whole thing for.

***** If it turns out his soul thing lets him do interesting and unique stuff with the system, that would be... good I guess. It just feels like even that has been stretched out so thin it wouldn't be satisfying.

I mean, if after this insanely long slog something insane like gaining intuitive understanding of the system happens, then *maybe* that would be worth it.

Or he gains access to large number of 'beta' skills that are not unbalanced, but clearly removed from the original system for various reasons.

Anything to shake up the board, make all the description have actually led somewhere other than back to the status quo.

But I don't think it's going to happen.

****** it is where is heading. The soul stuff is not only confusing and tedious to read but also a clear plot device for many of Rain "accomplishment". He would have fail to interact with the magistral artifact if it wasnt for his broken soul. he wouldnt have made such an impact with the dulls without his "aura of fear" and so the company would not kick started.

To me, the author could not find a way to use his system to acomplish this things so he added soul stuff.

Spoiler

half of ch 134 is about dozer getting in rain´s soul. All of ch 137 is about soul stuff and Rain coming to the realization that dozer is in his soul. The author consider his readers idiots, in need for a doble explanation of what happened. For fuck sake the pace is horrendous and now we have multiple POVs of the same shit? what´s the problem with these authors and their long ass explanations of things that where previously shown? why can you left things to be read by context?

******* I really hate how so much of each chapter is dedicated to this soul bullshit. Literally nothing ever changes, all that happens is “woah, my soul is hard to concentrate on”, but with 3 pages worth of bullshit. Maybe once every 5 chapters we'll get a slight change of “it was slightly easier to concentrate on this go around”.

I was wondering why every chapter felt so pointless, and you've helped me realize that's because 1/4 of every chapter is spent on soul bullshit. The way you put it, I really do feel insulted by all this now, what with all the padding on the exact same development every chapter.
