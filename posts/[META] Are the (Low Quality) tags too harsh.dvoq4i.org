Due to recent feedback, I've come to the conclusion that there are people who believe the (Low Quality) tags negatively affect their enjoyment of certain stories.

I've [[http://www.strawpoll.me/18934461][set up a poll here]]. You can choose between three options: keeping the (Low Quality) tags I sometimes attach to linked titles, entirely removing them, or replacing them with something less harsh. If you choose the third option, please suggest what that replacement might be in the comments.

Edit: link activity halted for now. Currently evaluating the feasibility of entirely changing the system based on Eliezer's ideas.


** Hi, [[/u/Lightwavers]]! Thank you for having put in the work on that bot, by the way! I hadn't even been aware of your recent bot changes at the time I wrote my own recent post. That said, yeah, putting a [Low Quality] tag on Metaworld Chronicles does seem to me like pushing it from two directions - the first direction being that an automated bot posting things at high volume takes on aspects of requiring community approval and not just a personal opinion, and the other direction being that it does seem like a bit of a slap for somebody to see that autoreply after posting a glowing review of Metaworld Chronicles.

Like the trueborn nerd I am, I have a thought about a technical solution to this political problem. It would require added work on your part and you should feel free to say in reply something like "You'd have to pay me $500 to do that".

My thought is to allocate wiki pages, on the reddit wiki or on some other wiki, to each new story that comes up for recommendation. The top of the wiki page links directly to the story. The bot links to the wiki page, /without/ any annotations shown inside the Reddit comment itself. People are free to post their own negative or positive reviews on the wiki page, but without the connotation of any of them replying to each other, and with etiquette saying that you are forbidden to suggest that other people shouldn't or won't enjoy something aside from you talking about your own experiences. All reviews on a wiki page must be signed by a /u reddit username.

It would also be nice to have something that automatically aggregated and posted all the story reviews, by a particular poster, to their own wiki page, and that replaced their signature inside the Wiki article with a link to that page.

*** From a reader perspective, I see this as a reasonable compromise, especially regarding tags other than [Low Quality]. I highly value getting a rough overview of other readers' feelings regarding a work, as well as anything in the author's Weltanschauung that I might want to take into account either before deciding if their work is worth my time, or during my enjoyment of said work. I am most jealous with my free time, after all.

Though of course tastes vary drastically, it seems patently absurd to me that anyone in this particular community *wouldn't* want any meta-information with which to update their probabilities on something that they'd likely be spending many hours consuming, even filtered as they are through the poor metaphors for reality that we mere humans can contribute.

*** You're correct that putting in work to come to that particular solution would be something I'm not particularly keen on doing, since I've spent the time on a system right now. The poll seems to be heading in the direction of removing the (Low Quality) tags entirely, so how about I do that and then replace the tags with links to the story's wiki, if applicable?

Also, what's your opinion on the (Author Politics) tags, which link to a specific Reddit discussion, including links/evidence to support that the author or work portrays certain political ideas in a certain way? So far that's just been to stories written by Neo-Nazis and ones which display bigotry toward trans people.

First, ideas and opinions can change. Though that isn't the case here. Do be aware that there is a difference between recognizing what a phenomenon /is/, and what you should treat it as. Tulpas, clinically speaking, are simply the manipulation of that inner voice most people have, and that I believe all neurotypical people can learn to build if they don't. However, if something acts human, my philosophy is that it's safer to treat it as human than not.

Point of order: that is not a 'quick perusal.' You have just lied. My last post in the community that shows support for the phenomena is several pages down. Next, I do not believe there is anything mystal about tulpas. They are simply a name for a mental process that you might call an imaginary friend. Many people have an inner dialogue, and with proper practice you can impart a personality, for lack of a better description, onto that inner dialogue. The community has been partially coopted by people who genuinely believe there is something mystical about all this, but the truth is simply that brains are extraordinarily malleable.

Being someone who tries to follow the evidence where is leads, despite my extreme skepticism in the phenomena, I found enough people who genuinely believed there is something to it to try it myself. I have succeeded.

Sure. But you have mystical ideas about how the brain operates in order for tulpas to be a thing. Probably less indicative of a mental health concern, now that I think about it.

No. I do not. Many, /many/ people have an inner voice that does not just disagree with them, but /violently/ does so. It's more common in depressed people, and /multiple/ voices are /much more/ common in people who are schizophrenic, or might become schizophrenic given the wrong triggers. Manipulating your inner voice to give it a different personality than "you, but nasty," is an extremely valuable technique. Once done, it's common to call that altered inner voice a tulpa.

You start off with strong accusations with him, but no evidence.

#+begin_quote
  I already had a problem with this [[/u/Lightwavers][u/Lightwavers]] person before any of this nonsense. It seems like a lot of other people did as well.
#+end_quote

Nobody else has chimed in, and the bot 'issue' is very separate (and he's clearly fixing it in this very thread) from the attack on his character, so *a lot of other people* already seems like a potential exaggeration.

Then you start making some even more serious statements, while mainly justifying them with your dislike

#+begin_quote
  ..I get a bad feeling from them. Saying whatever they have to say to make it look like they're the one who's right. Disingenuous. Somewhat manipulative. That sort of thing.
#+end_quote

This is also the first comment that actually lists something concrete

#+begin_quote
  of their commenting history indicates that they sincerely believe that "tulpas" are actually real, and that causes me to question their mental health.
#+end_quote

Now there's something to examine - which I did. After seeing his comments I quickly looked at his history (ctrl-f tulpa) and it seems he shares the common position here that Tulpas are something in the general direction of a directed hallucination, extension of someone's inner voice and/or modelling of others etc.

You continue over multiple comments to double down on this (while it still being your only real accusation).

#+begin_quote
  It feels like arguing with a creationist.
#+end_quote

Reading more, it sounds like you had a disagreement. I specifically looked through the thread for other links to something he has done/said that's obviously bad and didn't see them - the most I saw was citing someone from [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]] that didn't like him or disagreed with him. The thing is you can find a comment like that about anyone that's spent significant time on reddit, so citing it here makes it look like there's nothing better to find. The quote from [[/r/tulpa][r/tulpa]] you cite is

#+begin_quote
  You just want to establish your personal opinions and ideas as the 'right' ones, the only correct way to think.
#+end_quote

Again, I'm sure you can find a comment like that about many redditors that are active enough.

Having said all that, someone giving you bad vibes is totally valid internal evidence, that I wouldn't say should be discarded by you. However, accepting 'bad feelings' as the main/only argument against someone is not great for us. Anyone can say it about anyone and in a forum if someone is problematic it should be possible to find evidence of it and show that instead.

*** (Message also sent to this subreddit's modmail.)

The bot now points toward the wiki for each title it links. Since anyone can modify the wiki, I've held off on working on an auto-populate function, as any user can simply click the creation link and add their content. That functionality can be added if requested.

Bot test results shown here: [[https://redd.it/dwpnwa]]

As per the about page, found at [[https://redd.it/dw7lux]], I can give users administrator positions, which means they can use the !Add function if they notice a title going unlinked. The !Add function is fragile and must be used exactly as shown, so keep that in mind if you have any usernames that I should give administrator access.

** If your intent behind this is to prevent people from spending time on frustratingly bad reads, I understand where you're coming from. The same happened numerous times to me, and my response was to try some more and (if nothing changes) drop the series. No harm, no foul. Everyone has their own pet peeves.

In this, I do not trust your judgment. This is fiction, and such a low resolution judgment as the one you espouse needs to align extremely well with viewers' criteria (and the weights thereof) to be valuable and not harmful.

How highly selective the "review" process is, combined with the inherent persistence of the bot effectively results in dubiously sourced low resolution judgment seem like gospel whenever a fiction is submitted. The fact that (at my time off writing) the removal option is winning in your optional poll to address your non-optional (as it operates) bot seems to show that this is not a minority opinion.

Finally, and I didn't even know about you doing this, you tag stories based on how you feel about the author as a person based on ideology? In addition to the above problems applying to this, there is at least the obvious problem:

If I could not separate the author and the art, I would not have read OSC or any of HP Lovecraft. People are certainly free to do otherwise, but your low-resolution, highly selective, and in this case extremely subjective author-tagging is more harmful than it is helpful. (what do you think of as an appropriate bad ideology tag? Sure you may have some easy targets like Nazis whom we've societally agreed are bad, which makes this implementation easier to justify for you, but is that where the ideology tags stop, and are you sufficiently confident in your evaluation to tag all authors with something so widely considered to be abhorrent?)

Given the voting at my time of worrying, the majority seems to want this system gone. I too voted that way; though I cannot help but note that this is not the actual point.

Anyway, I hope you don't misunderstand me: I can actually see where you are coming from, so consider these two suggestions:

1) Make it a browser plugin instead of a reddit bot. You can solve many of the above problems, insofar as you believe they are problems. In addition, the private nature of the plugin would help ease the feeling that an extremely opinionated and equally persistent bot is holding this community's common hobby hostage.

2) Create a more nuanced review system and deploy it on an external site that your bot can then link to. Like topwebfiction, but in the form of more in depth reviews. A useful function to help authors grow could be to focus on recency (as well as review "upvotes" like many platforms do) to encourage development. That may have other drawbacks, but it's up to you.

In summary: I sympathize with what I think to be your initial motivation. However, your idea's current application seems at least to be polarizing and mostly disliked (according to current votes). I believe there are ways that you can achieve what I presume to be your core goals in better ways. Also, please don't make a reddit bot where you tell everyone your judgment of an author's character in a fiction subreddit. I'm sure that egregious and easy examples can be given to justify that course, but 1) the execution is tyrannical 2) you do not have the right to deny redemption and trap people in categories you deem to be evil. I am unconvinced by your neutral stance in this.

In short, there are better ways to do what you say you want to do. As it stands, the bot is at best useless, and at worst harmful.

**** I really mean it when I say I sympathize with where you are coming from on the story front. As I said, I had similar experiences of my own and most of those stories were very well-liked by a large number of people.

Perhaps you could consider specifying the axes of ratings/tags that people can use. I'm sure this has occurred to you. However, (beyond the obvious like "Grammar", which is mentioned often) a way to ease the burden on you in this regard could be to make a poll like this on the bases of judgment here, the community (that I think) you have built a service for. The low bandwidth nature of both the bot and communication here seems to be hobbling that. I would love to see your work blossom; and I mean it. Solving the core problem behind the idea (which is non-trivial) would be of great value.

On the topic of tagging author politics, I believe this is not the right place for the discussion to go where it currently is. The medium itself is difficult. We are speaking past one another, on different levels of generality, and that is not an accusation on you. With that in mind, I won't.

- Everyone, when presented with the same evidence as I have seen, will inevitably come to the same conclusion if they take the time to properly consider the evidence. This is well known.
- People will always understand precisely what I mean when I make any statement.
- It does no harm to divide people into Them and Us.
- There exist people in the world who are Evil. While redemption is possible, it is rare to the point of being vanishingly nonexistent.
- It does no harm to exclude people labelled as Evil; in fact, by removing a corrupting influence, this does a lot of good.

Any of the statements in the above list, taken as true, would represent a different potential flaw. Are there any of the above statements in which you /cannot/ see the flaw? (I ask this mainly so as to avoid spending a lot of words going over something that you are already aware of).

Alternatively, are there any of the above statements where you cannot see what the statement has to do with your bot's tagging?

I don't think so. First off, I don't believe this is well known---I instead think the exact /opposite/ is known. However, while I agree that simply shoving evidence at someone will not change their mind in most cases, what would you say if I claimed that if someone were able to experience my life exactly as I have, moment by moment, many of my conclusions on bigotry and related topics be shared? I confess that saying that makes me look arrogant, but the thing is, bigotry generally stems from a place of experience, emotion, and most of all, flawed nurturing.

#+begin_quote

I don't believe so. However, I submit that the harm caused by doing so is less than /not/ dividing people into Them and Us---when those labeled Them are actual Nazis.

  There exist people in the world who are Evil. While redemption is possible, it is rare to the point of being vanishingly nonexistent.
#+end_quote

Here are some of my beliefs. People cannot be evil because I believe that is a nonsensical claim. Actions can be evil, ideas can be evil, but no matter how much evil a person does, they are not themselves evil. Even a psycho/sociopath is not inherently evil; it's just much easier for them to do evil things. It's probably not a big distinction for most, but it is for me. And while redemption can be very rare in some cases, I believe that if there were enough scientists with enough resources studying a person for a long enough period of time, then no matter who they are or what they've done, redemption is always /possible/. Though I'm not sure our definitions of redemption coincide, so maybe not. Definition swap?

#+begin_quote
  It does no harm to exclude people labelled as Evil; in fact, by removing a corrupting influence, this does a lot of good.

I agree that someone else who has experienced your entire life and nothing else will agree with you on /many/ things (I hesitate to say "all" because people are complicated). However, that is not quite where I was intending to go with that point.

So let's consider a more concrete example.

I state, without (yet) providing any evidence one way or the other, that person X has 'objectionable politics'. What are the odds that you would, if you did the research on Person X, agree with that assessment?

There are two flaws that I believe I can see in this statement.

The first flaw is the idea that it does little harm to /incorrectly/ label someone as a Nazi. (This ties in to the above)

The second flaw is that it does little harm to divide off the Nazis so that their only company is each other, such that they can reinforce and strengthen each other's views. (This ties in to the below)

(There are a number of further practical problems with any Them/Us division as well, quite apart from the above).

Redemption: Realising that a course of action, undertaken in the past, was incorrect. Taking effort to eliminate, as far as humanly possible, the negative consequences of said action. Taking effort to ensure that said action is not undertaken again in the future, particularly by oneself. Having the above recognised by the victims of the original course of action.

I do not merely believe that redemption is possible; I would go further and say that it is /likely/ in many cases. Especially when the offense is minor.

I believe that the latter is false, in many cases. The reasoning is thus: most people want to be good. Most people therefore do not /intentionally/ try to corrupt people. (This includes people with objectionable politics of almost every stripe).

What people do do, is they intentionally try to /redeem/ other people. (Sometimes two people can work at cross-purposes, because they have different ideas of what the 'good' course of action is.) If members of Them are permitted to interact with Us, then I put it to you that the result is /more likely/ to be the redemption of Them than the corruption of Us.

I have to disagree there. There are a few harmful ideas which cause the people holding them to promote said ideas.

This holds true in many cases, but not for Nazis. When a Nazi sees that a place will tolerate them, it becomes a signal for more to come join, and push the politics of that place further right with their presence and arguments. It is a very rare Nazi that wishes to change their mind---when you join a community pre-committing to refuse all persuasive arguments, it takes a boxed AI to get through that and peel back those kinds of beliefs.

Mmm-hmm. Let me make it explicit, then.

The first time that I see a story labelled 'objectionable author politics', I have to ask myself, what does that /mean/? Does the author disagree with some reviewer on the subject of (say) gun control? Or (to take an example from Gulliver's Travels) which end of the egg to open at breakfast?

Has the author been slandered by an enemy? Has the author said something in innocence that has been badly misinterpreted? Has the author been attacked by political mudslingers, or expressed support for a single good policy of an otherwise reprehensible person?

Has the reviewer actually done /thorough/ research, or merely skimmed the surface?

There are so /many/ ways in which even a committed and thorough researcher can get someone else's politics /wrong/ that it's a near-certainty that it will happen sooner or later. And that's /before/ I consider the possibility that the reviewer's politics might not align with my own.

#+begin_quote
  Doing that does do harm. However, would you not say that someone who spouts actual Nazi propaganda on their Twitter feed is a Nazi?
#+end_quote

Define 'Nazi propaganda'. Extreme counterexample: Hitler was a vegetarian. People supporting vegetarianism should not be considered to be 'spouting Nazi propaganda'.

Personally, given how much of a bad name the Nazis have had ever since WWII, I'd find it hard to imagine them being taken seriously as a political concern.

Deplatforming takes people out of the public eye and removes their audience. This is, in my view, an /extreme/ step which should not be taken lightly (albeit sometimes a necessary step).

#+begin_quote
  Indeed. A world where this is not the case would be bleak indeed. Fortunately, Reddit provides an easy way for someone who has committed such offense to correct it and come back with no one finding a connection between the two accounts if they so choose, completely eliminating any social stigma their former positions may have incurred.
#+end_quote

I put it to you that merely putting on a new mask is /not/ redemption. Redemption requires acknowledgement of wrong and an attempt to make it right; not merely a dodging of consequences.

#+begin_quote
  I have to disagree there. There are a few harmful ideas which cause the people holding them to promote said ideas. Most religions do this, as they say that converting people is one of the best things one can do. Nazism is another one of these beliefs, because anyone who is not a Nazi is seen as an enemy.
#+end_quote

...okay, I acknowledge the main substance of your point, though I believe it's rooted in a misunderstanding.

Most people believe that they are good, and that their attempts to spread their own ideology are attempts to redeem, not to corrupt. These people operate under the /belief/ that they are redeeming.

#+begin_quote
  This holds true in many cases, but not for Nazis. When a Nazi sees that a place will tolerate them, it becomes a signal for more to come join, and push the politics of that place further right with their presence and arguments. It is a very rare Nazi that wishes to change their mind---when you join a community pre-committing to refuse all persuasive arguments, it takes a boxed AI to get through that and peel back those kinds of beliefs.
#+end_quote

...this suggests that you may have fallen into one of the major traps of the Them vs. Us mindset; to be precise, a belief that there is a sharp gulf between the two groups. That 'Them' are actively malicious, and not merely mistaken; that 'They' are the enemy and are diametrically opposed to Us. Moreover, that 'They' are a cohesive and well-organised group.

They are a minority, but being actively malicious in support of a cause is /still being mistaken/. From a Nazi's perspective, it is /just/ and /right/ and /good/ to kill Jews. It is just as right to infiltrate online spaces and promote their ideology whatever the cost. It is important to precommit to ignoring persuasive arguments, because /they are the enemy/. It's the paradox of tolerance, see? Tolerate anything except intolerance, because when intolerance becomes intertwined with an ideology people who believe in it become zealots. You don't calmly reason with a terrorist holding a bomb, for example---you /disarm the bomb/.

I will agree with you that anyone actually willing to kill people based on nothing more than their ethnicity or culture deserves far more than merely being banned from online discussions. I will further agree that anyone trying to persuade other people to kill people based on nothing more than ethnicity or culture should be prevented from reaching a wide audience.

Okay, I had to go and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics][look that up]]. It turns out the dog-whistles are absolutely not about trying to convert other people to your ideology. Rather, it's about tricking people into voting for a given ideology by couching it behind innocent-seeming codephrases.

Which is only useful in situations where there /is/ a vote.

And the biggest problem with innocent-seeming codephrases is that sometimes people really do say innocent things. Which may lead to them being unfairly considered part of a group that uses said phrase.

...I'm getting off-track.

While the conflict that you perceive is /a/ conflict between us, it is not the conflict at the core of the debate. The conflict at the core of this debate regards how useful or harmful it is to have a link-bot refer to the politics of the author next to the link of the fic.

Perhaps pointing out that some users are Nazis actually starts driving away the Nazis---that's undesireable, so they might push forward the idea that politics shouldn't be allowed.

And that prevents them from spreading their ideology, neutering them entirely.

The moment that they start to push a vote for an actually objectionable cause - like allowing anti-Semitic rhetoric while simultaneously banning all other politics - they will lose that vote.

And if they're not yet at that point, well, you only need half a dozen dedicated people to fake a consensus, especially in smaller communities. And if everyone who posts things that are even mildly anti-Nazi sees constant disapproval---well, some people might see that their community seems to be constantly downvoting posts by Jewish people.

Well, that's unfortunate, but I think we're at the point where we have to either do that or accept Nazis into the community. If we were planning to /make/ a community, it's easy to subtly influence it to steer away Nazis from gaining ground in the first place. Suffuse a place with anti-Nazi sentiment, or just ban all bigotry in the comments. For example, someone who says or implies homophobia is okay is just gone, no matter how politely they word it.

Two points. Point the first: were the mods aware? (There is a 'report' button under posts which can be used to make the mods aware if you are not sure).

Point the second: No action /that you saw/. It is possible that, in certain cases, the action that the mods would take is one of the following:

- Conclude that the statement has an innocent interpretation, and/or is being taken out of context, and give the poster the benefit of the doubt
- Send the poster a private message, warning them to be more careful or face stronger sanctions in the future
- Request that the poster edit the post to something less objectionable
- Very quietly delete the given post (perhaps with, again, a castigation of the poster via private message)

Generally, the first two will look like nothing; but a poster with a habit of objectionable statements would be more likely to end up in trouble than a poster who says something easily misinterpreted (perhaps due to tiredness).

****** Just want to preface this by saying that I've found the links helpful, and used them on a number of occasions. And also that I think your heart is 100% in the right place.

I'm probably not the only person who is saying this, and I know that getting criticized from multiple places simultaneously can be stressful and alienating even if individual responses are relatively restrained. So sorry, too, if this is adding to a pile of similar responses that is creating a negative effect on you. But I think adding any kind of politics tags to posts is damaging to the community. Besides the fact that it's specifically against the rules, the fact that the bot respons so prolifically and prominently in the recommendation threads makes it highly likely that a politics tag will trigger a political discussion. I've already seen it multiple times since the bot started up and almost never before that.

Secondarily, the subjective nature of the tags leads to unresolvable contradictions, and the system seems to be based on a number of cultral assumptions. For example, the Lord of the Mysteries tag for author politics is based on views that are commonly, really near universally, held in mainland China. It's really saying you have a beef with another culture, which in this case is Western-centric. It also means you would, for example, have to put an author politics tag on 95% of the works written before 1960, or which were written in the middle east (maybe more like 70% on that one). I think that just doesn't show enough respect for cultural difference. The fact that it's yourself, or yourself and two hand-picked friends, means that this isn't something that the community has chosen for itself, but that you're implementing unilaterally. And I do think the disucsioon kicked up by these tags is convulsing the community, and even if the tags themselves have some value they're not worth it.

I know you've invested a lot in the bot, but I wonder if you could make it go back to just linking to texts. Please. :(

The issue with this scenario is that we don't believe in the end goal. No one complained about him providing links prior to the addition of comments yet if he had asked someone might have said we don't need it. People will just comment if they want the link. People can Google.

But if no one had bothered buying a calender for any cubicle and they'd went around realising how inefficient that was and improving it. Well not their responsibility still? And you bet people would find some reason to be annoyed in an office.

Consider the following statement:

"It's not my place to come to your house while you're at work and start painting it purple with orange polka dots."

Even if that /is/ status-based, it's still entirely valid.

The real reason I've been participating in this argument (and you should be suspicious of yourself for trying to be a telepath, ascribing to me an emotional state based on how you inferred I must have been feeling - as though I couldn't /possibly/ have said the things I said unless I was upset) is because Lightwavers attitude ("as long as there are no titles unlinked, there will be no links and thus no tags provided") struck me as similar to "if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear."

It's like, no, you don't get to assume that this decision you've made is the default option. I don't even care if there's a bot or what it does, I barely interact with this subreddit outside of the Friday thread anyway.

And if you'll follow this argument to its conclusion, Lightwavers thought they had a "gotcha" with the "prove it's objectively true." I responded with two short, simple sentences. Then they went back and said "... yeah, okay, I'm messaging the mods for permission right now." So, like, idk what you're doing here but I'm wanting to be shut of all this, I haven't heavily participated in reddit for a hot minute and I feel like I wasted my entire day thinking about this nonsense, so...

That's totally fine when it's just a convention that you're breaking, and the convention is one you understand why it's in place (Chesterton's Fence) and what it's for, and you're breaking it for a specific reason that you think will improve the situation. I will charitably ascribe this motive to Lightwavers as I don't think his behaviour contradicts it. (Although I don't /know/ how hard he thought about it first, by default one should be charitable in their interpretations of others, I feel.)

Sorry about using the word "upset." I meant it as more of a stand-in for the longer phrase "arguing about this on the internet." I see this as mostly a pointless activity, so I don't do it much. Possibly I am guilty of ascribing a motive to you because you are engaging in an activity I find to be low-value.

Why not? Why can't people contribute as they see fit, if they look at the current state of things on [[/r/rational]] and go, "Hey, I could do this and it would be a definite improvement. I know about all the likely errors I could be making in this judgement, and have specifically thought about why things are the way they are, and I still feel that this would be an improvement." And then the only thing they do is break a (previously unenforced) convention. As an honest, genuine question, what is the problem with this?

(A separate issue: I can see why people dislike Lightwavers injecting personal commentary into bot-like behaviour which should be "impartial." I mostly agree with the criticisms here and so voted to remove the extra tags on the poll he put up.)

** I personally think that they should be removed. I feel like they are detrimental to the community as a whole.

By immediately judging and labelling a story 'low quality' we are arbitrarily prejudging it for everyone who sees it.

I personally am writing a story that I want to consider rational, but I am an amateur and it is obviously the work of an amateur. Does that make it 'low quality'? Perhaps, does that mean it deserves to be labelled low quality? I don't think so.

I voted for remove, but if replace wins, then perhaps replacing the tag with 'amateur story' or 'constructive Critique only', something that will tell the reader not to expect a master work but not to judge the work like they would judge a story that has been edited and published by a professional Writer and a full team of editors and beta readers.

** Ironic given the meta discussion, but I see a lot of negativity directed toward you. Disappointing given your good intentions.

Anyways, thanks for creating and sharing your super convenient tool! Really appreciate not having to search up the titles.

Re: controversy, people apparently find your objectionable tags objectionable (to the point where they irrationally hate the bot itself rather than its current iteration) , so the neutral solution is posting the links only.

On a side note, having to police beneficial technology because of human foibles and quibbles is always depressing...

** I expect that the underlying issue is that you are trying to enhance your bot, which was originally limited to providing links to third party sites, to provide what is effectively recommendation data. Or anti-recommendation data, as the case may be.

The problem with it is that recommendations are a notoriously complex area. Even Amazon, which has access to its users' browsing history and their purchasing history, not to mention a lot of experienced developers, has had trouble with them over the years. And they have every incentive to get recommendations right in order to sell more books.

Something like /Taylor Varga/, which you currently [[https://www.reddit.com/r/LightPieces/comments/dtszrx/taylor_varga/][list as (Low Quality)]], is a good example of the challenges involved. It's a hugely polarizing fics; some readers love it and some readers hate it. The quotes that you have collected are a decent cross-section of the reasons given by the people who dislike it. However, you could also come up with another list of reasons given by the people who like it. Which is why it is [[https://wormstorysearch.com/?direction=desc&is_nsfw_eq=any&limit=20&page=2&searching=true&sort=stories.rating][currently ranked 32rd out of 7,000+ /Worm/ fics]].

In my case, I had finished 180 /Worm/ fics before I started researching /Taylor Varga/ in depth, so I knew what I was doing. And yet even after reading all the arguments "pro et contra" I wasn't sure whether I would like it. I had to actually sit down and read the 2,000,000-word monstrosity in order to decide for myself. Moreover, my opinion changed repeatedly as I progressed through the text. If I had stopped after the first 300K words, when some of the issues with the fic became more pronounced, I would have had a different opinion than I have now. If you were to ask me today whether it's a "low quality" work, I would shrug and say that it really depends on what you are after, what kind of sense of humor you appreciate, whether you can handle well-written but repetitive scenes, etc. There are sections of /Taylor Varga/ which I find to be very enjoyable and there are section which I find to be very irritating.

As a general observation, I find that using objective quantifiable data helps when creating recommendation lists. It's not a perfect method by any means, but it helps minimize controversy. Things like [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/most_popular_table.cgi?1][the ISFDB's list of Novels Ranked by Awards and Nominations]], which I put together a few years ago.

*** The system so far ranges from low quality, as in the way the text/plot/etc is constructed is subpar, to no recommendation one way or the other, and finally a nearly universal recommendation at the other end. Star ratings are not in line with this system, unfortunately.

**** I'm not sure you can really make a fine dividing line between the wide scope of what you are talking about and a recommendation.

I mean try saying 'The writing, plotting and characters are all subpar - strongly recommended'. I think it sounds absurd. 'Low quality' as a tag with no qualifiers attached is functionally identical to saying 'not recommended'.

If you want to attach tags to links, I wouldn't mind something like (original) vs (fan-fiction) - I generally tend to prefer original stories, or if I am going to read fan-fiction it'll only be for specific settings I'm interested in other takes on (e.g I like Worm & Ward, but have little interest in other author's Worm spin-offs).

From the title of a story alone it is not always clear what category it falls into.

Indeed. Links are attached that point to reviews/comments that display specific critiques.

An interesting idea. The system right now doesn't support more than one tag, but I might redesign it to point to fandoms if I have the time.
