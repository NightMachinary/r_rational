RE other things I've written:

There are a couple of other things on AO3. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335][Stargate Physics 101]] is probably the best of them (I think it's been posted here previously)

I also have a blog. It's mostly non-fiction about whatever is on my mind at the moment has some non fanfic fiction on it - mostly very short. You can see it [[http://www.drmaciver.com/category/fiction/][in the fiction category]]. Of these, [[http://www.drmaciver.com/2009/04/gates/][gates]] seems to have been the most popular.

I also have [[http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][a software testing library]], but that's probably not what you had in mind. ;-)

**** It's good that the genie's been set free, and the opposing forces so far are 5, right? "The Kingdom", Jafar, Aladdin, Jasmine, and The Genie...

There's tons to be drawn from the wooing between someone "as powerful as a free-genie" and someone who's been granted "the best possible wish as per the genie's consideration". I'd assume the Genie is now siding with Jasmine rather than Aladdin, since well, she rocked the shit out of her wishes. So the forces are Basically Kingdom-Genie-Jas Vs Al Vs Jafar, and as far as power goes, it remains to be seen who is more powerful between Jafar or Aladdin, sin forseeably, Jaffar's last wish was wiser, but probably resulted in a less powerful outcome. Still, in Jasmine Vs Jaffar, Jas has the upper hand, since as far as it goes, The genie might have use the knowledge of the wishes he granted to Jafar and Aladdin, even without telling her (thus probably adding a new rule). Also, now Aladdin and The Genie are identical matches, level wise.

Still, jasmine has the kingdom, and now bff with an ex-genie. Short from Jafar killing her, she's definitely about to become the best ruler of all fucking times.

***** u/ancientcampus:
#+begin_quote
  Basically Kingdom-Genie-Jas Vs Al Vs Jafar,
#+end_quote

That's a good point.

If this is developed into a longer story with back and forth combat between the three, then it might be interesting to show Kingdom/Genie/Jasmine as having /less/ power than Aladdin or Jaffar.

Aladdin wished for "as much power as possible", and presumably got it. Jasmine just wished for "as much power as you think is safe/best for me to have and would make me happy". Jaffar has the perfect understanding of wishes, and /presumably/ made one or two wishes we didn't see. (He had the knowledge to put his heart in a jar, which probably didn't come from the first wish, so he likely made at least one more.) Jaffar's wish was probably excellently worded, but had to force an uncooperative Genie, so I'd expect he ended up with less power than Aladdin.

So, I expect the rankings are:

Knowledge: Jasmine > Jaffar > Aladdin

Magical Power: Aladdin > Jaffar > Jasmine

The newly-freed Genie's an unknown on that scale. Aladdin has "as much power as possible for a free being to have". Genie /might/ have that much, but I'd expect not. In cannon the freed genie had much less than that - it seemed less than cannon Jaffar after he wished to be "The Most Powerful Sorcerer In The World", which is likely less than "The Most Powerful Sorcerer Possible".

***** Hm. This is a good point, but I think the "conditional on you being satisfied with your second and third wishes" part kinda ruins the trust angle, which Jasmine in particular is clearly going for. "I wish for you to be free after I've made the rest of my wishes" works though. I may retcon that in, thanks. :-)

****** If you think the Genie might screw you over, you really have no chance to stop it.

I mean, what kind of theories could you have about the Genie?

- If the Genie is completely fair and honest, any reasonable wish will do here.
- If the Genie is completely fair with wishes, but might screw you over once freed, that could happen anyway. The only way to stop this is to avoid anything that /might/ free the Genie.
- If the Genie has lied about twisting wishes, the Genie could be lying about anything. "Evil omnipotent being trying to screw you over with wishes" is a possibility, but so is "Omnipotent being using your wish choice as a test of character" and "Omnipotent being not actually planning to grant wishes but toying with you" and "Hallucinogenic mushroom". In this case, you have no way to get true knowledge about the nature of wishes, so no wish you make is guaranteed safe.

Okay. But the wish that [[/u/Jiro_T]] proposed was "You make your first wish be that the genie will be free *conditional on you being satisfied with your second and third wishes*" If the genie is on your side, he's not going to stop being on your side after you precommit to doing him a major solid, even if there's a minor caveat on it. (Or, at least, I wouldn't be.) In fact, he's now super motivated to make sure you're happy.

** At least this touches upon one thing a lot of multiple wish munchkining misses, you cannot possibly create the optimal wish. Your first wish should at least include the ability to formulate a near optimal second wish.

After that, depending on what you can put in a single wish vs two, the third might as well be a freebie.

*** Well, it's every time someone thinks of a loophole- which doesn't require they have a genie or understand genie rules, to start with- just coming up with a new genie loophole, given that most people think the obvious ones are fulfilled, there might be that much potential divergence.

There might be more worlds than this one with lamps floating around. I doubt aladin thought of 62 different loopholes alone- not because he couldn't have, but because it's pretty hard to come up with 62 new loopholes for over 5000 rules without finding a valid version first.
