** "Dragons possess their own brand of structured magic, which has never been successfully copied by human mages. Quite simply, the issue is that dragons possess far bigger mana reserves than humans, and the sheer amount of energies involved in dragon spellcasting is virtually impossible for human spellcasters to match. Not every dragon is proficient in this form of magic, however -- most don't have the talent or patience for it, and instead simply rely on their innate magical abilities."

Go Zach, go Zach ... you can be the first one to learn dragon magic with your enormous mana reserves.

**** Yeah, I think Zach's reserves are probably far short. He can shoot 232 magic missles, but his mana reserves are probably only around half that due to efficiency bonuses from shaping skills and near perfection with the magic missle spell. So his natural starting reserves weren't nearly as inhuman as Zorian seemed to think, just on the extreme high end, probably around 29 or so compared to Zorian's 8.

***** That's a mistaken assumption on Zorian's part, since he wasn't taking efficiency gains into account. Zach's probably more of a 29.

#+begin_quote
  Q: Does Zach's "232 magic missiles" comment include the efficiency gains, like Zorian's current 35, or is it as Zorian assumes, and 232 is his magnitude of magic reserves.

  A: It includes the efficiency gains. There is no way to disentangle them from everything else when measuring things.

- Zach and Zorian will meet Lizardmen, Sulrothum and Dragons.

*** Zach already encountered a dragon. In chapter 14(?), after several short restarts, Zorian reads an article about him killing a dragon that's been troubling humans. We've been wondering for a while if there was a greater reason to this than Zach wanting to do something cool, but we don't know what it could be... Until now, maybe.

** One thing that often bothered me.

IF dragons are more itnellgient, more powerfull and live MUCH longer then humans, how come they are not secretly controllign thte human states from the shadows?

*** How would they secretly control human communities, exactly? It's hard enough to do that as a human, I can't imagine that an 8 meter long flying lizard arriving periodically to 'advise' local rulers would be much of a secret to anyone. These are not quite D&D dragons, with their ability to all assume human form if they feel like it.

Aside from that, there is a matter of dragons being largely ignorant of human society and its rules, and would find it hard to manipulate it - openly or from shadows. They may be intelligent, but they are also largely solitary - social manipulation is not something they're good at.

They do manipulate the human communities that live near them in a way. If one human polity is hostile to them and the other isn't (or not as much), they will sometimes help out the friendlier one by spying on the hostile power for them and doing random acts of sabotage. And if they're pestered by individuals or small groups they can't get to easily, they will sometimes bribe other humans to deal with them.

In short, the dragons are not in position to secretly control any society. They're not subtle, have a hard time dealing with actual societies, not are they so overwhelming they can just move into a large human polity and start giving orders.

Was Cyoria ever home to dragons, as a rank 9 mana well? Or did they decide it wasn't worth the massive amount of dungeon creatures they'd have to contend with?

And it's a bit far off, but do you intend to write more stories set in this world after you finish Mother of Learning?

I honestly never considered it. Let's say no, for the reason you mentioned.

Not really. I have ideas for other stories, but they're set in different worlds. I did think about writing another (much shorter) story about the events immediately following MoL - a sort of arc 4 to the story, if you will. But that is not even in planning stages, as I don't want to get ahead of myself. Resolution to MoL must come first before I seriously consider something like that.

Does that, perhaps, suggest that /some/ dragons /can/ assume human form /sometimes/?

Could the source of Zach's oversized mana reserves actually be draconic lineage?

***** Dragons can assume human form the same way humans can assume a dragon one - by chopping a human into pieces and making a transformation potion/ritual. They just need to find a friendly alchemist or learn how to do it themselves.

I confess I didn't put much thought into whether or not shapeshifters can breed with species whose form they assumed. I leave it up to you to make your own conclusions.
