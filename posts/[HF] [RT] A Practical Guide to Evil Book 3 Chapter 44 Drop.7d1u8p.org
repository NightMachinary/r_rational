  “KILL THEM,” Nauk screamed.

  “TAKE THEIR STUFF,” the Fifteenth screamed back.
#+end_quote

I'm so /proud/ of the Fifteenth right now

edit: oh fuck, those are some choice last words

*** I know the first part of this chapter is hilarious:

  Warlord,” he grinned. “We got a plan?”

  “Smash through everything until we've won,” I said honestly.

  “Ah, the Foundling gambit,” he gravelled. “It's never failed us before.”

  “Don't say that where people can hear, and that's an order,” I hurriedly replied.

  Archer's arrow would have torn through his knee, if he hadn't caught it. He raised a mocking eyebrow.

  Then it blew.

Ooh, nice reference.

**** I thought about that panel from Order of the Stick: [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0858.html]]

For context, it happens after Tarquin (the guy in the helmet) repeatedly catches the arrows Haley shoots at him and stabs other heroes with them (like here: [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0851.html]]).

**** And they took down two hundred Immortals and a Baron at the same time when they thought they could only handle one. Losing Farrier and Nauk at the same time is rough though, I'll admit.

** (I'm not going to pretend the following verse is any good, but the song is what I was thinking of after reading)

#+begin_quote
  Time has worn the soldiers down, marched for many miles...\\
  In the lands of Sun so cursed,\\
  Time to make a stand!\\
  Baron has scorched this nation's life,\\
  Nothing to be left,\\
  Anger grasps the soldiers' hearts,\\
  Mere six hundred strong!

  WENT TO CERTAIN DEATH AND PAIN,\\

  SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES IN VAIN,\\
  BY SUMMER!
