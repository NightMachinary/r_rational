** As a participant in this thread, I'd argue that it isn't [HF] since the general thread consensus is that magic most likely doesn't exist.

Also not really sure that this is considered rational considering the characters don't last long enough to get a real grasp of their psychology and the civs as a whole are clearly not playing rationally.

*** Civilizations are not making the best move, from a rational perspective, or they are not behaving in accordance to human psychology?

**** Well, we don't have enough information on the other civs to be certain, but definitely closer to the optimal move side. The main issue is that you can't really treat a while civilization as a single character.

***** Why would they be making optimal moves? In history, actors make all sort of unoptimal moves all the time.

The Ymrri are really the outliers in making optimal choices.

****** "we're making optimal choices"... heh.

More seriously though, my issue is that it's not really rational fiction since the story isn't really about the characters. There isn't really any sort of a cohesive plot, which I see as a necessary component. It's a game/simulation much more than it is a story, disqualifying it from the "rational fiction" category.

My apologies, I didn't state my point clearly at the start, and I should not have thrown in that last bit on my first post.
