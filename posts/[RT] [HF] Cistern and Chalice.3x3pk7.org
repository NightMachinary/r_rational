This story started out as a fun way of fleshing out the world of Erwt, which [[/u/thewalruss]] has been developing in tandem with a programmable magic system called "Time of Wizards". Figuring out the world-changing consequences of his magic system and cosmology has been a big part of the work with Erwt, and as a hobbyist writer I've been busy exploring various dramatic perspectives. This particular story grew to about 8000 words, and manages to show (or at least hint at) a lot of the possibilities and conflicts in what's turning out to be a fascinating world.

edit: and here I thought Wattpad was a good thing. Sorry folks, I'm going to rehost to something that doesn't require people to register.

*** There shouldn't be. Is there? I thought Wattpad was readable by anyone.
