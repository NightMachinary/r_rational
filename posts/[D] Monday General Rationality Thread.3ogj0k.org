Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I have not-so-lately become interested in applied rationality as it applies to writing/selling creative content. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3n8fep/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cvopcem][See here]], for example. So much of what publishing houses, television networks, and Hollywood studios do seems to be random flailing around. When it's not flailing around, it's following formula, which doesn't work half the time anyway.

People are doing [[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-how-pan-turned-831240][post-mortems on /Pan/]], which is the latest box-office flop. I really love these post-mortems, because when I see something like this I wonder how in the hell it happens. They had a budget of $150 million on the line! There were literally hundreds of people trying to make it work! Some of it you can maybe explain by people only doing enough to earn their paycheck, or a studio shifting resources mid-stream when they realized that the movie wasn't going to be good (attempting to avoid sinking resources that weren't going to make their money back). But I don't think that's all of it, because publishing (which is a completely different world) also puts out flops; [[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/books/review/Meyer-t.html][7 out of 10 books don't earn out their advance]].

So let's say that you're an author of middling quality. You don't really care what you write, you don't really have any difference in skill with regards to drama, and you've hit some level of diminishing returns on skill. What is your ideal strategy for Making It?

You can put your finger on the pulse of the market, but everyone else is already doing that, and the time from sitting down to write a novel and seeing it on shelves is [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/01/the-next-big-thing.html][5-6 years if done traditionally or 1-4 years if you self-publish]]. So if you see that vampires are currently the next big thing, you can't really get in on that, because by the time you finish writing your vampire novel, the market will be flooded with them. If you want to hit the market /right/, you need to anticipate where the market is going to go next, which is very difficult to do. Efficient-market hypothesis strikes again!

I feel like there must be aspects of human psychology that you can exploit in order to beat out the competition. If you know how and why people are compelled to share things with each other, you can craft something that will spread without having to pay for advertising (or in addition to advertising). I'm of the school of thought that sees stories as being predicated not just on culture, but the structure of the human brain itself; books, movies, and television shows are about delivering hedons, so it makes sense that they would be calibrated for that task. But since most authors/writers don't study human psychology, their calibration is based only on trial and error to see what works and what doesn't. I feel like there's got to be a better way than that.

(I hope this doesn't edge too far into the rationalist dark arts. I'm not really that interested in applying any of this myself, because writing is a hobby that I do to destress and entertain myself, not something that I'm trying to sociopathically profit from.)

**** But the challenge is anticipating these trends. It's easy to tell right now that Dystopian young adult fiction is hot, but could you predict that 3-5 years ago (when the trend really picked up), or better yet, 5-7 years ago (when the Hunger Games was first being published). Ideally, you would be able to anticipate the beginning of a trend 1-2 years before it starts to give yourself time to start a book series corresponding to that trend.

So I think the earliest a prediction could have been made in the case of the Dystopian YA genre would be when the Hunger Games movies was first announced (2009 or 2010?). The book was pretty popular, and based on the reasonable belief that the movie would do well, an author seeking to cash in on trends could start writing their take on the genre around then. It would go to the publisher right as the trend got big... And lets see, Divergent was published in 2011, and the Hunger Games movie was released in 2012...

It might be that publishers already know how to predict these trends fairly well, and they just sort through manuscripts looking for one that come close to the latest trends.

edit: Some additional thoughts... It occured to me that Uglies, Pretties, and Specials (by Scott Westerfeld) were all published before Hunger Games was published, much less got big... did they experience a boost in sales in correlation with the Hunger Games getting popular? If not, then doing thing the way alexanderwales envisions is even harder, because publishing well before a trend starts isn't helpful either, the books need to be ready right as the trend begins.

***** Yeah, I hold with Charles Stross' advice, which is basically that if you want to take trends into account, you should steer clear of what the current trend is. Maybe your rip-off of Tarzan isn't going to be what's in vogue, but at least you're not going to land right in the glut of other manuscripts centered around whatever is trendy. And hey, maybe you can get lucky and wind up catching some different trend.

**** See, this is part of the problem with chasing the market. /Hunger Games/ came out in 2008, /The Maze Runner/ came out in 2009. The market has been saturated with YA dystopian novels for the last five years. So yes, you could probably churn out a new YA dystopian novel in a handful of months, but then you'd be in competition with all the YA dystopian novels that were trying to ride that wave.

In fact, back in 2010 when /Hunger Games/ was ascendant, the publishers were probably picking already-written manuscripts up from the slush pile, so even if you had seen the trend coming, you'd /still/ be behind by however long it took you to write your book.

It really boils down to game theory; you don't want to go in the same direction as everyone else.

*** If you are truly an author of middling quality then probably the best thing to do is make friends with people in the industry. They are more likely to publish/advertise your admittedly mediocre stuff.

The impressive example of Eliezer Yudkowski who apparently is just that good at writing that hes able to write, on purpose, an excellent propaganda piece thats actually gets popular is unfortunately not replicable by your placeholder author.

** I think I may have fallen victim to the planning fallacy, and want some advice to recover from it before I end up homeless and destitute on the streets of Tacoma.

Some background: I'm from a small town in upstate NY, and had been getting really sick of the place. My roommate and I decided we wanted to go out west and started making plans. We paid for bus tickets, and the first month of a two month planned stay at a converted bus supplied by AirBnB. Then we started saving. By the time we were ready to leave (Sept 28th) we had amassed about 1600 dollars in savings, which would pay for the second month's rent as well as food and transportation and other assorted expenses during the trip and subsequent job hunting period.

We've now been in Tacoma for a little over a week, and have put in over 30 resumes each in that time period. We've gotten callbacks for interviews and I'm optimistic about mine, but I don't want to bet too heavily on it working out because I really really do not want to be homeless in Tacoma in December.

Now here's the worry, while discussing the planning fallacy with my roommate, it occurred to us to look at how long we were between jobs the last time we were looking for work (him: 4 months and me: 6 months). He'd put in five applications a week during that time. The planning fallacy tells you to look in very broad strokes at how long it took you before, and the answer we get is "Way longer then we have." Not only this, but once homeless, our hiring chances drop even further since we have no safe places to sleep or store our things.

I'm looking at ways of avoiding a catastrophe. During his 4 month period without work, my roommate was averaging 5 job applications per week. If we increase that number to 20 per week, it should help, but do those sorts of details also fall prey to the planning fallacy? there are also way, way more jobs around here then there were in my hometown, but that seems like exactly the sort of details that the planning fallacy tells you to pay no attention to.

I try to be as forward thinking and rational and proactive as possible. What sort of steps should I be taking /now/ while I still have a month and a half buffer, to avoid ending up homeless when our deadline to move out of our AirBnB housing hits?

We won't have enough money at the end of the period to afford emergency bus tickets to anywhere further away then maaybe Portland. My mum has a friend there who might let us stay with her, but I haven't asked yet and I've no idea if she has the space for us. I don't know anyone around here so I can't crash on someone's couch.

***** Alright. Then as absolutely crappy as minimum wage jobs in the US are, I recommend you start pursuing even jobs that are absolutely awful. If you become homeless, getting a job becomes harder. A lot harder. Or you may already be doing this, I don't know. Your original comment obviously doesn't go into all the details.

Also spend some time looking for ways to actively save money. Is there a soup kitchen you can go to? A place where you can fill up on free water? Make sure there is always food at home so you never get hunger nauseous enough that you say fuck it and buy ready made food/eat out. Hunger nausea is vicious.

I have always hated it when I've been unemployed and my mother has been like a broken record telling me things I already know, because it felt like she thought I was an idiot who couldn't figure basic things out for myself, but you asked for advice, so hopefully not everything I say is rehashing something you already took for granted.

It might be worth asking your mother's friend, just so you know one way or the other. If it's flatly impossible, best not to have false hope. If not, it might be an option even before it reaches an emergency.

Yeah applied at McDonalds which said they were hiring full time and has "Now Hiring" signs plastered all over the place. Haven't heard back from them yet. I'm used to minimum wage. My last job was minimum wage in my old state, and the minimum wage there was lower, so even a minimum wage job would feel like a promotion. I've been mostly focusing on those sorts of low hanging fruit jobs. Places that say they're hiring, fast food joints with a high employee turnover, gas stations, convenience and grocery stores, anywhere that might pick me up fast. So far none of them have messaged me back, but I've no idea how long to wait before I assume they didn't hire me.

The only callback I've gotten so far seems really promising, and I think I did well on the interview, but I've no idea how that will actually pan out. Hopefully well, but you can't put all your human-eggs in one planet-basket, as Elon Musk would say.

******* Alright, so, this won't work often, but it /can/ work. Some few places, it pays to write an email after a week or two and politely ask if they have reached a decision. Obviously if they have said in their recruitment post that they will get back to you/start processing applications by a certain date, you should wait as appropriate. But for some reason there are people out there who think that if you contact them a second time, tht means you are more 'keen' on the job.

the question is how expensive is your current rented bus? are there cheaper alternatives? you may be able to scrape up enough money with self employment. for example by making sandwiches and selling them, or other such jobs were basically the pay is for some simple work and requires very minimal investment. it probably won't make you too much money, but it may be enough to let you last till you do land a job.

Our new city has a lot more people, businesses, and thus hopefully, employment opportunities. I'm not sure how much of a compensatory effect that will have though, or how I could go about modelling it in terms of probability of employment.

***** Sorry if this sounds like the exact same advice as everyone else here, but the absolute basic thing to do is to make applying for jobs into a job of itself.

Wake up at 7 in the morning, get ready for "work", and sit down at your desk by 7:30 and start looking for applications. At 9:00 break for 15 minutes and then start filling out and submitting all of the applications you have gathered so far. At 12:00, break for lunch, and then start e-mailing back prior jobs you applied for to check if they have accepted you or not. At 3:00, start planning for upcoming interviews and other ways you can make yourself a better candidate. At 5:00, make detailed notes on what you got done and what you need to do next tomorrow.

This is just a random schedule I made up for a day when you have nothing you need to go out for. I once stuck to a routine like this when I needed a job for the summer and it was in May. I churned out like 50 applications in 2 weeks and got a job within that time period. I felt like dying of boredom by the end though.

Addition advice is to start being a miser with your money like using as little electricity as possible, cook only cheap groceries, use public services like the library's computers to save on Internet bill, and so on.

Good luck!

*** Depends on what you mean by "real life":

- Often, at various meta-levels, when playing games with postgraduate economists. This can be a lot of fun, but I'm not sure it counts as real life.

- Selection of various things - research topics, books to read, etc - can be made much more productive by starting in areas you have reason to believe are under-investigated for some reason. Basically just a technique to work out where you might have an advantage.

- Implicit negotiations - whenever interacting with a corporation, think about how to hack it's incentive structure (/and/ that of the person you're talking to). In what scenario will it be easier for the company/organisation/whatever to give you what you want than deny it?

  - This is just for companies though, since they're generally model-able as rational actors. People tend to respond better to psychology than game theory though; for negotiations read the book by the FBI hostage guy and the Harvard Business Review.

- Avoiding situations which resemble negative-sum games, or where it would likely be negative for me (eg dominated by experts, high loss rate, etc). Basically avoid most forms of speculation and check typical outcomes for your demographics before doing anything really important.

Most of it is really just understanding a system, and game theory is one useful tool among many.

***** From a sample size of one (myself, obviously), I'm tempted to say:

Going from a poor diet with regular brushing of my teeth (and next to 0 acidic food / drinks) to beginning a healthier diet (with acidic drinks and fruits) with the same health care habits led to degrediation of my enamel. My dentist said this was likely due to softening my enamel via fruits or juices before eating harder foods or brushing.

So while the acidity itself may not be harmful to your teeth directly, the temporary weakening of your enamel can be an issue.

I would be tempted to see what the effects of highly acidic drinks such as diet sodas (to be without the sugar) are on the ecology of the mouth.

Might be worth poking around for an hour or two.

  Title: Sugar Substitutes May Reduce Tooth Demineralization in High Caries Patients Clinical Question: In a patient with high risk caries how do dietary sugar substitutes compared to sucrose affect demineralization on teeth surfaces? Clinical Bottom Line: Sugar substitutes have shown to decrease the chances of tooth demineralization when assessing for enamel pH, caries incidence and tooth surface hardness compared to conventional sucrose diets. Comments on The Evidence: There were no systematic reviews or quality meta-analysis studies found over the connection of aspartame and demineralization. The validity was very questionable as this was not a very common study and was mostly from lab experiments. There will need to be more in vivo studies to be analyzed before a definite conclusion can be made.

My 5 minutes of looking at the literature confirms that there are no clinical trials or anything really, beyond the "Lisa Simpson" experiment with a tooth in soda. But diet sodas seem like they may be better for preventing tooth decay. This may change once our microbiota develops pathways to metabolize artificial sweeteners.

***** Oh yeah, use Seaborn for anything which can ultimately be represented by 2D plots - and it sounds like you'd be fine with x-y-colour. Look up some [[https://web.stanford.edu/%7Emwaskom/software/seaborn/examples/index.html#example-gallery][heatmaps]], very very pretty and dead easy too.

** I posted this in the off topic thread Friday, but realized it's a fairly relevant topic of discussion for rationality in general:

The actions we take are dictated by a number of factors. Most of us can agree that we are not rational all of the time. There are times when we act or feel in an irrational manner, despite the fact that we may consciously realize we are being irrational.

Prime Example. Fear. Personally, I know that fear isn't very useful to me. Caution, sure. But the feeling of fear, of ice in your stomach and nervous butterflies, sweaty hands, etc. is mostly useless. I know this rationally. But that doesn't help me in scary situations. And I don't mean viscerally scary situations, like being confronted by an angry bear, or being trapped in a burning building. I mean situations like going into a job interview, or confronting a friend about something they do that I dislike. Logically, I know that there's nothing to be afraid of and, often enough, when I'm in said situation, I perform well. My fear fades, and I can deal with the situation. But the apprehension is a killer and no matter how much I try to rationalize it away, it doesn't leave.

So. Here's my discussion point. What's the best way(s) to utilize our conscious, rational conclusions and understanding to directly influence our feelings?

******* Okay, sorry took a while. Here's what I got.

Fear vs. Anxiety

It may not be immediately obvious what the difference is. Fear is an emotional and physiological response to a known or definite threat. Let's say you're walking down a dark street and someone points a gun at you and says, “This is a stick up.” This would cause you to go into the fight-or-flight-or-freeze response to fear. The danger is real, definite and immediate. There is a clear and present object of fear. If you feel fear, it's because you believe there is a danger to you, could be a physical danger, could be an emotional one, could even be an imaginary danger that you just /believe/ is real.

Anxiety, however, “a diffuse, unpleasant, vague sense of apprehension...” It is a response to an imprecise or unknown threat. To a threat you believe is possible, perhaps even likely, but not certain.

If you're walking down a dark street, you may feel uneasy, perhaps you have a few butterflies in your stomach. You're worried that someone /might/ try to mug you. You have no indication that someone /will/, but you are considering the possibility. That feeling is anxiety. It's the feeling you get when there is the potential for a threat to you.

When you feel anxiety, it doesn't necessarily cause you to go into fight-or-flight-or-freeze mode, because the danger is not immediate.

However, even though fear and anxiety /are/ different, they are obviously closely related. Fear can cause anxiety, and anxiety can lead to fear. A person may become so anxious over a possible threat that they do in fact have a fear response, and run, even though the threat has not manifested itself.

Generally speaking, anxiety is a bad thing.

Fear can be irrational sometimes, in the case of a phobia, but it's often the right response to a real danger. If something is a legitimate threat to you, you should be afraid! And the fear response is to DO something, run, or fight, or hide.

Anxiety, though, is a feeling we get about possible dangers, that might occur... and because they are only possibilities, there is not actually much for us to actually DO.

I myself am particularly predisposed to anxiety, and it's been a real problem for me for as long as I can remember. But I have been working on it, and I have definitely made some progress.

“Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad.”

Suppose your rent is due tomorrow and you don't have the money. You can spent the rest of tonight worrying about that, but worrying isn't going to make the money come, is it?

Worry is pointless anyway, because it doesn't actually change our situation. You don't get more money by worrying. You don't live longer because you spent time worrying. The opposite, actually, worry is bad for your health!

“And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?”

None of us. Worry doesn't accomplish anything. It doesn't help us.

If the thing you were worried about never happens, you wasted your energy and made yourself miserable for nothing.

If the thing you were worried about DOES happen... the worry didn't help you actually prepare for it... all it did was make you miserable in advance.

Have you ever needed to have an unpleasant conversation with someone, and you put it off? You keep putting it off, because of anxiety. And you try to prepare by imagining what you'll say, and then imagining what they'll say, and so on.

It's an unpleasant conversation you don't really want to have to have... and you put it off, and you have entire simulated conversations in your head, maybe, to try and prepare, or more accurately, to make yourself /think/ you are preparing.

And then you finally have the real conversation, and how much did all your imaginings actually help you? Maybe a little. Maybe. But you could have done 5 minutes of imagining, and then just got right into it. All the “preparation” past the first five minutes didn't really help, because it never goes in real life like you think it will in your head. And all the time putting it off was just more time spent in anxiety and worry.

“No plan survives contact with the enemy.”

There is no point in excessive planning and the anxiety that goes along with it, because it won't actually help. It may /feel/ like you're being productive by thinking about your problems and planning for them... but is it?

Once you've prepared all you can... once there is nothing left for you to actually DO... find something truly productive you can do instead. Something to take your mind off the worry.

Suppose your child got their license and is driving alone for the first time, and you're worried they will get hurt? Unless you're going to forbid them to drive... there's nothing you can do. You give them a cell phone so they can call you if they get in an accident. You make sure they don't use it while driving so they don't cause an accident. Then you stop thinking about it. You stop imagining all the ways it can go wrong. You read a book, do some chores, go for a jog. But there's no sense in dwelling on the possible danger.

We can't eliminate anxiety completely. If we recognize when we are in its grip though, that can help us at least break the cycle of anxiety causing more anxiety.

I got some bad news a couple of weeks ago. Some potential bad news... some probable bad news... I thought about it and thought about it. And finally I realized that thinking about it wasn't going to change the outcome. Either things would turn around, or they wouldn't. I had no power in the situation to change anything. There was nothing for me to do, very few decisions to make or plans to make.

So I said to myself... I'm feeling anxiety. This is an emotion. This is something that is happening to me. I'm sure I'm going to feel this the rest of the day, and tomorrow as well, but it won't be quite as strong tomorrow, and in a few more days I will be mostly over it. This intensity I'm feeling now, this panic... this is not going to last. This will end. And at no point will this feeling actually change anything. So I don't have to try to figure out what to do... there's nothing to do. It's just something to get through.

It's like if you bruise your knee, and limp for a few days. It hurts, but there's nothing to do. The pain will eventually go away, you have no decisions to make... it's just something to endure.

I will feel this way for a while, and then I'll have other things to deal with. I know that any time I think about this bad news, I will restart the anxiety again... but I won't have any new insights. So I will just try to... not think about it. Not worry about it.

If there is cause for /fear/, you /don't/ want to just ignore it and not think about it and just /hope/ things work out. That's foolish and dangerous.

But with anxiety, you already know it is unproductive. If there was anything to actually DO, you'd know, and could be doing it. So at that point, yes, trying to stop thinking about it... that's the way to go.

If you bruise your knee, does it help to keep thinking about how much it hurts? How much harder walking is? No. You try to take your mind off it.

I don't know if that helps you. But it was tremendously helpful to me. To think of anxiety as something that just happened to me. Just something to endure. Not something to feel guilty about, not something to keep thinking about... just something to endure.

*** I have a similar issue with Anger. It was actually my intro post here, before I realized that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] was for rat fic, not merely the concept of rationality.

I now realize that when I'm confronted with Anger, I rationalize it as a reaction to specific sets of actions that others do to "set me off" when really, it's more about acceptance of my personal limitations and relinquishing my personal domain of control in my home life.

I typically have to recognize when the primal emotion is present and allow it to pass, since any action I take in reaction to anger is irrational, even if I perceive it to be rational at the time. It's tough for my fiancée to accept that she needs to give me space at random times, but we generate better discussions and solutions an hour after I start getting irrationally grouchy about something.

*** I'm going to answer a different question (because I have something to say about that question, but not so much about your original one): "What's the best way(s) to utilize our conscious, rational conclusions and understanding to deal with /thoughts that make us anxious/?"

There are two approaches I know of.

The first is to engage with the content of your feelings. For example, you ask yourself "what's the worst that could happen" and keep asking back "so what if ...?" (or "how likely is that", or "is that really so bad?"). For example, you are anxious about a job interview. "What's the worst that could happen?", "I won't get the job", "so what if I don't get that job?", "I'll feel disappointed", "that's okay, we can deal with that". That would be roughly a CBT approach. Doing that in writing might be superior (I don't know). Thinking of concrete counterexamples to your fears (evidence that the fears are unfounded) might also help.

The second one is kind of the opposite, but might be better suited if you already know that your fears are irrational. You realise that thoughts are not beliefs (we sometimes have thoughts we know not to be true). You accept them as 'mental chatter'. Like a radio that's running in the background and, even if can be annoying and distracting, is not really worthy of your attention.

There are indeed people whos UF strongly include kids+family life and who dont need much beside; other people are deeply unsatisfied with such a life.

Of course wether or not all these modern day human UF hold up in reflective equilibrium and wether or not they converge or diverge in extrapolated volition is still up to debate.

In fact, I think we need to understand more about our minds before we can even talk about what it is we're putting in equilibrium and how.

Otherwise, people will tend to just select some few things as overriding and rationalize away all disharmony.
