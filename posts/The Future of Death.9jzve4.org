io9 wants stories of 2000 words or less about the Future of Death. And they're paying a ton. 50 cents per word. That's nearly ten times what is considered "professional pay rate." I think this is a cool challenge many of us would be up to.

" *We're looking for pieces under 2,000 words and the deadline for us to receive your submission is October 25, 2018. Our rates start at $0.50/word and authors will retain the copyright to their work, granting Gizmodo a right to first publication and a 90-day exclusive period.*

They're paying 50 cents per word /on spec work./ (The listing says, "Please include your story as an attachment." You write and submit a story, and then they decide afterward if they want to pay you.) If you submit a story and they like it, you get 50 cents per word, but if you submit a story and it's not accepted, you get 0 cents per word.

If you assume that you have, say, a 2% chance of getting your story published, and factor that into a calculation of expected value, then a 2% chance of getting paid 50 cents per word (and a 98% chance of getting paid 0 cents per word) gives you an EV of 1 cent per word. Obviously, you can adjust this number up or down depending on whether you think your odds of being accepted are better or worse than 2%. (Things to consider: the estimated size of the slush pile, the number of submissions they're going to accept, and where your skill level as a writer places you within the (presumably bell-curve shaped) distribution.) Your EV calculation could also factor in the likelihood of your story getting rejected by io9 but accepted by another magazine (or the potential reputation gain of self-publishing the work and posting it to forums like [[/r/rational]], if you care about such things).

5 cents per word would make 100 dollars for 2000 words, so you would have to be able to finish a 2000 word piece within 2 days just to make minimum wage, including researching and editing and whatever. People might be writing for those kinds of fees, but not if they want to make a living of it.

**** Back in the 1920's and 1930's (the "Golden Age" of science fiction), magazines paid between 0.5 and 10 cents per word for submissions. The rates have stayed the same, the only thing that's changed is how much you can buy with a penny!

The success rate for NaNoWriMo is around ~15%. That's not even close to "most."

** Hmm, I have no intention or desire to submit anything to this, but if I were to write something for this prompt it would be a short story based on HP Lovecraft's quote from the Nameless City:

#+begin_quote
  That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die.
#+end_quote

You see this fascinating poem is a reference to the Old Ones' immortality and state of mind. They are eternal and will never die. However they spend time in a death-like state as a sort of hibernation.

I choose to interpret this as if they are so fundamentally different from humanity, that death is not a end for them like to would be for us, but rather a state from which they can revive from which would imply death has died, no?

So I would write a story where humans have changed into a form of Old Ones like the ones described in HP Lovecraft's stories. It's up to the reader whether or not this is a bad thing.

*** I've heard the hibernation interpretation before and think it downplays the grandeur of that line. I prefer more abstract explanations.

For example, maybe entropy's effects on Old Ones are different due to their embodying the underlying stuff of the universe, and so where time wears down the minds and bodies of mundane creatures it reinvigorates theirs, either directly or by wearing away at surrounding matter that impedes their connection to greater sources of power.

Or, we could have a "the arc of the universe bends towards horror" huge timescales thing going on where these are beings of such power and size that they can't meaningfully decay until billions of billions of billions of years have passed, and so are usually coincidentally jolted into resurrection before that point.

Considering that they are paying a ridiculously high per-word rate, and they are io9, and according to comments they don't have any interns helping... I would expect a very long wait.

***** I spoke to an editor friend last night. She said that, given the probably volume, lack of manpower, and use of an email address for submissions rather than a submissions system; and seeing that io9 published a Future of Death story on Oct 31st -- they are probably done with this, and no one will receive any rejections, even form rejections. We should consider the publishing of that story to be our notice, and feel free to send our stories elsewhere.

​

Tho I would suggest waiting a few months, so avoid the crush of everyone else doing so.
