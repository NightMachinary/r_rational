In this village I've read mentions of highly imaginative concepts from this man's books, like genie-ish metal armbands you can store your weight in. But when I tried entering his books I found them hellishly dully written, and couldn't.

So what are some of the cool ideas they entomb?


** Which ones did you try? I personally have found his work to be engrossing and refreshingly original. I don't know that one or two sentence summaries would do justice to the stories he's crafted . . . and despite this being [[/r/rational]] it sort of misses the point entirely.

Aside from what I personally consider to be his exceptional writing, he has managed to move away from being just another crypto-Tolkein with a human/elf/dwarf cast in a fantasy-europe. I have historically hardly read any fantasy precisely because of the same old tropes. Sanderson makes me want to read more.

He also manages to bridge the fantasy/sci-fi divide nicely by having elements of both in his writing.

*** I dipped Well of Ascension, read some Way of Kings and a stroke into Warbreaker, then a random page of Hero of Ages because that was also on the shelf. Clearly not a fair trial of most of them as stories or as speculative fiction, but the bland prose warded me off.

The setting sounds cool but I don't want to mine the book for them. If you have the gem, I'd love to see a photo.

***** I read The Final Empire and was unconvinced. Yes, the magic system is interesting, but by god, the plot! It's like every YA fantasy novel I've ever seen. By the time the Oppressed Orphan with Mysterious Parentage discovers her Innate Mystical Power (which is inherently stronger than other people's Innate Mystical Power because she won the lottery), you can pretty much predict every plot point.

I opened Well of Ascension and got as far as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/2g6qka/spoilers_fe_the_most_irritating_paragraph_in_well/][this line]] before the anti-genre-savviness got too much to bear. So in-your-face you'd almost think it was deliberate, but I never saw a hint of self-awareness.

I think I could've enjoyed it if I'd read it years ago, long before HPMOR and [[/r/rational]] got to me.

**** The "bland prose" is an aspect I really enjoy about his books. The prose tends to go for clarity rather than flowery descriptions and it helps me maintain a clear mental image when reading. It reminds me a bit of the prose in Worm.

If you're looking for better prose with a similar ideas about magic, check out " the Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss. I mentioned it on my other comment on this but his prose is well and some of the same approach to magic and world building that appeal to the rationalist in me are there.

***** You're right - I think Sanderson's keeping his prose less flowery is a deliberate choice, though mileage will vary. He tends to work on one or two phrases that build the mental picture. In mistborn, it's Kredik Shaw's spires and "Ash fell from the sky."

On the plus side, Mistborn is the only good Medieval Fantasy story I've found that tells a /complete/ story in under 600 pages. It's "A New Hope", not "Fellowship of the Ring".

I think he got better at this in the Stormlight Archive. He manages to slip in descriptions through events and through character observations, as opposed to thickening the prose:

I really enjoyed the Mistborn series, but start from the first book.

My first book of his was [[http://smile.amazon.com/Elantris-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/0765350378][Elantris]], which I found to be quite unique.

Beyond that . . . I guess you've got to read 'em to pull the gems. I liked 'em . . . YMMV.

I would say that since he doesn't start out with the common tropes his books maybe take a bit longer to get rolling, since he's got a whole world to build. I particularly recall Warbreaker taking a while to spool up.

** You should check out his lectures on the three rules of magic. It shows how the magic systems he makes are quasi-reductionist. It's not strictly rationalist(rule zero is awesomeness trumps everything), but the ideas he has about how much a reader understands the magic is proportional what magic can solve plot wise reminds me of rationalist fic.

The stormlight archives have some cool scenes of people trying to understand magic through scientific means, and while it's not hugely detailed, there's a feeling that people aren't just "magic works mysteriously because magic, k?" the world building is detailed and takes care to stay internally consistent. You won't see many "well, why don't they just fly on eagles to mount doom and drop the ring in" inconsistencies.

His prose can be a little bland because its so straightforward, but I like the straightforward clarity it lends to his action sequences when stuff gets complicated.

As a secondary recommendation of stuff I'd consider semi-rational fantasy if you didn't care for Sanderson, you should check out "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss. The sympathetic(like affects like) magic in that series uses a kind of conservation law in it, but the prose is really fantastic.

I think there actually was a reason for that in one of the other books. IIRC it was that Sauron was a Maiar (maybe? some sort of super-demonic/angelic being, but I forget the types) and the eagles were a lower form of super-demonic/angelic being. Basically, they literally couldn't go on his turf until he was dead.

I think. A friend of mine who actually managed to (a) get through the entire Silmarillion and (b) remember it explained it to me at one point, but I lost the details. When you have the whole story, LotR actually makes much more sense.

**** You can make up various fan reasons why they didn't use the eagles but it probably is just a fan reason- Tolkein likely either didn't want to use the eagles or forgot them. As they said in book 2.

""No, no indeed," said Gollum. "Hobbits must see, must try to understand. He does not expect attack that way [Cirith Ungol]. His eye is all around, but it attends more to some places than to others. He can't see everything at once, not yet."

He can't see everything, so him being stronger than the eagles doesn't mean much since he wouldn't know that they were there. He also lacks clear powers to attack them and deter them.

Really, if he'd thought of it when the council of elrond had talked about it they should have raised some objection. They raised many other plans and discarded them, he should have added this one.

Actually, one powerful character I did ignore was Hammond. I wanted to give the heroes a curbstomp win and some information, and he was a good vehicle for that. He never appeared again, though. I think it was mostly fair, because he was very clear about "I am doing absolutely nothing that could bring Afi down on me", and the rest of the story happened very quickly (just a couple of days) but I could have involved him more if I wanted to. I just didn't want to.

Would Hammond have been that useful or powerful? He's hardly an eagle, as a non magical person with a great of knowledge. I don't really think his absence is a plot hole. He certainly could have done more if they were fighting the other liches, but they weren't.

**** It was really just the first thing I thought of as a good example. And if reading the silmarillion is required to understand why it seems inconsistent the point still kind of works.

The idea is that your reader understands the rules of magic system enough to understand why the characters don't just use magic to solve the problem.

When the entire plot of a trilogy revolves around this problem that appears to be easily solvable with this magical power, it'd be nice to at least mention why in those books, but nobody even considers it.

I'm not trying ripping on Tolkien or anything. He basically wrote the basis for all secondary world fiction and I'm really nitpicking decades later when the genre is a lot more developed. But the difference between Gandalf's handwavey mostly unexplained magic and Sanderson's magic is what I really like about Sanderson's books.

***** Oh, no argument here. Tolkien magic system is bollocks and completely unexplained in the canonical trilogy. Shoot, the Silmarillion wasn't published until 20+ years after LotR -- it was basically a fix-fic.

Although, if you actually look at it, I think the only magic that Gandalf actually does in the trilogy is make a beam of light to repel the Nazgul one time and fight the Balrog. Maybe I'm forgetting something, but that's all I can come up with. As I recall, he even had one of the Rings of Power and I don't think we ever saw it used.

Also, I doubt Tolkein was aiming to write something that made quite rationalist-fic levels of sense and logic. LotR is a mix of world-building language essay and homage to the Kalevala as I remember.

I'm not entirely sure that Tolkein was setting out to inspire and originate several genres of fiction :P

**** Hell yes, we're talking about eagles. I fucking love eagles. Let's do this.

In Lord of the Rings, the giant plot-solving eagles of awesomeness have their nest extremely near to Caradhras, the mountain that they try and fail to cross over. Instead, the Fellowship passes beneath the mountain range, through Moria. Gandalf dies in Moria. His last words: "Fly, you fools." If they had successfully passed through the mountain, Gandalf could have taken them to his eagle bros, and used them to fly to Mordor, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY SAYS. Except he dies, and has to use this vague phrase to hint at it to Aragorn, the other person who knows where these eagles live. If he had shouted out "Go north and climb Mountain Blah, there are eagles there!" he would have been overheard by the nearby orcs, and Sauron would know to watch out for eagles. Unfortunately, Aragorn doesn't crack the code, and the Fellowship is broken.

This reduces the plot hole from "Gandalf is an idiot for forgetting about his flying eagle friends" to "Aragorn doesn't figure out Gandalf's plan using only a vague hint." It also keeps the existing plot hole of "Gandalf doesn't tell a single person his plan to get into Mordor."

Maybe this is because he knew Sauron and Saruman were scrying and didn't want to be overheard? ...and he didn't think of it until after they left Rivendell, where they were safe from scrying?

Really damn long and not rational per say, but he does a great job of extrapolating what mages would do to medieval warfare, and the gods are actual people with stakes in reality. To say the magic is rational is kind a bit of a stretch, because you don't really understand most of it until the end of most of the series, and even then it's pretty convoluted.

** Hey, though I'm a big fan of Sanderson and am naturally saddened that you don't enjoy the books, I understand that opinions will always vary. To answer the question and try to make an info-dump:

- One book has magic made by drawing symbols, then you find /why/ they're drawn like they are, and it's plot relevant, and even deducible before the characters figure it out.
- The Rithmatist also has a magic system based on drawing magic circles in chalk. It's simple and explained thoroughly enough that you know all the rules and could draw them yourself, and make intelligent decisions like "I would put another line there, which would sacrifice flexibility but improve defense" or "I'd leave that bit out because, though it's useful, it'd take too long to draw and this needs to be fast."
- Warbreaker: animating objects, used intelligently. In particular, animating parts of your clothing.
- Technically a spoiler, but I'd want to know it anyways if I were a new fan: [[#s][]]
- A guy who's probably a genius - he's more-or-less perfectly average, but he hallucinates lots of different experts in different fields, as imaginary friends. He insists they get seats in the car, hotel rooms, etc.
- All the tricks in Mistborn you've probably read. [[#s][Book one spoiler:]]
- Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians has a group of people who have really dumb-sounding superpowers who use them to insane effect. The ability to "get water on the floor while doing dishes" ended a drought. Grandpa uses his talent to arrive late to things in order to arrive late to bullets.
