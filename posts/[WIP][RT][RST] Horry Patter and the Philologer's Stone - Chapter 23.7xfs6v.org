** I went back through the conversation in Chapter 20 and there wasn't any candle flickering. So, everyone was either being honest up to that point in the conversation or they had taken "the regular precautions."

My Questions:

- Did Horry really cast the lie detecting spell on the alcove?
- If so, how did he cast it without a wand?

*** Re point 2: this is what is referred to, in the business, so to speak, as a “plot hole”.

(Pretend Horbid gave Horry a book that could one-time-cast the spell, which is how I'll edit this)

**** On the other hand, if Harry wasn't looking for a candle flickering, he wouldn't notice it. If you're in a drafty room with a candle having a conversation, do you notice every time the candle flickers?

**** Typo in Chapter 24:

#+begin_quote
  He trudges over next to Romb looks out at the...display.
#+end_quote

Romb looks -> Romb and looks
