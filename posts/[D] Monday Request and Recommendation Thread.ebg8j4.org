Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Pre-holiday dump of recs, some are repeats from others' recs over the months and definitely missed a bunch. Weekly threads have been awesome at turning up new stuff, but I feel like it's a shame that some excellent recommendations never get a rerun and new community members miss out.

First of all, shoutout to [[/u/Robert_Barlow]] for the [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c4pfw9/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/erxw2b1/][Monday rec post with single biggest yield of stories I enjoyed.]] Just a quick summary below of 4/7. Nemesis is short and great, didn't read Magical Girl Escalation Taylor yet and didn't like The Simulacrum.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]] (Youjo Senki) - Source is alt-history of WW era with magic. No knowledge required of canon and much more exciting than its title suggests. Politics in fanfiction has never been so...inadvertent.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/greg-veder-vs-the-world-worm-the-gamer.601118/][Greg Veder vs. The World]] (Worm/The Gamer) is a decent Gamer!Greg litrpg action flick, but if you only have patience for one Greg, go for this one instead:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/][A daring synthesis]] (Worm/The Gamer) - The first few chapters are unbelievably cringey (and fortunately intentional), but after that it's quite the trip of self-awareness. All around satisfying character growth and modern bildungsroman (i.e. dank memes).

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/deep-red-avatar-the-last-airbender.50358/][Deep Red]] (Avatar: The Last Airbender) - Quest played as an OC older sister to Zuko and Azula. Have to agree with Robert_Barlow that the writing is unparalleled for quests, especially considering it was written live (on [[https://fiction.live/stories/Deep-Red/3Qk82fibaeXXuvJXm/home][fiction.live]]). Probably dead, partially due to poor voting. OC aspires to rationality despite her cognitive distortions.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest]] - Tongue-in-cheek title but the best original quest I've read so far (not many). Borrows from light novel and mecha traditions and makes it better. Played as a traumatized veteran mecha-girl who's technically the side character. Good worldbuilding, great technobabble and fight articulation. Not rational; it's basically above average anime.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2][Let Me In 2]] is a sequel fanfic to /Let Me In/ or the superior Swedish original /Let The Right One In/ (recommended). Rational vampire story - read [[/u/Sophronius]]'s [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/btahxu/rec_let_me_in_2_a_rational_vampire_fanfic/][recommendation thread]] for more gushing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17734931/chapters/41842241?view_adult=true][Silent Partner, Unfinished Business]] (Death Note) - Great/thoughtful what-if execution. Naomi Misora survives. One of only two DN fics I've really enjoyed, the other being:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431989/1/If-It-s-Not-Me-It-s-You][If It's Not Me, It's You]] (Death Note) - Light's personality doesn't change when he loses his memories. Cat and mouse a-go with more tension and introspection.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13166639/1/Unmade][Unmade]] (Oregairu) - Hardboiled crime/romcom from the memorable perspective of the cynical loner protagonist of Oregairu. Set years after canon so some familiarity with characters is recommended. On the dramatic side, but each of the opening chapters keeps topping the last. Not rational, but entertaining romcom banter and detective drama.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kaleidoscope.717019/][Kaleidoscope]] (Worm) - If you like the questionable morality of PGTE, you'll probably like this. Anything more would be spoilers: it's a blend of lawful/chaotic/neutral evil done right and Machiavelli would undoubtedly approve.

[[https://mangabat.com/manga/serie-1088885674][Dorohedoro]] (Manga) - Imaginative dungeon-punk (not sure what to classify as) fantasy worldbuilding and characters, though not rational. Quirky and distinctive flavor of grimdark comedy and lighthearted gore.

Now for requests...does anyone have:

1. Quest recommendations with standout storytelling or characters? Some quests are fun to play/watch, but I'm not invested in the characters.

2. Manga recommendations? Preferably seinen.

3. Or rational-enough RPGs/survival games? Preferably on PC.

*** For seinen manga recommendations I've got a few, though I don't kmow if you are looking for rarional-type manga or just general ones.

First there is Berserk. Don't go into this if you're looking for a completed story, cause that probably wont happen before the heat death of the universe. However it is a brutal manga that is exceptionally well done, and I would definitely recommend checking it out. Fair warning, it is decently NSFW.

Another seinen that has more of a "clever" main character is Monster. Featuring a doctor trying to track down a former patient turned serial killer, it's widely renown and for good reason.

On a (slightly) more lighthearted note is Akumetsu. While technically shonen it doesn't fit the sterotypes of the genre. It features a vigilante fighting against widespread corruption within the japanese government.

  Kaleidoscope (Worm) - If you like the questionable morality of PGTE, you'll probably like this.
#+end_quote

I like PGTE, and I didn't enjoy this. I skimmed more and more as I went until I dropped it after Scarlet 1.12 was page after page of stuff I didn't care about. Spoiler-laden commentary below:

The first few chapters built up something I'd be interested in - it was clear there's something off about our protagonist, but interesting to puzzle out exactly how and what strange goals she might have. But the further I got the less substantial it got. The social manipulation is hamfisted and unbelievable because the characters have no inner life and their personalities have no inertia. The combat scenes are lengthy and portray move after move of anime fisticuffs without portraying any unique ideas. The power-based problem solving is interesting in some of the early uses of illusions, and remains one of the better parts of the fic, but increasing use of body control illusions made it clear that this was going to become a hammer that solves all problems. The moral ambiguity is undermined by the protagonist's constant asides to remind you that she's a sociopath. Somehow it's supposed to be a mystery why the protagonist throws up when turning her powers off on some nights and not others, but despite the incredibly obvious answer it's spelled out for the audience explicitly by the third time.

**** *SPOILERS*

I disagree with most of that (obviously, having liked it), but fwiw: I thought the social manipulation was hamfisted at times, lacking the finesse or persuasiveness of perfectly delivered manipulation. However, it was more than good enough in execution, especially because the narration goes into detail on /how and why/ it would work. Also on the contrary, there's only been a few longer interactions but the characters that were given social screentime had plenty of life. Excepting the great prologue, they're ordinary people with ordinary inertia (I don't know what your standard is for "inner life"). There are quite a lot of OCs later by necessity and most of them stand out. There's a weight to their names, not as major players but as real voices - albeit drawn into the wake of Taylor's charisma.

I actually thought the action sequences were well done, not dragging on but long enough to paint a challenge. Also given her powers and the crossover, I don't see a reason for condemning fisticuffs. Without asking the author to use a different alt-power, what uniqueness is possible within the limitations of Taylor's current powers and means? Personally I think the body control aspect is a tad overpowered, but we're in a sub that appreciates utility, so I wouldn't condemn usage of powers until it becomes a crutch that resolves all (cape) fights. Rather I feel like the power is /too/ ambitious in scope - as her arsenal grows, it becomes harder and harder to rationally justify why she uses one power and not another.

I might've made a mistake bringing up moral ambiguity, when it's more like moral irony. Taylor is the definition of neutral evil (with some caveats and lawful/chaotic moments), but the fic doesn't hide that. It constantly reminds you she's a sociopath, but one that's /evil to evil/ (or at least those seemingly deserving of it). If there's any moral ambiguity, it's a question of whether the enemy of my enemy is a friend.

It's not supposed to be a real mystery beyond the 2nd time it happens, but I do think the scenes when her power's off could better illustrate the psychological contrast. At the moment, she's slowly desensitizing but without the power on, she's just not different enough to sell the whole guilt-ridden nausea blackouts.

  A Young Woman's Political Record (Youjo Senki) - Source is alt-history of WW era with magic. No knowledge required of canon and much more exciting than its title suggests. Politics in fanfiction has never been so...inadvertent.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if I would call it inadvertent. I got about two-thirds of the way through, and everything about it feels intentional, like an apology for Hitler. At every point, the main character downplays her involvement and responsibility, rising through the political ranks of pre-WWII Germany.

- The execution of the communist party leaders, framed as an overzealous subordinate.
- The call for rounding up and killing all French nationals, framed as trying to drive away moderate voters.
- The increasingly warmongering rhetoric, framed as trying to get France to call for her exile.

The writing is good, but the politics of it feel like it is trying to excuse Hitler's actions and policies by framing each as a reasonable next step.

**** I assume you're speaking from a meta standpoint, because in story, everything she does backfires on her intentions, hence "inadvertent." She doesn't downplay her responsibility; she's just written as some near-idiot savant who has zero ability to read the (political) mood. But if we're talking meta, I can see your point about the story validating Hitler's actions and policies. However, I don't see it as apologetics or excuses for Hitler's atrocities. Rather it seems like the story is saying the post-war political climate was an ideal breeding ground for hate and warmongering and that Hitler's actions and policies were successful for a reason. Her hate-on for communism aside, her whole spiel for the rest of the story after the ill-conceived warmongering episode is about avoiding war (albeit wielding a bigger stick as a deterrent). She's no paragon of ethics, but she seems like the eminent politician Hitler would have been if he wasn't completely evil and out to make enemies with the entire world.

***** You are correct, I am speaking from a meta standpoint. Inside the story, all of her actions make sense from her perspective. Outside the story, events are constructed such that it can make sense, and that she can stay in ignorance of her effects.

For example, at no point does Elya ask for clarification, recognition, or praise for her campaign against the communists. We hear about the leaders being found dead and later the entire organization falls apart from additional missing leadership. Had Elya done so, the campaign could only have continued with Tanya's approval. The situation is constructed such that we, the reader, know that Tanya is not responsible. Since Tanya is filling the role of Hitler within the fictional world, we are meant to conclude that Hitler may not have been responsible for his policies.

****** I don't wanna get too deep into Godwin's Law, as I lack the expertise to convincingly argue either side. But if we're comparing to actual history, it's misleading to imply that Hitler was solely responsible for his policies. He's been vilified to the point where people like to treat him as the source of all Nazi Germany's evils, when he's really just one person. Yes, he's the spearhead enabling everything, but those policies didn't happen in a vacuum. Besides the faulty premise here, you're setting up a straw man when you claim Tanya would surely have approved the assassination campaign (also might be mixing up premises, is the assassination of communists one of Hitler's unacceptable policies?). There's a few other fallacies here but I'm too sleepy to pick them out. Anyways, just wanna say I'm not saying your overall interpretation is wrong. If you see it this way, someone else surely does too. Overall I feel it's pro-Hitler's successful policies and anti-Hitler's atrocity-related policies.

** I'd like to recommend [[https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/][Should the Sun not Rise]], a complete Urban Fantasy webserial set in contemporary America. It follows a woman of supernatural Aztec origins (what kind is a spoiler, revealed halfway through). She's been largely ignoring society, waiting for the day when someone inevitably catches proof of the supernatural on video and brings supernatural beings into the spotlight. Her solitary existence is shaken when murder victims are found, killed in the style of Aztec sacrifices. As she is the prime suspect, she's forced to investigate and prove her innocence.

I enjoyed the themes of the work, her struggle to stay human even though everything in her nature wants her to rip people's hearts out on top of pyramid. Mesoamerican religion and history isn't really taught here in German schools, so that was a nice change, too. Also it had a fascinating chapter, where a Professor of Mesoamerican history sat down with a young woman and unknowingly had a conversation about religion, identity, and culture of a time period she actually lived through.

*** I read most of it, but could not really enjoy it due to some worldbuiling/setting aspects:

(It's been a while, so I might misremember some details.)

- The world feels incredibly small.

  - We are told that this is a world in which all the myths are true. But we introduced to only a few characters in a single city. You can pinpoint the culprit way before any incriminating evidence is presented, just because there are no other possible suspects. There is just no sense that anything interesting exists beyond this city and a handful of people.

- The supernatural powers are very weak. Mere gimmicks for the most part.

  - A ghost or a monster of ancient mythology, you are probably better off with a gun and a couple of grenades than trying to rely on their magic in combat. Spiky stone forearms, exploding hummingbirds or werecoyotes are not really more threatening than a mob hitman.

- A couple of backyard rituals, or even just the exposure of the supernatural to a wider portion of the public can end the age of man and usher in a new age of magic.

  - This has been so for centuries and is a stable state of affairs. Somehow. This is despite the fact that the enforcement of the secrecy of the supernatural ranges from incredibly ad-hoc to non-existent.

- Relating to the previous point, it is noted in the story that the proliferation of smart phones will reveal the supernatural to the public and usher in a new age of magic soonish anyway. So the whole central struggle seems a bit pointless.

** I figured it out when I started reading The Nothing Mage by Nixia on RR. The things this story has that I want right now are:

A world where magic is commonplace

A world where efforts to understand that magic have been undertaken, with the attempts making enough progress such that the magic system is relatively hard (as opposed to soft magic) by the time the story takes place. This is why I thought people on this subreddit might have good recommendations.

A main character who has a unique trait that makes them able to do unexpected things with magic (greater versatility, greater power, quicker at learning, whatever) and makes sense in the magic system, it isn't just them being the chosen one or whatever. I really like this about The Nothing Mage. Basically magic is like EM radiation and the main character's mana is at an extremely high frequency and low amplitude, making it nearly a straight line, so he can copy other kinds of mana by bending his nearly straight mana into any wave.

That main character begins relatively untrained at magic and a solid part of the story involves them progressing in skill/capacity

I think that so far, the only stories that I have read that have all of these things are Mother of Learning, The Nothing Mage, and the Mage Errant books. These are also the stories I've read recently that I've enjoyed the most, so I definitely think I've found a genre of fantasy that I really like. Now I just need to find more stories that meet it! Any recommendations for someone who likes these things in fantasy? Also, I don't care too much about the quality of the writing so long as the worldbuilding is interesting and the dialogue isn't completely inane, so feel free to recommend lesser known webfictions or books.

For example, I find the beginning of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Amy]] to be unreadable, while the story overall is excellent.

Regarding genre, I personally dislike horror and worm/MLP fanfics, but maybe others will find such recommendations useful, so anything goes.

I've delved in the depths of many fanfiction or original fiction sites (SB, SV, FF.net, RR, AH, TopWebFiction-even QQ, Anonkun and FimFiction with careful search filters) over the years, and it seems this is the one whose search function I just can't tackle.

It follows a rather headstrong girl who grew up muggle, and is invited to a wizarding school. I'd say the writing is better than canon, and I find Alexandra a more interesting protagonist too. Wouldn't call it /rational/, but the worldbuilding makes more sense than most magical worlds.

Right now the series is on book five, where each book contains a separate schoolyear, but also contributes to a larger plot more than each HP book did. In total it's more than a million words, so you'll have enough to dig through.

****** Definitely not wildbow levels (circa pact anyway). spoilers It's kinda a downward spiral. She gets screwed by the system (and fate) repeatedly. She very often overcomes problems by strategies that just cause bigger, slightly delayed problems, or sacrifice the unique advantages her efforts have earned for ephemeral gains (she's really not very careful or rational here, and has a bias for taking action even when sitting back would clearly be better. It makes her an exciting protagonist, but also sometimes annoying -- less so than eg Harry Potter though). For example look at the description of the newest book which succinctly describes how we last left off seven years ago. "Expelled from Charmbridge Academy, wandless, and fated to die..." Admittedly she doesn't really let this get her down, which makes it readable, but I found it a bit depressing.

Pretty much all of her problems are caused by her impulsiveness and lack of forward thinking or planning, and she often survives just by the skin of her teeth due to the intervention of a more powerful figure or sheer luck.

You could claim it's unrealistic that she doesn't learn from her mistakes, or not quickly enough, but I'd have to disagree. Kids sometimes /are/ that stubborn and difficult to reign in. Add to that that most of the time, her disobeying didn't only get her punishments but also tangible benefits, and it's easy to see why she keeps acting like she does.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]], currently 760+ English translated chapters and nearly 400 chapters ahead in original Chinese.

It's certainly "alternative", considering it's a translated original work from a non-English author. If you can stomach through the sometimes questionable word choices by the translator, it has an excellent overarching plot with many cinematic moments that transcends language barriers.

The work also stars one of my favourite rationalist MCs, someone who makes logical inferences in his head that you can follow along with like a "Level 2 Intelligent" character as described by [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]]. I've been recommending this work constantly here.

A bit of a random one:

You know forum mafia/werewolf? Where there's ~10 players, 3 are bad guys, and you have to vote each other out, night powers, plot, etc?

I've been playing it on the xkcd forums with a group of about ~7-8 regulars who are very enthusiastic... and then the xkcd forum has been down for 3-4 months and will probably be down forever, as new signups to the forum broke about 2 years ago and it was unlinked from xkcd.com at about the same time.

So now the 7-8 of us want to find a forum where we can play mafia: we don't really care what the forum is for (a hungarian soccer team fan forum? sure thing, as long as they play mafia in English!). We don't particularly want to join mafiascum or any of the really big mafia forums, we are hoping for something with O(10-50) active users as we liked the small community feel of xkcd. Because forums seem to be withering away in general, we know that we'd have welcomed an influx of 7-8 new plays a year ago, so the ideal would be for a smallish forum to be equally excited to make some new friends/players. But we're not fussy.

That's essentially what the xkcd forum became, and people got new jobs, had kids, I went on a long holiday, etc and we stopped having the number of people we needed for a fun game. It's hard to play when you can only get 7 players; I'd love to play in a 25 player game again, which are tons of fun but the xkcd forum hadn't been able to support that for like 5 years. So yeah, the problem was also attrition and not having new people coming on.

The online mafia games we played were really excellent: we used lots of stuff I found really innovative, with plotting and tons of interesting flavour text and a bunch of creative powers.

It's different to in person, because you analyse peoples' posts, and you can go back in time and find things from past game Days. So it's a more analytical game. It also allows some really strange and fun powers. I highly recommend it!
