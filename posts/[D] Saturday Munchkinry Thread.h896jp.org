Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

If 100$ appears in your hand every time an untruth is directed at you, you have the ability to be an actual lie detector. I think you could probably make money with this even if you /lost/ 100$ with each lie.

On second thought the $100 per lie might not be a safe option. I'm constantly in denial of many things, and that could be considered lying to myself, so I could potentially drown in all the money that constantly appears.

** Faith.

You can believe whatever you want, and when you believe, you really believe it, in the deepest and strongest way possible. You can create the exact description of what you want to believe in your mind and then you confirm the belief with the snap of fingers, and next second you really believe it. You just rewrite your brain and memories to think it's true and act on it.

For example, you can make yourself believe that you just had the perfect day of your life, or that you just returned from Moon trip, anything.

Of course, you can't gain any outside knowledge this way.

Would you use this power, and if yes, how? Would you try to use it to attain happines? Success? Knowledge?

*** Can I get rid of the false belief after I'm done? If so, there are a few useful applications here in being a better liar or becoming more self confident in situations where that is a useful trait.

If you can't get rid of it though, that stuff becomes a dangerous double edged knife.

If it is irreversible and there are ways to verify that you used your powers, people could force you to do a value handshake. So if that is an option, you might be better off making yourself forget you have this power in the first place.

As for using it for ignorance is bliss style happiness: Nope, not happening. You live in reality whether you like it or not, closing your eyes doesn't make a bad picture worse, etc.

The criteria doesn't really matter at that point, so you'd probably want to pick something that doesn't drive humanity into weird directions on its own; and in that case, it depends on how the criteria works. If you picked "height", would be recalculated at every moment? Like, would kids have to grow into their control?

They cut cleanly through every demographic, from age to race to religion to nationality. The only notable pattern is that ASPD accounts for 1.5% of men versus 0.5% of women. Although in part that may be because women with ASPD get misdiagnosed with Bipolar or Borderline Personality Disorder instead of ASPD.

/Everything/ in psychology is ultimately rooted in biology. You are a machine. So am I. You are saying "It's their brain that makes them evil!" as if that means /anything/. They can't be reformed. They can't be treated. They can't be convinced to behave. When a dog gets rabies you don't argue about whether the dog is to blame, you put it down before it can hurt anyone.

There are two interesting places where people with ASPD are overrepresented: Prison and high level leadership positions in business, churches and politics. They are 1% of the population and account for a /majority/ of violent crime convictions, including rape and murder.

There is no salvaging them. If you believe otherwise you should read up on mental illness in general and cluster B personality disorders in particular. Psychiatrists won't even touch ASPD, even the ones who will try to help with the other cluster B disorders.

Slippery slope arguments are generally not very useful.

Schizophrenics have a hell of a bad time, but you'll find a much higher proportion of them in the homeless population than in prison. Some of them do also manage to live full lives with the help of medication and therapy. No such tools exist for managing ASPD.

Autism doesn't compare at all. The worst you can say about severe cases is that they have low quality of life and cost money because they can't take care of themselves. I have plenty of sympathy for people whose worst crime is costing society money.

The lat part is blatantly untrue. The main motivation of sociopaths is not to cause harm for harm sake, but selfishness. There is plenty of examples (I would even argue that it is the majority) where the actions of a sociopath can be aligned with the good of society, at least in important aspects, in a way that benefits the sociopath AND us.

Sociopathy is not cartoon Evilness. Its simply pathological lack of emotional empathy. A trait that is pretty damaging in regular relationships with other people, but harmless or even useful in some jobs and lifestyles.

I mean, what would be the harm of a sociopath being say, a researched in far away Arctic outpost? Or a wilderness ranger? Or a lonely farmer who only contacts people once in a while?

Hell, off the top of my head I can think of countless jobs in which sociopathy would be a bonus! Spec Ops, CIA black-bag operatives, spies, bomber pilots, executors, debt collectors, bounty hunters etc, all those people would BENEFIT from being devoid of empathy, since the whole point of their job is to cause destruction and suffering. A normal person is not going to be able to drone-bomb a preschool because there are terrorists hiding in its basement. A normal person would not be able to give someone fatal injection and then go home happy. A normal person will not be able to storm a cartel hideout and shoot 20 people at point blank. But all those things need doing from the perspective of utilitarian greater good.

You also mention that a lot of leaders are sociopaths. Which is completely understandable, since pragmatic ruthlessness is a requirement for effective leadership. A good boss sometimes has to fire someone and thus destroy their life. A politician often decides to cut funding from something, causing thousands of people to die, sink into poverty or homelessness. A general sometimes sacrifices a city full of civilians to win a war.

Basically, a good leader is someone who with unshaking confidence would sacrifice 10 people to save 100, or sacrifice 100 if this choice has a greater long term practical utility.

If you get rid of sociopaths/psychopaths somehow, then each and every of those problems listed above becomes an Outside Context Problem for your civilization.

#+end_quote

This seems rather unfair to be honest. People can't really change their internal desires, They can't just arbitrarily decide to want something or not, since a lot of that is very much innate. Otherwise people undergoing torture would just adjust their internal desires to desire being tortured and enjoy the torture.

Furthermore, just because someone desires something doesn't mean they will act on that desire. Desires can overrule one another. For example, I desire eating lots of snacks, but I also desire not becoming overweight, so I use the latter desire to curb my snacking desire and go on a diet instead.

In the same way, someone who desires harm upon others could rationally recognize that such desires are harmful to not just others but themselves as well. Then they can use their desire to avoid self-harm to curb that harmful desire and never act on it.

On the other side of the table, there are also people who desire other's wellbeing, but desire their own wellbeing /more,/ and so regularly take actions that hurt others for their own self benefit. Under the chosen criteria, since these people /do/ care for others, they won't suffer your aging curse at all despite regularly performing evil deeds.

All in all, this is a really terrible metric to use.

I think some of the people in this sub underestimate how much damage bad people do to those around them. There are no harmless Narcissists. There are people who like themselves a lot. I'm one of them. I bet this community attracts others like me. But /Narcissism/, as in NPD, is /never/ harmless. These are people who /constantly/ abuse and manipulate others. They don't think there is anything wrong with them, and almost all psychiatrists hate working with them because they are all manipulative assholes who will pretend to get better and switch back to monster mode the second they are out of sight. ASPD is the same but worse. Therapy is /actively detrimental/ in ASPD, because the 'patients' will just absorb the techniques to become better manipulators.

Seriously read up on cluster B personality disorders. These are people who are /massively/ detrimental to everyone around them.

And like I said elsewhere in the comment tree, switching from internal motivations to results gained is a terrible idea because it lets the worst assholes game the system. If Superman went around saving lives Monday to Saturday and spent Sundays raping children, he would probably still have a big net positive impact on society, while someone of less than average intelligence in a wheelchair would fall behind because they just can't operate on the same scale as others.

Then your interpretation does not match the metric specified: "scales with your indifference or desire for other people's suffering." would certainly exclude people who are averse to causing suffering but do it anyway, and include people who love to cause suffering but restrain themselves from doing so.

#+end_quote

A stillborn Narcissist is harmless. A Narcissist in a coma is harmless. A Narcissist that has been shot into space beyond any other person's reach is harmless. Absolutes rarely exist. What makes things even worse in this case is that many people would hide their Narcissism, so we could hardly get a representative sample of Narcissists to determine the expected harm of a Narcissist. There could be countless secret Narcissists out there that have learned to curb their evil desires and so were never recognized as Narcissists. For example:

#+begin_quote
  they are all manipulative assholes who will pretend to get better and switch back to monster mode the second they are out of sight
#+end_quote

This sentence in fact convinces me that there could be harmless Narcissists. Because the fact that they can pretend to get better while in sight indicates that they /can/ curb their harmful desires. Naturally, the idea of being "in sight" differs from person to person. You could be "in sight" at any moment, since hidden cameras are a thing that exists. So a Narcissist that thinks he is constantly "in sight" could pretend to be better all the time, and effectively cause the same amount of "harm" as the healthy person he is pretending to be. Such a Narcissist would, in keeping up the pretense constantly, never be diagnosed with Narcissism, and be as harmless as any normal person, and so you would never find them in your sample of known Narcissists (look up survivorship bias), and yet the chosen metric will kill them even though they have not harmed anyone. I find that quite cruel and unfair.

Now, I do agree that there are /some/ (a minority? a majority? who knows?) Narcissists that are major problems and spread harm everywhere, but the chosen metric will not accurately target them. The potential for collateral damage in this scenario is immense. Countless innocents could die, and you wouldn't even get all of the bad guys. Personally I find the suggested metric as offensive as suggesting the entire Middle East should be nuked to defeat terrorists. The collateral damage would be immense and it would not be effective!

#+begin_quote

Indeed such a system would not be perfect, and allow people to game it. But in my opinion it would still be far more effective and produce far less collateral damage.

Also, since we are giving out superpowers anyway, why not just give people some form of clairvoyance? Let people see what actions other people have taken, then no one would be able to hide their wrongdoings, and there would be actual intelligent minds able to decide whether something is a wrongdoing rather than a system that can be gamed. Certainly, this would sacrifice privacy, but that is a far far far cheaper cost than literal lives.

Or, if you want to take a harsher approach, then since apparently blessing people with suck is an option, why not just bless people with powerful empathy? Give them supernatural empathy that overrules all their evil desires. It could still be considered a horrendous violation of people's minds, but that's at least way better than killing them.

The obvious solution here is to not use the *net* impact. Just consider the amount of harm done, with no subtractions. Why was *net* even considered here? The law doesn't allow people to commit murder no matter how much good they have done or will do.

There is no psychiatrist on Earth who would willingly date a Narcissist, or even be friends with one, or see the people they care about do so.

I would be happy with this, although the rules set by OP do not let us give everyone equal strength in the power. Even without supernatural powers, I do believe the world would become a significantly better place if we expanded from making some cops wear body cams to making more and more powerful people wear bodycams. Starting with high level regulators and politicians, but I would quite happily expand to religious leaders, bureaucrats, teachers etc. Privacy is overrated. It might seem scary to let others know what kind of porn you enjoy, and we might want to allow for windows where you can turn the cam off, but if everyone was forced to always have a cam on, I do think the world would be a lot better than it is today. Barring dictators, etc. Maybe don't start by implementing this in China.

That's fair, although the other people I've talked to in the comment tree have talked about net impact, so that's what I went along with. If we change the power to get stronger the more deliberate/indifferent damage you do to others, then that leaves a hypothetical path for cruel people to pretend to be nice all their lives. Although, again, I don't think you realize how impossible that would still be for them.

I remember a professor giving a lecture some time back who talked about a study where they 'substituted' for the teacher for school children of various ages. They were studying how kids reacted to different kinds of rules changes. First they told the kids they were thinking about making it so you don't have to put your hand up today before you talk. Then they asked the kids, if they /did/ make that rules change, would it be ok to talk without raising your hand? Essentially every kid agreed it would then be ok to just talk. Then the experimenters said they were thinking of removing the rule against hitting each other, stealing each other's food and items, etc. They asked the kids, if they removed those rules, would it be ok to do those things now? The vast majority still thought it would absolutely not be ok to do it, because it still hurt other kids, regardless of what the rules were. But a tiny percentage of kids, /exclusively/ kids with behavioural problems, thought that of course it would be ok if the rules said it was ok. They didn't see a qualitative difference between rules against talking without permission and rules against causing bodily harm for fun. These differences persist all the way to adulthood, the only thing that changes is that the people who don't see the difference learn to pretend and give the 'right' answers when asked.

A few years back I was part of a few different mental health forums and a discord. It was fascinating to see how the chat rooms and boards differed for people with different issues and disorders. Lots of people struggle with severe mental illness but still want to be a force for good to the people around them. They feel terrible about having lost control and said something hurtful to a friend, etc. And then you look at the ASPD boards, where they trade tips on how to fuck with the normies, get away with crimes, trade gore pics and complain about how limited and overpriced the supply of real torture videos is on the dark web.

Narcissists by and large aren't /on/ these forums. Those with ASPD know they have it and don't care, which is arguably a lot worse, but people with NPD seem to mostly think the diagnosis is a fake illness invented by jealous psychiatrists who wish they could be as cool of an apex predator as them.

Alright, I concede that I am not a professional in this subject and so may not really understand what NPD means. Reading up on wikipedia/random internet pages has not helped me to understand why there cannot be a harmless Narcissist, and no other sources are within easy reach.

So, although I am highly suspicious, I concede that there could be a definition of NPD that precisely contains exactly those individuals that are deliberately harmful to others plus or minus certain caveats. But then this precise definition is what should have been chosen as the metric, instead of the current innate desires statement that does not seem anywhere near as airtight.

#+begin_quote

Then I am much reassured. Please look for such 'peaceful' alternatives whenever possible, because mass killings really really should be the last resort. I'm not so much of an idealist that I would think killing is never the answer, but I do think it rarely is the best or only answer.

#+begin_quote
  although the rules set by OP do not let us give everyone equal strength in the power.
#+end_quote

That's simple enough to work around. Even if the OP denies any metric for which every person is equal (like how many bodies they have or whether they exist), proper randomization can often still get the job done.

For example, define the metric as how close a person is to being conceived (sperm meeting egg) on an even planck time since the big bang. A planck time is something like 5e-44seconds and so is pretty much impossible for anyone to know or discriminate upon. Furthermore, there is no way to influence what planck time a person is conceived on, so this should be more or less completely random and should result in roughly 50% of any population (regardless of location/gender/race/any and all groupings) having strong supernatural clairvoyance that would let them catch any wrongdoers.

#+begin_quote
  then that leaves a hypothetical path for cruel people to pretend to be nice all their lives. Although, again, I don't think you realize how impossible that would still be for them.
#+end_quote

If they have very bad luck, their remaining lifespan could be measured in seconds, in which case pretending to be nice for the rest of their lives is incredibly easy. Naturally this is a rather extreme case, but it does indicate that pretending to be nice for the rest of their lives isn't absolutely impossible: it just has probability inversely proportional to their remaining lifespan.

The anecdotes about Narcissism were interesting, but I still worry about survivorship bias. It could be that only some bad Narcissists posted those messed up comments, while other (possibly harmless) Narcissists resisted their impulses and did not participate. Though I concede that this possibility could be precluded by the precise definition of NPD that I am unaware of.

However, specifically for the religious folks you mention, the desire for 'divine punishment' or 'god's judgement' would count just as much as normal hate. It doesn't distinguish between "Stone him because he's gay" or "Stone her for not being a virgin," or "Stone him because he shot up a mall." If you hold ill will toward a group and want to see them suffer, you get docked points and fall down the rankings. Naturally, even the least cruel people can be expected to hold ill will /sometimes/, but it's graded on a curve. You only fall down the rankings if you are /more/ cruel than someone else.

We can tweak the system all day long. But as I imagined it, hateful religious folks don't get any kind of pass because of the religion part. If such a system went into effect, religious people full of hate would die off and religious people full of love would remain. You'd probably end up with about the same proportions of Christians, Muslims, Hinduists etc as we have today.

If people are punished for *INDIFFERENCE* to the suffering of others, then they would be incapable of not acting to save others, even against their best interest, or if the suffering of the other is prerequisite to their happiness. You are basically training people to be constant martyrs if they do not want to die prematurely. Everyone who is not suicidal is forced to be an "altruism machine" 24/7.

Absurdly, it would slowly train people to neglect their own suffering and desires, which will make them more in need of being saved by others, which accelerates the frantic need to practice altruism.

You are basically creating a positive feedback loop between obsessive martyr behavior and rising levels of personal suffering, caused by self-sacrifice.

After several generations pass, and the only living people are those who were always martyrs, there would be no free will for practical purposes. Everyone would basically enslave themselves to the cause of "suffering prevention" 24/7, neglecting everything that makes them a separate person.

2. Mental Admin Privileges: you can browse, edit, and work with your mind as if it ran on Linux. You have complete control over your software, and to some degree, hardware. Your memories are recorded as various files (text, video etc) and skills are applications. You can also do the same for other people, including copying, editing, swapping, storing, merging or deleting their minds.EDIT: the power on others works on touch, the mind is structured to mimic a computer system perfectly.

3. Thinking in Portals. You can create an infinite number of portals of any size. You can place a portal in any place you know, from RL or from a picture. The edges of the portals are infinitely sharp. A portal can lead to any other portal forming a gate, from one portal to several (thus, a duplication device) or from several to one (matter fusion device).

  Thinking in Portals. You can create an infinite number of portals of any size. You can place a portal in any place you know, from RL or from a picture. The edges of the portals are infinitely sharp. A portal can lead to any other portal forming a gate, from one portal to several (thus, a duplication device) or from several to one (matter fusion device).

it's totally flawed, even with two portals. What about putting a frame with portal into another portal?

​

also, just two portals with conservation of momentum would allow you to create a free energy device (for example, put one portal on floor and second on ceiling and you get infinite fall from which you can harvest energy from)

I would say various shenanigans would happen with any matter inserted into the portal pair, since it would double on itself. Possibly exotic matter fusion?
