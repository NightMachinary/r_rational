Most rational stories --- and especially rationalist --- stories feature protagonists that would generally be considered heroes. I'm bored of that, and want something a little different. After all, rationality isn't inherently a force for good. It's a competence multiplier, and can serve any motivations. I'd prefer protagonists who would be considered evil/immoral (but psychologically realistic villains and not psychopath caricatures) or are amoral as both offer differing motivations that I think would make for an interesting story.

Rational stories preferred, bonus points if it's rationalist, but if no rational(ist) stories fit the bill, I'll take other stories as well as long as the MC is psychologically realistic.

I've read and loved [[https://fictionhub.io/story/the-metropolitan-man/][The Metropolitan Man]]. It fits the bill (anyone looking for something like this should check it out).

​

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/weaver-nine-worm-fanfic-au.289395/][Weaver Nine]] : Jack Slash and Taylor occupy each other's canon positions in the story, Jack is still a psychopath. I think it should be noted that despite the synopsis of this story, its primary focus is a big Endbringer Fight.

******** I wouldn't say Taylor is immoral or amoral, precisely. But she is a traumatized teenager, with all the limitations of a traumatized teenager. She makes abrupt and drastic decisions, often without regard for probable long-term consequences, because she frequently can't see past her own anger, fear, or pride. She is, in short, a very flawed hero, and the "doing the wrong things for the right reasons" tagline is IMO at least a little misleading.

​

She isn't outright immoral in the sense that she isn't deliberately, consistently, and flagrantly antisocial in her long-term goals. She doesn't hurt people for fun, for example, and perceives all her actions as morally justified (as did Hitler, for that matter). But I don't see how a deliberately antisocial character would be especially interesting--it sounds like the psychologically unrealistic sociopaths you say you're avoiding. And despite what I said about bad decisions, she makes excellent use of her powers on a tactical level. She's far from stupid. Just impetuous and angry.

​

And if that doesn't do it for you, much of the supporting cast is differently immoral.

*** I think 'amoral' is fair considering he really lacks any kind of deontological restraint. You can say he's an utilitarian but frankly even then his risk perception is kind of... skewed? He just /decides/ that Superman is a threat so dire he warrants murdering innocents to stop and then has no more qualms about it, regardless of what happens as a consequence of his own and Superman's actions. He never really questions his own judgement or future predictions. And remember it's stated that he did have criminal friendships and contacts and a murky past, so it's not like he ever was much above dirty means, and that was back when he wasn't fighting for some kind of greater good, but just to get rich.

** To scratch The Metropolitan Man itch: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8700173/1/Lex-Luthor-Triumphant][Lex Luthor Triumphant]] by GuapoMendez.

For more DC universe: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-better-class-of-criminal-dc-si.394632/][A Better Class of Criminal]] is more funny than rational. Follows a self-inserted, slightly insane villain in post-apocalyptic Gotham. He runs for mayor obviously. If that wasn't enough, he has Moriarty in his head.

[[http://www.ironteethserial.com][The Iron Teeth]] a rationalist story by [[/u/dsraider]]. Follows a morally oblivious goblin who can't understand why any action against his own or his master's interest might be wrong.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1534683/1/Harry-s-Madness][Harry's Madness]] by SilverLocke980. What if Harry snapped and become darkness that rivals Voldemort himself.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luck_of_Barry_Lyndon][The Luck of Barry Lyndon]] by William Makepeace Thackeray (love this name). If you are not a fan of 1800s writing, then at least watch [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072684/][Kubrick's amazing adaption]]. While the roguish narrator remains unreliable, he made him more sympathetic.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita][Lolita]] by Vladimir Nabokov. A well-liked and charming man marries a woman doesn't sound villainous at all. You've been duped, he was a pedo all along. There is a reason we don't meet young Adolfs or young Lolitas on the street anymore. This book is the reason for the latter. It was also [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056193/][adapted by Kubrick]].

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prague_Cemetery][The Prague Cemetery]] is Umberto Eco's attempt to write the most despicable character he can. Follows a racist, misogynistic spy and a forger who deals with his political opponents and participates in nineteenth-century Europe events.

This short story may not fit perfectly, but I'll include it nonetheless: A Study in Emerald by Neil Gaiman. No link here. Better to go blind. Trust me.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora][The Lies of Locke Lamora]] and the Gentleman Bastard Series by Scott Lynch. Ocean's 11 in medieval times. While probably rationalist, I read them for the banter.

MC is literally a necromancer king in his own kingdom by the end of the first book. He might not necessarily be evil - but the rest of the world treats him like a villain, he regularly commits virtual mass murder, ritualistic murder and psychological warfare. Later in the story he's even put on unofficial trial in the real world for it. Lot's of political intrigue and diving into the mechanics of the magic and the world, not very deeply but definitely enough to tickle that munchkinry trope, at one point the game nerfs him and his abilities specifically because he exploited it so bad.

****** Honestly, cat is an ally to her Country, then her morals and then whoever the guy with the biggest stick is. I think that she really is a good person, even if her goodness is focused almost entirely towards blind Nationalism.

Her morals are pretty dubious on most days as well, though I think if some had to pin her down on them it would come down to the fact that in her point of view human (yes specifically human) life should not be given material value, this core moral has shaped the direction she has grown in through the entire series, it is why she Hates Praes so much, even if she doesn't hate the Praesi as a whole, the fundamental basis of their culture, human sacrifice, goes against her at her core.

Then there is the fact that she tends to side with whoever has the biggest stick, starting with Praes, and going into spoilers probably best left out of this thread.

I find her a fascinating character, and am baffled when she is called a Mary Sue, or even called Irrational, Cat is exceedingly rational /for the logic that her world runs on/, this logic is counterintuitive to us, and she has been getting better and better at it as the series goes.

Even if we see their motivations as rational, for most of the known world they're villains /and/ they deliberately exploit that. From the viewpoint of basically the rest of the world she's absolutely a villain.

I'd call her a villain protagonist rather than an antihero.

Edit: You've convinced me she's not "amoral". But now I'm wondering: is it possible to write a villain protagonist without either alienating the readers or showing how their morality justifies their villainous acts?

She does have an ingroup vs outgroup mentality, but that's been the norm for most of human history (and arguably still is).

I'm on my phone and it won't let me link to the comment but search for

anyone read any good story with a competent amoral/evil protagonist? I just read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/][Blood and Chaos]] and look for something with a main character like Jack(preferably less crazy) who uses science and munchkins everything mainly for his own gain and doesn't really

It reads like a wizard onepunch-man. Pretty great.

** The comic /Irredeemable/ did, in my never humble opinion, a far better job than /Watchmen/ in portraying what happens when a superhero gets disillusioned in the world and starts pursuing his own agenda.

*** It's about as non-rational as a story can get though, fair warning.

Also meanders and drags (into a terrible ending). It feels like the author didn't have a clear story in mind, they just kept writing until someone made them stop.

***** I'm afraid I won't be able to be very specific. It's been a while; I remember the overall impression it left on me more than the details.

It wasn't made clear what various powers could actually do, or what powerful entities or factions existed in the setting. So there was a regular stream of deus ex machina, and you'd never know in advance whether a plan was likely to work.

****** Gotcha. What stuck with me was people seeming to have realistic reactions to things, and that they explained Not-Superman's actual powers, and then a great justification for why the resident genius hero never figured it out.

******* It's possible the negative feelings I had about the ending tainted my memories of the rest of the work. On reading the Wikipedia plot summary, it doesn't seem too bad.

******** Yeah, I can see that happening :) I didn't hate the ending, I thought it was cute in a way, but yeah it was clearly nonsensical. Didn't impact my enjoyment mostly because it didn't feel like it mattered to the story at all. Like you could tear out the last couple pages or whatever of every copy and no one would notice, they'd just assume it ended more ambiguously.

*** As much as I love that series (and the sequel, The Completionist), I really don't think you can describe Cal as rational. Intelligent, sure. Ruthless, definitely. Amoral, absolutely.

But, I mean, distortion cat and mushroom parasite plague.

Rational, not really.

**** True, I was stuck on the word "amoral".

I just read the Completionist series a couple days ago, and quite enjoyed it. Now I'm in the midst of the Threadbare series, and enjoying it.

**** To be fair to Cal, a lot of his mistakes are from his own experimentation. He's got no reference frame for what is rational beyond what his Wisp says. So his earlier mistakes are at least understandable.

However by the later books when he does have an understanding of the world he's not rational I agree. Hell, his original is sometimes more rational when it comes to the utilization of his available resources.
