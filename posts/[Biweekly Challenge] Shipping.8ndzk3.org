[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8k1avm/biweekly_challenge_memoir/][Last time]], the prompt was "Memoir". Our winner is [[/u/9adam4]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8k1avm/biweekly_challenge_memoir/dzc22u9/]["Verity"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/9adam4]]!

** This Time

   :END:
This time will be [[/u/vi_fi]]'s choice, *Shipping*. "There are two obvious directions into which one could take that prompt. The first is to write shipping fanfic, in which case I would prefer them to be as rational as possible (as an additional restriction to a really non-specific prompt). Also, keeping things SFW would be appropriate for a biweekly challenge. The second option with the prompt is to write about shipping, i.e. with characters that ship, or are shipped, and a story that revolves around that fact. (A wildcard third option is to write about naval transportation of goods, or all of the above.)" Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit. If you are writing something NSFW, please tag it. Also, if you're doing fanfic that includes spoilers, please mark those too.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, June 13th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be "Anniversary", as the first challenge was posted on 6/17/15, meaning that the challenges have been running for three years now. What direction you want to take this prompt is up to you; anniversaries are normally about commemorating, honoring, or remembering something. [[https://futureoflife.org/2015/10/11/happy-petrov-day/][Petrov Day]] would be a good example, though I think stories with a theme of remembrance, reflection, etc. could all fit well within the theme. *Also, as a special one-time thing, this challenge will have a cash prize of $50.* (If you win, I'll message you.)

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 6/13*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8ne2gp/challenge_companion_shipping/][is available here.]]

*** Very good. It's a classic ratfic in the sense that it makes characters in the source material more rational and extrapolates from there. Also, you have a short discussion of a related mathematical problem, which is also very [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Very solid work.

I admire the many ways in which you chose to troll me. For example, you went with the "naval transport" choice of shipping, which is the troll choice -- and then, to troll me further, you added the slightest hint of an actual ship, and you chose to ship the only two characters with speaking roles in the original Oglaf strip, who (in the original) are as far from being a ship as they possibly could be. And you chose Oglaf of all things for a challenge which I wanted to remain SFW, and then you actually pulled off an SFW Oglaf fic? Got to respect that Chutzpah.

**** Trolling was not the purpose! When I first read the comic, I couldn't help but think the situation could have been handled better. I jumped on the opportunity to write a story about it.

Okay, including a hint of a ship between the characters was a little bit of a troll.

Set in Warhammer 40k universe, it's a shipping of Abaddon the Despoiler with a Grey Knight Brother-Captain Monroe.

For those not in the loop concerning Warhammer 40k lore and memes, here is the relevant dramatis personae, with pictures and wiki pages:

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Abaddon][Abaddon the Despoiler]], Warmaster of Chaos. Current leader of chaos. Failed to conquer a single planet 12 times in a row.

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Creed][Ursarkar E. Creed.]] Tactical genious. Possibly a giant MECHA in disguise.

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Cadia][Cadia.]] Planet situated right in front of an enormous portal into hell. Creed commands the defenses there, Abaddon constantly fails to conquer it.

[[https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Grey_Knights][Grey knights.]] If you know what a "doublewitch" means in HPMOR, basically that. Take superhuman space warriors, hike them up to 11, and get double-super demon fighting space warriors.

Honestly the entire thing is a combination of rational world/universe building, literal shipping and also "shipping" and also ways in which characters can misonstrue and ship and again attempts to play the characters rational to each other.

Honestly my story is essentially built on this premise right down to what I chose to make the acronym of the story.

The whole thing is a massive pun on the concept.

**** I believe it's happened once or maybe twice. It's heavily discouraged, though there are some edge cases where I might allow it. The problem is that such works aren't actually responses to the prompts, and they're then put in competition with works that /were/ written for the prompt, usually over the course of a week or two.

I do encourage people to rewrite or revamp stories for the challenge, if this is the kick they needed, especially if those stories were non-winning entries for a different challenge. But the spirit of the challenge is sort of about getting people to write, and I don't think that purpose is served too well by allowing long-running stories with some amount of clout to come in.

(I'll leave your comment where it is, if you win by votes, I'll maybe figure out some sort of secondary prize or something.)
