** It seems somehow unfair when we readers: (a) know who Superman is, (b) get multiple perspectives, and (c) aren't under whatever mental influence Krypton provides.

I love it.

** It is a really fun story. I am actually really curious about how the problems will be solved, which isn't normal for a story like this where a human is fighting a god.

** Two days on and I'm actually finding myself impatient for the next chapter. Any time I see Superman referenced anywhere I get a tiny jolt of excitement as my brain subconsciously makes the connection before I realise what it's excited about and that it'll be days before the next one and will continue to be a week between each one...

Congratulations I guess!

** When Clark was talking to Lois you then said "superman said" instead of Clark, otherwise fantastic as always

**** On my personal comments, I like the point of view of Lex, but I think by changing Lois's inner thoughts you bias us further against Superman which I think is, perhaps not unfair, but overdone. I think that Lois, or someone in this fiction, should have a differing view from Lex instead of it being an echo chamber. If Lois was similar to canon Lois we would get the contrast of Lex and Lois's opinion on Superman instead of both of them disliking him.

I mean it doesn't have to be Lois now that you've wrote her in like that but I think it better demonstrates Lex if he doesn't have like minded people as in the Superman comics, where all his points would still apply but he would be alone instead, even the people who meet superman disagreeing with him (because of course that doesn't change his points but it creates more of a likely scenario for people in that position), but of course I don't know your intention with the story but that's kind of my theory comments.

***** I think we're all used to Superman being the hero, for me its nice to have him act the same but for the story to emphasise the counterarguments.

Let Superman himself prove his goodness, if good he is, against all opposition, by his words and actions.

****** Sure that's reasonable too, I just hope there's more conflict in the future other than from superman who is a teensy bit of a position of bias when debating about the utility of himself.

** u/embrodski:

  I believe chemical agents were mentioned," he said. Radioactive and chemical too, though the person he was pretending to be didn't know that.
#+end_quote

Should the second "chemical" be something else? Biological maybe?

** u/embrodski:
#+begin_quote
  Clark looked to the ceiling, which was quickly becoming a universal sign that powerful ears might be watching.
#+end_quote

Probably ears + listening, or eyes + watching. Feels weird like this.

Also, I'm enjoying the hell out of this story!

*** You're definitely right, I updated it to be ears+listening. Thanks!
