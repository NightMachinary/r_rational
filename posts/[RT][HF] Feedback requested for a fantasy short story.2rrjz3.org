I have a short story out as a bit of a test piece for a fantasy novel I'm working on. I'd like for the novel to pass the rational fiction litmus test, so I'd appreciate knowing what works vs. what doesn't in the sample piece.

I know ~5500 words wasn't really enough to get a thorough grounding in the magical mechanics, and the plan is to get into more detail in the full version. That said, consider everything there up for comments or criticism.

The story, "Luck's Touch", can be found on [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3119456/chapters/6759845][AO3]] or [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3229480/1/Luck-s-Touch][fictionpress]]. Comments can be posted on either site or here, and are appreciated.

*Edit:* As is noted below, I am working in someone else's IP, which means I have limited influence regarding existing characters and locations. As a result, I am primarily interested in feedback geared toward characterization, storytelling style, problem solving, plotholes, logic breakdowns, and mechanics fumbling, etcetera. Essentially, if my storytelling skills aren't up to par, I'd like to see where. If I'm doing something right, I'd like to know what.

That said, I do welcome *all* feedback.


** I don't think you make a strong case for why risky robbery is the best choice for someone with superpowers. What in this world makes that a good idea? What does everyone else use these talents for, that this is a useful way to use a supposed prodigy?

Forget the main character: why does her noblewoman mentor need to run a criminal organization of such power and scope? Who is preventing them from simply ruling everything in the city? How badass are their enemies to prevent this? Is their organization into other illegal things? And why is what they do that isn't stealing still illegal, if they are that powerful?

These questions don't have to be answered, better if they aren't, but they should at least be /asked/ by an intelligent character, as the reader will certainly wonder about them. Though not needed, we're missing a character who, like the reader, doesn't know the setting. Someone to explain things to.

That isn't a requirement, though. But to me, that means everything should be explained as we go, instead of having an incomplete trope-filled infodump at the start. Do it Steven Brust style -- things happen and we learn the setting by the character moving through the world.

All that is why I think the setup itself fails the rational fic test, as it seems to be thievery for its own sake. Even if there is backstory explaining it, we don't see it here. The story, as presented, isn't very rational-fic-y. It seems to suggest that big magical-world cities have big magical thieves because that's how the tropes work. Those thieves have magical powers because of course they do. In the first few paragraphs, someone is literally named a villain and the head of the thieves' guild -- though possibly tongue-in-cheek, that naming is not obviously followed up on. There is no ambiguity there, no "or that's what the King thinks, which is why such an powerful woman is never invited to his galas."

So we've got thieves for their own sake and a villain because they are the leader of the thieves guild. That looks a lot like things declared as so because of plot, and evil vs good morality to make the protagonist more of a bad-girl antihero.

--------------

As for style, and getting back to that intro I so dislike, I would have preferred the story start at the gallery. Everything leading up to that was, in my opinion, obvious and rather boring details about things the reader has no interest in yet. I would start here:

#+begin_quote
  The gallery was remarkably underwhelming, for all Nalorian's boasting.
#+end_quote

That's your first paragraph. Action, an interesting setting, objectives the reader learns about as things happen, and elemental things like theft and fear of discovery being presented as fait accompli.

Once the world and the point of things are demonstrated, you could go back and show a training or testing montage. Better yet would be weaving those things into the narrative as the action happens. Hard, as you'd need to find the pauses in the action to put longer, more contemplative stuff in. But that stuff as intro is not good. It doesn't set the scene and it doesn't excite the reader.

Maybe that's where you could work in some thoughts of feeling trapped -- even though our protagonist has great power she can't escape her life of seemingly pointless crime. She doesn't understand why things are the way they are, and she feels powerless to escape her situation. Then she gets a strange magical dagger, one her mentor doesn't seem to know the properties of, and everything changes.

Now /that's/ a character arc in the making.

--------------

I'm not really interested in the usual Praise, Criticism, Positive Support structure these things usually go in, so I'll just say here that I didn't hate it. The dagger was, as it obviously should be, my favorite character, but it only appeared three-quarters of the way into the story. Boo. More dagger, please.

Back to more direct griping: I think sometimes the most interesting part of a paragraph is buried in the middle, making it hard to slide from one topic to the next. For example:

#+begin_quote
  “If I can't get the dagger, are you planning to try for it afterward?” I didn't want to be responsible for whatever deal Siyara was so smug about falling through. The difficulty of stealing an item after the target was alerted went up considerably, and though my aunt was famous for a reason, the insecurity of inexperience had me wondering if handing me the reins was wise.
#+end_quote

The character's motivation and an explanation of why they're asking is buried behind relatively uninteresting dialog. Maybe put that first, or on a new paragraph.

Overall, dialog is a little choppy in format. I know it is the style nowadays, and if your editor says it must be that way fine, but I say use goddamn dialog tags. Use:

#+begin_quote
  "Blah blah blah," I said.
#+end_quote

Just do it. Without tags, and with chunky paragraphs around them, it is very, very hard to read, at least for me.

--------------

Overall (here's the positive ending, I guess) I think you've got the ability to finish a complete and coherent story, which is like 80% of the job. Good. Keep up the writing.

** If I were looking along a bookshelf, essentially the challenge of a novel based on this story would be to do something to interrupt my sense of cliche, and to do it quickly.

*** Thank you for your response.

Is that sense of cliché from the lack of a synopsis here, the synopsis posted for the short story on the sites, or the story itself?

I can revise my description or post a hook of some sort here if you think it will help, and I'm open to suggestion if you feel there are overused tropes you'd like to call out. I can't, however, do much to change the basic premise of the story.

I don't know what this borrowed world is, and there are plenty of people who would find all this comforting, but basically all this stuff just kind of sounds like every other fantasy book, so if you want to appeal to anyone looking for something more than every other fantasy book you need something early on to indicate that it is something more than every other fantasy book. Indicate it with your tone or subvert a trope or do something to make it all your own rather than something that feels very borrowed.

***** Thanks for elaborating, I'm grateful for the feedback. As I am writing in someone else's IP, it's difficult to address the existing character and location names, pantheon, or genre, so it seems that this story might not be up your alley.

I'd definitely appreciate your opinion on my own solo IP when I have something to show for that project, as I think it contains unique spins on old concepts that might appeal to you more.

Thanks for your time!

******* This is written in the Shades of Venaya setting, which is owned by [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/new-years-book-update/][Andrew Rowe]]. I'm one of three writers, including Andrew, working on novels within this setting.

As a result, I am primarily interested in feedback geared toward characterization, storytelling style, problem solving, plotholes, logic breakdowns, and mechanics fumbling, as these are the elements that I have the greatest control over.
