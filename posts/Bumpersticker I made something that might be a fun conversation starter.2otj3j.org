** Hmm, apparently you are a brony or pegasister and are interested in AI research.

Why you are clearly a person with refined taste and I simply must get to know you better!

*** Eh, mostly trying to attract more interest into AI in my in-group of fellow BS and MS Computer Science students. There's a large crossover between our active CS students and our Bronies and Pegasisters club. But it was one of those ideas that I had to implement and share to reward my idea creation behavior. I still need to read EY's papers and Bolstrom's X-risk book, but I need to finish a paper on Manufacturing and Google glass first.
