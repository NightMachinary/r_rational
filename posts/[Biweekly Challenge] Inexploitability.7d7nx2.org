Next time, the challenge will be *Inexploitability*. [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/inexploitability][Inexploitability]] is the principle that if there is an easy way to do something obviously valuable, people should already be doing that thing. If you're writing fiction, and especially rational fiction, there should be a justification for why your character's method of taking over the world or exploiting the rules has not already been discovered, and "they're just that smart" is probably not good enough, at least if you want to display that intelligence on the page. More generally, inexploitability can also be applied to the real world; if someone offers you a scheme to get rich quick, you should view it with skepticism, because if it were easy, efficient markets (in the general sense of the term) would have already adjusted (though note that this is not universally true). Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, November 29th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be *Mimicry.* I'm leaving this relatively wide open to interpretation, though there are lots of canons and genres to draw on if you want to do fanfic, pastiche, or draw inspiration from somewhere. John Carpenter's /The Thing/ or the recent videogame /Prey/ might be good places to start, though "mimicry" has pretty wide bounds.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/29.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7d93qw/challenge_companion_inexploitability/][can be found here]].

Kept this idea in the back of my mind for a couple months, this is as good an opportunity as any, particularly if this cleans up my mental attic a bit.

*** Point of contention: the ideas given for getting rich from sideways gravity are not significant. One human's weight worth of acceleration applied to a truck or plane will matter so little it won't save much money at all. Further, if it only works in one direction (relative to the Earth, like say, due East) you would only gain energy when going in that direction, and would either lose energy when making a return trip, or would have to circumnavigate the globe in order to make a net positive.

A 60 kg man pushing a jet travelling at 800 km/hr would produce 48 megaJoules of energy per hour, which could presumably be used to reduce the amount of fuel it needed. Based on the energy density of Jet fuel could replace about 1 kg of Jet Fuel, assuming 100% efficiency rates. A quick googling says Jet fuel costs about $5.21 per gallon, which means a kg is about a third of that, or $1.74.

So, assuming he could find a series of jets already planning to travel around the world in about the same direction as his gravity, he could save them all about $1.74 per hour in fuel costs. I imagine if you built an electric generator that looped around the world that could harness his gravity as electricity you'd earn a similar amount when compared to a gasoline powered generator.

The only exploitable thing here is that technically power scales as force * speed, so the faster he's already going the more power he produces from the same force. Theoretically an advanced society could build such a generator with a vacuum tube and allow him to accelerate him to relativistic speeds before generating electricity and it'd be a much higher rate, but it would take some insane infrastructure to make.

**** Nitpick, it's 480MJ.

(W = Fd, F = mg ~ 60kg x 10 N/kg = 600N, d = 800,000m)

But your point still stands.
