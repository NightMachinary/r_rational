** Yes, but do they consider crossover fanfiction?

** Considering that the majority of the content of this subreddit is fanfiction, I think it fitting to link to a place where the topic is taken as seriously as can be: an academic journal. Every article is available for free, and although many may not be personally relevant, they do make for fascinating reading.

Edit: [[http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/40/49][This]] is one of my favorites. Look at the abstract!

#+begin_quote
  Abstract---This essay examines three Japanese anime texts---/Ghost in the Shell/, /Neon Genesis Evangelion/, and /Serial Experiments: Lain/---in order to discover metaphors for female fan practices online. In each of the three texts, women overthrow corporate, governmental, or paternal control over the body and gain the right to copy or reproduce it by fundamentally altering those bodies. These gestures are expressions of posthuman anxiety and "terminal identity." In addition, they involve confrontation with an uncanny double in some way. But how can they provide models for cyborg and fan subjectivity in an era in which bodily and textual reproduction, especially among females, is such a hotly contested issue? And how is the antifanfic backlash related to the phenomenon of the uncanny?

Obviously contains spoilers for those three animes.
