** So it was, in fact, a work of love. Foreshadowing successfully spotted.

So, about the time loop. One of the running theories is that time loop has divine origins. This makes sense, since it is clearly stated that time loop is impossible via magic, but gods are, well, gods.

What did not make sense to me was that for a divine intervention some aspects of the time loop made perfect sense but some parts seemed poorly executed.

Namely Zach as the starting point of the time loop seems... stupid? He is not the right person to be handled this power. He is not the right person to avert primordial summoning, not because he is a bad person, but because he is woefully under-qualified.

But then the gods have been silent for some time and they are clearly not omnipotent.

Suppose gods had foreseen their exile from the world and therefore had created some contingency measure for primordial prisons, in case someone breaks them. It is now clear that invaders had succeeded in the restart Zero. They had summoned the beast even with premature invasion, with Eldemar forces on alert. No matter how 'uninspired' (Zorian's words) their assault was in the initial timeline, it was still bound to succeed. Hence the divine contingency measure was set off.

So the gods had to create a mechanism that would save the day, in advance. Like centuries at least. Suppose they decide to appoint a Champion and loop him. If the gods were exiled for some reason and had no way to directly appoint a Champion, they had to write a spell that would do that for them. So they create a bloodline that is destined for this task. The Noveda bloodline. Now, suppose the Weeping was not part of the plan. As far as we can tell a magical plague is not something extraordinary, for all we know the Weeping could be naturally mutated troll flu. Irritating for trolls, deadly for weaker bipedal apes. In the end, Zach was picked by the loop simply because there was no choice, he was the only one candidate alive. The Noveda bloodline also boosted his mana reserves because he became a focal point; normally it could be distributed evenly between all living Novedas. With, say, 5 people alive they get +10 starting mana, advantageous but not revolutionary. Extended mana supplies naturally leads to their specialization in combat magic. But with Zach being the only one alive he gets +50, which is inhuman.

How does RR fall into this? I have no idea. RR is the product of counter-contingency plan made by Dragon herself! Yep, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

*** This theory has a certain flaw, however.

The time loop rewinds time at a precise time: 2 hours and 40 minutes after midnight (reference: [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/40/Mother-of-Learning][end of chapter 40]]). It is fairly improbable that invaders just happen to always summon He Of The Flowing Flesh 9600 seconds after midnight, so at the end of the month the time rewinds independently of the primordial's summoning. Which isn't terribly meaningful mechanic, if you are correct.

Albeit... It is possible the Noveda heir was supposed to terminate the loop manually, once he/she had made sure the primordial issue was dealt with permanently, without the danger of repeated summon a day later.

Yes, this theory looks solid.

Hm, I have a feeling the Weeping was not just your ordinary epidemic, though. Doesn't seem fitting. But I have nothing conclusive.

***** Or cover for blood magic? We hear it mentioned that a blood magician would be easy to spot because of the number of deaths, a large scale plague that killed a lot of magic users would be a perfect cover then.

We haven't heard anything about the symptoms of the weeping, so we don't know how easy it would be to confuse it for another form of death. But lets assume its possible, either the weeping was directly tied to blood magic as some sort of deliberate weapon, or it was unrelated and red robe took advantage of the cover. Then he steals a bunch of magical power from one of the most famous bloodlines, gaining it for himself, and in the process tying himself into the looping.

Every other time that has happened, they carry out the ritual at the moment of alignment, and the reset occurs. He hasn't been able to see the ritual up until now because it happened in the Hole and he didn't have a direct LoS without a concerted military strike on their center.

The critical new information is:

A) the reset is tied to the primordial summoning

B) they don't need to wait until alignment after all - the ritual works just fine without it

**** I don't think the source can be interpreted to mean that reset happens /precisely/ at 02:40:00. If we interpret "a few seconds" as 5, it gives us 02:39:06 - 02:40:05 window for the exact moment of reset.

And yes, Novedas could have had some knowledge about their bloodline, but since everyone died before they could pass that knowledge to Zach, that meant he was thrown in the loop completely clueless.

As for the Weeping, it was said to kill off somewhat around 10% of the population I believe? If so, this isn't even close to real world epidemics, like Black Death, that is estimated to have killed 1 in 3 /at least/. It may, of course, be unnatural, i.e. biological warfare designed by someone (maybe even Ibasans?) but I think it's irrelevant for the time loop. The only thing that mattered is that a confluence of circumstances reduced Novedas to Zach. I mean the other factor is proliferation of firearms and that is entirely rational idea.

The biggest flaw in this theory is that it does not explain Red Robe. But then the only reasonable RR theory I saw (Daimen discovering ancient magic in ancient magical ruins) conversely does not explain Zach.

****** Re-reading the story, I realize I've probably gotten it wrong. Primordial's don't cause the wells of power, but they might be attached to them. Otherwise, why place one next to a giant, magical beacon, which is pretty much guaranteed to attract people to settle next to it? Why not just bury them deep underground, with no tunnel?

My guess is that the primordial we know about is either generating the well of power (and the story about the dragon below generating magic is wrong), or if the story is true, it was placed there because its prison requires magic to power.

Either way, my guess is that all wells of power have primordials sealed in them. The author has explained warding schemes in detail, explicitly noting that more powerful ones either require huge batteries (which eventually drain), or large amounts of ambient power (thus being next to the wells.)

If neither of these things are true, I don't see why the gods wouldn't have sealed the primordials deep underground, or on the moon.

P.S. This is what i'm basing my theory on, BTW

#+begin_quote
  According to Ikosians, the world was originally a swirling, shapeless chaos, inhabited only by the 7 primordial dragons. One day, the gods descended from the higher planes of existence and killed all of them save one. This last one they refashioned into the material world that humans now inhabit, turning her body into dirt and stone, her blood into water, her breath into air and her fire into magic. The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World -- the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground. Far from being content with her fate, the Dragon Below still rages against her bounds, giving birth to natural disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes. Unable to strike back against the gods themselves, the dragon takes her anger out on their favored creations -- humans -- by utilizing her heart, the one thing the gods have not seen fit to take away from her. Pieces of it continually flake off from the main mass, giving birth to horrifying monsters whenever they hit the ground, at which point said monsters begin their ascent to the surface to terrorize mankind...

*** There is one big problem to your theory. Bloodlines tend to spread far and wide. For example, I personally have the blood of Charlemagne, but that doesn't make me part of any aristocratic family.

There would be branch families to the Noveda. I'd find it hard to believe that everyone would have stayed related to the family, and never ventured off. Never had illegitimate children, never married to a male member of another one of the great houses and thus taking their name, etc.

If it was so easy as having Noveda blood, then there should be a lot more time travelers around.

Edit: Unless, of course, the Weeping was truly a very focused disease made specifically to target the Noveda bloodline, and that that 10% of the population who died represented all of these branch families.

I can see how they wouldn't be, but if Zach is the initial key to the party, then how Red Robe got into the loop would be a major question. Perhaps Red Robe is, in fact, working against the Ibasans, but also for his own reasons/goals.

**** I was thinking the same thing too; that red robe and Zach might be related. Obviously the loop is able to take more than one person back each time, so could it be that it was designed that way? What if the whole Noveda family is supposed to loop back together. The only reason Zach is the prime user, is because he's currently the Noveda elder. Or closest to the Noveda mansion when the first loop started.

In that case Red Robe could be some long lost family relation of Zach. Possibly even have ties with the Ibasan forces through adoption.

Also, bonus observation, it would suck if you would have to spend years looping, while your spouse was unable to. The soul marker would have to be designed in a way that it could be shared with others through marriage. Maybe through a special ritual to induce a soul bond.

Now, tin-foil hat. Red robe is just someone that Zach married in one of his crazy loops. Possibly while under-cover with Ibasans.

*** But we've seen so far that victims of soul mutilation are reverted just fine. I mean, Nochka has been sacrificed and her soul mined for primordial essence countless times, and she seemed fine.

Since it was said that souls contain various information, the loop definitely tampers with souls of non-loopers in some fashion or with the souls of loopers (by adding extra information gained from the previous restart). It is not clear why the loop would fail to restore damage to life-force controlling block of non-looper soul.

If the loop really affects time it doesn't have to affect souls. But if it doesn't it has to reconstruct the world. Then the aranea were correct, they were effectively mind-wiped every month.

And this is after he already suspected that something had changed about Zorian, and after he'd known there had to be another time traveler, since all of the events were happening differently. Of course, before that conversation, he thought that the aranea were the time travelers, but he probably changed his mind here.

Either he's correctly guessed that Zorian is the time traveler, either he still believes that it was the aranea, but that Zorian is involved with them somehow. But after all of these restarts in which he's never once been contacted by the aranea, who were the ones who initially contacted him, he has to suspect that it's probably not the second option. And he probably also spent a restart or two in Cyoria, after the aranea were soul killed. He probably saw that Zorian was not there in that restart where he was facing RR alone and blew himself up in the Hole. That was probably enough to convince him.

Did I end up in alternative universe where misygonists and cruel manipulators deserve "rational" and calm discussion about whether what they're doing is bad or good, while people fighting for more equal world (that's my definition of SJW's) are bad on default?

Well, there is a whole sub where people try to guess wherever something was said by a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/StormfrontorSJW/][neonazi or a self-identified SJW]], and usually people win not by guessing "well, this is clearly not what a %group% would have said, it's not what they stand for", but by analysing wording and style of text. Add to this [[http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/05/03/dc-gamergate-meetup-disrupted-by-feminist-bomb-threat/][bomb threats to silence political opposition]] and other shenanigans that happen, and you can see why people aren't all that hot for the group.

Problem is, majority of people who call themselves SJW and identify with that crowd don't fight for that, hence the name being an insult of sorts.

Maybe primordial (or however it's spelled) is actually a giant black hole and it destroyed Cyoria, therefore Zorian and Zach both died and loop reset.

** Anyone else wondering now if the time loop was set up to be a competition? There's a bit in the incomplete message the matriarch left: "...can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly..."

If so, perhaps RR and Zach were both in the loop from the start, and possibly even more people. But the others were eliminated, but instead of dying, it's as if they were never a part of it, which is why more inexplicably dead people aren't found at the beginning of the loop. And since Zorian and Zach share a marker, as long as RR loses, they both get to keep their "time loop modified" souls, where as the losers, including RR, will never know it existed at all.

Unfortunately, I'm guessing that RR cornered Zach in the past and made him forget the method to eliminate competitors, giving himself plenty of time to enjoy the benefits of the loop.

** Adding a few observations, and a bit of speculation: The ritual needs not just one, but multiple shifter children. Raynie has a baby brother. For some unspecified reason (aside from Raynie's guess), Raynie is not allowed to go home during the summer festival.

It seems rather unlikely that the shifters are involved, but from a Doylist point of view, the fact that the ritual requires multiple shifter children is probably not without reason... Random speculation: 1) The cult could be aware of Raynie's brother. There might not be too many shifter children, and they must have done some research (maybe via Sudomir?) 2) The tribe might know something is going on (shifters worship primordials maybe? They also dislike outside influence, which could be motivation to be involved with the invasion). Still seems unlikely; who would reach out to them for something like that?

If 1) and 2) are combined, the refusal to have Raynie come back could theoretically be a murder attempt by her father. If I'm negative in the other direction, Raynie's supporters might want to get rid of an 'obstacle', and deal with the cult to get rid of Raynie's brother. If it is only option 1), maybe the tribe is aware that the boy is at risk (divination?), and if they don't know about the cult, Raynie seems like the biggest danger?
