** I just finished reading [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XBFD7CB/][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]] which was recommended here a few days ago (great book by the way) and I find myself craving more dungeon crawling books. Something like the dungeon exploration in the [[http://www.goblinscomic.org/][Goblins]] comic would be amazing.

Basically if anyone can recommend a good story where the main character(s) have to travel through deadly puzzle rooms, I would be a very happy reader.

EDIT: I have been trying to find a short NSFW story posted here about two years ago about a dark lord who kidnaps a princess. I barely remember anything about it except this awful, hilarious joke. The dark lord threatens to rape the princess, except this isn't a viable threat because instead of a blushing virgin princess, she's a scandalous princess who loves having sex. It was hilarious and I was curious to reread the story.

**** No definitely not that. I've spent some time thinking about the time range and it could be anywhere from two to four years ago.

/A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?!/ came out roughly a year ago.

It has similar themes, but a dramatically different writing style and is centered around the dark lord with frequent interactions with his saner henchman.

*** I can second Schlock Mercenary, though I have trouble figuring out why I like it. In many ways, I think the story puts quantity over quality. A lot of the jokes don't make me laugh, most of the characters are underdeveloped, the plot never explores its interesting ideas as much as I'd like it to, and the story has to keep coming up with contrived reasons for the characters to be typical murderhobos after all that's happened in the setting.

Nearest I can tell, it's the comfort food of webcomics in the same way sitcoms and detective shows are comfort food of tv shows. It rarely achieves true greatness, but it remains consistently "good enough" that it's easy to consume and be entertained. As serialized comedy webcomics go I think [[http://www.sluggy.com/nvg][Sluggy Freelance]] is better (though much less rational), but Schlock Mercenary remains a fun space opera about sociopathic guns for hire that I read every morning.

** If you haven't checked out Brandon Sanderson's work before, you should. Mistborn is my favorite fantasy series and I've yet to read a story of his I didn't like. What I'd like to talk about now, though, are The Alloy of Law books that pull a Legend of Korra by telling a story in the same universe as Mistborn hundreds of years later. You can enjoy them without reading the original series, though the ending of all the books will be completely spoiled so I recommend this mainly for fans of Mistborn.

Where I think The Alloy of Law and its sequels surpass Korra is by changing the genre of the story. Instead of a heroic fantasy about people with incredible power shaping the course of history, these books are fast-paced pulp adventures about a Wild West-style bounty hunter working as a detective in a city inspired by Victorian London. I won't say they're better than Mistborn, but are definitely the most rational take on pulp adventure I've ever seen. Sanderson actually researched sociology and economics to build this world, and one of the main characters is a statistician.

The story is still clearly rooted in the tropes of Victorian-era pulp. There's action, mystery, and romance from the get-go, some horror straight out of a Penny Dreadful, and even Indiana Jones-style adventure later on. I can't say it's better than Mistborn, but it's a lot of fun, especially the action scenes. Wax is like a flying, gun slinging Batman who's kleptomaniac master-of-disguise sidekick Wayne can slow down time, and they never seem overpowered. The power level is actually lower than Mistborn.

There is one one thing these books do better than Mistborn. These books are /funny/. The characters can be downright hysterical, especially Wayne's one-liners and Steris' obsessive need to plan for *every* contingency. These books seriously made me crack up without ever breaking the tone it was going for, and the story is completely grounded and serious even while mixing city politics and conspiracies with superpowered criminals and shapeshifters who work for God. These books are just awesome, go read them.

*** So, I suppose this is gravedigging a bit but I'm trawling through old rec threads looking for things to read and I may as well answer, in case you're still interested.

For anyone else reading: definitely recommend Perilous Waif. Looking forward to further entries in that series.

Regarding Riyria: I don't remember a lot of details about it, but I do remember that the writing got /significantly/ better as the series went on. On the whole, it's still just a fairly generic fantasy series, but it's fairly light, fun, and entertaining. Don't force yourself to read it if you're not feeling it, but it does get better. I also read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19084955-hollow-world][Hollow World]] by the same author and I'd tentatively recommend it too. Again, nothing earth-shattering, or particularly rational, but I found it reasonably entertaining.

I am surprised that you recommend Michael Manning but don't like Riyria. Perhaps you and I have different tastes, but I tried /The Blacksmith's Son/ by him and it was /terrible./ It's so bad that I won't read anything by that author. So yeah, don't read that book. :)

Yeah, blacksmiths son is indeed terrible. The writing is atrocious. I read embers first, then tried his other stuff. It's pretty obvious novice writing, and terrible writing at that. Embers is ok though.

** I would recommend the book 'Trice upon a time' by by James P. Hogan. It's about a scientist that discovers a machine that can sent messages to itself in the past, and all it's ramifications. I loved it.

Also the Orthogonal trilogy by Greg Egan. On an alien planet in an alien universe with slightly different (and extremely detailed) physics some inhabitants try to use a special natural law to save their world. I'm not sure this truly fits the rational frame, but it's definitely about people exploiting the forces of nature to get their way.

**** I think it has more to do with being effective than being fair. You can't really get to your target demographic by saying something that that'll cause them to dismiss the article immediately. It's a problem I have generally with rational anti-sjw bloggers. The way a few of them write, it's like they're unaware that they're bad at convincing SJWs that things like public humiliation, doxxing, etc are bad. Either that or they're just writing for other anti-SJWs about how awful the SJWs are, which doesn't do anything to fix the problem.
