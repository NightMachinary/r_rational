I remember a story (possibly a star trek fic) where a low level tech realizes that the " no replicating living stuff" rule is just a config tweak in the firmware. I can't for the life of me remember the title.

Edit: found it [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/159ASjt0t-YVWcKY8l1CzWF3IqmgxnOlNPy6iBUbN40M/edit?usp=sharing][here, transporter tribluations]]


** I kind of forgot that I had shared that one. It never really got properly working, for reasons that are still a little opaque to me (which goes for something like half a million words worth of stuff that's sitting in Google Docs instead of out in the world). It's not actually Star Trek fanfic, which would just make it a let down for someone who came across it on ff.net. I really like the core idea, of a bunch of roleplayers running around in a version of Star Trek built by the lowest bidder, and a Wesley Crusher stand-in who's trapped there and has to hack his way out, but ... I don't know, maybe it's an idea that I'll attack from another direction at a later date.

It doesn't read too poorly though, I don't think.

*** So you're the author, then?

I think the problem is that it reads more like a thought experiment than a story. It's pretty much just a straight run through three or four major reveals about the setting, with a little bit of discussion for each.

I think it could be a good story. [[#s][Spoilers]]

**** Plus all matter in the real world has likely been converted into computronium by this point anyway, so it's not like getting there would do any good.

***** Yeah. If there's a way this could work out non-horribly, it'd be a hell of story.

****** They have the source code to the replicators that have been built by the lowest contractor. They can look for other holes in the code. Maybe they can use the replicator to push down a level of simulation, like Peer and Kate in /Permutation City/. Maybe they can find other implied spaces like the Jefferies Tubes that have to exist long term, but have spare computational capacity assigned to them. Maybe they can copy themselves to another simulation which needs more long-term extras if they can get over the existential issues of local death.

******* I've never read /Permutation City/ (I know, I know, I really should). What do you mean by "push down a level of simulation"? My naive reading of that would be "create a simulation within a simulation".
