** Is there anything like DKA that I can read while Pusakuronu is writing the next chapter? At this rate I'm afraid I'm going to binge read the whole thing again D:

*** Maybe try these:

- wanderinginn.wordpress.com

- forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/

- oneofmanydemon.wordpress.com

though they are very quite similar they do have some similarities.

*** There's a rewrite be someone else with permission. It's a bit short thus far, and not up to the quality of later chapters just yet, but it's about even/better with how DKA was around this point.

[[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/]] has also a bunch of similarities, namely, a magical girl trying to apply a scientific approach and modern engineering to magic, but it spends more time on the science of magical girls rather than the world conquering bits. Sadly, it appears to be dead.
