The topic seemed appropriate, given the holiday. I don't want to talk specifically about Rationalist Romance, but rather what the title states.

  I'm sorry Jack, but I my friends and I talked it over for sixty minutes by the clock and now uniamously agree that the optimal outcome is for you to be friendzoned for exactly four months while watching me date a series of increasingly suitable males before your heart breaks and you stop following me around like a creep.

** What would be the defining qualities of romance in rationalist fiction?

- Clear communication?
- An honest assessment of strengths/weaknesses/compatibilities/incompatibilities?
- A rejection of cultural scripts and cached rules?
- Optimizing for acquiring the best partner?
- Game theoric dating?
- Hacking human biases ([[/r/seduction]])?

Absolutely. I see so many romantic problems in fiction that can be solved by the partners sitting down and talking honestly for five minutes.

**** Alright, well since conflict drives story, what's a romantic problem that can't be easily solved by clear communication? I imagine that if there's to be any tension in a romance in a rationalist fiction, you'd want to have a romance that's ill-fated for some reason - it conflicts with societal views, there are underlying ideological disagreements, biological attraction doesn't match up with stated values?

I pitched a story idea to a friend awhile back about a modern retelling of Tarzan (in the public domain!) with some steampunk/biopunk trappings, and I realized that it's got the capability to be a good romance, specifically because the inherent tensions internal to Jane that can't be solved by simply sitting down and talking things over.

***** My solution was to simply build in really, /really/ significant reasons for the two characters who make the most romantic progress to fall in love, namely that one of them has a terminal disease that would get the other executed for hanging out with them, and that the second person is stuck between the most dangerous man in the world and an organization that wants him for his secrets. Either of them rapidly, completely opening up to the other basically guarantees that they would die horribly.

Of course, the relationship progresses anyway.

****** I wish I had something constructive to add to this scenario, but I don't.

Romance is incredibly low on my list of things I consider desirable in life, so my inner maths went along the lines of "Further progression of this scenario is inoptimal and may result in harm to one or more parties. Optimal solution is to break off contact, and pursue other avenues."

Which doesn't exactly work as a romantic development.

***** Easy. Step one : Laverne - being moderately bright, but a shining exemplar of the rationalist virtues of Luminosity, Conscientiousness and Honesty is very good at monogamy. Over 130 years she marries trice, all three unions ending in the untimely demise and subsequent freezing of her spouse. (Traffic, War, lab accident) Step two: The march of progress finally achieves the grail of resurrection of the frozen. Step Three: Drama.

*** Brienne and I do 1-4, I know a couple that consensually does 6 on a long-term romantic basis, and I'm not sure what you mean by 5.

However 1-4 are defining qualities of /rational romance in real life/. Fiction is about conflict, no exceptions. I suspect that a good rational romance /story/ would need some /actually good reason/ for clear communication to not occur, such as somebody being a secret agent.

***** I like that. Putting some more human back into rational humanism.

Rationality doesn't necessarily mean knowing your desires perfectly, although ideally you'd effectively use evidence to narrow in on it. Changing your beliefs about what you want can be emotional and would be a good internal crisis (which of course should be backed by an external one to tell a good story).

There's also the problem of zooming in on a local maximum instead of an actual ideal. Which sounds dry when I put it that way, but if the protagonist is in a happy, committed relationship with someone who closely matches their current idea of an ideal partner, and then they discover someone else who's completely different but better, well, that's rational and a stock romance plot.

Or to give that one a bit more of an edge^{*} you could have the protagonist discover someone wildly different, worse than their current partner, but close enough to suggest that someone else like them might be better. Do you break up with your current partner? Throw out monogamy? Do you date the new slightly worse person to learn about that area of potential-partners-space, or wait for an actually better one?

^{*} The edge is the part of the story you accidentally cut yourself on.

**** By "game theoric dating" I meant an application of game theory towards finding a mate. If we take the most basic form of the game, two men compete with each other over a woman, and they adjust their strategies as they see what the other is doing until eventually they arrive at an equilibrium (whereupon the woman makes her choice and the "game" is over).

I've been trying to figure out a good way to fictionalize game theory in the form of competitive romance, but it seems like a lot of work for very little payoff.

Who says two women aren't competing for a man? Who says you're not implicitly adopting social norms based on obsolete ideas about gender roles that objectify all participants? Who says this game is an effective way to good outcomes in the first place?

****** That was just an example of dating as a game, with a whole bunch of really obvious assumptions that are apparent when you think about it for five seconds, but which hopefully got the point across, which is that a lot of the same concepts translate over.

The game is not an effective way to get good outcomes - it's not about that. It's about how people can strategically make complex decisions. Each person is trying to maximize their own happiness, but that doesn't mean that the result is maximized happiness for everyone depending on what strategies are chosen.

So since you seem to want it, let's imagine a more complex version of the game. There's a high school full of teenagers that are distributed along the bell curve as far as things like attractiveness, intelligence, sexuality, etc. (Spectrum would probably be better than bell curve when it comes to sexuality, but you take my point.) Now, unlike how actual teenagers deal with the question of love, all these teenagers are rational actors. They have differing utility functions and differing abilities (the game is asymmetric) but most of them want a partner, with some of them wanting more than that. And from there, the game begins until it either reaches an equilibrium (which may not be the best equilibrium possible) or time runs out.

And obviously there are lot of assumptions still in place there.

******** Ah, I think I may have found the miscommunication. I'm not suggesting that this is how people normally behave, or that this is how they should behave. I'm saying that concepts from game theory are applicable to dating, and that this might constitute a rationalist story. You're absolutely right that there's a risk of it coming off as socially clueless, specifically because that's not how people deal with romance in the real world.

But I still think it has the possibility to be fun to watch.

(I'd also argue that it doesn't matter if everyone knows their exact expected utility from any given pairing - the game theory part still comes into play when some people aren't going to get their first choice, which means that there are different solutions to the question of who should pair with who, and incentives for people to alter their strategy in order to arrive at a good outcome for themselves.)

** I'd find this really difficult to pull off without falling into the "rationalists are emotionless and cold" thing.

Of course, it doesn't help that I'm an aromantic asexual (nothing to do with my rational-fic fandom, since it far pre-dates that!) and most of my stories, where they have romance, have some nasty twist or other in it.

Noteworthy examples of love in rationalist fiction:

- HPMOR's Lucius Malfoy's love for his son. Familial rather than romantic, but very, very touching.
- Luminosity's Bella and Edward. Not interesting, to me, for romance's sake alone. Interesting because of the worldbuildy predestiny soulmates thing, which turned out to be minorly exploitable [[#s][later in the story]]
- Got more examples? Feel free to add them in a reply! I can't think of any at the moment.

As far as I can tell, Alicorn doesn't think highly of Bella and Edward's relationship in Luminosity. They have to be together /because that's the story/, but there really isn't that much chemistry, either portrayed or intended.

[[http://edgeofyourseat.dreamwidth.org/2121.html][The other Bells]] (who seem to have rather more fun) at some point describe Luminosity!Bella as using Edward as "a glorified thought radio" (and thereby, likely, a firewalled container for moral agency, relieving her of the Bad Feelings she'd get from /choosing/ to invade other people's minds herself.) Not too romantic, that.
