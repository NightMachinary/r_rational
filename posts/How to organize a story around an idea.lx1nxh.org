Say you mostly want to use a story to discuss some Idea like a philosophy or psychological principle. What are methods of doing this? I'd like to hear other people's thoughts, I've come up with a few below.

1. A character wants to spread the Idea. Since it's part of their motivation, they will naturally talk to people about it to convince them/convert them. For example, if a character is motivated to spread a religion, they will naturally have conversations with people about religion.

2. The Idea is needed/useful for solving a problem. A character wants X, and to get X they need to use the Idea. For example, the good guy wants to catch the bad guy, and in order to do this the good guy has to use Bayesian reasoning, so you have a reason to talk about how Bayesian reasoning works.

3a. A character makes a mistake and you can explain why that mistake happened with the Idea. When mistakes are made it's pretty natural to want to understand why. For example, a character thinks they will complete a project faster than they actually do, and now you can talk about the planning fallacy.

3b. A character comes up with a bad plan, and you can explain why the plan is bad by invoking the Idea. For example, a character says they should go through with plan X because they have already invested so much money into it, and another character explains that this reasoning is an example of the sunk cost fallacy.

1. A character uses the Idea to justify a decision. For example, a character is in a trolley problem dilemma, and they choose to sacrifice one person to save five. They then justify themselves to other characters by talking about utilitarianism.

2. A character is engaged in training or is seeking advice, and the Idea is relevant. For example, a character asks for advice regarding their romantic relationship, and now you can talk about the psychology of relationships.


** One kind of answer is that this question is what a lot of short story science fiction is all about. E.g., Asimov's stories are about the question of how people who have read science fiction stories about robots would build robots. He was bored of Frankenstein stories where a robot turns on its master for no reason, so he came up with the three laws.

It's cliche to say that stories are about conflict, but it's also cliche to walk on your feet instead of your hands. So the story emerges when the Three Laws lead to conflict. E.g., one of the laws is to prevent humans from coming to harm, and so there's a short story where the robots won't let humans enter a radioactive area that isn't really that dangerous. So the humans disable the Third Law in one robot, and then the robopsychologist explains how easy it is to murder someone with the third law disabled. Spoilers for decades old science fiction you've already read.

So the principle of writing science fiction short stories is to think of a cool idea for a space ship, a time machine, a matter transporter, or whatever else, and then have it go wrong in some way that illustrates the significance of the idea being contemplated.

A second kind of answer is Atlas Shrugged. Show a society that is the extreme antithesis of the philosophy you want to advocate, then show how the society sucks really hard because they are so opposed to your philosophy, then show how awesome people can be when they adhere to your philosophy. This requires you to come up with a society that's the logical outcome of opposition to your philosophy and extraordinary characters who are plausibly powered by your philosophy.

A third kind of answer is that pretty much every story is about an idea. /High School Musical/ is about the idea that expressing yourself through societally unapproved ways may be the key to personal fulfillment. It achieves this by telling a story where the main conflict of the main character comes from his struggle to express himself through song when society just wants him to play basketball. Characters don't have long complicated discussions about psychology and social norms; the ideas are woven into the characters and story so that you don't necessarily notice they're present.

In the end, the answer to this question is going to be that an idea isn't a story until you have a story, so you organize a story around an idea by...organizing a story! I recall Orson Scott Card saying somewhere that he came up with the idea for the Battle Room while he was just sitting on a bench doing nothing. He wanted a story about war, decided it would be in the future, and thought about how you might train people for war in three dimensions. Once he had that idea, he did /not/ write Ender's Game. He just had an idea, nothing more. Without a character and a conflict, he didn't even have the seed of a story, just something cool to plug into his story if he ever came up with one. Nothing about the main story of Ender's Game depends on the particularities of Battle School as opposed to any other cool idea he could have come up with. Similarly, Asimov's three laws aren't specifically necessary for the main thrust of most of his stories, and Atlas Shrugged didn't need to be about Objectivism per se.

Stories come from stories, not ideas---which isn't to say you can't search for stories based on their ability to service an idea. The main emotional through-lines of HPMOR don't depend on concepts of rationality; at the same time, /Harry Potter/ fanfiction is unusually well-suited to presenting ideas that challenge our norms because the world of /Harry Potter/ is relatable enough that empathizing with Harry is easy, and it's easy to find analogues of his struggles to things that happen in our own world, but it is also alien and strange enough that we can hear Harry's argument for tearing down Azkaban without becoming defensive or biased by the status quo of our own horrible prison system.

In sum, I don't know.

Though TBF, it's puzzling how exactly would robots with a First Law even work without having an understanding of acceptable risk levels. Do they stop you from driving a car? Slap excessively cholesterol rich sandwiches out of your hands? Forcefully drag you out of polluted urban areas?

My favorite Ayn Rand story is The Irregular at Magic High School, time-proven propaganda about how your life would magically be better, /somehow/, if you didn't suck so much. And also how it's a good idea to boink your sister.

It's conceptually risible within just a couple of seconds: the main character is a magic cripple, and in a logical, rational world he'd be a magic shoe shine boy for the rest of his life while the wizards with actual MP points do the important stuff. But here he somehow isn't because he's just too cool and smart. (Perhaps because he boinks his sister? I didn't explore it too deeply, but I'd have ten million times more respect for the author if that was the actual in-world reason.) Though of course all of Ayn Rand's works faithfully follow this exact template precisely, it's nothing special.

Her followers tend to be far more extreme than that though - it's often mentioned that Gravel lost second place in a libertarian presidential primary to a woman who wanted to eliminate the minimum age of consent.

Anyway, I think that's only a good example of how to sell ideology: people want to hear what they want to hear. They don't want to eat slightly less and undergo the horrific trauma of the diameter of their intestines shrinking very slightly for like four days, they want to buy a million weird tricks that don't work. (Because god knows if they worked, there wouldn't be a market for them.)

** In HPMOR, I almost always started by writing the events of a chapter, got to the point where something happened where it made sense for Harry to think about a principle or a cognitive bias, and then named a chapter after that. The big exception to this principle was "The Stanford Prison Experiment"* arc, which I thought was a safe bet because Harry would have to think about that at some point, right? But not until ten chapters into it did a natural opportunity come up for Harry to think about it for one sentence. Tl;dr: Targeting stories on predetermined explanations is actually super hard for me, and I get by via having so many different things I want to explain that any random story I write is liable to naturally run through one of them.

** I think it depends on whether the idea is interesting for practical reasons or intellectual reasons.

--------------

If it's interesting for practical reasons, that usually means that there's something in the world which gets better when people understand it. Working backward from that can yield really really compelling stories, because the problem feels honest.

For example, the scene in HPMOR where Harry uses genetics to help Draco realize that his beliefs about pure wizarding blood being contaminated by muggles are poorly-justified. Not making mistakes like that is a real benefit of understanding genetics, so it clicks for the readers.

--------------

If it's interesting for intellectual reasons, like some philosophy topics or thought experiments, I think the best way is to embed the interesting topic in the physical world magical-realism-style, so that thinking about and interacting with this abstract topic becomes important for the characters.

For example, the recurring theme in WTC where the characters have to discuss narrative and worldbuilding because it seems to at least partially shape the physics of the world they inhabit. This lets the author put real-seeming consequences and emotional weight behind understanding these abstract topics.

** One sub point to your point 2 is immersing the characters in a world in which the Idea is the core part of the reality, and they must interact with it.

Lately, I have been tinkering with a wilderness survival story ("What if all technology suddenly vanished, stranding humans in pristine wilderness??") and the Idea that I hammered into almost every scene is that cool-headed stoicism saves lives, while panic and irrational decisions kill you, often before you realise your mistake. The way i constructed the world the characters exist in, I can do 100% Show Don't Tell, and never have my characters pontificate or think loud about it. It is simply so that the characters who agree with the Idea tend to not die as easily, so as the plot goes on the % of stoic rationalists increases.

** Imagine a world or a scenario where the Idea is central to how things work, in a way that is more visceral & relatable. Make that the core of your story.

For example, Ted Chiang's story /Exhalation/ takes the Idea of entropy and makes it less abstract and more visceral by inventing a world where it's about air pressure, which people have a more direct intuitive grasp of.

There are other good examples in some of Chiang's other stories, like /Hell Is the Absence of God/, and in some of EY's short stories like /The Sword of Good/ and /The Hero With A Thousand Chances/. Some of Scott's posts, like his [[https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/list-of-fictional-cryptocurrencies][lists of fictional X's]] also contain the seeds for these kinds of stories.

This is more straightforward to do with short stories than with longer works.

** Hmmm.... some more examples that don't perfectly fit or are categories on their own.. All just from Pokemon: Origin of Species. The categories should be more general perhaps?

1. Characters stumbling across/inventing an idea spontaneously, because it is useful for the problem they are trying to solve.example: heroic responsibility group ritual thingy after the Absol-fight

2. A character being super-confused by a complex idea and they're shown grappling with it.

example: Red running thru examples and continuously mixing up numbers till Bayes' theorem clicks

1. A character executing an idea, letting attentive reader figure out the idea on the spot. And less attentive readers getting a direct or indirect explanation afterwards.

example:Leaf entering a door, whilst putting in earplugs, so she can won't fall asleep from her Wigglytuff's "sing"-attack (for the attentive reader). Blue, his pokemon, the renegade and his Sandslash falling asleep, when she tells Wigglytuff to sing.

Aiko asking other trainers in her group for their water supplies, in the middle of a life and death fight against two Onyx. Then using them to threaten to drown the Onyx eggs, so they retreat with them instead of further engaging the group.

1. Group of characters attending a workshop and getting the idea explained to them.

2. Same group of characters then being tasked to come up with an improved version of the idea.

example: Ranger priority system workshop

---though 9 and 10 could be generalized.In "the moon is a harsh mistress", the professor explains how to run a terrorist/revolutionary cell system to minimize risk to the org, by any one cell being captured or becoming traitors. And Manwell comes up with some kind of 3d version, that's more efficient.

Though 8 could also be seens as a subset of 2.10 is kind of related to 3b, but it doesn't assume that the original idea is bad. Just that there's a better one, without the original idea being bad.

1. In Worth the Candle, they often discuss one or more alternative for a problem. Disagreeing and discussing various merits. Part of the operational planning for a magical strike team going into extremely dangerous situations.

2. Also in WTC showing weird Unicorn probability space mechanics by just showing them in the Unicorn fight. Also kind of Show, don't tell.....wait, that's actually part of 8.Ah whatever, I give up. Lists are hard.

[expressing the idea of diminishing returns, by writing so long, that you're hitting... wait that's also 12]

1. Secret antagonist writing a blog post, which helps with worldbuilding and adding depth to their character.\\
   example: Giovanni questioning whether renegades really should be always getting the death penalty, since this incentivizes them to fight life and death instead of giving up. Which could cause much more harm than otherwise.\\
   A fact that he happily exploits by regularly faking the deaths of the renegades, he's supposed to execute as a gym leader and making them his loyal employees. [or shipping them off to some other crime syndicate and receiving them, since there's actually an international renegade black job market]

** Ayn Rand has an [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Fiction-Guide-Writers-Readers/dp/0452281547][amazing book]] where she talks about exactly this. Whatever you think about her politically, she's undeniably an expert at doing this stuff, and I think this book would be very useful to you.

** Have you read Pokemon and the Origin of Species? Chapters tend to be that, the author reads some non fiction or article then has his characters talk about it and apply it in the context of the story.

​

I don't particularly enjoy this, I'd rather read non fiction, and get the information directly and a couple examples and be done, but many people do. It's a matter of taste and how you prefer to learn.

​

Other ways of doing this would be more complex, like having a theme for the story and every part of it aimed at conveying that message and theme to the reader. Literary fiction is good at that, it tends to be short too when compared to serials, because there's only so far you can stretch a theme or idea until it loses it's punch. It tends to be pretentious though, and very how do I put this? 'Look at this woman / cripple / minority in the past following his dreams and facing adversity', which I feel is very lazily trying to score 'morality points', so I can't stand most of it, the writing is good though so there's that.

I feel like that is a bit of a bad take. The people writing things like House of the spirits and Beloved are people writing stories to make it easier to understand a perspective. I think it's true that sometimes readers or critics take the ideas too far, like a lot of literary criticism use Marxist ideas, but overall I think overall if both sides are trying to just understand things better, literary fiction is good.
