I just noticed that the plot of Nightmare in Dreamland reminds me somewhat of Eliezer Yudkowsky's "the Sword of Good". I would LOVE to see a rational take on the Kirby universe. (Preferably the video games, not the anime). anyone interested in making that?


** Kirby, both as a character and a series, seems like an interesting target for creating a rational spin.

Kirby himself is strongly implied, through out all of his media, that he is very young, mentally. Usually this is used to explain his large lack of language and simple demeanor, but given we're allowed to go a bit off the rails with a ration fanfic, it seems valid to me say that he might also have the absorptive (pun intended) tendencies of a child, as well.

I suppose, the way you'd use that framework, would be to try and craft a coming-of-age arc out of his stories. There's already something like that there, with the rise and fall of cooperative characters like the animal friends, Bandana Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight.

Necessity seems like it'd be the main drive for Kirby (or any of the characters, really) to develop their rationality. Even with Kirby's inherently huge power level, the enemies he faces in his adventures are very big, and often pretty existential. If you cut out the eleventh hour power boosts (or made them less eleventh hour-y) and subbed in some mental growth, training with his powers (capitalize on the presence of a master swordsman and fellow star warrior, if nothing else) and maybe some enlightenment on his nature as a seemingly cosmic entity (the copy palette, receptivity to the star rod, command of the warp star, literally planet-cracking strength, that sort of thing), and it seems like there's something there.

You could star with a light in-media-res, after Kirby finishes up one of the smaller adventures, like when Dyna Blade ravages the crops to feed her nest. This beginning can serve to introduce how Kirby's character has changed from canon, from a purely innocent puffball who is mostly interested in getting the food back so he can eat, to what we could consider a slightly more mindful child, one who's learned that, beyond being hungry himself (which should definitely remain one of his top priorities throughout), Dyna Blade is also damaging all of Dreamland. The extra awareness will also let the ending of that story impact him more, another example where his more terrestrial foe is innocent, in some ways at least. That's already a theme almost every game.

Progress can happen, I can't think of all the details right now. But an interesting point would whatever equivalent to Return to Dreamland would be. Potentially, it would be one of the first times where not only is a foe actually friend, but where Kirby is honestly, directly, painfully betrayed. This could serve as formation point for Kirby, a jumping off point where if he's matured enough by that time in the story, for him to develop his rationality further. If he hasn't already, maybe he can go to Meta Knight, who seems, if nothing else, less naive, get some training in being a better judge of character as well as a better swordsman and warrior.

Other points to the story could the development of how Kirby interacts with the other people in Dreamland. At first, he might seem like almost another monster, if cuter than average, occasionally pillaging the fields and homes for food. He can grow to into more social behaviors, perhaps learning at first to find food in the wispy woods or the similarly uncultivated places, and then actually attempting to trade with Dreamlanders, and further in the future, maybe even use his considerable power to help them grow food.

If a darker twinge feels necessary, you can also expand on Shiver Star being a snowballed modern Earth. Maybe have some future humans wandering about the galaxy for Kirby to encounter. Maybe this human population is the true origin of Adeleine, if her presence on Pop Star needs to be explained. If she's given sole humanity as a character trait, then reconnecting her to her species could be plot point, as well as an interesting parallel to Kirby and the stark lack of star warriors beyond him and Meta Knight.

**** It's kinda lame to say "DAE wanna Rational ________". The question by itself has no actual content. This would be amended if you wrote several paragraphs about the story and its rational qualities, etc.

**** "Rational _____?" is low-effort and low-quality. In addition, asking for someone to make your idea is useless, as you will generally be the person most interested in the idea, and the person most qualified to make it as a story you will enjoy.

It may not be against the rules, but this community is largely self-moderating. You'll notice that there aren't actually any rules.

**** Right you are, but that doesn't necessarily make it content that people are interested in, leading to the current situation.

*** Are you real Eaglejarl? Kirby is the pink guy that sucks up things to turn into them? prominent smash brothers character? Arguably at a fame level similar to that of Mario, Samus, or Link?

[[https://www.google.com/search?q=kirby&safe=off&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiO0fjp17TJAhXKaD4KHfd1Ab0QsAQIKw&biw=931&bih=575][This Thing]]?

Aaanyway, Nightmare in Dreamland, goes something like this: King Dedede removes the power source of the Fountain of Dreams, the Star Rod, splits it into pieces, and hides them away. Now nobody can have dreams anymore! Oh noes! You spend the whole game slaughtering your way to the pieces of the Star Rod, reassemble the Star Rod, shove it back into the fountain of dreams to restore peace to dreamland- OOPS.

Looks like King Dedede had divided and hidden away the pieces for a freaking reason! the minute you put it back the real Big Bad "Nightmare" descends and absorbs all its power, forming the final boss.

So I assume OP is relating it to Sword of Good because it has the same sort of "Actually you've kinda been doing the wrong thing all along" theme.

Ahem, but uh yeah, OP probably should have said all that in their post.

I've heard of Smash Brothers, but didn't know anything about it aside from "it's a video game named Smash Brothers...or maybe Smash Bros". And, to be honest, I only know who Samus is from the Cracked video, "[[http://www.cracked.com/video_18491_video-game-battle-sexes-halo-vs.-metroid.html][Samus vs Master Chief]]" and from the [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cL-mR79GErU][Haloid]] video.

Anyway, thanks for the clarification.

***** Ooh, speaking of which, there's the Kirby vs Majin Buu [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwzH7eSOwAc][Death Battle]].

As per usual obviously not everyone agrees with the outcome, but you know. That's death battle for you.
