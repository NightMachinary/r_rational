I just listened to a podcast on Freakonomics radio that gave a strong case for children being smarter than adults. Some things it said was that it's much easier for a magician to fool an adult than a child and children have a much easier time figuring out how the magic tricks work than adults; also they had a child psychology researcher come onto the show and she described children as the "Research and Development division of the human species" and adults as "production and management".

What does the community make of this?

The podcast can be found here: [[http://freakonomics.com/2014/05/22/think-like-a-child-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/]]


** I have not listened to the podcast.

Based solely on your summary, this feels like one of those cases where somebody takes a weak, unsurprising but true claim ("carps have more chromosomes than people") and inflates it into a paradoxical, surprising-sounding and untrue or borderline-meaningless claim ("carps are more evolved than people! [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines][are carps the next step in human evolution?]]")

I don't think children are smarter than adults. Even the smarter ones often struggle with logical problems that adults solve much more quickly. There's a reason you'll learn more mathematics during a single semester in university than during the first 4 years of school. There's a reason they adjust iq tests for age. I don't think we should twist the truth of all that so that we could say something that sounds surprising.

That said, as far as I can tell kids do seem to have some... let's call them "weird mental superpowers", and the younger they are the stronger those powers are. They learn languages quickly. They learn games like Go or Chess quickly, to the point where it becomes embarrassing for the adults. There's probably much more that I don't even realize. The podcast probably gives some other great examples.

** Haven't listened to the podcast, but that doesn't sound like 'more intelligent' to me. It sounds like children and adults have different approach to the 'exploitation vs exploration' dilemma, which makes a lot of sense. The children brain should be much more open towards looking for new solution / learning new laws. The adult brain, which has collected much more signal, can and should rely more on previous knowledge.

** The older you get, the more heuristics your brain learns to use to prune and filter and summarise the inflow of data it gets. Most of the time that's advantageous - it lets you get to the important details of a situation more quickly and make more accurate guesses from limited information, but the misdirection used by magicians is /specifically designed/ to exploit your heuristics and pull your attention towards the irrelevant while concealing the real trickery.

It does also have other effects - from what I hear children are more able to tell apart (for example) individuals in a group of animals, because they haven't yet learned a mental filter that categorises all sheep as "A sheep" so they're still genuinely looking at the individual details. By the time you're an adult you've learned that the specific identities of sheep are rarely important, so they all look the same because you're not really paying attention (unless you're a shepherd, in which case those individual identities are useful information and you either don't learn or gradually un-learn that filter).

The adult brain has its advantages too; if memory serves there are whole regions of the brain that don't become fully functional until you reach your mid-20s. Which perhaps explains why teenagers are prone to risky behaviour and short-term thinking - they literally don't have the circuitry required to properly assess risk, or appreciate long-term rewards. Thinking at high levels of abstraction is also a skill that takes time and age to develop, which is a useful component of 'intelligence'.

We cant? It seems to me that among people actually studying it there is a broad majority view that iq tests are very good tests for mental ability.

Specific examples aside, we can certainly test ourselves against one another in certain aspects of intelligence that we all agree are important. That doesn't mean we understand what intelligence is, and how to measure it except in very small slices, apples to apples.

I can make predictions that all of these people test in the high percentiles on iq tests and it would be one hell of a fluke if they did not. That being said iq tests have greater predictive power and repeatability in the middle of the bell curve so exceptional individuals may lead to a false picture of the volatility of such tests.

Nah that is just wrong. All these fruits correlate with very high correlation coefficient to the apple the iq score, so much so that psychometricians talk about g - the general intelligence factor that translate between very different tests and explains the performance. There are almost no tests of cognitive ability that are not g loaded, meaning that people with high scores on iq test outperform medium performers on aggreagate which then outperform low performers in almost every test ever devised (and those where it is not so are e.g. revognizing faces not something which we would particularly count as intelligence).

******** I suppose my wording wasn't very appropriate to the question. I do agree that we have ways of measuring certain aspects of mental ability which will typically allow us to identify high intelligence in adults. There are, of course outliers. A fairly substantial number of them.

Here's an example from myself. When I was in third grade, I could open any book I'd ever read, to any page, read two or three sentences, and know if I'd read it before. I learned to do that because the book covers for a lot of the books I was reading at the time were different at the school library and the public library.

Today, I just read the names of the books.

Was I smarter then, or now?

First up since we know that the IQ scores of Lesswrong types are very high , and [[/r/rational]] certainly is a lesswrong affiliated sub you are probably in the very high range were the predictive validity is not that good anymore. Second, you are smarter now. If I give you an intellectual task you are more likely to succeed now.

********** On the topic of highly intelligent people that are outside the realm of most intelligence testing. If you haven't spent much time around extremely good machinists and other tradesmen, you might not be familiar with just how shockingly good some of them are with their hands and tools. It's not just manual dexterity and a good eye. Some of them simply /know/ the materials and tools of their trade better than most people outside the trades would believe. They aren't common, but they aren't rare. I've worked with a few, and most of them were not good candidates for a higher education.

Back to the child comparison. If you give me a task today that I could not succeed in when I was younger, how much of my success is due to my learned patterns, my lifetime of optimization? How much of it is due to raw intelligence? Have my learned patterns pruned my intelligence by making my life easier? Do I only seem smarter now, because some of the lessons life threw at me managed to stick? Do I learn new things faster now?

Sure. But if the entire population would be in such trades I suspect that iq would be a good predictor for ability. It is in most jobs. It would not be everything however. Intelligence as defined by psychometricians is the ability to solve abstract problems and this ability is an exceedingly good predictor for success in many areas but not the only one and correlations are never perfect.

Memory tasks on smaller sets are probably the key here. I have been playing Magic (the trading card game) since I was a child. Back then I knew every card I possesed by heart. Now there is no chance to remember them all there are thousands and most of them are irrelevant. The grown you has read hundreds of books, many more than the child you and the large set is harder to keep in focus and the brain begins to optimze by forgeting useless stuff.

#+end_quote

Intelligence in raw (crystalized+soft) terms is much higher in your adult life. You are a better problem solver.

#+begin_quote
  Have my learned patterns pruned my intelligence by making my life easier?
#+end_quote

Yes. And they will continue to until your 50s or so.

#+begin_quote
  Do I only seem smarter now, because some of the lessons life threw at me managed to stick?
#+end_quote

No. Your soft intelligence or transfer intelligence is higher now too.

#+begin_quote
  Do I learn new things faster now?
#+end_quote

Yes. Languages become easier to learn as adult provided you have learned languages as well as child and done some preorganization.

** No. The reason it can seem that way depending on how you list the data is that "intelligent" is a poorly-defined term. Children are typically more observant than adults, but less capable of reasoning about consequences. They are more plastic in the way that they think (more capable of picking up new mental skills or habits), but less able to make logical inferences and rule out classes of solutions at a time.

** Children have the same number of neurons as adults, but more synapses (i.e. more connections between neurons). This means more neuroplasticity - children are better learners than adults.

So yes, children might well be "more intelligent", depending on how you define that. I don't think that's a completely accurate picture, but it's pretty close to say that children are "as intelligent" as adults. Someone once said "a child is an adult with less experience".

You can certainly give a fairly good understanding of quantum mechanics to an eight year old, if you can get them to sit still long enough. You just have to start from first principles a lot more often than you would with an undergrad.

I have not listened to the podcast, they probably said most of this.

** Children tend to have greater neuroplasticity, partly due to age and partly also due to receiving genuinely novel stimuli on a /far/ more regular basis, and also, in the probabilistic sense, have /much/ less informative (ie: higher-entropy) priors.

To corrupt the work of Terry Pratchett a bit, children are better at First Sight, even while adults are better at Second Thoughts.
