I don't want to split the community, so feel free to bridge my chatroom to Discord. This looks like a good program for bridging: [[https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge]]

I've messaged the admins about this, I hope they respond soon.

*** because I like matrix, and I don't like Discord. I like open source software because for the purposes of rationality it makes it easier for me (and others) to map and modify what I observe, in terms of software.

***** Thanks!

However, I think at some point I ought to test my beliefs about free software. For example, I believe that proprietary software is often malware. I think I could test that by taking samples of popular software that is commercial, freeware, open source but nonfree, and free, and figuring out how many from each category contain features/antifeatures that I wouldn't like.

****** I don't think "malware" maps to "features that I don't like". Personally, I like Discord. Ideally, every program would be open source, but I feel like decentralized communities are bound to be smaller, and Matrix doesn't seem to have all of Discord's ease of use features (let alone video chat), so it's not a real competitor.

******* Eh, why should software compete? I like Matrix because it's free software. And someday, there will be a Matrix client comparable to what Discord is today, although I'm not sure whether it will ever surpass Discord, or whether by the time it's at today's Discord's level, Discord will be able to wash your dishes.

******** There is a limited amount of people, and a limited amount of time for those people to put into chat programs. It's not about who wins, it's about both userbases losing.
