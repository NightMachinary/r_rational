So I have been enjoying various uplift fiction stories e.g.

- [[http://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War]]
- [[http://www.paultwister.com][www.paultwister.com]]
- [[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/][www.schlockmercenary.com/]] (may not quite be considered uplift fiction)

So is there any of the opposite (preferably rational)?

Edit: Thanks for all the replies!

************ That's a defensible position. Certainly I enjoy the luxuries I currently experience, and would not like to lose them. But if I had never experienced them, my expectations and thus actual happiness would be different. There are many stories of Native American tribes who were able to easily convert white people to their way of life, and almost no stories of the reverse. Of course, that was two centuries ago, but I really don't think recent developments like the internet have altered cost/benefit tradeoff much for the better for modern civilization. Rates of mental illness are higher, experiences of loneliness and depression are higher, etc. Religion is more maintainable in small tribes or communities, and has many benefits for experienced well being. In small communities everyone can be unique and important. These aren't necessarily unanswerable arguments, but they're far from self-evidently incorrect ones.

And not even just technology, but philosophy. In a tribal society, physical strength rules and equality isn't even a fantasy. The enlightenment was a product of the wealth of western society, in the same way the bronze age was a product of the wealth of the first farming cities.

The things that make life anything other than "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short," are the products of modern society.

************** and what if small tribes did have access to modern wealth, technology and education? the reason that small tribes were so primitive is not because they were small, it's because they lacked the knowledge and resources necessary for a better quality of life.

and people are still living in tribes in the modern day. it's just that a lot of those tribes are much, MUCH BIGGER, and that might have something to do with issues like loneliness etc. (people feeling like they don't belong to their own tribe or something). That being said, having larger societies does have advantages. Like being easier to defend from other larger societies, or more social mobility--correct me if i'm wrong, but if you didn't like the people in your small tribe back when small tribes were a thing, you didn't necessarily have many other options. maybe just hope your small tribe encountered another small tribe which you liked more?

history is not a simple constant arrow of upwards progress. there are ups and downs. just because the present is much better than the past /on average/ doesn't mean that it's better in every way.

*** Both Anathem (Stephenson) and Dune (Herbert) posit worlds in which computers turn out to be so dangerous that the technology must be dramatically limited. In Anathem, programmers are separated from scientists, and both groups are forced to live apart from society in monasteries. In Dune, computers are considered anathema and an alternative set of technologies based on advanced human intelligence allows people to perform (somewhat) similar operations, like astronavigation. The Tripod Trilogy might also fit this (human technology suppressed by alien occupiers).

The universe of the Culture books (Banks) has a sort of technological high point in the distant past, but the level of technology in the books is still high. A technological fall is a pretty common trope in general (post-apocalyptic everything, also many fantasy books like Sword of Shannara or Prince of Thorns), but that might not be what you're looking for. Wheel of Time might also technically fit your criteria, as the "technology" there (more like magic) has fallen from a high point and must be rediscovered over the course of the novels.

***** This is exactly the scenario I considered in Set In Stone. Someone plugged me with a link earlier (which is how I found this thread.)

After colonizing an extremely metal-poor world, Humanity finally manages to create a stable, sane, AI, and convince it that humanity is required for it's long-term sanity. The AI, in turn, determines that humans are insufficiently sane. So it suppresses technology and engages in a very long term biological and societal experiment in an effort to reduce humanity's aggressive violent tendencies.

That's the backstory. The story itself is told from the point of view of a young swineherd with worrisome violent tendencies, who has to navigate through a scenario of potential war in a society that hasn't seen a war in a thousand years.

The story is a readable draft, but due to my change of career and working 80+ hour weeks for the last year or so, I have not edited it for publication yet.

***** Science Fiction tends to be written by people with big ideas, that don't like hewing to Malthusian principles or "appropriate technology", and if you extend the last thousand years forward you are going to assume that technology will (eventually) have an answer to every question and problem that it raises. By giving that up you are assigning an end date to the continued survival of the people who suffer under your restrictions.

So, some examples (none of which are particularly rational):

Anne McCaffrey's Pern was settled by Space Amish, colonists who deliberately selected a world that didn't have the resources (metals) to sustain an industrial society.

David Weber's Safehold books are about a colony world that lives in fear that the aliens who destroyed Earth and the other human colonies would come back for them and so ban anything that might lead to the re-development of radio.

David Brin's /The Practice Effect/ is a world where machines built under conventional physics have difficulty operating.

Niven and Pournelle's /Fallen Angels/ is Earth, after an anti-technology government took power in the US and banned space flight. It tells the story of two survivors of the International Space Station after they crash during a routine machine to skim atmosphere and resupply volatiles and how they get back into space. It's propaganda, but it's also fun :)

Sharon Shinn's Samaria (romance) novels are another colony world that was colonized by Luddites that wanted the pastoral ideal (with semi-mystical weather control).

Peter F Hamilton's /Night's Dawn/ trilogy has two examples, the human colonized world of Norfolk that prohibits most post-industrial technology and iirc one of the alien races they interact with has deliberately frozen their technology level. (I might be mis-remembering it but I think the Adamists also had some self-imposed limits on researching biology? Most of them found the Edenists unsettling and avoided researching anything that might rediscover the technology that set them apart?)

So it definitely doesn't entirely satisfy your general request, but a recurring theme in [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories][The Fall of Doc Future and its sequels]] is shaping the direction in which technology develops and suppressing certain technologies and aspects of society while improving things overall. It's in general much closer to uplift than downlift, but it's a very specifically shaped uplift in which certain things (including high frequency trading) are stomped on pretty hard.

****** There's a subgenre of rational fiction where an entity has alien values but rationally pursues their goals. So for example, if my main character had a value of "maximize the number of paperclips in the universe" I could write a rational story about that, even if it's a stupid value to have.

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/][See: Reactionary Philosophy in an Enormous Planetsized Nutshell]]. I think it's incorrect, but I will say that I think it's not /so/ incorrect as to be completely outside the bounds of what a rational person might believe.

** Stargate had 2 episodes about a race that did this in season 4 and 5 (spoilers as to how obviously).

The first episode was set 10 years ahead of the shows present time. The characters had contacted an advanced race called the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5gmcc4/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/daulxv5][Aschen]], who shared their technology with Earth. The Goa'uld are wiped out, the public transportation system uses personal teleporter pads, an anti-aging vaccine has been distributed worldwide, and the beginnings of a plan to turn Jupiter into a star are being discussed. One of the characters discover that the anti-aging vaccine has actually caused sterility in over 90% of the human population in a long term invasion plan by the Aschen. The characters use a time travel application of the Stargate to to warn their past selves, who receive a bloody note in their own handwriting telling them that under no circumstances to visit (address of the Aschen homeworld).

Next season, we see an example of another race who have been downlifted by the Aschen into a primarily agrarian society who export most of the food they farm to to the Aschen and who have no memory of ever having been an industrial civilization. The characters eventually discover some industrial ruins and a newspaper headline proclaiming "Aschen vaccine causes sterility", as well as realizing that the Aschen homeworld has the same address as the one they had been warned about in the bloody note.

Luckily, the Aschen are mostly quarantined since they only have a handful of Stargate addresses, and no way of discovering more (the SGC's database of addresses are the main thing they wanted to trade with Earth for).
