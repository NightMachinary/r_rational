Oh my god. You can't publish economics ey; think of the children.

edit// that warning makes much more sense after reading it, it does contain far to much economics

I'm posting it here so people can discuss the economic principles if they wish.

*** EY is advocating an economic school of thought called 'Market Monetarism' which is not agreed upon by all economists.

I'm not an expert and I don't know which is right, but some other schools of thought include 'Neo-Keynesianism' and 'Neo-Fisherism'.

It seems like the most likely 'Q' in EY's post would be the European Central Bank since in February they experienced deflation?

In my personal opinion I don't see much difference between 1% and 2% inflation, but when the prospect of deflation rises, that is the time to use all available tools (including ridiculing central bankers) to prevent deflation.

** Hrm. [[#s][Spoiler]]

[[#s][Spoiler]] Though that may not have been your intention but instead caused by me reading things into the story due to my own bias.

Other feedback would be that there was little in the form of suspense or interesting world building or really intriguing ideas and that the ending was a bit anticlimactic. Then again, an anticlimactic ending is pretty realistic in this situation.

All in all, I've read better short stories from you for free. But the fact that I greatly enjoyed those better short stories /and/ that this one was still decent even if not great mean that you definitely deserve what I happily paid.

** (Spoilers below.)

So, this was an interesting piece. I've been thinking a lot about "message fiction" lately, fiction that has a pretty clear message or idea or position or whatever that is trying to be communicated through the extended analogy or application or example that is the story. A lot of my favourite pieces of fiction are those that are convincing in conveying perhaps otherwise unintuitive concepts, or just those that aren't popularly held. It's satisfying to walk through concepts and their implications like that.

So the fact that this was an admitted failure at what was initially at least in part an attempt at producing a message fic of that kind makes it interesting. It isn't a complete failure - it still communicates a lot of ideas and I still found it a fun read, but I find myself getting a lot out of analyzing it, thinking about what the story was trying to do, what worked and what didn't, where it went to do so.

In terms of economics, it didn't seem to get that far with monetary policy except to point out that deflation was bad, and increasing the money supply could be a good way to combat it. I guess on the way there it did lay some groundwork on economic equilibria and unintended consequences through the kinda clunky analogical lecture midway through the story. Eliezer even got in a basic income plug in the welfare bit.

I think the story seemed to end up saying more about ethics and image though. Like, it made sure to touch base with consequentialism very quickly, which makes sense since it's the basis of ethical judgement for the duration of the story. But there are so many things that ended up being part of the story, the sexual masochism, the isekai visitor, hiding true identities, virtue signalling, being sane or having insight in an unopimized or insane world, what image to project in accordance with what you plan on doing and the importance of perception, all those pieces the story worked with and put together to make points about subjects often rather removed from one another. It was fun, but it was messy, and things weren't often all that interrelated. Repeatedly weirding out the prude mc with BDSM in your illustrative econ story is an interesting choice, and much of the story was like that.

I'm really glad it was made and released, anyhow. It's cool to get to see examples of early attempts at specific ideas, case studies of things that didn't work out exactly as intended, and it's fun to place it and what it does in context with the rest of Eliezer's output. Happy to have read it.

His solution of [[#s][Spoiler]]

That felt like it would have fit with the overall theme, and Elaine's comments about how the prince was a good person to ask after that other slave.

** I can't help thinking that Elaine's backstory is that of humanity being destroyed by an ai who sent each member of the race to a separate world sort of similar to Failed Utopia 4-2 only more drastic. Each was sent to the world where they would be able to achieve the most and/or receive the most satisfaction of their fantasies by an almost, but not quite, friendly ai.

Overall I feel that I would have preferred the story without the BDSM elements. They didn't seem linked with the rest of the plot. Of course I love economics and could cope with a story entirely devoted to it. Some might disagree.
