Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

Apparently. Unless /someone/ was wildly optimistic, and failed prey to some sort of fallacy involving planning.

If so, let me know and I'll send a private message with a link to the GDoc. (Genres: hard-SF, at least in the general direction of rational, and abstract horror.)

*** Not sure what your university is like but from my personal experience in my bachelor's I think the topic you choose is not as important as your supervisor: which supervisors are known to be good supervisors, which are known to be bad? Ask around with past students, they will have opinions.

I chose a bad supervisor for my bachelor project because he was a good lecturer and regretted it because he wasn't very supportive and didn't review my drafts in a timely manner. A friend chose a bad lecturer and I was shocked at his choice and he said that the reason she was a bad lecturer is because she focused all her attention on her students and as a result was a really good supervisor.

Of course I'm now thinking that if this is a six month research project you might not get a choice of supervisor and it might just be more like a paper that everyone in the class submits to the professor? Anyway, maybe someone else will benefit from this advice.

***** My advice was, "if you're working closely with a supervisor, pick a project to fit a good supervisor, rather than picking a supervisor for a good project". When I did my thesis each supervisor had a list of research interests and sample projects, not sure what the system is where you are.

*** I looked into it and the consensus on the "as seen on TV" laser hair removal tools is that they don't work very well and are basically a scam. The thought that convinced me was if those cheap, handheld devices worked every nail salon would have them and try to upsell you IPL with a pedicure. Even the one you linked below, the reviews are /very/ subjective and seem to mostly be from people who have only used it a couple of times: plenty of time for the placebo effect.

I had IPL done (I think about 7 or 8 treatments) and ~4 years ago and my hair is maybe a tiny bit thinner but not noticeably or conveniently so. I think it's because I cheaped out and got a groupon rather than going to a reputable place: a friend of mine is transgender and she got good results on her face with IPL. Also if you google for IPL horror stories you can see that people end up with horrible burns occasionally due to improper use of the equipment.

Basic things about the suitability of your personal hair for removal also need to be considered: the darker your hair and the lighter your skin the better results. I have dark hair and light skin and was not happy with my results, FWIW.

I've heard that getting electrolysis is really the only way to go for permanent results, but it's a lot more expensive and extremely slow (as someone basically uses electric tweezers to kill each individual follicle).

*** Any reason you're going the laser route as opposed to electrolysis?

From my research at-home is far less convenient (more pain and required repetition) and worse results. Unless you're intending to do very large areas, such as legs, I think the time to learn and inconvenience outweigh the cheaper cost.

*** Have you had the process shown to you by a professional? As I understand it [[http://www.hairremovalforum.com/laser-hair-removal-research/laser-hair-removal-scarring/137/][there's some minor risk of scarring]], but I suspect if you have a handle on the procedure, that will be minimised.

Assuming you've undergone some laser hair removal already, there might be an advantage to be had to hire a professional to set up the equipment with you, walk you through the process, how much time is required for your skin to recover, what to focus on for maintaining the machine, who to call for maintenance/repair, and so on.

Keeping in mind I've never read anything on this topic, I assume it's under the same constrains as other economic processes: bigger upfront cost, but lower long-term. What you save in money is partially paid in time and inconvenience. Also, whatever the tool costs, put aside some money for replacement, repair, and maintenance purposes, perhaps whenever you actually /use/ the machine.

Penultimately, you may want to set a reminder for in a year or two to make review and reevaluate if you're still happy with doing the removal yourself, or if the convenience of not having to set up the machine, going through the procedure, cleaning it, and finally putting it back in storage is worth the savings.

Lastly, take care whom you tell people you have such a machine, don't be surprised if people come to you to have their hair removed, and maybe be cross when you say no.

There's really no need for it to be much bigger. It basically just needs to be big enough to create a laser.

** Hah! Score one more point for the shower stall as an indispensable writer's tool.

For the last three days, I've known a few vague outlines of some ideas I want to write a story about, but couldn't come up with anything better than those blurry notions. Today, while I was thinking about them while shampooing my head, I finally identified what I wanted out of them, and in enough focus to combine them into a three-word premise. (Or, come to think of it, a different three words, if I'm allowed to use published authours' last names.) And now that I've done that, I'm extrapolating a host of details and new sub-ideas to play with.

I used an old outline as the basis for IO.SYS, and was starting to wonder if I'd need to look into creativity-workshop stuff to kick my brain back into gear. Now I've got my authorial confidence back. :)

(And /now/ all I have to worry about is whether I'll be able to tell the difference between "not depressed" and "manic-to-hypomanic state". But that's a much more tolerable problem than before, so no complaints. ;) )

*** The following two stories are ones that I typically recommend when someone wants to read about immortality, but I want to warn you that both stories have very dark and graphic themes such as violence, slavery, and depravity, Demon in particular. Demon has situations similar to Harry from HPMOR talking about using Hufflepuff bones as weapons, but more /graphic/. Fortunately, it's only described, not drawn in Demon.

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008HALNFQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Wild Seed]] - It's about how two immortals relate to each other as the only long-lived humans on the planet. They have major disagreements in how they each attempt to create fellow immortal companions and there are strong themes of slavery and unique usage of social power.

I bring this story up here because it really plays around with themes of immortality in novel ways, even if no one's obviously rationalist (just enlightened self-interest at best).

[[http://www.shigabooks.com/][Demon]] - Unlike many stories, Jimmy is a complete sociopath who can only care about his similarly sociopathic daughter. He can't die and, like Wild Seed, plays with the theme of immortality in very unusual ways I don't often see in other stories. A big part of the story is solving the logic puzzles in what is causing his inability to die.
