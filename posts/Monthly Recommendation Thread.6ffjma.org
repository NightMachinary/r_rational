** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6417590/1/What-I-Learned-at-SRU][What I Learned at SRU]] is a slice of life drama set in a college AU of Avatar: The Last Airbender. I know that doesn't sound very interesting, but for what it is, it's amazing. It takes characters that you already care about and want to just see interact with one another while they live their lives, and gives you exactly that without changing anything about them.

It's astonishing how thematically similar the story and characters are in a completely different setting. Even the addition of Aang/Toph actually perfectly suits their character dynamic and allows them to develop in similar ways to the show without retreading old ground. Sokka makes pop culture references, but every one of them sounds like a joke he would make and are just as funny!

I will argue that this is a rational fic given how well it handles its characters personalities and the fact that they are really good at thinking critically about each other and themselves, but I won't deny that the fundamental appeal of this story is friendship. You just get to see these people be good friends to each other, facing personal trials and tribulations, and it feels /really good/.

Maybe I'm just a depressed weirdo who likes to live vicariously through fiction due to insecurity about social isolation, but *dammit*, this story makes me happy and I want to share that happiness with others. It's not simple distraction from misery happy, either, seeing these characters tackle simple yet challenging personal problems makes me want to do the same and gives me the confidence to do so.

I literally started reading this the day after I graduated college (swell timing on my part) and despite my time at university being nothing like this I still adore it. I haven't even come close to finishing it and I have no idea whether it will leave a lasting impact on me or help me through this point in my life, but I haven't felt this much pure hope while reading a story in a /long/ time.

**** I've gotten surprisingly into the slice of life genre lately. I really liked the anime /K-On!/ and /Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid/, but SRU is on a whole other level. I honestly think I like this fic is as good as Netflix's /Master of None/, a show I absolutely love. In some ways I like SRU even more just because of these characters and comedy, as well as the fact there's so much more content at such a consistent level of quality.

***** “seeing these characters tackle simple yet challenging personal problems */makes me want to do the same and gives me the confidence to do so./*”

This is 100% literally the ENTIRE REASON the story exists, the reason almost all of my fiction exists, this is why I tell stories, I'm legit crying over here. I NEED to find a way to finish something I can actually publish because my fictional children have a job to do after I am gone and just goddamn.

All right. Got that out of my system.

SRU took 3.5 years to write. I went through a divorce, left my entire life behind, and started a brand new life, all while working on this story every week. A generous patron helped make SRU my full-time job for nearly two years, and helped me foster the over 300 piece art gallery the project has amassed (almost all of which by commission). I learned so much about myself and how I wanted to tell stories through this project, as well as how to collaborate with others to bring visions to life. It is an imperfect mess, an experimental mish-mash of so many things that express my love for these characters (later on I start introducing Legend of Korra characters, with Korra becoming a 6th main member of the cast). The story is a few years old now since completion, and it's so meaningful to know that even if its ramshackle state, it can still do what I set out to do with it.

I am revamping the story as an original series, very slowly, in the form of 'What We Learned at Rokudai,' (some of which is freely available on the net) a choice that was easy because the story and its characters were like children born of my DNA and the DNA of Avatar. In SRU, I'd argue the biggest issues with the story boil down to me trying too hard to reference the source material. I want to fix those problems, get rid of unneeded plot lines and characters, and add in brand new ones. I don't want to hide its genealogy, but I want it to grow into its own 'person,' in a sense.

Because of the scale of this narrative, and how many aspects need to be edited and modified, it's going to be a long time. But I still feel like this story can do what I meant for it to, if I can only get it to where it needs to go.

I hope you enjoy the rest of SRU for what it is. Thanks so much for sharing these supportive words on it.

****** I was torn over how to respond to someone who's written one of the few pieces of fiction that's had enough of an emotional impact on me that I regularly cry with feels and relish each moment. I didn't know whether to half-jokingly say "senpai noticed me!", go full fanboy over how I was hooked my this story because I already knew I liked these characters, or just praise the achievements you've made with this story and wish you luck. In the end, I settled on "thank you".

Thank you Destiny for making a story that I have already prepared a place for in my personal hall of fame. I'm autistic, so I sometimes have trouble feeling emotions and relentlessly berate myself for it because I probably have anxiety and depression. It's rare that a story comes along that reminds me that I can be happy even when life is hard. That difficult challenges, particularly social, are surmountable and I will find a way to do it.

Out of all the stories that have made me feel that way, though, yours is unlike any other. Every other one of them had some supernatural or sci-fi elements to them. Sometimes it was used as a metaphor for some personal conflict, other times it served to enable the plot and influence character development, but never have I /loved/ a story that had no fantastical elements at all. There's no escapism in SRU, not even in terms of romance, it's just...people, and somehow I can feel what they feel.

Maybe this clicks with me because it helps me understand how other people feel, or the characters are just so relatable that even someone like me can feel the way they do, but I've gotten as far as Katara and Toph rudely arguing about Toph's parents (it's heartbreaking) and my only issue with the fic has been the barely distracting typos. My life feels fuller just because I have read this story, so thank you Destiny and Godspeed...

...you know what, screw it! I was about to wish you on your way and go, but why should I? If there's one thing your story reminded me of it's the value of friendship, so Destiny, I would like to be your friend. Message me when you want to talk, friend me on Facebook, schedule time to hang out, whatever you'd like. I'm not going to gush over your work, we can just geek out over the dumb stuff we like. Even if you say no, I'm still proud of myself for having the confidence to do this.

** This was submitted as a thread 2 years ago, but I've been reading [[http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover][Maybe I'm A Lion]] and enjoying it. No particular familiarity with the source material needed - I've seen one Fate anime and that's it.

One thing that it does that I really like is that there are multiple smart characters who are wrong in their own ways, and as the point of view hops around, they point out the mistakes of the other characters (though rarely their own). Aside from making things easy for the reader, it's also really entertaining.

EDIT: eventually the pace became too glacial and I stopped reading. First 25 or so chapters still fully recommended.

If you're at all into anime, I strongly recommend checking out the ufotable Kara no Kyoukai adaptation. Not so much for the plot, but instead because it is visually gorgeous and the soundtrack is amazing. Also, Paradox Spiral (part five of the series) is just really neatly told and cut together in a really interesting way.

Ensou's [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-finely-honed-blade-worm-kara-no-kyoukai-garden-of-sinners.32454/][Worm/Knk crossover]] is not bad, but not as good as Maybe I'm a Lion. However, the update rate is frustratingly slow and extremely irregular.

Does it get any better in the later chapters, maybe? I'd really like to read a good Prototype fanfic but this ones suffers from a bunch of problems.

1) It's too stretched out. Especially when it's being told from the Blacklight-protagonist's perspective, it's full of these unnecessarily long introspective streams of consciousness that don't really add much to the plot development.

#+begin_quote
  God damn it, Lio! Enough of this emo shit
#+end_quote

2) Another problem is with way too many PoV switchings --- I don't care what's happening on some tangentially relevant government briefings or with some anime characters, I just want to read some literature-ised Prototype story from the perspective of the special infected.

3) Finally, the first serious fight (with helicopters and all) not only turns into a chain of what-an-idiot moments, but also pulls a bunch of Deus ex machina plot armors that make the already-powerful protagonist into a reassembles-from-ashes-level immortal, which just makes me lose all the remaining interest in the story.

Also, as a side note, maybe anyone knows any good Prototype stories to recommend?

**** It's a RPG-Mechanics Verse that knows well the universes it's sourcing from, it does a great job of deconstructing these universes and merging them together into a more detailed new one, it showcases many original and interesting solutions inside the new setting that are consistent with its laws. The protagonist has to work her way out of a pretty bad situation (recover her soul before dying) starting with rather limited resources. While it does have its idiot ball moments, there aren't too many of them.

All these are things I'm interested in, so the story is interesting to me too.

Though admittedly I don't like protagonist's flavour of morality, and there are some running gags that in my opinion partially spoil the story (e.g. how lawful goods keep interpreting her benevolent actions as those of an evil overlord, or how they keep seeing her as a perverted person despite her attempts to not appear as one, etc).

** I have only read a couple of things in the last month, and only one would probably be considered rational:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] is a Harry Potter fan fic where the only difference is that Hermione is exceptionally good at math(s). That fic follows the first four years in Hogwarts; the on-going followup [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]] is covering the final three years and is currently approaching the end of year 6.

I enjoyed it for the world building since there is a good bit of focus on rituals and spellcrafting, and seeing the small changes that add up to bigger deviations over time. There is also a lot of real life mathematical concepts at play, though it began going over my head for the most part after the first few years. Some of it is frustrating - I feel like a few of the choices the characters make are primarily made to keep the plot somewhat closer to the source material, rather than being based on what the characters would actually do. And I keep finding myself going "Kill the bad guys, you idiots!" but I suppose that's a bit out of character for the kids (though Harry and Hermione are getting closer to that point). Still, it was really enjoyable.

The only other thing I've been reading was an original work climbing the lists at topwebfiction.com called [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests/chapter/99919/prologue][Everybody Loves Large Chests]]. It's... well, not rational at all, but can be funny at times. Fair amount of explicit sex in it. The title itself is a play on the main character, [[#s][Spoiler]]. It reminds me of [[http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/1729/change-new-world/chapter/14075/prologue-summer-cicadas][change: new world]] which I reviewed a few months ago... except that one is really bad. I can't really recommend this one either, but it made for a decent change up. I probably won't finish it though.

Possibly this is because I don't really know the maths in question well enough, but I don't think the story would be materially changed if all references to maths were replaced with techno-babble and Hermione an intuitive magical genius.

The thing that would be interesting is precisely in what way magical rituals can be described by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)][actions]].

I think that's a fair criticism; the first has a lot more world building (though the latter does when it comes to alchemy) and slow build-up over time; the sequel is much more "She already knows all the stuff so it's nothing to just make up a bunch of new spells off the top of her head; let's get to the action!"

The narration is witty and the action is great; by her own admission Yue's not a powerhouse type, so she has to not only think fast but be unscrupulous when she fights. Currently, the story is finished with three cases and is on the opening chapter of the fourth case. A note, though, that it can be argued that while the style of the story is good, it's not really in line with the source material.

I would call this the best SAO fanfic out there; it's thoroughly and extremely well built. The characters authentically feel like a mix of gaming geeks and in-over-their-heads laymen that they should be, with all the different personal motives, objectives and conflicts that implies, and the game mechanics are explained logically and extensively (the author even built a conlang for the "language of magic" that fills the purpose the original source informed the audience about but never lived up to). The one criticism I've seen that's validly levelled at it is that its main characters are too smart for people who are ostensibly fourteen-year-olds at the start, but considering this subreddit's themes I don't think that'll be much of a problem here.

I brought this up in a previous recommendation thread but didn't get much attention, so I'll bring up again [[http://ebonyriddle.com/][E.B.O.N.Y. - The Weirdest Riddle Game On The Internet]]. As a riddle game, you are given riddles and you have to input the answer correctly into the URL to proceed. Those riddles aren't just trivia questions - you have to correctly figure out the train of logic that's being asked of you before you can get anywhere. And unlike other riddle games, its storyline is both coherent and an intriguing thing. That said, the first few levels might not look like much - I would point to Level 10 as the closest taste of some of the brain-wranglers you'll be forced to go through later in the game. (Also, a warning that some screen settings might not let you see parts of images properly, like if you have high brightness and low contrast.)

** I'm tentatively recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9740933/1/Fate-Revelation-Online][/Fate Revelation Online/]]. After the events of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate/stay_night][/Fate/Stay Night/]] (the Fate route), Illyasviel persuades Shirou to play virtual reality video games with her. But unfortunately, when the two of them log onto [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online][/Sword Art Online/]] for the first time, they find themselves trapped in a death game just like everybody else.

What follows is a frankly impressive deconstruction and reconstruction of both FSN /and/ SAO, which are both close to irrational by definition. FSN is set in a world of mysticism (the less-understood and well-known the magic, the better) and traditionalism (the older the magic, the better), and Sword Art Online features a villain without a motive, acting because the plot demands it.

In contrast, FRO features a large cast of characters who apply critical thinking, doing everything in their power to escape their ignorance (magical or otherwise), acting intelligently to pursue their varied goals - and the villain is no different. FRO moves beyond the stations of canon as it goes on (or at least, where it does stick to the stations, it justifies them in a way that SAO never did), and features strong characterization.

There are more chapters available on Sufficient Velocity and on The Fanfiction Forum (where the author also openly posts his notes and outlines, which are a treat to read).

I wouldn't say FSN is inherently irrational, the setting just runs on narrativium- the thing that works best is literally the thing that makes the best story. Also- intentionally or not- it does end up subverting a large majority of the standard epic story tropes ("King" Arthur is really a girl, the first legendary hero is actually a complete bastard, the Holy grail, the protagonist is actually complete dogshit at being the hero, etc.)

Well, sort of?

The setting has room for instrumental rationality, but the core problem is the essential nature (and conservation of) "mystery". Magecraft fundamentally draws power from consensus reality, and thrives in ambiguity; it is a "god of the gaps" argument writ large. When things run on narrativium, they run that way because humans love stories, and that love gets carved into the world.

But you probably know that already, or know better than me; I'm not a full Nasu maniac.

Eventually they go out looking for immortality by deed, Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh gets sad and terrified by the prospect of his own death. He decides to go looking for immortality in truth, completely fails at finding it, but gets a plant that reverts aging as a consolation prize. By this time, he's become wiser, so instead of hoarding it, he decides to share it with the elders of his city. Unfortunately, a snake steals it, and he goes back to the city, only to find that his newfound wisdom and experience, not to mention lack of dickishness, has granted him the immortality in deed he longed for when he set off at first.

At least, that's what I remember.

If you expect each chapter of the story to directly build up an overall plotline, this story may be too slow paced.

** Tentative recommendation of the RWBY/Exalted crossover Miracles of Ancient Wonder (on spacebattles). It's not really rational, given that it has Exalted as its main characters, but I liked the writing well enough. Other than that, if you've read Worm, I would recommend A Cloudy Path. I just reread up to the end point, and other than a few bumpy spots, it's probably the closest fic to canon quality and length. If you haven't read Worm, then read that first. (Or don't, I'm interested to see what you can gleam about canon from a piece of fanfiction. Not that that would necessarily be in your best interest.)

***** The main one for this sub is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][Two Year Emperor]], which is even linked on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][the wiki]]. Guy gets sucked into a dnd setting under rules as written, and as he learns how to horribly game the rules he's faced with obstacles sufficiently overwhelming to keep tension even as the power levels skyrocket. It doesn't quite have the 'from nothing' thing because he starts as the absolute ruler of a major nation, but it's still quite good.

The second one I can recommend is [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents][I'm a Spider, So What?]], where a magic duel of destiny between the Hero and Demon Lord culminates in an explosion that crosses dimensions and kills a high school classroom in a modern world, and the protagonist is reincarnated into said fantasy world as a weak spider monster. If you're looking for 'from nothing' stories, this is /very much/ it and I've found it to have excellent pacing as the protagonist grows stronger against all odds.

The last one off the top of my head is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/comments/5xh4o7/chapter_0/][The Snake Report]], which was linked from here recently. Much like /I'm a Spider, So What?/ the protagonist is reincarnated into a fantasy world as a weak snake monster and forced to survive against all odds. The main difference is that /The Snake Report/ feels much more frantic, as the protagonist's actions often have unintended and just as deadly consequences and he's constantly trying his hardest to keep on top of everything that's going on, with varying success. For what it's worth, I found /I'm a Spider, So What?/ more exciting and /The Snake Report/ more amusing, but both definitely worth reading.

EDIT: Read further and a few chapters /later/, there's a throwaway comment about how you [[#s][spoiler]]. Still annoying to read though, since you don't know if it's an oversight or the character's just that dumb.

Also, massive points loss for not checking if there's an "enhance intelligence" skill.

Portal Fantasy(isekai) where the MC from our world and time is transported to another world with 17th or 18th century technology. He uses his very general knowledge of science to get an edge up and help an ireland-analogue to defeat some invading english/turk-analogues. Last book/4 should be coming out in a month or two.
