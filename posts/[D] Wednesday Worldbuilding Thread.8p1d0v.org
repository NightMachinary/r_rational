Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Fifty feet above the ground is an aetheric layer, which some materials have certain interactions with. Fifty feet above that is another, and another, until you're up so high that you can't breathe the air.

One of the things that interacts with this aetheric layer is a special type of paint, which passes through the layers only reluctantly. In many ways, painting the bottom of a ship or other object allows some semblance of buoyancy, allowing the aetheric layers to be treated as water which ships and other things can travel across with only some token friction to overcome. From a Doyalist standpoint, this is all largely in service of having floating islands and skyships.

What I'd like some help with is:

1. the exact physical properties of the paint so that it's usable by humans in ways that roughly relate to real-world transport over water
2. knock-on effects of having these aetheric layers
3. neat things that flora, fauna, and people could do with them, assuming different types of interaction
4. some engineering to make use of them, given sufficiently defined properties (especially moving between layers, which I don't have good ideas for - initial thought was a painted grappling hook thrown up fifty feet to the next layer, but it would take some math to see how much the aetheric layers can "support" to see whether that would work, and you'd also have to have some way of getting down, like I guess putting it in a sack and dropping with a parachute?)

Right now I have a specific way that the world looks in my head, but I don't think that it would survive scrutiny, and there are probably some neat things that could arise from exploring the premise of having different layers that give something like buoyancy.

*** You could treat the aether like a layer of water in a different universe, and the paint causes materials to bridge universes. Then things float in the aether because they are literally buoyant from displacing the aether on the other plane. A sinking ship falls through a layer and lands on the next one, with all the consequences you'd expect from dropping a ship fifty feet into water. The problem with this approach is that you then have to worry about gravity on this other plane--why doesn't the aether pool into the oceans, as water does on Earth? I'd be tempted to make the layers perfectly spherical to simplify things, but gravity on Earth isn't spherical. There will be a sort of 'gravitational current'. Anything floating on aether will slowly gather where gravity is highest in our universe, assuming that gravity in the other universes is spherical. It will be dispersed by wind as well, though.

As for flora and fauna, I'd consider sky-fish at least. They swim through air and aether, and can jump from layer to layer when needed by swimming fast. I would avoid putting plants in the aether unless you want your world to be perpetually darkened by mats of greenery on high layers.

Grappling hook... how about a painted umbrella that folds out after being thrown, trapping the aether against whatever surface forms the bottom of its layer in the other universe? Although, it's essential that aether trapped at the bottom of its layer can escape somehow. Otherwise, a descending vehicle will be hindered by pockets of aether forming on its hull and stopping its descent, or damaging the paint at least.

Ships could ascend with the help of balloons inflated at higher layers. Attach an empty aether balloon to a mast (or an air balloon) and bring it above the aether layer above you. Inflate it easily. Pull on it with a rope and the aether buoyancy allows you to lift yourself. Aether rowboats with a pully system allow even large ships to move up a layer: someone goes up a layer ahead of the main ship and keeps inflating balloons until the main ship can crank itself up. Descending is trickier, but probably involves the same thing except the ship opens a hole in the bottom so it can sink through the layer.

Expect every ship to have multiple small buoys inside, so that the crew can easily read the level of aether inside the ship.

Rope towers supported by aether buoys at each layer are a possibility. My intuition is that a rigid tower with buoys on multiple layers won't shoot off into the sky when detached (since buoys entering a layer from the bottom have to lift pressurized aether out of the way) but don't quote me on that.

Travel by aether would change the face of the planet. Harbors don't occur in bays--they occur on hilltops and plateaus just below a high layer, which is more convenient for access, but not so high that other ports are many layers removed. Maybe civilizations would have conventions for layers as well: every fourth layer is for traveling north, the one above that for west, etc. Jet streams aid in shipping, assuming ships can go that high.

*** Idea: For natural floating islands, you want the floating effect to be caused by a mineral of some sort.

The most primitive way to use it would be to carve a raft/canoe directly from that mineral.

Next would be to just put chunks of that mineral in ballast tanks.

Finally(?) would be turning the mineral into sheeting/paint to cover a skyship hull.

*** You could have the layers being something similar like surface tension. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRw0ttUuTX4]]

1. And the paint would be something like hydrophobe paint. Like water strider.

2. It totally depends what is affected by the layers. I would guess the weather and clima would be different. There could be small dust clouds which keeps countries in darkness (Or they need to remove it). Everyone thinks the 'surface' is just another layer, with huge landmasses and is looking/digging for a way down

3. Fauna could be walking on the air (like water striders). Flora (trees) could get huge by using the layers to distribute the weight and for stabilization. They would have many leaves and twigs at each layer. Maybe Humans steal water from the trees.

4. Well, humans don't need to fly too high. They could just use mountains and buildings (or megaflora) for ascending. Or big ballons with ropes that put some painted platforms in the next layer. Going down would be first by putting the platforms next to them and then removing the painted hull somehow (rotating them inside for example) and then lowering with ropes.

Hooks could be used to crash an enemy ship above you. Or maybe paint that overrides the effect of the ship.

Also keep in mind how your ship looks like. If you want something like a shiphull, the aetheric layers have to be deformed by the ship. If it doesn't deform you would only have flat bottoms. Maybe hydrofoils (water wings) are also a thing and use the deformation to be more stable and have more buoyancy with less surface area. And 50 feet is not high (trees can get that big), I would expect ships to have some redundancies by being in multiple layers at the same time. Maybe only with ropes. Of course, it all depends what you want your ships to look like. Most people who read about sky islands will suspend their disbelieve to have ships fly in air. And maybe, they wouldn't like to have something that doesn't look like a ship. So keep that in mind, if you are writing for an audience.

If you have floating islands, are some of them natural, if so then I would Guess there is some sedimentary or igneous element that when a smooth enough layer is formed, and eventually pushed up to the right layer can be sheered off a mountain to make a floating island. Does the layer have currents, or is it just wind powered? Do the layers fluctuate and make floating islands bob in the air? Is the floating element sedimentary and too much wind can erode the bottom of an island and drop it out of the sky, or is it like slate making the bottom of the islands flat?

*** Are the aetheric layers bordering each other or do we have a thin aetheric layer then a gap of normal air, then another aetheric layer?

If it's the latter your ships would function more like submarines than ships and would need a way to change their buoyancy on command.

If it's the former, you get some really interesting (and cool) physics as any parts of the painted hull that passes through the layer no longer provides buoyancy. On a ship with a roughly triangular cross section the amount of surface area that is in contact with the water surface doesn't increase when it sits deeper in the water, so such as ship would either sit with just the point of the keel in the aetheric layer (if its load is light enough) or fall right through it.

You'd want your ships to either have a flat bottom and sort of skid over the layer or have a cross section that becomes flatter near the top, such that the surface area in contact with the layer increases the more stuff you bring on board (something like this [[https://i.imgur.com/fhg7kN4.png][incredibly advanced technical drawing]])

Edit: As for changing layers: If you want to go with the grappling hook route, you would need a grappling hook that has the same amount of surface area in contact with the layer as the ship itself (which is probably not feasible) and a way for the ship to generate enough power to lift itself up fifty feet. Why not have floating islands (or even man build stations) that can lift ships up to a higher layer with ropes and pulleys?

Going down is much easier, just have a bunch of panels in your hull that can flip over or slide away so the paint on the hull is no longer in contact with the aether (and also make your ship sturdy enough to survive a fifty foot drop, which is probably not easy for heavier ships).

** I'm not sure if this goes in the World-building thread, but I would like to talk about stories with a world where there is one single government that has united every nation under a single authority.

How realistic is this and will it ever happen in real life? I'm thinking that it will never happen on Earth, but if we expand to another world, then it's plausible that the planet is entirely under the domain of...let's say the American government (or at least until they rebel against America, just like how America rebelled against the British). It would make sense for a single planet to be under one government if a single nation did all of the work from terraforming the planet to sending colonists there.

*** I think you need some degree of sociocultural homogeneity for it to actually work, and failing that, then either enormous amounts of force projection, or enough agreement on the question of "what should the government do" that you can get unified authority.

I think America is a decent example of how it might work in the real world. /Originally/ it was thirteen states who banded together to form the United States, with a pretty weak federal government. If you look at the powers as enumerated in the Constitution, and as actually exercised by the early government, they were a shadow of what we see today. So you have people bonding together for things that it's better to do mutually, then gradual escalation of powers until the government has a finger in every pie. Add in a Civil War that prevents the breakup of the union, some bumps in the road with things like the Slaughter-House Cases, some propaganda and foreign affairs to set yourself against, and eventually you get people who consider themselves "American" first and "Ohioan" second (if at all).

I'm under the impression that the EU is a somewhat similar story, though I'm less well-read on the subject, and much less current. It's also a much sloppier mess, [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Supranational_European_Bodies-en.png][as the EU Venn diagram]] shows.

It's not really.

We've never had a common enemy (except maybe USSR / Russia if you stretch it), and so far the EU has no power to infringe on its members' sovereignty, unlike the federal US government. Most of what the EU does is economic regulation and coordination, which is useful, but not really identity-building. So people in eg Germany are German first, and European a very distant second, even though they can travel to any EU country.

Not sure how well that helps with OP's question.

*** It's fairly likely to happen in real life if we don't kill ourselves first. Just consider the historical trend from tribes to kingdoms to empires to nations to multi-national pseudo-countries like the European Union. There are currently 196 countries in the world. According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1900][this list]], there were 234 countries in 1900. Some current countries may split, but the overall trend is likely to continue with countries being annexed by their neighbors or voluntarily incorporating into a larger and more powerful supranational union which gradually hybridizes them politically and culturally into a single state.

In real life, we've seen the European Union begin the process of transforming Europe into a united military entity without internal borders. The same process is taking place with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_American_Nations][Union of South American Nations]], though they do not yet have a shared currency. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation][Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] is the beginnings of the same process in Eurasia, with a united military, though shared borders and currency are still in development. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union#Current_issues][African Union]] is even further behind and just beginning the process of uniting Africa, with the aim of creating a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_Africa][United States of Africa]]. Given 100-200 years, I expect we'll see Africa, South America, Eurasia, and Europe largely incorporated into supranational entities. When we're down to <10 countries, the role of the United Nations will likely start to transition towards the next level of supranational union.

** I'm working on a magic system based on stoic physics intended for a wuxia-esque setting. (TLDR the universe is made of pneuma in various configurations and states of tension, corresponding to (in increasing order of complexity) stuff, living things, sentience, and logic. Another important trait is that metaphysical concepts exist materially)

Basically, by using some philosophical insight that coincides with the discovery of bronze, people can learn to sense and sympathetically manipulate the structure of the pneuma that makes up reality with mental exercises. The exact nature of the insight isn't known in-setting, with each discoverer only managing to reduce the key to their new power down to essentially a short religious/philosophical text.

This sympathy only works on lower orders of pneuma than the manipulator. As adepts grow more skilled, they can affect lower orders of pneuma. Any manipulation is mentally draining, which can be mitigated with practice.

Psyche (nervous system): self- the most basic form of magic, completely instinctive to anyone who can manipulate pneuma, is causing the nervous system to correspond to their thoughts directly, essentially granting low-end bullet time.

sense- once they can manipulate pneuma, they can let existing pneuma affect them, which gradually develops into a pneuma sense, eventually granting instinctive spatial awareness.

other- an obscure use due to the relative rewards of focusing on manipulating the next level of pneuma, the user can affect the nervous system of others on contact. They might be able to cause spasms, light nerve damage, or with great skill, paralysis

Physis (body) self- by maintaining a strong self-image, the adept can resist and regenerate from harm or foreign magic. change- take on the physical traits of other lifeforms. largely based on trial and error to find stuff that actually works. Will very rarely be heritable. other- makes the adept's blows harder to resits or regenerate. Ubiquitous in agriculture to enhance crops, rarely used on trained animals

Hexis (matter) self- autokenisis, limited by preconceptions infuse- imbue nearby objects with the patterns of other things (ie: fire aura/sword) requires

This is set a few centuries after the initial discovery, in an otherwise bronze age world

*** Given it's easier to affect higher orders of pneuma one implication of your setting ought to be that people would very quickly realize that controlling others logic would be basically the easiest possible thing if they didn't also know how to manipulate pneuma (after controlling your own logic which would probably be the easiest thing to do by far, though perhaps not if that tended to mess with your focus).\\
So that would seem to make mind control something that very quickly reshapes the world into centralized governments since mind controlling the untrained should be much quicker and easier than teaching them how to defend themselves against that.

*** Yes an no. Crivtox is right you need a switch, so you can make something statefull instead of something analog. Though if you google universal Turing machines and the game of life, or the relevant [[https://xkcd.com/505/][XKCD comic 505 A bunch of rocks]] it's just a matter of how many switches you have and how long it takes the switches to operate.

As a thought, you have, I think five elemental chi's? Regulating pulse length intensity to make a single constaint "bit" size would probably be inhumanly hard, cue your Zener diode filter equivalents and no clue how you'd make an inverter but you might make your transistor eventually by having some form of reliable, reversible elemental interaction, though that requires multiple chakra natures. I think you'd want to make the first transistor a little complicated, and make the character work hard from there on a lot of drugery if you want EE or comp/sci types to not lose suspension of disbelief. As seals do things in the real world it can go way past S rank once you can make a seal that that both adds parallel computing power to make and design seals and remakes itself. That said, designing it or programming in it would be the work of several life- times even for experienced programmers and EE types. Look at the amount of computational theory that had to be developed, the automation and man years that goes into designing hardware for chips with 7nm logic gates, and the low level software before someone wrote the first [[https://qntm.org/ragdoll][quine (warning 6 chapter into Ra)]].

If your character isn't a hacker/hardware enthusiast/martial artist thrust back into the Naruto verse after a rigorous bachelors level of Compsci and Microprocessor design masters (they know assembly an can write more than a c-- compiler and know a lot of low level chip design) you are going to need a team, though I could see a time braid Daemon backed Akasuki machine being one of these.

Edit: Sorry for the wall of words. TL/DR Assuming no and waving:

- You need chakra switches, and they probably won't be the same as transistors, but you'd be able to use them for everything from there.

- You might need storage but storage isn't that hard and you might just keep things in memory, but that's design intensive.

- Everything from there is scale, design time, and programming (more on that below).

- It'd be several years of Godawful nigh impossible, persnickety work even if you were a top of the line grad student or professional microprocessor designer.

- It'd be several lifetimes of work from first principles.

- It'd be impossible to do by hand.

** I'm a bit late to this one, but I'd rather not wait till next thread rolls around, so I'll try my luck and see if anyone responds.

My question revolves around the definition of "solveable mysteries". For example, suppose there's a world in which an unknown and half-insane god grants people boons. He doesn't grant them to everyone, but to a select few based on insane, eclectic criteria that may even change over time. It's so nonsensical that it may as well be random, and since the god is unknown, people think that the boons are random.

My question is this, should the author of this world and the story that takes place in it know the criteria that the god uses? Is it not rational anymore if the author doesn't, and maybe even decides to treat such a thing as random?
