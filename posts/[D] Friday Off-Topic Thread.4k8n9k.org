Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** My job allows me to listen to a lot of audiobooks on the clock. Coincidentally, the Starship Troopers audiobook is available on youtube.

It's pretty good. The movie seems like it pokes fun at the fascist human society it portrays, but the book lacks that parody element. It's not persuasive as in makes you think fascism ain't so bad, but it makes the world seem much more plausible, and the citizen/resident distinction is well explained within the culture of the world. There also aren't any technologies that should transform society but mysteriously don't, like the resurrection tubs the movie added for no apparent reason, and the scifi tech that does exist leads to societal changes that make sense. I recommend it. Good book. Also the first time I've come across power armour in fiction and liked it.

*** /Starship Troopers/ (the book) is definitely soaked in militarism and while I agree that it's not really going to persuade anyone towards fascism, it does portray fascism is a pretty positive light. It's hard to know what Heinlein was saying with that though; whether he's making a full-throated endorsement of fascism or just trying to steelman it. I'm sure if I read more biography of him that would be clear, but I don't really care to. (Reading more Heinlein didn't really help me, because he took a turn somewhere in his life and became much more leftist.)

The translation it made to film is one of the most fascinating ones out there, because while there are a lot of movie that aren't faithful adaptations, and a lot of movie that change the moral, there are relatively few where this happens for ideological reasons. Verhoeven grew up in Nazi-occupied Netherlands, so had some problems with military fascism (to put it lightly).

**** That is interesting about Verhoeven. I just assumed it got a typical Hollywood makeover to maximize entertainment value. But a director who changes the political message on purpose while leaving most of the action and dialogue intact, that grabs my attention. I'm going to have to google me up some more on this.

**** From what I understand he actually shifted to the right as his life went on. The left-wing books are the earlier ones. Although he never really settled on any one ideology. Almost every book seems to explore a slightly different one. A hatred of communism and a general tendency towards sexual liberalism were his only consisted features as far as I can see.

** So, is anyone else playing Stellaris?

My experience with it so far has been fairly positive, though I haven't been able to put in as many hours as I'd like. It does feel like there's a lot of room for additions and improvements, but other than a few bugs I've run into (nothing terribly game-breaking), it's a great 4X.

I do run into the problem I normally have with 4X games, which is that I find the early parts (dominated by exploration and capture of resources) more enjoyable than the later parts (diplomacy and warfare). I don't think that's a result of anything Stellaris does though, that's just how I am with any sort of game like it.

*** I did.

I played it a lot at first, so it's not terrible, but after the first 2 games I lost motivation.

The writing is pretty great, but once you've seen a lot of the events, that's over and you notice that the game is pretty threadbare. There just isn't much to do.

The aliens are all the same. Yes, they look pretty different, but they're pretty much the same. There are no radically different playstyles. I would say less difference between nations than there is in CK2 or EU4. There is no real character to these randomly generated races. It's just a bunch of bonuses randomly assigned to a cool portrait.

- The fighting system is not that great. It's very hard to understand what is going on and most wars are decided in the first big engagement. (After the parties get done playing cat-and-mouse.)

- There should be a lot more events happening in the midgame. There is a lot of exploration stuff early and some late-game stuff, but inbetween it gets pretty boring.

- Sectors don't work correctly. Their AI is pretty dumb, bu what's more, they don't build robots or enact Edicts or even build out spaceports. So you still need to access all those planets, which are now hidden in the UI or remember where they all are on the map.

- You can't order a new fleet at once like you can order an army template in EU4. It gets really annoying in big empires to get a new fleet up and running. Especially since most of your ports are in sectors.

- Armies are even more annoying, since you can put attachments on them, but that has to be done for every unit separately. It's also kind of opaque on how many units you need and I don't feel like better army technology brings me much. The hard part is beating the enemy fleet and not the invasion of planets.

- I'm sure eventually, with a couple of expansion packs, all this gets improved, but currently, I'm done after about 30 hours.

They have actually helped me defensively on a couple of occasions. The AI doesn't plan around 12 Xenomorph garrisons; it will sometimes land doomed invasions and then have no backup plan when they fail, leaving me time to get a doomstack ready.

*** I have been, overall I think its pretty decent right now and has an incredible amount of potential.

The biggest issue for me is that the empire doesn't feel like it has a real internal life. For example, in Victoria II and Crusader Kings II you really get the sense that their is a civilization and then there is you. You are trying to steer this civilization, but it has its own interesting dynamic behaviour that you have to work with and understand in order to accomplish anything. Its very different than, say, Civilization and 4Xs in general where you're basically a God emperor who extracts resources from the "civ/empire" that doesn't actually have a genuine civ/empire being simulated underneath.

Right now I can see sectors and pops giving that potential for internal life (and, in fact, its not completely devoid of internal life as it is). But as it stands the sectors make it feel a bit like you're the God Emperor who got a little lazy.

That said I like Stellaris for the reasons I love Civ. And, based on the already scheduled updates and my expectations of Paradox, I'm looking forward to loving what Stellaris will become.

*** I've been playing it, and yeah, it has the 4X problem in spades. Part of it is the lack of events (they're going to fix that in the somewhat-near future), part of it is that the micromanagement isn't very interesting, and part of it is the tech tree.

I actually think it's quite a clever bit of game design to have three random research options, and three simultaneous research threads. It means you can get drawn in interesting directions instead of following an optimal "build", and it means more things happening at once. But all that is undone by having most techs be /dreadfully/ boring, and by the humongous amount of time they all take.

I am cautiously optimistic about its long-term future, once updates, DLCs and mods have done their work. It might take a while though. And I'm not sure they'll be bold enough to prune the tech tree, so we may be stuck with that.

I recently tossed some photos from a few of the hikes I've done in recent years on [[https://imgur.com/a/SA96g][imgur]] and felt like sharing. What are y'all's favorite hikes? Where will your future outdoors adventures take you? I think the nicest places I've been would include the Sierras, Northern Arizona, the (US) Pacific Northwest, and the South Island of New Zealand (sadly, my camera broke a fifth of the way into my backpacking trip in the latter, so I don't have too many pictures from there). My next stops will be Iceland, the Scottish Highlands, more of the Pacific Northwest, and maybe parts of SE Asia.

We did that three or four times a summer when I was a kid. Southern Minnesota tends to be more farmlands, which are vital to the state economy but quite boring.

** /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30200089][Life After Life]]/ is a /vaguely/-interesting time-loop story, [[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/life-after-life-kate-atkinson/1112411960?ean=9780316230803][available for three dollars from Barnes & Noble]]. It's written in a weirdly-disjointed way, it has more characters than I'm reliably able to remember, and its protagonist doesn't start to recall her past loops (beyond sudden premonitions of terror) and make plans for exploiting future loops until literally the last few pages of the book. Really, most of it is a slice-of-life story from approximately 1910 through 1950. It's a gigantic bait-and-switch, for someone who, after reading the summary, is expecting /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ or /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ or at the very least /[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]]/. It's one of those stories after whose reading I feel disgusted with myself for not having found a better way to spend a few hours. Still, I found it just barely fun enough to be worth three stars on Goodreads--and, if you want something approaching one hour of entertainment for every dollar of expenditure, it provides a nice value for your money.

- ★★★★★ = awesome enough to be read many times (e.g., /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/: "That was incredible! I can't wait to read it again!");\\

- ★★☆☆☆ = boring enough that I give up partway through (e.g., /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816][Cryptonomicon]]/: "I think I should cut my losses here."); and\\
- ★☆☆☆☆ = unbearable enough that I shudder away from it almost immediately (e.g., /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071][Harry Crow]]/: "Ugh.").)

** I've been reading through Diane Duane's Young Wizards series and loving it (so many feels!!), but there's an aspect of the setting I'd like to nitpick: the lack of communication. The Powers That Be rarely tell wizards what to do, or even directly notify them that they have work. Nita and Kit just look at their manuals and say, "Look! We're on active status, there must be something important to do," and go searching for it. Wouldn't it make more sense to be more direct?

The Powers aren't the only guilty ones, I'm surprised at how unorganized wizards are considering their goals of universal preservation. They do coordinate with each other sometimes, but so far it's seemed more along the lines of friends helping each other out with problems that are usually mutual. New wizards are all but forced to face their Ordeal alone, even when Seniors are consulted they usually just provide advice rather than direct assistance.

Lastly, I have no idea why wizards haven't told everyone about wizardry and the Lone Power. I understand minimizing outside influence on Earth, disrupting the natural order causes entropy, but wouldn't telling people the truth make the prevention of entropy easier? Aliens know about wizards, which does make errantry easier to do. Humans will presumably make contact with those aliens someday, so would hearing it from them make it easier to accept?

*** I am pretty sure I could come up with mind-caulk explanations for all of this given a huge amount of time and effort, but I essentially agree - Young Wizards makes 'sense' in that special YA Fiction sense where every single thing makes some sort of sense in it's own limited context if you don't think about it at all but when you go to consider everything as a whole everything stops making sense and is nonsense instead. The Powers give tons of obscure prophecies that are pointlessly obscure, are excessively cryptic, and are in person extremely odd.

Other weird bits:

- the demographics. One part basically stated there are something like 1/10 human people as wizards, which is crazy because no maskerade would survive where everyone's extended family contains between 2-5 wizards. On the other hand, another part implied 1/10000 - which is extremely different and much more reasonable, but at the same time why are two seniors and two junior wizards in walking distance of each other? Also, the characteristics of Wizards, from the book, are not that rare.

- The wealth. Fred materializes stuff worth approximately $FUCKOFF in Book 1, and nobody cares or tries to use that stuff to quit their day jobs to devote themselves to wizardry or even just donate it to charity - Star Sapphires, Lear Jets, cars, I think gold, etc. Book 3, we get aliens and other worlds and interstellar travel, but no-one is making mad bank off of any of the obvious possibilities.

- The time use: Wizardry is done by guys in their spare time when they can be bothered and peoples' school or jobs are not keeping them too busy, even when the fate of the world or universe is at stake. Seriously, WTF is this? Why aren't the superstar wizards who are going to have thier powers degrade in a few months excused class for the duration? Why are super advisory wizards who control time and teleporters also selling ad space on the radio?

- Why the fuck are Cats wizards and also fully human intelligent... but also apparantly cats and happy being domesticated and e.g. spayed/neutered and otherwise being exactly like our cats within human society?

- Do wizards not find it super fucking creepy to eat things that can talk to them?

**** Some of those plot holes are filled. Wizards are forbidden from creating money except in extreme emergencies, which I completely agree with given my knowledge of economics. I think the issue with the animal characters is that they're a little too human, they're all but stated to be sentient with their own societies that all happen to be aware of wizards. Creatures used to make food, however, do accept their fate, which I like because it's an alien psychology that can be explained by domestication.

I don't think the time use is nearly as big a plot hole as the fact that younger wizards are expected to use their power so much more. The nature of destiny in the story implies that a wizard will usually be available to solve an important problem, it's the fact that children are expected to go on these adventures themselves that befuddles me. Harry Potter actually had better justifications for why kids were going on adventures and fighting evil, and had a lot of mundane stuff to do when they weren't.

  and are in person extremely odd.

Well that, at least, /isn't/ at all nonsense. The Powers are /not/ human. Try squeezing a few fingers into a sockpuppet and using it to do an impression of a dog to talk to the dogs about dog problems. /That's/ the Powers trying to talk to humans.

  Why the fuck are Cats wizards and also fully human intelligent... but also apparantly cats and happy being domesticated and e.g. spayed/neutered and otherwise being exactly like our cats within human society?
#+end_quote

I was under the impression the cats view domestic cats as slightly weird, and actually have a third gender-concept particularly for spayed-or-neutered cats of either sex.

  The time use: Wizardry is done by guys in their spare time when they can be bothered and peoples' school or jobs are not keeping them too busy, even when the fate of the world or universe is at stake. Seriously, WTF is this? Why aren't the superstar wizards who are going to have thier powers degrade in a few months excused class for the duration? Why are super advisory wizards who control time and teleporters also selling ad space on the radio?
#+end_quote

Yes, this is an actual plot hole. Except for Tom and Carl. I was always under the impression wizardry was their primary thing and the ad-space and writing was basically just part-time work designed to bring in monetary income and support their real jobs.

  Do wizards not find it super fucking creepy to eat things that can talk to them?
#+end_quote

Do you not find it super fucking creepy to eat things that were literally alive, and in the case of meat, emotionally sentient?

***** On the cats: Probably it's more sensible than I remember it. I've been rereading the YW books recently, but I haven't touched the books about the cats directly yet, and I read those like 15 years ago, so I probably am misremembering things.

** Bizarre thought experiment: consider a trivial decision, like moving a finger. Change your mind about doing it as many times as you can. You can always change your mind, right? Or are you just telling yourself you changed your mind? Like I said, it's weird.

*** Here's how it went down for me:

I decided to do the 'experiment', so I put my arm down and held it still. Imagined moving it. Imagined not moving it. Realized that I wasn't actually changing my mind, because the hand was going to remain still for a while if I was going to do this experiment. Decided I needed a fixed time limit, and if I couldn't trick myself before then I was just going to end the experiment. Realized that that meant move the hand at the end of the countdown. Immediately discarded the countdown. Realized I had just changed my mind, but saw no further avenue toward deciding to move it again. Thought about how boring it was to just try to tell myself what I was thinking. Thought about having a countdown. Didn't trust myself to adhere to the countdown. Got annoyed with myself for being unable to decide on something as easy as moving my hand. Realized I was still holding my hand deliberately still. Was offended. Tried to trick myself into accepting the countdown idea again, but failed. Resumed watching Parasyte - the maxim. Moved hand at some point.

***** No of course not. The similarity is that both deal with the issue of to what extent you can self-deceive yourself about what you will do.

** Orphaned story idea:

In /Madoka Magica/, Kyubee refers to having received his energy quota from "this planet". This implies that the Incubators have more planets than just Earth. But he also stated and implied that human beings, with emotions that can effect magic, are rare, and no small bit crazy, compared to the multispecies, astronomical-scale civilization that produced the Incubators and is mature enough to worry about the heat-death of the universe.

So Empress Homura sets out to conquer and reunite the many unknown worlds of humanity and take the fight to the Incubators. This "demon" stuff doesn't fool her: she knows the Goddess Madoka cannot be satisfied until despair plagues humankind no more.

Mahou shojou power armor and genetically-engineered SPEHSS MAGICAL GIRLZ may appear.
