I'm talking diet (Mediterranean, plant based, Okinawan, etc) exercise (running, bwf) and sleep hygene? I treated myself like crap for a long time and changed recently to try and survive longer & better. Wondering if anyone else is practicing what they can as far as rational health practices irl.


** I...sort of try to not think about that. I'm mostly just killing time till time kills me, and to the extent that I'm trying to live healthily, it's so that my body functions and feels well /now/.

I guess I'm still a little suicidal. I'm not at the point anymore where I'm actively wanting to die /immediately/, but, like, I got rather sick recently, and it was possible that what I had was going to be very bad, and my main concern was just that I not die in a way that inconvenienced other people, rather than that I, you know, not die at all.

Part of me wants to live long enough to accomplish everything on my to-do list, but another part of me wonders why I should care that much about leaving anything unfinished on that list, because when I'm dead I won't be around to feel bad about it, so...

**** Yup. And if I'm capable of killing myself now, then I'm capable of killing myself later. It isn't as though not committing suicide is a choice that I can't later undo, so if I can wait, why not wait?

(Though, if I had access to some painless, sure-fire suicide method that would only be accessible to me once, I might kill myself even if I wasn't in a suicidal mood. I'd be tempted, at least.)

But if you could arrange yourself to be born later in history, then why would you be born /now/? Shouldn't you have made yourself be born into a post-Singularity, utopian society?

Choosing to be born now when we are in the middle of accelerating scientific discovery seems to imply to me that we are about to encounter an apocalyptic disaster that ends civilization or severely damages it.

*** Also, limit or eliminate consumption of alcohol (one serving a day /might/ be healthy, but more than that definitively negates any positive effects), keep away from inhaling anything superheated (especially tobacco smoke), eat lots of vegetables, and prioritize calories from proteins/fats over those from starches. For sleep hygiene, try to avoid blue or white light in the evenings, and use your bed for only one thing: sleeping (two things if you have a significant other). I would underline sleep as quite possibly the most important thing on the list. If you're not sleeping well, you won't have the energy to do any of the rest of it.

Oh yeah, that's another thing I forgot to add. I usually only drink hard apple cider because it has a lower alcohol content than beer or wines (plus it's delicious!).

There's also only drinking caffeine when I actually need a boost to my energy rather than having it every single morning.

**** Both. Cooking at home tends to be cheaper, and if you are willing to put the time into cooking, it can be better nutrition-wise. But if you are just buying frozen meals or similar low effort meals, then it would be worse nutrition-wise. I minimize the amount of time spent on cooking by making a huge pot of food on the weekends and eat the leftovers for dinner throughout the week. [[https://Delish.com][Delish.com]] has a lot of great easy recipes, and I would advise buying a slow-cooker. Most slow-cooker recipes take less then 15 minutes to chop the ingredients, throw them in the pot, and then all you need to do is wait a few hours for everything to cook.

My parents rarely gave me and my siblings red meat to eat growing up (mostly chicken instead), so we ended up continuing the trend since red meat now tastes a little too rich for our tastes.

It won't ruin your health, but your quality of life improves if you are well-rested and it's easier to be healthy if you have the energy to exercise. Don't exercise when you are tired by the way.

** I don't go to the extreme of being too paranoid about it also because I tend to be hypochondriac, so if I start focusing too much on my health I'll actually /lose/ quality of life to panic attacks and the like. But Mediterranean diet comes pretty natural to me (due to being Italian and stuff), I'm a vegetarian both for health, environmental and ethical reasons, I don't smoke, I drink very little alcohol, I don't drive (again, multiple reasons: environmental but also I'm such a shitty driver I feared it would shorten my lifespan and those of people around me) so I walk quite a lot.

You will never actually get me to do regular boring old exercise, that's too much. If I had easy access to a competitive activity I can be at least decent at and to friends who are fun and easygoing about playing it I'd probably do much more of that. I did a bit of fencing, I did bouldering once and liked it a lot, I used to like volleyball when I was in school. But most of the time the surrounding stuff (reach some far off field, change, shower, deal with people taking the thing too fucking seriously) just turns me off from what otherwise would be a fun activity.

On Reddit - you have to look past the popular communities to the things that interest you, or will improve your life. And to the communities you feel you can provide something useful in. The subreddit for keto taught me an enormous amount about how to learn about nutrition, even though I had to leave keto after a bit. The running subreddit taught me how to run and pointed me at resources that let me complete a marathon; when I started I hadn't run in two decades and couldn't finish more than a couple miles without walking. The ask historians subreddit has taught me tons both about history and about how historians look at the past; the subreddit for my local areas has been fun and informative on local events, and the subreddits for places I go on vacation help give you a feel for what's good and bad, what the locals are interested in.

There's a lot to learn. :) You just have to get past the default subs!

** Yes!!

- I stay away from most isolated supplements, but I take collagen and krill oil daily + herbs in tablet form.

- I filter my water with activated charcoal when it's practical.

- For exercise I stretch and dance, it's super lovely. I just make sure to sweat regularly, it's one of the best detoxing methods. The best is healthy digestion.

- I'm aiming for a Mediterranean diet but it's not going its best in this area at the moment.

- I research every product I use and avoid most unhealthy chemicals when a better option is available. (I'm not a fanatic)

- I take well care of my environment. I air my home out often, and clean every week. I also make it pretty and take the psychological effects of my surroundings seriously. That we're capable of having our bodies altered for instance by experiencing emotions during social or private experiences is a giant clue for me that atmosphere affects health.

- I walk barefeet outdoors or go to the beach for grounding.
