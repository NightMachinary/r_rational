#+TITLE: [RT][C][DC][TH][FF] Mortal: "The things that pull at your heart—the memorial in the prologue, the wedding in Chapter 1, the births and deaths and relationships to come—are not the point of the story: _they are the stakes_, and the story is at its heart about a decision that must be made."

** An absolutely heartwrenching exploration of transhumanist ethics, /Mortal/ is one of the most beautiful novels I have ever had the privilege of reading. It has a one-shot sequel, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/134664/mother-of-nations]["Mother of Nations"]], set centuries after the events of /Mortal/, and a trio of deleted scenes collected in [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/85197/lunar-orbit][/Lunar Orbit/]]. I found that listening to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2Plw8CFOc]["The Passage of Emptiness"]] on repeat while reading really enhanced the experience.

Also, awesome Crabapple is awesome.

** Not bad, definitely the kind of MLP fiction I'd rather see on here. A good intro to some transhumanist debate. The arguments on both sides were a little more emotionally charged and a little less logically grounded than I'd have liked. It would have been nice to see some of the consequences actually play out in longer form. I think I'd have enjoyed it more if it had been longer- which is probably the highest compliment I can pay a fic, come to think of it.

The sequel, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/134664/mother-of-nations]["Mother of Nations"]], and [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/85197/3/lunar-orbit/mortal-deleted-scenes-epilogue][the deleted epilogue]] both deal with the events of /Mortal/ on a longer timescale.
