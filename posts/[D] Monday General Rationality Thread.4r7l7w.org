Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Recently watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QNKcwe_lM][the brand new testament]], a cute movie about gods daugther, who runs away from her abusive father.

The best scence in the entire movie: god proudly tells someone he hates people and is god, backs his claim up by telling that person an intimate memory of that persons life - and the person quite rationally immediately tries to kill god.

I wish I was that good at updating upon evidence!

*** I just watched it and really liked the concept of people knowing their death dates. The thing is, I heard/read a lot of quotes saying "Live each day as your last", "If today was your last day, would you do what you are about to do today" and things like that. But I never thought about this in the perspective of "What would you do if this is your last 3 months or last 2 years". To me, this is more inspiring than the former thought about "last day".

Anyway, thank you for sharing about this movie, kind sir.

***** Well, first of all, it's /god/. He's immortal and there's no reason to suspect that his character has an influence on his mortality. You're quite the opposite. If hell exists, you've just literally done the worst possible thing you could do. Even if hell doesn't exist, god could make it just for you.

Second of all, it's /god/. Literally the shortcut to eternal happiness to everyone, everywhere, forever. Sure he's an asshole now but from what I understand there's no reason to suspect that he was always an asshole and he always will be. And even if one assumes omniscience means that god will never change character--the world isn't completely horrible now and there is some semblance of order in a few places. It's completely possible that god is the only thing keeping the world from going, quite literally, to hell.

This is like finding a switchboard that controls the universe, proving it's legit, and then smashing it with a hammer because you don't like the position of some of the switches and can't get them to budge.

*** Had problems with both 'socially interacting with girls' and 'interacting with enough people in general (so there would be a GF candidate)'. Eventually solved both for myself.

For the first one, a thing that might have worked for me (or perhaps correllated with working) was watching&listening to media (series/podcasts/webcasts/LPs) which a guy co-hosted with a girl, interacting with her in a friendly atmosphere (well, the atmosphere where the audience obviously ship them but nothing really going on and the jokes are quite mild).

For a second problem, I thought 'Which of my interests are making me interact with people less than average and how can I re-focus that?'. Playing board games with friends? Might as well visit board game clubs a couple of times, why not? Spending my time in an online community? Why don't I visit (or even help to organise) a local meet-up and discuss the ingroup's things in a %food_place%. Playing a (non-casual) game on my phone? Why don't I try, say, Ingress instead, based on constant IRL interaction between players? And so on.

I was a bit scared about 'how do I switch from just social communication aka being friends to showing a romantic interest and determining whether it is mutual' but I managed that intuitively (well, I guess I got lucky with one girl that became interested in me first, but I have successfully initiated a relationship too, with some light jokes and stuff.)

Hope I helped a bit.

EDIT: It's a vague question, so it depends on the parameters, but in essence, getting other people to behave in a way convenient to you, be it by giving you material goods or by doing something you want done, is what money represents.

Again, it depends on the exact situation you're in, who you want to influence, what you want them to do, etc. A guru in a sect will not exercise his influence the way a policeman on the job or an office manager will.

"No matter how smart you may be, no matter how much money you may have at you disposal, no matter strength of arms or argument, you simply cannot force people to do something. It costs too much. For all the bombs we have dropped, for all the lives that were lost, in the end this is why the Nazis could not prevail. There is not enough money in the world to truly command and control a populace. The best you can do, all you can hope to do, is create a situation where it is easier for people to do what you want than it is for them to do what you don't. Then no one will seek to oppose you or thwart you aim because it appears you are merely helping them to do what they really want to do. There is, in the end, no defense against cooperation." - Patrick E. McLean, How to Succeed in Evil

*** Is the issues getting them to work at all, or is it getting them to take specific actions?

If it is getting them to work/work together, then finding ways to make each person feel responsible for a specific part of the work so they feel like they own it or that it is theirs.

If the issues is getting them to take specific courses of actions... If they are friends of yours, then establishing reciprocation over time is good. You help them with something small, later you get them to help you with something slightly bigger, and so on until you are willing to go out of the way for each other. If they are merely acquaintances, it might help to know what each person wants from the group and being able to navigate and negotiate between them.

Also, to go with [[/u/CouteauBleu]]'s idea, you don't need to pay them directly necessarily, but offer compensation that is worth money. For example, if a bunch of friends help you move, buy them pizza for lunch, and if it really takes a while/you have a bunch of stuff, maybe take them out to dinner afterwards also.

If you want specific examples... I was in the Boy Scouts and I was alternatively Patrol Leader, Quarter Master, Senior Patrol Leader, and Junior Assistant Scoutmaster, so I have some stories of what to do (and lots of stories about what not to do).

About the dentist thing... I think that would be one of the last medical professions to go. I could see implants monitoring your health and eliminating the need for checkups, but mouth health seems kind of tricky (spit into a device that monitors for chemical traces associated with cavities) and physically removing cavities will be always necessary if anything goes wrong in maintaining your mouth health.

**** Duhigg really lost me tbh. In fact, he was the one who cemented my prejudice against non-scientific writers writing science books. I simply won't read one now.

He spends faaaar too much time on anecdotes and he seems to have been doing this thing where he pandered to two demos, as if his editor came in and told him the book would sell more if he framed it as one part pop-cogsci, one part-self-help and one part business advice.

Pop-sci writers are great at storytelling and construction but I kinda loathe the (sometimes tiny) flair and digressions they add. It feels like it's eating at my time for no good reason. Moonwalking with Einstein was the other book that made me swear them off; it's an autobiographical account on mnemonics mixed in with the actual techniques, and twice as circuitous as any of the books of the people it profiles, who structure their books in the most glorious ways (literally chapter-by-chapter: "How to remember X" then on to the next thing, so you can cherrypick new techniques to learn with no fat)

Kahneman is good, but thick. I made the mistake of buying the audiobook instead of what I do now: make notes while reading along with a book to review later and I'm regretting it so much. I'm going to have go through it again, I have terrible retention with audiobooks and that's with works that are mainly narrative and not having to remember figures.

Good point on audiobook version. I had issues with retention on a few non-narrative books too. A [[/r/TheRedPill]] user recommended using both at the same time: audiobook + ebook/book, so you engage all senses, which should greatly increase retention. I have to try it too in the future (as soon as I have time to actually read books. audiobooks I can listen to when I do many other things).

****** I've fallen out of love with it but...

Honestly, anything from either Dominic O'Brien or Harry Lorayne (or look for other memory champs). They seem to have the same ideas and tools across several books. /You can have an amazing memory/ or /How to develop a perfect memory/ will help. They're short, concise and contain their tricks without a lot of fluff. Websites like Art of Memory are also good.

Word of caution though; I've not see much that really helps with say...poetry or passages. Their stuff is very smooth for numbers (the Dominic System takes some set up but,especially with a memory palace, is quite intuitive) but passages and concepts -which is where the meat is for me-...those seem quite hard and I haven't seen as quick an effect or as useful a blunt tool as the Dominic System.

I can only assume that it's a "rising tide lifts all boats" thing. The more vigilant and flexible you get with the tools the easier it comes. Well...I hope.
