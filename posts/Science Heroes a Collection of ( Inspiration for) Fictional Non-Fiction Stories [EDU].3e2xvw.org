This "top ten" list reminds me of Stephenson's [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.Cryptonomicon][Cryptonomicon]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49317-the-baroque-cycle][Baroque Cycle]] series.

[[http://www.scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=395&Itemid=361][Science Heroes:]] A Community of Rambunctious Scholars Celebrating People Who Have Made Lifesaving Discoveries And Encouraging Students and Politicians to Read 1000 Science Stories!"

--------------

1) Are there any other authors who write rational, fictional stories about scientists in the midst of their discoveries?

[[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/][Exhalation]] by Ted Chiang

--------------

2) Barring that, are there any stories about scientists you'd recommend?

Physics:

Feynman has [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5544.Surely_You_re_Joking_Mr_Feynman_][Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!]]

Neil DeGrasse Tyson has his [[http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ngd5e/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ama/c38vowu?context=1][AMA recommended reading list]] which includes Newton and Darwin's works.

Chemistry:

Clark's [[http://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pdf][Ignition! An Informal History of Liquid Fuel Propellants]]

Gergel's [[ftp://www.fourmilab.ch/pub/etexts/www/gergel/isopropyl_bromide.pdf][Excuse me, Sir, Would you like to buy a kilo of isopropyl bromide?]]

Biology:

de Kruif's [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/582171.Microbe_Hunters][Microbe Hunters]] outlines the pathway from humors and miasma to microbiology and modern medicine, including Leeuwenhoek, Koch, Pasteur, and Ehrlich.

Skloot's [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks][Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]] is a sociological and ethical foray into the HeLa cell line and the controversial tale of inequality, racism, and ignorance woven into the mixed history of one of the great triumphs of laboratory cell/molecular bioscience.

I'll try to keep this top post updated with science recommendations...
