--------------

‘Rationality' is a specific quality of fictional works - it does not simply mean ‘good', nor is all good writing necessarily rational.

A work of fiction is rational to the extent that it focuses on competent characters with consistent motivations proactively pursuing their goals in settings whose premises are rigorously thought-out and consistently applied.

In particular, characters in rational fiction often follow unorthodox or genre-defying courses of action which require clever planning, careful analysis, and the creative application of resources or knowledge.

Settings in rational fiction may or may not include fantastical elements, so long as the consequences of their underlying rules are carefully considered and taken seriously in crafting the story's world.

*Common Elements*

Though the presence of any particular feature below is not a requirement, the following characteristics and tropes appear often enough in rational fiction to help point to the cluster.

- Careful Worldbuilding: The "rules" a setting runs on remain consistent, as do their effects and implications. In preexisting settings (e.g. fanfiction), the author may seek to remove or justify incongruities, or to explore their implications.
- Fair-Play Whodunnit: A story's mysteries or problems could, in theory, be solved by attentive readers ahead of time, and the reader should be able to see at least in retrospect how the characters came up with their ideas.
- Munchkinry: Characters strive to exploit their world's rules and solve their problems by leveraging their available resources in creative ways.
- Cerebral Values: The story demonstrates the usefulness of deliberation, preparation, deduction, etc.
- Aspiring Rationalism: The story focuses on revealing characters' thinking, motives, decision-making, and/or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is often a particular feature of the rationalist fiction subgenre of rational fiction, particularly if the reader is meant to be able to take practical lessons from the work.

#+end_quote

I strongly dislike the use of 'Left-Brained' in this statement. It implies an overly simplistic model of the brain, which is scientifically inaccurate (see e.g. [[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071275][here]]) and thus unnecessarily detracts from the very point the definition is making.

Additionally, for some people (me, for example) it does not carry meaning by itself, as I would not have been able to tell you the difference between 'left-brained' and 'right-brained' values had you asked me an hour ago.

That's not wrong rethorically, but I think our shared public-facing definition needs to be held to a higher standard than that. Referring to a concept that's pseudoscientific - or at least oversimplified to the point where it carries similar connotations - might be taken seriously by a portion of readers, which doesn't look good for us.

******* Not to worry - double-pinging me got the job done where your first reply alone likely wouldn't have.

"Respecting intelligence" is probably better, though not perfect. It /might/ sound pretentious to the average redditor, but I'm not qualified to judge whether that's a statistically significant problem.

One phrasing I did come to think of is "Enlightentment [values|ideals|spirit]". It is, as pointers-in-conceptspace go, somewhat inexact - the immediate connotations for The Enlightenment seem to be philosophical and social, while that-which-is-pointed-at by the paragraph feels more immediate and practical, much like referring to science when you were actually trying to describe engineering. Nevertheless, it is related, and harmless-sounding enough that I'm putting it up for consideration.

***** Difficult. System-2 would be much better. Still, it is very technical and not very evocative. Usually, I would be inclined to call it 'rational', but obviously that does not work here. Just removing the class title breaks the aesthetic, we can do better. The word Intellectualism fits somewhat, but has negative connotations and is thus equally unsuitable. So, I do not have a good drop-in replacement handy.

Have you considered restructuring the line? I think something like 'Respecting Intelligence: The story acknowledges the value of advance planning, deductive reasoning and logical thinking.' would circumvent the problem.

*** Very good, I like it. Minor suggestions/nitpicks:

- The first sentence is pretty complex/long, if apt. Could it be divided in two, perhaps?

- The term "agent" from the first sentence could be misunderstood by unenlightened people. Could it be substituted?

- Reformatting. I don't think the definition itself should be written in large letters, or formatted as a quote. (Also, a nitpick among nitpicks: the template calls for the header and the definition itself to be divided by a line.)

- Rewording. I think it looks better if all entries on a list follow a common pattern. The first two entries on your list read a bit differently from the rest. Something like [Name]:[Description] would be ideal.

#+begin_quote
  I think it might be better to think of rational fiction as a qualifier that attaches to other genres, rather than as a genre on its own. You can write rational fiction in just about every genre you feel like, but you can't write just rational fiction. Rational Fantasy and Rational Sci-Fi are the most common combinations and I can easily imagine rational westerns, rational animes, rational horror, rational mysteries and even rational romance stories, but I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.
#+end_quote

The way you framed your definition seems most compatible with this point, out of all proposals so far. What do you think about explicitly incorporating it?

  A fictional work's level of ‘rationality' describes the extent to which that work focuses on exploring what happens when consistently-modeled characters pursue their goals in settings whose premises, however fantastical, are rigorously and consistently applied.
#+end_quote

Here's a suggestion for a re-write:

#+begin_quote
  A fictional work's 'rationality' can be measured on a scale; fiction on the 'rational' end of this scale explores what happens when characters with consistent motivations pursue their goals in settings with consistent premises. These settings may or may not be fantastical in nature, as long as the underlying rules are internally consistent.

Even if worded differently, the main concept that I think would be important to express is that rational =/= good, and most importantly, non rational =/= bad.

([[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JcpzFpPBSmzuksmWM/the-5-second-level][This is a super common problem with smart people who try to explain things:]] They always talk in the abstract rather than allowing newcomers to infer the meta-level logic from the object-level rules themselves. This is especially weird given that said smart people almost always learned the rules themselves using the latter method.)

You could also probably leave out bullet point 4, since it's mostly covered by the other points. That leaves us with this:

- Careful Worldbuilding: The "rules" a setting runs on remain consistent, and their consequences are taken seriously. In pre-existing settings (e.g. fanfiction), the author may seek to remove or justify incongruities, or to explore their implications.

"Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality][in honest pursuit of their goals]], as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

- Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

- Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.

- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

Presence of these /particular/ features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

*Adjacent tropes:* Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence /doesn't/ make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit][Fair-Play Whodunnit]]: story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.

- Absence of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina][Deus Ex Machina]]: established story rules are never broken.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction][Deconstruction]]: genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.

- Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][Genre Savviness]]: characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.

*** I like the listing of bullet points and tropes after the main definition. This helps clarify the definition, and I think it should be part of whichever solution is chosen. However, I think the main definition is still too general here.

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction is written with intent to explore thoughtful, goal-driven behaviour of people in reaction to their world
#+end_quote

I can just imagine writers unfamiliar with the rationalist community seeing this definition and saying to themselves, "Well, yes, I should hope that my characters are thoughtful and goal-driven! That's just good writing advice." I'm not sure that this definition alone adequately conveys the idea that rationalist fiction specifically goes beyond other kinds of fiction in its focus on this aspect of the story.

#+begin_quote
  Rational characters always strive .... their decision-making is never warped ....
#+end_quote

"Always" and "never" are strong words... I'm sure exceptions could be cooked up easily.

This definition also makes rational characters a core feature of the genre, excluding works that might explore consistent worlds in other ways besides having such characters. That's not /necessarily/ bad; the community needs to decide whether it wants rational characters to be a necessary condition for the genre, or just a common sufficient condition.

Good points. Reworded that section. Better now?

(However, I /do/ think rational fiction is just fiction-which-must-be-good-in-certain-ways, not really a "genre". Yes, all perfectly-good fiction would be rational. It doesn't mean that /all/ commonly-accepted good fiction is rational, or that all rational fiction is good. It means rational fiction is always good in one particular way.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Well, sort of. As a possible counter-example, consider Arthur Clark's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama][/Rendezvous with Rama/]]. It's about a crew of astronauts exploring an alien starship. It doesn't, as far as I remember, focus on their thinking process and reasoning; however, the starship is explored in-depth. It could qualify as rational fiction, however, since the ship is a creation of alien background characters. If their engineering decisions were sensible → the worldbuilding is consistent, then that part of the work is rational.

There's two types of debatably-rational works which my definition excludes: about irrational characters living in a natural, consistently-written world, and textbooks about fictional natural worlds with no characters at all. I don't think it's a major problem, but my mind could be changed.

So, a perfectly-good comedy could have inconsistent characterization?.. Hm, alright, granted. There's no objective standard for "good fiction", let alone "perfectly good fiction".

#+begin_quote

I don't think so. Brief digression: In practice, when reading rational fiction discussions, I frequently saw questions along the lines of "Why didn't character X do Y?", "Why didn't population F take over the world, if they could A, B, and C?", or "Why was M set up this way?". A Perfectly Rational Story, according to the intent behind my definition, would be such that answers to all of these questions about it exist and are followable. Questions about aliens' engineering decisions definitely fall under this as well.

However, what's important is that it /does/ seem like a stretch to you. It's not supposed to; the aforementioned idea should be made clear. Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve this?

It seems like a stretch to me because your definition says that a rational work should focus on thoughtful characters with agency.

Not really, to be honest. "Background people" is an awkward phrase, and it just makes me think of minor human characters in the background.

They are in the background, yes, but my mind still doesn't automatically group them in with the rewording. I think what you had before that second rewording was better.

I would tend to consider that as still counting as rational. HPMOR of course uses Rational!Harry as its main plot device to expose all the tropey-ness of the canon, but in any work that's not fanfiction, I don't see why such a character would be strictly needed. It'd be pretty boring if all rational fiction was "a hyperintelligent hyperrational protagonist and everyone dances to their tune" - however fun it is the first few times. For example, I was reading /Fargo/, a PMMM fanfiction which I think is classified as rational (read about it here) and none of its characters is especially rational. They're what Eliezer calls first level intelligent: they make decisions that make sense for them, and show the appearance of possessing a consistent self, but that self isn't necessarily rational.

Rational fiction is fiction that is psychologically and socially realistic given the premise. In other words, characters, organizations and societies in works of rational fiction think and act in ways that are plausible given the rules of the setting.

This doesn't mean the setting itself has to be 100% realistic overall. Works of rational fiction can contain many fantastical elements, as long as their in-universe characters, organizations and societies think and act in ways that are plausible in such a setting.

This means that highly intelligent and sane characters must also think and act in ways that are plausible given the rules of the setting. So when highly intelligent and sane characters are portrayed in a work of rational fiction their intelligence and sanity is portrayed realistically. However, a work need not include highly intelligent and sane characters to be considered rational fiction.

*** Commentary:

No need to invent overly complicated lists of criteria. All rational fiction has one common denominator, one characteristic that every single work that has ever been referred to as rational fiction has: Psychological and social realism given the rules of the setting. In other words, characters think and act the way they would think and act if they and the world they reside in actually existed.

Notice this is not the same thing as being 100% realistic. You can have as many fantastical elements as you like as long as individual characters, organizations and societies think and act in ways that are plausible given the setting. For instance, in HPMOR, Harry's magical dark side isn't psychologically realistic in a real life setting, but it is psychologically realistic in a world where HPMOR-style level-1 horcruxes exist.

Any work that someone would call rational fiction, this definition applies to. Even Unsong falls under this definition (How would people and society really think and act if Hebrew scripture was actually true). Same thing with Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (how would individuals and societies in the Harry Potter universe really think and act in response to a first contact scenario with an alien "human" from a Universe that runs on rules as written Dungeons and Dragons).

Notice that psychological realism also applies to intelligent characters, so intelligence would have to be portrayed realistically.

I am quite confident in this definition. It is the only definition that includes every work that has ever been referred to as rational fiction, and if everyone votes for something else, then everyone else is wrong.

Using this definition, it would be quite hard to distinguish sufficiently well-written non-rational fiction from sufficiently well-written rational fiction.

Additionally, even if it's a sound definition of "rational fiction" in abstract, it doesn't capture our interests as a community. For example, we enjoy competent protagonists, in-depth exploration of consistent fictional worlds, "solvable" stories, and stories employing real rationality techniques, but this definition doesn't select for them at all.

I think it's /too/ simple.

Realistic depiction of intelligence and rationality do not imply that main characters must be intelligent or rational. They could be realistically portrayed fools, and it would fit.

In-depth exploration of the world and "solvability" of the story have nothing to do with psychosocial internal consistency. They're properties of the /narrative/, of the way authors choose to tell their story, not properties of the fictional world.

*** When reading HPMOR, HJPEV is in the story itself acknowledged as not a normal 11-year old -- this is /eventually/ explained, but until it was so explained, would you have denied HPMOR's membership in the rational genre?

This definition feels to me to be missing the qualities that most of us are seeking in stories of this type. Consider "The Promised Neverland". Are the kids there acting 'realistically'? Frankly I have no way of knowing. If I had to guess, I'd guess not.

To the extent that that story is posted here is not because the kids are realistic, but because they're intelligent and go out of their way to prepare in order to overcome their challenges, and the story appreciates intelligence and preparation: e.g it "The Promised Neverland" goes to the trouble of showing in a montagee page of the kids training to slide using tied-up sheets, seeing that the knots were causing a problem in the sliding, then figuring out a solution (sewing the sheet together rather than tying them).

*In rational fiction:*

- The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.
- The author seeks to explore the moral and material implications of the elements in the story, as well as alternate solutions to presented problems, even if they violate the usual conventions of the genre.

Pursuant to the above, rational fiction *usually contains*:

- Consistent worldbuilding. In pre-established settings (like fanfiction) the author makes an effort to remove or justify seeming incongruities.
- Intelligent characters, who seek to understand the world, and to competently pursue their goals in accordance with their values.
- A focus on the thought-processes of the characters as they pursue said goals.
- Themes and topics that relate to the extensive exploration of solution-space, e.g. metaethics, effective altruism, munchkinism, transhumanism.

*In rational/ist/ fiction:*\\
In addition to the above,

- The author describes rationalist and scientific principles and techniques which can be applied by readers in real life.

Or taking one of my own stories - in "Names and Forms" ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3114287]]), written almost 20 years ago, I did a retelling of the Minos & Pasiphae story, except set in the Gargoyles universe. If there's a rationalist character anywhere there, it's probably the only-appearing-in-two-brief-scenes tertiary character of Daedalus.

I wouldn't call the story part of the 'rational genre' at all, and not just because it has some badly written implausible elements (though it does), but rather because the value of intelligence, planning, preparation wasn't really anywhere displayed or more importantly nor was it /intended/ to be displayed in the story. Neither Minos nor Pasiphae nor most other secondary characters, are very good thinkers, /nor do they have to be/ for the purposes of the story.

Nor did I bother making them fail because of lack of intelligence. Minos wins against a somewhat better thinker - and then loses against worse thinkers, both cases because of, well... divine power, so to speak, which is perfectly plausible within the setting of the story, since he /is/ the offspring of a god, and gods meddle all the time -- but nonetheless the whole storyline fails to display the respect for intelligence I'd seek in the rational genre.

Hm, okay, I think I grasp a little better what you're shooting for. Thinking through the premises of a setting and its characters will have lots of consequences, and some of them are disproportionately important from the POV of asking 'what matters in rational fiction'; of those, 'demonstrating respect for intelligence' is one of the big ones. Does that feel roughly correct to you?

*Rationalist Fiction* attempts to make the reader more rational. Here, "more rational" means more like a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent][rational agent]]", a being that acts to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem][/maximize/ a coherent set of /preferences/]] according to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference][/logically/ consistent, /empirically/ sound, /parsimonious/ worldview]].

Generally, rational fiction encourages us to try to come up with logical explanations for things, and to seek evidence for our beliefs, encouraging the reader towards a scientific, reductionist worldview. It also encourages us to view "simpler" hypotheses about the universe as more plausible - with a notion of "simplicity" that loosely alludes to more mathematically rigorous notions of simplicity in that it not include things that are merely "simple" for humans to think about, such as magical and supernatural explanations.

Additionally, it encourages us to build more coherent frameworks concerning our preferences, values, and what we want for the universe. Humanist and transhumanist frameworks are common, and the rejection of death and the notion that acceptance of death as good and natural represents a cognitive bias is a staple of this genre.

Finally, it encourages us to be more effective in pursuit of those goals. Explicit discussion of cognitive biases and techniques for identifying and reducing them are discussed, as well as useful heuristics for improving practical behavior.

*Rational fiction* generally invokes the same worldview as described above, but does not necessarily attempt to teach the reader in as explicit a manner. The criteria for rational fiction are loose and there is no single necessary nor sufficient criteria.

-the use of "common sense" to subvert common narrative tropes is a frequent theme, especially in fanfiction where the original characters did not do so. Sometimes, one character is at an advantage over other characters because they alone are able to use this common sense. Other times, all characters make good use of common sense. This can lead to the characters behaving very differently from what readers generally expect from fictional characters in the genre.

-Often, characters seek instrumental knowledge or power, or exploits a unique situation that they find themselves in to pursue an ambitious goal. This sometimes involves humanist or transhumanist themes, or plays with consequentialist/utilitarian takes on morality.

-Particularly in magical fantasy settings, rational and rationalist fiction often gives the sense that someone, whether the author, the narrator, or a character, cares about attempting to come up with logically consistent explanations of the world as presented...even when the world seems to resist such logical explanations. For instance, if magic exists, the characters may note that this means that the universe seems to have special rules which respect human minds, and furthermore they may note that this strange and resists reductionist explanations.

-It's common for an interplay of conflict and cooperation to revolve around different characters which each have unique set of coherent goals that they are trying to maximize. Some characters may even have completely alien goals, orthogonal to any human values, which they nevertheless pursue rationally. Concepts from game theory are sometimes implicitly or explicitly invoked.

-Sometimes, none of the characters are especially rational, but it is clear that the underlying world has been constructed by the author with an eye to logical consistency and a careful thinking through of implications.

-Sometimes the story itself explores some tangentially relevant philosophical or practical question.

...and so on. Generally, "you know it when you see it" applies.

*Rational fiction* is fiction which specifically emphasizes themes related to *rationality*, where "rationality" loosely refers to a set of ideals such as reason, science, thoughtfulness, learning, excellence, self-improvement, goal-directed behavior, optimal strategy, understanding how things work, and similar ideas. A defining feature of rational fiction is that it strives to stand up to careful reader scrutiny by proceeding /realistically/ given the setting, rather than according to standard literary forms or tropes (if these are used, they must be justified independently). Rational works should possess at least one, and preferably both, of the following attributes:

*Competent* characters: Characters possess at least [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 intelligence]]; that is, they act as intelligent agents optimizing to the best of their ability towards their goals. Characters do not ignore obvious opportunities and weaknesses for the sake of the plot.

*Consistent* settings: Settings obey rigorously applied rules. Every aspect of the plot and setting is a plausible consequence of the underlying rules and the initial setup, and conversely, logical consequences of the rules are not ignored for the sake of the plot.

These qualities apply to many works of fiction to some degree, but rational fiction respects them with an extra /thoroughness/. Other genres may relax the rules in order to establish a certain payoff: action that sacrifices physics for fun, thrillers that ignore probability for the sake of twists, literary fiction whose oddities are designed to be metaphorical rather than literal. In rational fiction, competence, consistency, and rationality are /themselves/ part of the payoff, and are not sacrificed for other considerations.

*Rationalist* fiction is a subgenre of rational fiction in which reasoning techniques are shown in a way that is realistic and /emulatable/ by the reader. Such works explicitly demonstrate techniques from science, logic, probability, game theory, decision theory, or other fields. The story is often structured like a puzzle that the reader can solve by applying such techniques.

Rational fiction has developed a set of common tropes which convey its aesthetics and ideals, including Munchkinry, Genre-savviness, Deconstruction, Worldbuilding, and others. For a more in-depth list with explanations, please read [the bullet points on the wiki](Link to the following bullet points on wiki). Also check out the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][TvTropes definition]] of rational fiction and [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Yudkowsky's guide to writing intelligent characters]] to gain a better understanding of the genre.

** Bullet points for the wiki page
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bullet-points-for-the-wiki-page
   :END:
Although not strictly necessary, works are likely to qualify as rational fiction if they contain some of the following:

- Intelligent characters: characters are demonstrably intelligent by /real-world/ standards

- Curious characters: characters are curious about their world, and make every effort to resolve their curiosity

- Genre-savviness: characters are familiar with standard literary tropes and can subvert them

- Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit the rules of their world in any way possible

- Deconstruction: tropes, magic systems, technologies, societies, and other things are reverse-engineered to see what makes them tick

- Worldbuilding: settings are crafted in meticulous detail, and non-obvious consequences are considered

- Solvability: Twists and problem solutions are theoretically predictable in advance by the reader with clever enough reasoning

- Transhumanism: Themes of immortality, self-modification, and existential risk are addressed in depth

Features commonly seen in stories exhibiting *competence* as applies to rational fiction:

- The thought processes of characters are described in detail, and these thought processes can be emulated by the reader

- Characters have a strong respect for knowledge and intellect

- Characters use every available technique to improve themselves

- Characters drive the plot, and often try to "munchkin" or exploit their setting to accomplish their goals, or just for fun

- Characters are curious about why things are the way they are, and try to discover the specific principles behind phenemona

- Characters are well-read and familiar with standard literary tropes

Features common in stories that do *NOT* exhibit competence:

- Character thought processes are not shown, or are shown very little

- The writing informs us that a character is intelligent without showing it

- Intelligent characters make deductions like Sherlock Holmes (that is, their deductions are implausible and unlikely to work in real life)

- Intelligent characters talk like Spock (that is, they think that being smart means ignoring emotions, using the word "logical" a lot, and giving way too many digits of significance in their calculations)

- Characters do not have much causal agency in the plot; they are just along for the ride

- Character actions are primarily driven by their emotions, without reflection on whether the actions are intelligent

- Characters are not curious about their world and do not make an effort to understand phenomena

Features commonly seen in stories exhibiting *consistency* as applies to rational fiction:

- The setting is based on precise, coherent, and discoverable rules, and all events in the story conform to these rules

- The plot proceeds like a simulation of what might actually happen given the established rules; real science is imported as much as possible

- Secrets and plot twists are hinted at beforehand, usually in a way that allows the reader to potentially think of them in advance

- Phenomena seen in the story have precise mechanisms which are explained in detail

- Phenomena, objects, characters, and actions are all entangled together and bound by the rules of the story and their logical consequences

- If there is any obvious technology or strategy that the background civilization is failing to exploit, a plausible explanation is provided as to why

Features common in stories *NOT* exhibiting consistency:

- Little or no effort is made to demonstrate the ground rules of the setting

- Little or no effort is made to show how and why events happen or how things work

- Characters encounter many new technologies, wonders, phenomena, etc. that have no relation to anything that comes before or afterward in the story

- There are implausible coincidences and Deus-Ex-Machinas

- The writing provides explanations for things that happen, but these explanations are vague, implausible, or full of buzzwords with no moving parts

- Characters consistently succeed at things despite having plans that are too complicated or kung-fu skills that are implausibly effective; the success of plans or fights is primarily plot-driven rather than a realistic consequence of the setting.

Features commonly seen in *rationalist* stories:

- Characters have a deep desire to think and act optimally in all things, and this desire for absolute excellence factors strongly into their character arcs

- The plot is fundamentally about reasoning, science, optimization, discovery, decision theory, etc., and is driven by them

- Competence and Consistency pervade the story fractally, apparent throughout at every level of narrative

- The story has core themes relating to transhumanism, immortality, ethics, Good vs. Good conflicts

Features common in stories *non-rationalist* stories:

- Reasoning techniques are not shown explicitly, or are not emulatable by the reader

- The plot can't be predicted in advance by the reader, even in principle

- Lack of strong plot focus on themes of reasoning, science, optimization, excellence, etc.

- Lack of strong plot focus on humanist or transhumanist philosophy

- Antagonists who are viciously or comically evil without any explanation

is definitely a problem. I think a few lines of text can be cut without losing too much of the intended message:

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction is fiction which [cut] strives to stand up to careful reader scrutiny by explicitly showing that events are realistic given the setting [cut], rather than like standard literary forms or tropes (if these are used, they must be justified independently).

The first cut specifies the somewhat nonstandard way we use the word rationality here. While this can be helpful, I think it clogs up the definition. I would include it separately or provide a link. The second cut is just redundant text.

#+begin_quote
  Displaying both competence and consistency in this respect is a sufficient condition for a work to be rational. Works which strongly possess one of these qualities, or which explore themes of rationality in other ways, may qualify as rational fiction, if the heart of the payoff is in the right place.
#+end_quote

I would cut this entire section. The idea does add to the definition, but I don't think it's worth the word count. If you really foresee problems with people arguing that a setting with competent characters, but no consistent world can never be rational I would change the line: /"Rational works almost always possess the following attributes:"/ to something like /"Rational works posses at least one, but preferably both, of the following attributes:"/

#+begin_quote
  Rational-adjacent fiction is fiction that acknowledges the ideals and tropes of rational fiction, but bends them for its own purposes.
#+end_quote

This line can also be cut. The term rational-adjacent is a useful one, but whenever it's used the meaning is probably self evident from context and if not it can be clarified in a sentence or two when someone asks.

Even with the cuts, this may still be too long for a sidebar. Hopefully the first paragraph conveys 90% of the message.

(in this particular case I'm going to only put the sidebar proposal and insert a link to this post for the wiki part. If you want to make a comment that has nothing but the wiki bit for me to link to instead, that will make your submission a bit tighter.)

I said having Level 2 Intelligent (main) Characters was enough, [[/u/Noumero]] said "widespread employment" of Level 1 Intelligent Characters was enough. I think I've figured out a way to turn that into a functional solution.

--------------

*Characteristics of Rational Fiction:*

- All characters are [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent]] or higher, meaning their thought-processes and behavioral patterns are consistent and realistic (i.e., they act and react /rationally/ - as if they were actual persons with agency - rather than simply acting to facilitate the plot).

  - If this were the only criterion, well-written works from every genre would qualify as rational fiction. Therefore, a work must also have a non world-building related rationalist-adjacent trope as its main thematic focus in order to qualify as rational fiction.

*Characteristics of Rationalist Fiction:*

- The main viewpoint character is [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][Level 3 Intelligent]].

- The thought-processes of the main viewpoint character are written in such a way that readers can absorb some of the character's techniques of good thinking (aka "Rationality").

  - This is the defining trait of rationalist fiction; showcasing a character's intelligence and thoughts and actions isn't the goal, it's a tool in service of the goal - to subtly teach the reader how to think and act more intelligently.

- The antagonist and most of the main supporting cast are often [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent][Level 2 Intelligent]] or higher.

- All characters are [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent]] or higher.

*Rationalist-Adjacent Tropes:*

- Achieving goals and resolving conflicts by applying techniques of good thinking (aka "Rationality")

- Self-awarness / genre-savviness

- Opposing positions pass the Ideological Turing Test

- Realistic villains who see themselves as the hero of their own story

- Consistent world-building

- Munchkinism

- Deconstruction

- Transhumanism

- Real-world application of the scientific method

- Grey and gray morality

- Blue and orange morality

Works not meeting the standard of either rational or rationalist fiction but which have extensive focus on two or more rationalist-adjacent tropes are classified as "rational-adjacent."

Then why include the other points? Why not include level-n intelligence under the list of related tropes?

#+end_quote

I don't see why it wouldn't be desirable. Not every concept can be distilled into a single word or short phrase which is immediately comprehensible. Sometimes accuracy is better than brevity. And you don't want to set the bar for entry too low, people should know what they're getting into if they happen to stumble upon this sub. "Reading" and "comprehending new concepts" are kinda supposed to come with the territory here, right?

#+begin_quote
  Why include the other points [if you're going to claim that one of the points is the "defining trait"]?
#+end_quote

I personally have many characteristics. I have brown hair. I'm not dumb, sometimes. I have four cats. I do a better-than-average job of typing lots of words in a short amount of time. I wear glasses. I'm generally ridiculous. I have a blood type, probably. But I'd say my "defining trait" is that I'm generally ridiculous. I wouldn't be "me" if I didn't have four cats or wear glasses (I'm being factious, please mentally substitute characteristics that a reasonable person would present in support of the argument I'm making), but the thing that people recognize immediately as "me" is the "generally ridiculous" part.

#+begin_quote
  Why not include level-n intelligence under the list of related tropes?
#+end_quote

1) Because it wouldn't be "rationalist" or "rational" if it didn't have level-n intelligence, but the thing that people recognize immediately as "rationalist" or "rational" is the "showcasing rational thought" part.

2) I think "rationalist fiction" could theoretically be written with a thematic focus entirely unrelated to any of the typical "rationalist-adjacent tropes" and still be recognizable as distinctly "rationalist fiction" if it's written right.

EDIT:

3) I really don't think you can showcase/"teach" Level 3 Intelligent thought-processes ("good thinking" or "rationality") if your main viewpoint character isn't Level 3 Intelligent.

/Rational/ fiction must meet the first two listed criteria. /Rationalist/ fiction must meet all three criteria.

*Concept* Conceptually, /rational/ fiction must include a clearly defined set of rules that the reader can analyze.

*Characters* At least one major character's arc must involve interacting with, analyzing, and understanding a ruleset in /rational/ fiction.

*Themes* Rationality itself must be the central theme of /rationalist/ fiction.

*** I've deliberately avoided using words like “intelligent” or “consistent” so that an individual's perception of those values doesn't influence whether a work is rational. (Of course those can still be used to argue a work is /bad/ rational fiction.)

To give some examples:

Worm fulfills the first criteria with most powers and how powers function having clearly defined rules, but understanding those rules isn't important to anyone's arc. It's adjacent to, but not, rational fiction.

Worth the Candle hasn't a clear set of rules and understanding them is part of the main character's arc. It is rational fiction.

HPMOR has multiple clear sets of rules, understanding them plays into characters' arcs, and rationality is the core theme of the entire story. It is rationalist fiction.
