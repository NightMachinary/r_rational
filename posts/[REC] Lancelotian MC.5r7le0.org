⚠ ⚠ ⚠ This is going to be pretty long. ⚠ ⚠ ⚠

A bit of my philosophy: (i) Incompetence is a crime.

(ii) Mediocrity is a sin.

(iii) Competence is a virtue.

I'll list the traits of the MC:

1.  MC is consequentialist. MC doesn't believe in good and evil, and does not abide to conventional morality. MC's morality is this: "right" actions give a positive payoff. "Wrong" actions give a negative payoff. The rightness or wrongness of any decision he makes, is */ONLY/* dependent on its payoff.

2.  MC is male. For story with multiple MCs, at least one of them should match listed criteria.

3.  MC is pragmatic and rational, MC isn't an idealist, he's realistic and pragmatic.

4.  MC is ruled by reason not by emotions. His actions work with cost benefit analysis; 'will this have a positive or negative payoff?" and Bayesian decision making; "which decision has the highest expected value?". he also asks questions like; "How does this affect my goal?"

5.  MC is utilitarian. He attaches a value to each human life, and other things. The worth of saving or sparing a life is that value. The cost of taking a life is that value. This may be implicit, not necessarily explicit.

6.  MC prioritises efficiency in all his actions. The most efficient means to achieve his goal, the most reliable. He'll pursue the action with the highest expected value(Bayesian method of decision making). He wouldn't take a chance on a very low probability(no betting on potential or believing in spirit) unless there's a logical reason to do so.

7.  MC is competent. He's capable and adept with respect to what he does, he does not need to be the best, but he should be highly proficient and accurately estimate his ability. Above the 99th percentile(most likely more) in his field(s) in his universe.

8.  MC is highly intelligent, no need to be a genius, but at the very least in the 99th percentile of intelligence; somewhere north of 145 with SD of 15. Bonus if he's a genius. Doesn't have to be explicitly stated, we readers should be able to infer it.

9.  MC has a goal. He has an overarching goal, that drives his actions and may have other sub goals he pursues.

10. MC is manipulative, a schemer and a planner. He makes carefully thought out plans and commits to them. He prefers brain over brawn and believes his biggest asset is his brain. He understands the value of information, and actively exploits it. He has backup plans for plausible scenarios, but can manage through unexpected scenarios. He's robust, even if something unaccounted for happens, he can deal with it.

11. MC is meticulous, he pays careful attention to detail. He's not careless.

12. MC has pride. I'm not asking for unnecessary arrogance, but he has pride in what he does. He's capable, and knows his capable. He takes pride in his abilities. But he shouldn't be ruled by his pride.

13. MC's goal may be beneficial e.g world peace, neutral e.g world domination(such an MC will actually bring about a more prosperous world after they take over), or hostile e.g World destruction. The MC may even have vengeance as a goal, his goals may be influenced by emotions, but not his actions. I wouldn't want mediocre goals though. Of he's pursuing vengeance then the target of revenge should be larger than life and also very competent.

Any genre that encompasses these elements will do; sci-fi, fantasy, horror, etc.

Bonus

1. MC is involved in politics wherever he finds himself

I'm not asking for a Gary Stu. Not an omniscient or omnipotent MC. He can have flaws and weaknesses, as long as those 14 requirements aren't violated. He may have a God complex like Light Yagami. He may have a Messiah complex(filtered through his own amoral world view) like Emiya Shirou. He may be nihilist, and see this world and humanity as beyond hope. He may think that there world needs to be destroyed to be saved. He may hate the world and want to destroy it. He should have flaws and emotions. I want a real feasible person, not a perfect robot.

He may have noble pride as his flaw. He may have deep hubris in his lineage and his house.

MC should have emotions and be a real human being. He just shouldn't let his emotions rule him. Or at least that should be his principle. He's human, so making an emotional mistake may happen.

I don't want a story where there are no consequences for his less rational choices. If he goofs up, there should be consequences for it. If he decides to prioritise something over his goal maybe the life of someone precious to him, then it should affect his plans, everything shouldn't somehow magically work for his benefit. He should have zero plot armour, and narrativium shouldn't help him. His luck should be average or less than. I don't want a "lucky" MC. No Deus Ex Machinas please.

There should be real consequences for his actions.

I want a plausible story; a story I don't need to keep suspending disbelief to read.

Simply put I don't want plot armour.

I know this was a chore to read. I'll take anime, manga, Asian translated novels, Original English Novels, Western Novels, comics, etc.

I'll take anything as long as it is FREELY available online in ENGLISH. The story should have at least a few 100 000 words(or equivalent content for videos and comics). I'm expecting at least a 1000 pages of English content(or equivalent). If there's less, but over 100,000 words and releases are steady and at a reasonable pace, the recommendation will be much appreciated.

Any genre will do, as long as it involves political machinations. I expect the MC to have or eventually get some kind of leadership role.

I'm okay with genocide if it's a rational choice, but I'll be put off by someone killing villager A for no reason or for something mundane like being in a bad mood. I think it's the thought behind the crime that decides it for me.

I don't really care whether the MC wins or loses, it's the journey for me.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. This is the most important recommendation thread I'm requesting for. I'll be eternally grateful to someone who can fix me up. If you can get me a dose of my crack, i'll be indebted.


** The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing][Prince of Nothing]] series sound right up your alley. It's a very complex series for me to try to describe, but the main character Kellhus fits your requirements almost perfectly. The only catch is that we learn very little about his inner thoughts despite following him for so much of the book and readers are left to decide on their own whether or not he's evil or amoral. Some people find the book boring due to the extensive world-building. I highly recommend reading the reviews on [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010MEPN14/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Amazon]] or some other site before deciding to read the book. It's fairly easy to find free copies of the first book online, but the rest of the series you might have to buy. Try bookzz.org if you have very little money to spend.

The [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/about/][Crystal Society]] is about an artificial intelligence named Face who sounds more feminine than masculine, but there is so much social manipulation in her every thoughts and action that I think you'll like reading about her any way due to how her single desire is to be *known* by every human and she only (barely) follows conventional human morality publicly to look 'benevolent' to humans because fame is better than infamy. The first book is free online, but you will have to buy the second one and the third one is coming out roughly in December.

[[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] features a version of Harry who is considered to be /intensely/ moral by many people on this subreddit due to his idealistic desire to want everyone to never ever die, including people considered to be evil. This moral conflict between him and the rest of wizarding society who thinks Death is "The next great adventure" is a major part of the story albeit not all of it. There's a /lot/ going on throughout. Since you sound like you like moral conflicts, I suspect you'll enjoy Harry. It's free online.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game][Ender's Game]] is a classic which you probably heard of before so I won't get into it too much. I'll just point out that Ender is considered by the subreddit one of the few examples of an genuinely intelligent characters in popular literature where we actually can learn good habits of thinking rather than a "genius" character who we are told rather than shown to be smart. I'll be stunned if free copies of this book can't be found somewhere online with some googling.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]] a whopping monster at /2 million/ words long and all entirely free online. Features a female superhero who constantly finds herself making horrible decisions in her pursuit to be a hero. Fans often comment on her doing "the wrong things for the right reasons". Taylor is exceptionally cunning, pragmatic, and clever as a [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][Third Level Character]]. She's female, but her gender is such a minor aspect of the story that I rarely noticed or thought about it.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Blindsight][Blindsight]] is an amazing book about people with very unusual ways of thinking and bizarre moralities along with aliens who genially feel like they are aliens rather than Star Trek aliens who are humans painted a different color. I can't write a summary good enough to do this book justice, but the TV Tropes link is very informative and will bring you to a free online copy of the book.

There are a lot of good rational fiction on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][TV Tropes]] I would recommend for hours of pleasurable reading, but there aren't any other fiction I can think of on that page which fulfills your main amoral requirement.

PS What does 'lancelotian' mean? I tried looking it up, but google doesn't tell me the meaning. I'm guessing something to do with amoral and probably a historical connection to Lancelot somehow. Or is it just a word you made up to identify characters similar to Lancelot?

EDIT: Looking at your post again, I think you are very heavily influenced by characterizations of the heroes in xianxia novels. The genre as a whole is considered by this subreddit to be very stagnant as mentioned by the top comment on this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ab3xk/recommendations_xianxia_is_a_good_genre_and_you/][post]]. [[https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/about/][Forty Millenniums of Cultivation]] is the rare exception which is liked by this subreddit. I think you have been reading so much of xianxia that you are desperate for something different, but are so used to reading stories from that genre that you haven't considered trying other types of stories. The only reason for my thoughts about you is because we had some people come to this subreddit from [[/r/noveltranslations]] asking for recommendations before and they made very similar requests to you.

EDIT 2: I just realized that while I was recommending books, there were two comics I would recommend as well.

[[http://www.leftoversoup.com/][Leftover Soup]] is a comic at only 970 pages with the author saying that he will be finishing it at exactly 1,000 pages. So it's not as long as you wanted, but the characters constantly discuss deep, thought provoking topics many of which are very easy to to get into arguments over (for pete's sake, the first page involves a rape joke!). They also often end up discussing whether or not a given horrible action is required due to one's moral philosophy/religion, so I think you'll like it despite the near total lack of any of your requirements.

[[http://freefall.purrsia.com/][Freefall]] is another comic which doesn't fulfill any of your requirements, but it's a very lengthy comic (several thousand strips) which examines the implications of alien and artificial minds which are similar to human minds, but are nonetheless different enough to make coexistence difficult.

To reinforce this, he mentioned that he would be finishing Leftover Soup in 2017 back in December when he was around strip #950. His reason for doing so is because he wanted to tell a story with a beginning, middle, and end unlike most webcomics which only have a beginning, middle, and just continues on forever without any ending.

Why? The rest seems to follow similar themes.

#+begin_quote
  MC is amoral. MC doesn't believe in good and evil, and does not abide to conventional morality.
#+end_quote

A lot of the MC's around here have decided that at least seeming to abide by conventional morality is useful. You don't often see protagonists completely ignoring conventional morality, if only for the reason that having a track record of adhering to conventional morality is a /very/ good thing.

Outside of that, you often see them adhering to unconventional moral frameworks. It's important to note that that does /not/ make them amoral in any way. We probably want to avoid words like "amoral". We want to avoid that as a group in general, and any appearance of evil should be the cartoon villain level.

*** I don't know what less wronger means.

Amoral: doesn't make you evil.

I want an MC who is amoral. They will not hesitate to take "evil" actions for a rational goal.

I mentioned, that I'm okay with genocide if it's a rational decision.

AN MC who pretends to be moral is all-right; I do that too. It doesn't change the fact that I'm amoral, I obey laws and haven't committed any violent crime, or ever been prosecuted for criminal charges.

But at heart, the MC should be amoral.

In our world to day, obeying laws has been highly beneficial so I do it.

Amorality isn't evil, it's neutral.

If I can save someone, I might if and only if the cost(resources expended, hostility gained, etc) is far less than the potential benefit(person saved will repay me, I'll gain favour of them or others).

If there is absolutely no benefit, or it's negligible, I'll abandon them even if it'll cost nothing.(UNlikely, because even popularity from saving is a benefit.)

tl;DR Amorality, is the most important character requirement.

I don't want an MC who's shackjled by morality. Hecommits crimes, if it's a rational choice.

I've never killed before, but if I were in a situation in which it was the logical, rational thing to do, will I? Yes, and I won't be bothered by it.

That's what I want from an MC.

MCs who kill for non logical reasons, are not my cup of tea. In fact, I'm slightly repulsed by them.

**** Your original post sounds like you are asking for an "edgy" protagonist... I think on [[/r/rational]] we look down on edginess for its own sake^{note} , although many of works we like can get pretty dark and many have... goal-driven protagonists. Worm is a great choice, although the protagonist is female (not sure why you had a constraint in gender) and has serious self esteem issues, she also kicks ass, is very ruthless, and has extremely strong convictions that drive her to take down foes way stronger than her. The Metropolitan Man sounds like exactly what you are liking for, Lex Luthor operating in a paranoid and efficient manner to fulfill an arguably good goal through amoral means.

^{Note:} that said, Quirrel in HPMOR was super edgy and it took forever for some people to figure out he wasn't meant as a role model, and a lot of people still think he is cool. I think the pushback after realizing about Quirrel may have made [[/r/rational]] more sensitive to the kind of edginess you are asking for.

Followed by Draco Malfoy. I couldn't connect with Harry, because of his morality. His conceptions and belief in good and evil seem naive to me.

I myself am not moral, I'm not quite amoral, but how I described my MC is a projection of how I am or want myself to be.

I can't identify with female characters. No that's wrong, my capacity for identifying with female characters is severely limited. There are reasons for this, I've not bothered finding out all of them. I don't see it as a problem.

I can read and enjoy stories with female characters, but identifying with them is difficult.

I'll probably, no definitely enjoy a female MC who meets all my requirements, but I won't be able to self insert. The recommendation wouldn't let me enjoy my fantasy of being who I want to be.

I'm not a misogynist, but suffice it to say, that I'd never choose to be born a female(no matter how advantageous the female(unless my exploits as one would benefit my next male reincarnation), if I reincarnated as one, I'd kill myself so I can reincarnate again.

**** That's not what amorality is. If your dream MC is utilitarian, he's not amoral. He has an unconventional moral framework, but he /does/ have one.

It's impossible to take "logical, rational" actions unless you have such a framework--you need to have specific values you're trying to achieve. For example, it's only "rational" to kill one person to save fifty if saving those fifty people advances your values in some way. Without that context, it's a totally arbitrary decision.

For example strong A.I will be amoral, yet capable of rational decision making.

Something similar to that, only with emotions.

My morality is this: "right" actions give a positive payoff.

"wrong" actions give a negative payoff.

This is the question whose answer depends on your value system. Different people will assign different values to the same outcome. The same "payoff" is positive for some people, but not others. As a consequentialist, you need (and presumably have) a moral framework for evaluating consequences.

For example, suppose your enemy is in danger and you are deciding whether to save their life. If you save them, the consequence is "your enemy is still alive." Depending on how much you value human life, that could be a positive or a negative outcome in your eyes.

But if the enemy will die anyway, I suppose it will be much easier to get accustomed to it. Making those decisions, thank having to pull the trigger myself.

I believe that sensible individuals should be selfish. Your interests should hold a great deal of importance.

A belief that's hard to discard, regardless of the truth of that belief, I was made proud to be male. I also grew up reading male MCs. It's quite late and hard to start identifying with female MCs.

**** There's a common criticism of SJWs regarding fiction. It generally goes something like "The inability to identify with characters who don't match the reader's exact demographics betrays a failure of empathy and conceptual ability". I suspect we're seeing the wild version of that trait, without the ideological framework. Or a more charitable possibility, as [[/u/hoja_nasredin]] suggested, a misfiring heuristic to avoid anvil-dropping.

I also suspect that people asking for female MCs would be more likely to ask in a more women-oriented/dominated venue. I see them occasionally in [[/r/fantasy]], for example, and I'd be shocked if there weren't /TwoXFiction type subs.

***** Just for clarification: Asking that uncommon demographics be respectfully represented in fiction (instead of ignored entirely, or represented only as objects of ridicule) isn't about being unable to identify with other types of characters.

The issue is that our mental model of human society is heavily influenced by fiction. For, say, a gay person to see gay characters represented in fiction as people worthy of basic respect is validating to their identity. Conversely, to see an absence of gay characters gives the impression that they're weird, uniquely broken people unworthy of a place in society (this is particularly damaging to young people still coming to grips with their identity).

I have a personal experience with this. As an aromantic asexual person, I /never/ came across characters who were like me while I was growing up, except in the form of heartless, sociopathic villains. I wasn't even aware that that was a way "real" people could be. It took me a long time to accept that I genuinely lacked romantic and sexual attraction, and even longer to stop thinking of it as something wrong with me. I believe that seeing respectful depictions of aromantic and/or asexual characters in fiction would have helped me accept myself much earlier, and saved me a lot of heartache.

Just as importantly, respectful representation also affects how the rest of society thinks of your demographic. If you're a gay person surrounded by people who never see gay characters in fiction, or see them depicted only as perverts, that will affect the way they treat you. I believe that the increasing amount of positive representation of LGBT+ characters has done enormous good in shifting perceptions of LGBT+ people, in a feedback loop that then further encourages representation. I've watched my own mother's opinion of trans people change dramatically just over the course of a single TV show centered on trans characters.

******* No, of course I don't think that every work needs to contain an aro/ace character. And I also don't think that that kind of attitude is anywhere near as common as people seem to think it is. It mainly comes from a few young teenagers, still in the process of establishing their identities and still in the beginning stages of navigating social justice concepts, who try to shoehorn LGBT+ identities into every character they like. For the record, I don't consider that a "pathology" or "deranged." It's just a manifestation of standard kid stuff--essentially trying too hard to earn a place in a community they identify with, combined with the black-and-white thinking of someone who isn't yet equipped to handle a lot of nuance.

The majority of people who advocate for representation are reasonable, and it's frustrating when people dismiss our concerns because they equate us with a few confused teenagers. The "make every character gay" stuff gets a lot of play because people find it funny and spread it around to mock it, but it's really not that popular or influential of a stance, and it shouldn't be the focus of the debate surrounding representation.

Culturally, you're a poor fit, your expressed desires and viewpoints too vulgar and unrefined.

You say you came here from [[/r/noveltranslations]]. The typical light novel is, well, pretty fucking low IQ, and that's coming from somebody that has a great deal of contempt for the fetish people around here have for the term IQ. The [[/r/rational]] sub is ostensibly focussed on "rational" fiction, but in fact it is a hub for the LessWrong exodus's Rationality community. People here care first and formost about ideals, ideas, how to live in the real world, and discussion around that. [[/r/rational]] is the sub that aggregates Rational fiction for these people due to the historical accident of Yudkowsky's magnum opus proselytizing peice being a "rational" fiction work, making such fiction an interest in its own right for these people. But if you come in only caring about fiction and talking as though that matters and you're ignorant of local rules and customs and cultural viewpoints and values, you might get told you're in the wrong place.

You're not in the wrong place, but you have an amazing experience of growing and learning ahead of you (I imagine anyway, from what you've said, that you'll like what you found around these parts, and many, myself excluded, have found the LessWrong and related material profound and life-changing.)

****** Edgy is slang for a particular type of over-the-top, trying-too-hard style grimness. Generally the connotation is that whoever designed the character is trying too hard, overused cliche tropes, doesn't really grasp/empathize with how their character would play out in reality, etc. Like if a character cries tears of blood while meditating on slaughtering their enemies who tortured their parents in front of them when they were a kid. If this same character has a katana that they bisect their enemies with and an ability that grants them immense power over darkness and shadow but drives them into a blood rage. Any one of these elements might be okay on their own. Altogether at once, they might be okay if they were played for black-comedy or parody. They might even work if they were gradually introduced and made sense in the plot in an overall well written story. But thrown in all at once, played seriously, they are too much. It gets completely ridiculous if the character is an OC (original character) and/or SI (self insert). So yeah, what you were asking for with "pride" and "amorality" and character I can empathize with via inserting myself into their (awesome) role trigger a lot of the warning signs of an over the top "edgy" character.
