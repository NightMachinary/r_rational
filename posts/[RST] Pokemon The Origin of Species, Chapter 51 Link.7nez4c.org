** Fun fact about electrical attacks: electric eels have to be impedance matched to their surroundings. In the ocean, with salt water having high conductivity, all their electrical cells are "wired" in parallel to deliver high current. In fresh water which has higher resistivity, they put them in series to increase the voltage; the increased internal resistance is matched to the increased external resistance.

Obviously this is a species by species thing though, not something they can reconfigure.

**** From the author's bio:

#+begin_quote
  Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

  The story basically has 3 arcs, and I finished two as of chapter 54. So I'm about 2/3 of the way done.
#+end_quote

My guess is that this last arc will end up being by far the largest one though. My guess is that we have 15-40 more chapters left in it.

The large variance is due to taking into account time skips (or months that are heavily summarized) and being unsure of how detailed the out of loop iteration will be. Any type of afterword could be quite long.

** This development with the psybond is nice.

You can see how he's pondering and attuning with pichu to to gauge attack expectancy. Then using that info to attack more judiciously and tip the battle odds.

Then he links with charmander and its new revelations because charmanders different and aggressive, little bloodlusty; but thats kind of his nature.

Let charmander "drive" while battling? Is it cool to override their instinct? Safety of all? Long term trainable/ untrainable: types? Specific pokemon? Specifics within specifics? Through evolutionary lines?

*** Love this update.

Just a minor tidbit--voltage hurts, current kills. People always think about the big voltage numbers as being super lethal, but it takes a remarkably small amount of current (half an amp) to reliably stop your heart, and even less to have a chance to do it, so long as the electricity passes through that part of your body.

As dangerous as the idea of giant rock monsters or bloodthirsty flying fire-breathing dragons might be, I'd be far /far/ more afraid to live in a world where a random rat chewing on wires in the walls could /accidentally/ kill me.

***** The important thing is how much current goes through your heart. It takes very little, only 90 milliamps.

Normally your skin is highly resistive, so it takes a lot of voltage across, say, your arms, to create a current inside your body.

If your skin on, say, just your hands is wet, you get a larger area of the same skin resistivity, and less voltage will cause the same internal current. Apparently this can be deadly with even small batteries.

If your entire body is wet or better, submerged, then the current is short circuited around your innards: now you need a large supply of current with a low source resistance to get that critical 90mA through your less-conductive body, even with a large amount bypassed. Think lightning strike on a pool, massive current.

*** I don't think electric attacks would reliably work the kind of way you're describing here, but I'm not confident about the exact results.

However, if you're giving electric pokemon a kind of ability to remotely influence the charges of things, a better mechanism for electrical attacks would be to use this ability to briefly ionize channels of air between themselves and the target, reducing the breakdown voltage so they could generate much more prominent arcs, over longer distances and with greater control over the shape than would ordinarily be possible. This would give them the ability to quickly create plasma 'wires' between themselves and their target, making it much easier to run a current.

***** To put it another way: Ohm's Law is quite clear, voltage = current x resistance.

If electric pokemon have the ability to shift electric charges around with effort (basically, by expending chemical energy), then it's easy to see how they could produce different voltages by shifting different amounts of charge. However, that would also alter current in proportion. The only way to vary one without changing the other would be to change the resistance of the circuit. Something like the earlier suggestion of ionising the path to the target, perhaps.

No. Voltage is the difference in potential between the start and end of the flow. It's basically pressure, but it doesn't translate to velocity in the way that water pressure would.

If you increase the charge differential (voltage), then you get proportionally more electrons (current) being pushed through the same resistance.

The only way to vary one, while keeping the other constant, is to adjust the resistance.

Edit: Also, according to Wikipedia, a 1-amp current represents 1 coulomb of charge being transferred per second. So, an ampere-hour represents a charge transfer of 3600 coulombs.

No, pokemon can't store their entire electrical capability as a static charge in their bodies.

I meant as a shorthand for what amount of charge they're capable of producing through whatever chemical or quasimagical biological methods they use to "store" it.

Like if you wanted to say that a pokemon was running low on charge, you wouldn't say they're "running low on their ability to use chemical potential energy to generate more charge," it would be implied by just saying "charge" that this was what you referred to. Or did I miss your meaning?

Well, if pokemon are able to expend effort in order to create charge buildups, and are also able to expend effort in order to reduce the target's resistance (eg creating ionised channels in the air), then they can indeed "tune" their attacks in the ways the chapter suggested, aiming for high voltage (focused on building charge) or high current (focused on lowering resistance).

Though ultimately, the resistance of the target, rather than the air, is what really matters. If that resistance is constant, then voltage applied to the target and current flow through the target will remain strictly proportional.

** Pokemon get stronger and even gain large boosts in strength (evolution) when they fight. It seems like stronger and more evolved Pokemon would face less predation and less resource and reproductive competition. If Pokemon have to be their highest evolution to be sexually mature and reproduce, that puts an even stronger pressure on Pokemon to get stronger.

[[#s][spoiler for Worm]]

It means that Pokemon relationships with humans are more symbiotic than the rights activists might think, because trainers boost their Pokemons' growth and fulfill their Pokemons' natural drives. It certainly shapes human society to have a very strong paradigm centered on self-improvement through work and competition. It also could have some implications if the 'humans are Pokemon' theory turns out to be true.

I think that if Red keeps spending time in his Pokemons' heads, he could be affected by this mindset. What you were doing with Charmander in this chapter seemed more about natural carnivorous instincts and expanding the concept of the conditioning Pokemon go through to not be wild, but I'm also interested to see if this factors into the mysteries of the Storm Birds and Mewtwo.

*** This is perhaps one of the more beautiful Pokemon theories I've heard of in a long time. I've seen many 'Humans are Pokemon' theories on Reddit, but they're almost all about how the humans in Pokemon differ from us physically (e.g being able to take repeated electric shocks and be fine, being able to spontaneously resuscitate after drowning, etc..).

But this is the first theory that may explain how Humans Being Pokemon might influence them psychologically, and therefore influence their culture on a large scale, and I think I like it so much that I'm accepting as part of my own personal canon. In fact I love it so much that I'm going to basically graft into every anime universe I know of - it would explain why so many anime characters (from basketball players to chefs to ninjas) are all so dedicated to their crafts; they're all Pokemon and Pokemon want to compete.

Also is the whole Humans are Pokemon theory part of this rat!fic? Because I've always wondered where a rational fic would go with that premise. Would the psychic and ghost people just be evolutions on the Human Tree? Perhaps humans don't evolve because the conditions required for it are just so subtle/rare/mysterious that only a few exactly fulfill them and gain abilities? Endless possibilities!

But /if/ they're attracted to pre-existing storm systems which they then enhance somehow, then the regional climate likely has some measure of control over where their rampages occur. Then if the regional climate is somehow disturbed by anthropogenic activities, then the behaviour of the local storms would begin changing, and... uh oh. [[/u/daystareld]], have any climate/Earth scientists in your Pokemon world identified evidence of anthropogenic climate change?

Alternatively, if the birds generate their storm systems from scratch (which means they're a lot more powerful), then their paths may still be influenced by biological needs, like food, or fleeing predation... and mating, maybe...? (They don't breed in the games except in Pokemon Snap, but a one-individual species should not exist unless there's some parthenogenesis, or something even stranger, happening).

  Weather Trio in Unova
#+end_quote

At the risk of being /really/ pedantic, "weather" is a sub-optimal adjective for the trio of Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus. Landorus is distinctly associated with seismic activity, mass wasting, and soil fertility, which are distinct phenomena from weather.

...or did you mean Hoenn? I would have thought Kyogre and Groudon would still be hibernating.

********** Why would there be?

The Mon world is far less industrial than ours and less populated than ours, thanks mostly due to the existence of the Mon themselves and an occasional "great war" that lowers the population drastically (the one back in AZ's day, and possibly the fan-theorized one Surge served in).

That's without even consideration that such a thing isn't even agreed upon in the /real/ world.

What gets me is that a group of powerful trainers doesn't get together to stop one of them. The Elite Four, perhaps. There would be a sort of "snowball effect" once a /really/ powerful or Legendary Mon is captured, as it makes it easier to acquire another, and then another, etc.

That means either nobody has tried (unlikely), that any sufficiently powerful group can't agree and trust each other to decide which person gets to keep it should they succeed, that at some point a powerful group of people did so and failed in such a fashion that it became well known and laws were put in place to stop unsanctioned attempts, or that such a process is currently underway but the one who is doing it hasn't achieved that stage in their plan yet (ie: Giovanni with Mewtwo. I'm not spoilering that, it's a thing since Gen 1). Actually, the last two can both be true at the same time.

******** I agree with everything except the last paragraph. The legendaries are pretty "magical" in the show and the games, and even if you make them rational and a biological force (albeit a superpowered one - even when compared to other mons), they are still the "ultimate" threat - the Bird Trio has nothing to fear from nature except Lugia I guess, so the fleeing predation point doesn't matter. Maybe they somehow absorb nutrients and stuff from their respective elements ? Or from the Earth itself when they are resting (aka in their off-seasons) or hibernating.\\
And maybe they genetically can't breed, and however they were designed or came to be (be it Arceus or whatever) made them in such a manner for a particular reason which hasn't been unveiled yet.

Of course he could always go looking for one in [[http://capx.wikia.com/wiki/Neureka][fan]]-made [[http://pokemon-uranium.wikia.com/wiki/Neopunk][regions]], but those sources can be a bit [[http://pgenvp.wikia.com/wiki/Dubus][dubious]].

Evolution still strikes as one of the most "magical" things in this rational pokeverse. Definitely tells me that the answer to Red's question of where they all came from cannot simply be descent with modification through natural selection.

Red is showing a bit of a knack for battling, and maybe even the inkling of a passion for it. Maybe we will see him a lonely former champion silently leering over the peaks of Mt. Silver yet.

If they'd coded in even a couple of lines like "Hey! We need that!" or "How could you?" I probably would have stopped, but there are so many valuables tucked away in all the crates and drawers and barrels around the world that it's hard not to grab them when the game treats it like it's expected.

Though, fun story on that, recently was accosted by a taxman in a city who asks if you've been engaging in certain activities that are exploitative to account for "unreported income." One of them is stealing people's stuff, which I copped to. Geralt even brings up that "no one's objected," which the taxman astutely observes is hardly an excuse.

I've always thought that things like that should be possible between psychic trainers and their pokemon :) I never watched the anime past like the second season, but heard about this of course and saw a few clips on youtube. It seemed a bit too shonen for me, lots of just "be stronger through more willpower," and I'm hoping to make this more cerebral and strategic.
