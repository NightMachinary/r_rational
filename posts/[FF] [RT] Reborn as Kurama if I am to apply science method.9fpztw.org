Ps:But be aware that I am new to this, so, please, don't judge me strictly!)

***** Dude, props for writing in a non native tongue. That is hard to do. It is a little rough to read, but I will give it a good try later today.

*** "If I am to apply science method" on its own doesn't make much sense. I suppose what you meant is "applying the scientific method". "If I am to X" is only a premise: "if I am to pay for the cinema, then I want to pick which movie we go watch!".

*** You replied to the wrong comment btw. To be precise, you replied to your thread instead of my comment, so I wouldn't have seen your reply if I hadn't checked the thread habitually.

** Your argument for English writing system really bothers me. Chinese characters allow for a very rich written language with much more depth, nuance, and clarity.

They are also easy to learn, if taught correctly.

​

Also, unlike the English system, Japanese has a true syllabary in the kana.

​

​

And why exactly should people with chakra have more voting rights? That sounds like a recipe for oppression. If you want to give more power to an elite I feel there should be potential for mobility into that elite.

*** I want to say, that it wasn't my intention to bother anyone. So I want to ask for forgiveness, if I somehow offended you.

I am not a linguistic expert, so I am not sure about my ideas/arguments and open for discussion and change of my thoughts.

If I may add, I plan to rewrite and slowly expand this story for the next month, after that it will be done and all ideas should be more fully explained and carefully described.

As example, logographic/alphabetic pros/cons of the system idea: If you look into this link [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram][logographic advantages/disadvantages]], there is a sub “advantages/disadvantages” and subsub “characters in information technology”, just before “see also” sub (all the way down).

There you can find my intended argument about why Main Character choose alphabetical system.

But because of time limit and other constrains which first time writer (myself) often meet with, I prioritized quickly writing novel and wasn't able to correctly refrase this subsub in comprehensive way.

I believe I should be able to do it, during next “rewrite/improve quality” month.

So, again It wasn't my intention to offend and I apologize if I somehow did.

Your argument about Japanese kana is true, but they still use both systems in everyday life and “cons” argument, which you can find in a link stay true as much for Japanese, as for Chinese.

*** Just saw your question about voting rights.

Short answer - for implementation sake.

Long one - Main Character misjudged willingness of elites to change, and because of that in his plan he gave them “preferential” treatment, because he thought he will meet with opposition, not willingness to follow.

You can see it described in chapter “Civilization starts with financial system”.
