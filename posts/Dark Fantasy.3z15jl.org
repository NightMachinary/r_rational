Having been reading Dungeon Keeper Ami I'm now in search of something to read set in a Dark Fantasy world. By that I mean full of withces, warlocks, imps, tortures, brutality, being awfull to people, maybe vampires etc. Not necessarily all of them, for example for me the first Doom qualifies as a Dark Fantasy. In particular I would love to find a consistent world, as I'm usually more intresting in the setting then in characters. Somwhere were it make sense to commit dark rituals and you are not constaly guessing how come a single guy could built this mega dungeon where he tortures dozen of people and none of the villagers ever noticed.

Let's disucss Dark Fantasy.


** I'm in the middle of reading the Mistborn novels right now, so I'm very biased, but it kind of sort of fits your bill? The first book really sets the stage: "Mistborn: The Final Empire". It takes place in a super-dystopia literally ruled by a god-like tyrant. The setting is very dark, and the book has its fair share of brutality, but I don't know if it's quite as dark as you want. The author does not dodge to avoid gore or horror, but at the same time the novel does follow a hero...

However, I will say that Brandon Sanderson (the author) is one of the most /superb/ world-builders. Everything makes sense and is touched on at nearly every level - for example, how the magic affects politics, society, culture, all the way down to the layman. I won't go into the details here, but... gosh. I'm midway through the second book and I'm only glad I waited until after college finals to pick this up because I don't know how I would have managed otherwise.

If you haven't already heard of it and discarded it, I would highly recommend checking them out.

*** I read the first two books of that series. I admit I really liked how the stuff in his world was connected and made sense, the reason I didn't read the third book is... Well you are still reading the second no reason to spoiler it for you.

Also reading his book made me think of the Orson Scott Card's book about how to write fantasy.

** I've quite enjoyed the writing of Joe Abercrombie. It's more gritty than dark but the characters are pretty morally grey and no one does anything for the sake of it.

** One example of Dark Fantasy I like is Warhammer Fantasy. It have all osrt of crazy elements most turned to eleven. Unfortunately it relies on the rule of cool to keep going and the lack of a single book or series makes it really hard to explore.

*** Well on that note there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wishful-thinking-40k-si.359714/][Wishful Thinking, a 40k SI.]] Though it's more muchkinry with free awesome powers than it is rationalist.

I'm honestly rather confused that it doesn't have more readers actually.

****** Well, until it trails off into incoherence in the latter chapters. I loved the beginning and middle.

** Not sure this qualifies but I'll throw it out there anyways. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22500562-fimbulwinter]] has witches. It's about a guy transported to another version of earth by a goddess. An earth that's starting to go into an ice age as the gods are going to war. She wants him to be her champion. The mechanics of the transportation let him pick his magical affinities. It's far more munchkiny/wish-fulfillment than rational. Also tons of sex. Oh yah I should mention that it has a harem.

If you like it, he's got a whole series.

** I'm not sure my world qualifies as Dark Fantasy in general, and there certainly aren't any imps or witches with cauldrons. But, the book I am writing follows a bunch of people who wake up at the gates of a ruin city that used to be Evil Capitol. So... the Dark stuff is all in the past, and the characters are just trying to survive/loot the place/figure out who brought them there. Even so, they discover a lot about how the magic wielding, skull-architecture obsessed Bad society worked. Much of it isn't dark, like permanent space twisting and industrialised alchemy, but there is also... uh...dark stuff. Not Black Magic, as that doesn't exist as a separate thing, but things like research journals describing all the magical science they managed to get out of a less wasteful holocaust, to the thought police and social engineering. It will hopefully qualify as a rational setting. It won't stray very far into rational/ist/ territory, though.

**** Unfortunately no. A few chapters are done, but I don't feel I have enough to show anyone. I will probably ask this sub for feedback after I get a little further, but the whole thing will not be put online, because I'm hoping to get published. Anyway, the only Dark thing they have seen so far is a stairway.
