I just had a thought...what makes a man reach beyond their primitive instincts to contribute to the society? Loyalty, nationalism, friendship... None of these concepts are components of human. Then how are societies of loyal, productive members formed? I've come to a conclusion that the key may be his/her youth. The (good) memories of youth are what bind the person to really “become” part of that society. Like Pavlov, people are conditioned to what they have enjoyed during their youth, and after their youth is over they will actively search ways to continue them. In other words, youth is even more than forming personal values and beliefs. The duration of youth probably differs significantly for people depending on race, gender, traits, etc. After youth ends and personal values, beliefs, conditioning have formed, that would pretty much “complete” that individual. Of course, some people who have problems with making decisions or people who aren't honest with themselves may still be able to change, but most people won't change their stripes.
