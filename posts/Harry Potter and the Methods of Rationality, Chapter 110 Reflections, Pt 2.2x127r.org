** Huh, well. I thought the mirror might be showing a Competent Dumbledore/Worthy Opponent (V's repeatedly stated desire), who would convince him back down/change his ways/self destruct.

It looks like either a Worthy Opponent wasn't really V's extrapolated volition, or that the mirror was instead a pre-arranged trap. Except.. the /Process of the Timeless/ must have been pulled from V's memories, rather than actually being built into it by D (at this point, all unforeshadowed major plot elements are being pulled from /somewhere/ at least). Anyone got any ideas of any CEVs of V that would generate Mirror Dumbledore?

BTW V didn't explicitly dismiss the Greater Circle of Concealment, or the Greater Circle of Exploding before dragging the cloak off Harry. I'm sure he did, otherwise it would have exploded, but I'm having to infer it.

*** This might be confirmation bias - since I originally thought the mirror was showing CEV Dumbledore as well - but Dumbledore's argument sounded a bit like a /caricature/ - what Voldemort believes Dumbledore believes. The argument was won too easily. The time-lock trap too poetically out-maneuvered.

(Granted, life isn't a story, so we shouldn't expect a rational villain to win in dramatically appropriate ways. It is still unusual.)

Hypothesis: Voldemort's CEV was to *win* against Dumbledore and all his future opponents, completely and utterly. With all the Deathly Hallows, the Philosopher's Stone, /and/ Harry naked at invisible gunpoint, this is practically assured.

Now we get to see what Harry's CEV is.

While I agree, I went back and read Ch 39 where Harry and Dumbledore had a very similar conversation, and I felt like it had shades of that.

***** It definitely did. The mirror could have conceivably gotten such arguments from Voldemort's mind, though, so such resemblance is not strong evidence either way. (Damn telepathic oracles!)

EDIT: Mirror Dumbledore referencing his earlier conversation with Harry specifically - "how I laughed when I realised it! When I saw you had made a Good Voldemort to oppose the evil one - ah, how I laughed!", /is/ fairly strong evidence that was the real Dumbledore. Could have gotten it from Harry's mind, I guess - either via shared soul shenanigans or Voldemort using undetectable Legilimency on Harry - but complexity penalty.

I don't think even a rational story has to be completely realistic. Eg. in reality deus ex machina are common, but in any story they're unwelcome. EY is a good writer trying to write a good story, so it's not totally ridiculous to put everything that might be going on through a 'satisfying' filter.

Voldemort's attempt to be Dumbledore was also imperfect, as Harry saw in the last chapter.

And I think you are correct regarding Voldemort's CEV.

** QM is now in possession of all three Deathly Hallows /and/ The Philosopher's stone /and/ has arranged for possibly the only two threats to him to be killed / trapped outside of time. Oh, and he has a gun too.

Meanwhile, Harry is completely disarmed and naked.

** I don't really like this chapter. The confrontation between Dumbledore and Voldemort felt rushed. Also the Dumbledore characterization was bad. It felt more like a silly caricature, something Voldemort would have imagined Dumbledore acted like rather then the real thing. I guess it's possible that the mirror is still reflecting Voldemort's fantasy of how he wants the confrontation to go.\\
I can;t wait for the next chapter.

*** Also bear in mind that Harry couldn't seen Confunded!Dumbledore's family, but could see this. I'm calling it that not only is this the Mirror-fantasy of how Voldemort wanted this to go, but also that he really wanted Harry to see it.

** If these events really are just Riddle's CEV (Skeptical, why on earth would he want that), there might be a lesson here: If illusions from within the mirror can successfully perform the /Process of the Timeless/, that means the mirror is dangerous after all.

Riddle said that the Atlantis believed the mirror to be harmless. It's quite clearly not /that/ harmless. Atlantis tried to build something really powerful. They tried to put that powerful object in a /box/ and used the /mirror/ to determine its volition /before letting it out of the box/. Then, they got removed from time. Also, this is written by the guy who came up with the AI box experiment. Coincidence?

(Which doesn't mean they are dead. There's clearly already versions of every time-turning character outside of time, thinking up all the self consistent time turner plots. Atlantis might still be pulling strings.)

*** I think the story was intended as a cheap didactic (by which I'm disappointed BTW) - Atlants tried to build Friendly AI - the mirror, but they haven't finished it before other Atlants build the non-constrained AI and it did away with them all. Reminds you of some organization perhaps ;) ?
