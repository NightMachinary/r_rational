** Cat's first thought on reaching a new city:

Some things never change.

** Good news: it's not demons. Bad news: it's much, much worse than demons.

And the character who was a bit of a joke until then got suddenly a lot scarier and A LOT more sinister. It's like non-Cat-PoV chapters where she appears and you notice how goddamn terrifying she is.

** When we have millennia old gods and goddesses taking the field, this chapter is a good reminder that /Names shape creation/. It's kind of nice to see the story return to its roots a little.

** I posted a long post on this thread in the other reddit, but suffice it to say. Cat has no theory of government or legitimacy to replace the ones she's destroying. Realpolitik and hypernationalism are great at using existing institutions, but not great at creating long-lasting ones. The Hierarch's appearance as a player means she needs to get one, fast.

â€‹

I hope this is a problem the character currently faces but will resolve, instead of an underlying unrealistic view of government the author has.

*** She's not trying to outright destroy them, though? I thought that the Accords were just an international convention aimed to curtail the collateral damage of warfare as it's practiced on Calernia, and she explicitly mentioned she intends to abdicate in favor of someone who can actually build a functional government on top of /those/ as soon as she can enforce them.

**** Yep. The Accords are more about binding Named from fucking around too much in warfare and politics. Similar to the technology cap enforced by the gnomes.

It also amuses me that whenever political entities come up in stories people rush to admonish authors for their perceived views. Seems to me that EE is basically shitting on every type of government that has been portrayed in the Guide universe. We see the worse excesses of each, even if they still kinda work. We've seen theocracies, aristocratic rule, military dictatorship. Bismarkian alliances, and democracy. I'm sure I am forgetting a couple.

And Cat has presented a form of government she prefers. A blend of Callowan aristocracy and guilds with military structure and bureaucracy pulled from the Reforms of Praes.
