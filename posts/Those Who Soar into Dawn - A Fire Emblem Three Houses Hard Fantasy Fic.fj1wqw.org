** This is the Three Houses fic I've been working on a while... I wanted to wait to post it here until I'd written enough of it that readers could solidly understand what the story was like. Now that it's over 55k, I can't really claim it's just getting started, even though it's still very much in its early stages. Anyway, I really appreciate any sort of feedback, so please don't hesitate to sing its praises or write a livid takedown of my incompetence as a writer.

Also, I'm not 100% sure whether it really counts as rational fiction? Please tell me what you think on that. I didn't set out with the intent of making it rational fiction, but my own tastes are so informed by ratfic that I think it may have ended up being ratfic anyway.

*** Whether or not it's rational fiction, I thoroughly enjoy it.

Especially not knowing much about the source material, I enjoyed the exposition.

**** As someone who does know a lot about the source material, I also thoroughly enjoyed the exposition.

**** I'm pretty much obligated to re-expound all relevant lore because I'm changing so much of it. So, if something isn't changed, I have to make sure the reader knows that even if they're familiar with the game's lore.

** I've been meaning to do something similar with Fates, but can never find the time. Not enough FE love in the rational community! I'll be keeping a close eye on this one :) more detailed review to come once I've finished reading.

** I like it! You've gotten Claude right. He is a very specific mix of obviously lying and probably still trustworthy wrapped in a deep layer of flirtatiousness and friendliness that has been captured pretty well here.

Also, I disagree with Hubert's animal being a snake. Snake's are liars. Hubert is many things, but he is not a liar. He never pretends to want anything besides Edelgard's success. He might have your throat slit in the middle of the night, but you knew what you were getting into when you got in Edelgard's way. IMO, a spider is more fitting. A spider can be useful and peaceful, but will never be mistaken for friendly, or entirely benign.

*** You got the animals backwards. Spiders use trickery and deceit (ie. Webbing) to ensare their foes while they hide in the shadows waiting for the food to come to them. Snakes hunt their food and use fast lethal bites to quickly end the fight. Also many use bright colors (or loud noises) to warn others of their dangerousness.

*** Keep in mind that the animal metaphors used in Interviews II are merely Lysithea's first impressions on Hubert and Dedue.
