My meandering mind just brought to my attention that I'd like to track down a site, forum, or something where I read short stores of a shared universe where atomic test opened a rift to a strange dungeon dimension and marines were tasked with exploring it while fending off things like orcs that hatched from eggs, vampires which were sentient fungus, elves that were part of a large plant, and an ever changing labyrinth of tunnels. Underlying the wholes thing was the dungeon dimention affecting the minds of those who explored it and the possibility that it was slowly expanding into our universe. Does anyone know where in the internet I might have read these years ago?


** [[https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/setting-riff-voices-from-below-and-the-long-stairs.391379/][Long Stairs?]] That matches the first part of your info, at least, an atomic test opening a rift to a dungeon dimension.

*** Very close, if it wasn't inspired by the same thing i am remembering it may have been the inspiration of it.

** I've read this! I can't remember what it is. I wanna say it might have been something from the SCP universe?
