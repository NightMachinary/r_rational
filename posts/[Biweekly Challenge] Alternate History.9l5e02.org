[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9grb9n/biweekly_challenge_conversion/][Last time]] the prompt was "Conversion". Our winner is [[/u/blasted0glass]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9grb9n/biweekly_challenge_conversion/e68elkq/]["Well In Hand"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/blasted0glass]]!

This time, the challenge will be *Alternate History*. Write a story about how the world might have turned out different, whether that's through simple chance, deliberate alteration of the timeline, or something else. Note that historical accuracy is appreciated, but I don't particularly expect anyone to be hyper-accurate, especially with a more divergent history. My ideal story would be one whose alt-ness helps illuminate some aspect of society, culture, thinking, systems, rationality, et cetera, but write what you want and/or what you think will appeal to this subreddit. As always, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, October 17th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided. (This mostly applies to calling for outside parties to vote.)

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, they're [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be *Afterlife*. We're going /really/ permissive here, so if you want to write about an algorithmic reconstruction of a person's consciousness on the basis of their online history and biometrics, or a company that offers cryonics services, or destructive brainscanning, you can do that instead of a more traditionally religious angle (literally existent or just discussed). You might also choose to take the prompt metaphorically, if you'd like.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/17*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or chit-chat is available [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9l5h0h/challenge_companion_alternate_history][here]].

*** A terrifying take on quantum immortality! I enjoyed this read very much.

*** It's this principle I've used to ensure a subset of mes win most contests since high school. I use [[https://qrng.anu.edu.au/][a QRNG]].

One thing that may have spoiled this is if it turns out that the generator only uses the quantum info as a seed, and not as a 1-bit for 1-bit output.

*** Just a small thing, could you use anything other than Medium for hosting? Medium has a cap on monthly views, so it's possible to be unable to read it there because of it. Places like Archive of our Own or FictionPress allow for hosting original stories, and then of course there's blogging sites like WordPress or Blogger, or just sharing docs through Dropbox or Google Docs.

***** I wasn't either until a couple months ago I read more articles than usual and was hit with a paywall /shrug/. Seems like a weird business model to make users pay for stuff written mostly by other unpaid users.

*** Nice! Particularly fun was the contrast of the tone of the words and of the events described.

​

If there was any mental stumbling, it was at things fully addressed, but later than they seemed important at the time; a minor case was that the Watsonian writer did not indicate awareness of the 'never interact' part until the end (incidentally of course terrible if you were in the same group with someone you cared about!). A more major case was the sentence 'Thus when you walk into[...], you are guaranteed to not experience[...]where[...]': the 'Thus' especially suggested that previous information was sufficient to give that guarantee, and that the Watsonian writer had an alarming (and confusing) misunderstanding about what was going to happen. (Happily, the guarantee was from other information later indicated!)

​

Incidentally, given that the procedure of drawing blood me consistently has been (and predictably will continue to be) severely traumatic no matter what, I would absolutely love a (temporary) TNC so that I didn't have to expend extra mental effort on holding still and not have to fear thrashing! Assuming that there weren't any lasting side-effects. 'as I did in a shameful moment of terror' indeed... I've actually succeeded in never thrashing during the thing itself (or vaccinations likewise, eagerly awaiting widespread adoption of needleless injectors so that there's no chance of a needle snapping off or tearing a big hole sideways), but I imagine it would be a lot more relaxing for my heart to be able to try to thrash, secure in the knowledge that I couldn't accidentally interfere.

​

That said, maybe that would be worse mental training for me, but how much positive effect would an event of such low frequency have in practice..? Much less considering the people who don't react the same way and so would never benefit from it, if there were any benefit. And moreover, the benefits-of-being-hit-by-a-rock-every-day perspective of that, if not already doing it, one wouldn't willingly expose oneself to a situation of having to repress panic into stillness (say, every day) even if there were some mental benefit. Probably. Hm, thinking about the gom jabbar humanity test now... definitely a once-in-a-lifetime thing... though it's hard to imagine or predict one's perspective when dealing with pure pain, where there's no intrusion or injury or (hopefully) permanent effects. Maybe a good--ah, that's it. Not just the instance of putting a spoonful of spicy chili into one's mouth, but the familiar experience of putting medication on a mouth ulcer. It feels like liquid pain, and one's body jerks and one's eyes tear, but it's refreshing and peaceful as one believes that the medication is doing no harm, and feels that the pain is an indication that the exposed inflamed flesh is in need of the medication and will benefit from it.

​

...I actually want to have a gom jabbar box (without the gom jabbar itself--I almost forgot that 'gom jabbar' wasn't the box, since the needle is far more easily replaceable than the box) now, so that I could observe whether my own predicted behaviour changes as I try using it, and how long I can withstand it as the intensity increases. It seems unlikely that I would be able to endure indefinitely, and yet it fascinates me that I cannot make even an extreme prediction of when I would be unable to.
