  I'm starting to have trouble reading Worm fanfiction about Panacea without my mental screaming drowning out the words. Her underuse of her powers is maybe the worst in that universe, short of Eidolon. It's like if Contessa was using her Path to Victory only to win at blackjack. Panacea is "total control over biology, including the ability to create new organisms with new complex abilities or immediately alter a virus to reverse its effects" being used to "heal physical injuries at a local hospital". There's a reason she's psychologically crippled in canon, the same reason Bonesaw and Siberian are in the Slaughterhouse Nine. If you have a non-crippled Panacea in your story, there is no story! By the time your story starts she's already made a virus that cured cancer, and designed trees that would grow sushi in a desert from seawater, and altered some humans to live outdoors on Mars, and maybe built an intelligence-enhancing bacterium, and converted irredeemable capes into her loyal minions by touch brain control, and bribed others to participate in Endbringer battles by converting them into immortal youthful supermen...

  Characters in Worm whose powers suffice to easily take over the world: Eidolon, Glaistig Ulaine, Panacea, Contessa, Bonesaw (instantly); and then Number Man, Dinah, Accord, Tattletale, Coil, Leet, Andrew Richter, Teacher, the Yang-ban... I've probably forgotten like half of them. I wonder if a prerequisite of a work generating an enormous quantity of fic is an enormous amount of untapped potential.

  Sigh. Maybe it's not a fair complaint. Out of the whole Forbes 400, nobody except Elon Musk makes any attempt to live up to the potential of their power, and nobody around them notices anything odd. It /should/ be the bug-control girl that ends up as the hinge of destiny. You /should/ have to go that far down the cape list to find one Munchkin.

#+begin_quote
  To be clear, I wasn't criticizing Wildbow. The original Worm does what it sets out to do as well as any story possibly could - it's trying (successfully) to be the Superhero Story To End All Superhero Stories, the category killer for its category, that doesn't let you ever look at superhero stories the same way again; the same thing I set out to do with HPMOR and Harry Potter fanfiction. Wildbow is rationalizing and therefore of necessity /preserving/ every aspect of traditional superhero stories, including Reed Richards Is Useless, excusing them and lawfulizing them as hard as he possibly can (and no harder). Even so the power balance in Worm is ludicrous but there's no way a human-level author could possibly avert that, given that they were trying to rationalize something akin to the Marvel or DC multiverse to start with; you just can't have economic balance or the weakest inexploitability given that many different superhero-level powers. Wildbow has thrown on at least four layers of inhibitors to try to rationalize why his Earth goes on spinning despite that, and that's the most he can possibly do without changing the nature of his universe.

  What makes the voices start shrieking in my head is when I read a fanfic that's unaware of this, and depicts happy cheerful sane Amy not taking over the world (nor being attacked by the Simurgh or blocked by Contessa).

  (Have read Amelia, check.)
#+end_quote


** 1. If she were going to do that she'd probably get Simurgh'd before the story begins.

2. It's possible her shard induces psychological limitations on its use, since her biological father and shard-sharer also made strict rules/restrictions for himself.

And she's fucked in the head. You have to take a story for what it is sometimes. Panacea is just not that character, which is fine.

If this was a comic book, with a bunch of writers trying to justify dumb conceits foisted on them by the Comics Code (but-but it's more rational for Batman to not kill the Joker honest!) then I'd be infuriated too. But the narrative never acts as if there's anything noble there, in fact, it's the opposite.

It gets even worse when he says that people like Number Man aren't achieving their potential because they're not taking over the world. That's just outright dumb, given Number Man's goals.

This right here is why I so strongly dislike Worm. It's an entire slew of interlocking narrative cheats designed to excuse absolutely anything. Villains wearing spandex and robbing banks instead of CuttingLexLuthorACheck? The shards did it! Character not living up to his potential? The shards did it! Every single person carrying the Conflict Ball? The shards...you get the idea. This is not an example of good writing. And then, of course, the entire thing is grimdark without any relief.

It frustrates me so much. The only thing that frustrates me more is that so many smart people love it; it's very unlikely that I'm the only sane man, so I wish to heck I knew what it was that all of them see that I don't.

***** It's one of those things that bothers me about Worm, but I just push it to the side as one of those things that I don't really /have/ to like. I mean, there are lots of other works of fiction that just take the whole "capes and superpowers" thing as their conceit and run with it, without feeling the need to add in lots of justifications. Worm adds those justifications in, and for me it doesn't really work, but I don't find this to be too much worse than if that justification weren't there at all. Obviously YMMV.

The persistent darkness is a much bigger issue, partly because there are so few breathers.

Honestly, you don't need space magic to get the original Undersiders to be criminals. Robbing people is actually a sensible way to make money if you have Grue's powers and live in a disintegrating nation where the police have thoroughly lost control.

Similarly, plenty of people fail to live up to their potential in real life. And the conflicts in the story mostly feel organic. At least in my opinion.

But fans, for whatever reason, love to talk about the entities.

As for the darkness...how dark it is is a matter of opinion, and how dark it should be is a matter of taste. Maybe it's just not your thing.

You kinda do, for most of them.

Regent, yes. He was a bad guy, I find it completely believable that he was a criminal.

Maybe Grue goes bad...maybe. I never really understood why he chose villain, and I'm pretty sure there are more lucrative things to do with superpowers, although I'd have to think about it. Seems more like alien space worms than common sense to me.

Imp only went bad because she followed Grue.

Tattletale should have been insider trading or front running stocks. What she was doing -- highly visible street crime for comparative pennies -- was ridiculous for a smart character whose power was information.

I never got why Bitch was an active villain, other than "these people are my pack and they want to be villains."

Taylor...well, Taylor was just a bit of an idiot. If she wanted to make a difference, she chose about the least effective way to start doing it. And then she only went villain because Armsmaster was likewise an idiot. If someone tells you they're going to infiltrate the bad guys but can't tell you too much...go with it. At the worst they are a criminal who is already on your radar. At best they can actually bring down a group.

#+begin_quote
  and live in a disintegrating nation where the police have thoroughly lost control.
#+end_quote

That's got it the wrong way around. The nation has disintegrated (if it has) because so many capes have decided that the best way to make money is to rob banks. There are so many better ways to achieve power and/or wealth, all of them either perfectly legal or illegal but white collar and not at all visible. Again, why isn't Tattletale just doing insider trading / front running stocks?

In the real world, sure, there will be some crazies and some psychopaths who actively want to commit violent, highly visible crime. (It's unlikely that they will want to do it in spandex, though; that requires alien space magic.) There will not, however, be anything like the number that we see. To the extent that society collapsed in Worm -- however much that might be -- it wouldn't do that in reality, because there would be far fewer bad guys so not as much authorization.

Skinhead groups and other cults led by evil capes? Sure, right there with you. Random capes who just want to be criminals for money and power? No.

The society in Worm seems to be the way it is because Wildbow was working backward -- he wanted a particular setting and figured out how to justify it. Unfortunately, the justification required a series of things that all involved people not acting like normal people.

******* Tattletale's situation is a bit odd. If Coil hadn't found and recruited her, she might well have gone for something like insider trading. But I found the story of how she ended up there believable before I knew anything about shards.

Grue needs money, the support of someone powerful (like Coil), and freedom. He doesn't trust the government, and his powers are not well-suited for business, so crime is really a good option for him.

Rachel was a homeless drifter who accidentally killed someone, and who was raised by a succession of abusers. Hard to return to ordinary society after that.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure Wildbow was working backward. But the way he did it seemed plausible to me. Early in the story, before shard stuff was on anyone's radar, it seemed plausible to me that society had been destabilized by parahumans to the point that "whatever, I'll take what I want with my powers" was a reasonable life plan.

I guess it's easy for me to accept society being destabilized. Our civilization isn't that competent/durable, if you ask me. And superpowers represent a pretty big shock to the system.

******* One thing to keep in mind is that by 2011 in worm, there had already been over a decade of PRT propaganda and media campaigns about Hero vs Villain. They /designed/ the system to work against "Rouges" (parahumans who use their powers legally but don't fight crime), it's only at the start of the story that the gov't starts to pivot and we see people like Canary and Parian. Before that, everyone who was born in 1990 or later would have grown up saturated with the idea of Hero vs Villain, and not necessarily in a way that deplored criminal activity. Outside Brockton Bay, Capes teams are viewed more like sports teams, a combination of MMA and NFL, perhaps.

So the fact that Taylor's first thoughts were of fighting crime and not joining the agricultural industry, is not surprising.

  You should have to go that far down the cape list to find one Munchkin
#+end_quote

You're also forgetting that Worm isn't the best universe for munchkinry, by design. There are a few that can do it, but mostly it's far more limited than it'd seem.

You know a good universe for munchkinry? Irredeemable. In that universe powers are natural and you can follow them to their conclusions. If someone can warp space, with enough know-how you can use that to crush planets and solar systems. If someone is pulling a whole bunch of Superman-style shenanigans, they're probably more than just a flying brick and can learn to go beyond that.

Worm powers are artificial, sentient and /deliberately blackboxed and limited/. That sort of 'explosion-munchkinry" is not happening. People can and do use their powers rationally (Purity picks fights where her power is strongest, Jack uses Hookwolf as a vehicle for his power) but that's mostly what you'll get. Notice that Skitter is incapable of achieving explosion-munchkinry on her own, and she would have been even more hamstrung if two unrestricted capes weren't around for her to coopt. She was stuck with vanilla competence for the longest time.

And this exists also on a societal level. New capes are coming, they have powers that you may not have accounted for, good luck taking over the world. The list of people that can do it is probably smaller than you imagine. Leet especially is someone touted too much. He is after all a natural trigger, and the whole point is that they can be threats, even massive ones,but they are there to provide conflict. He's not allowed to do anything and everything. In fact, there's absolutely no guarantee that his powers don't bottom out relatively early. That's the benefit of shards as an explanation for powers: arbitrariness is now fine.

Then you have Endbringers, who can and will kill anyone getting out of hand and are engineered to be superior to just about any cape or any group of capes.

#+begin_quote
  Characters in Worm whose powers suffice to easily take over the world: Eidolon, Glaistig Ulaine, Panacea, Contessa, Bonesaw (instantly); and then Number Man, Dinah, Accord, Tattletale, Coil, Leet, Andrew Richter, Teacher, the Yang-ban... I've probably forgotten like half of them. I wonder if a prerequisite of a work generating an enormous quantity of fic is an enormous amount of untapped potential.
#+end_quote

Some of these aren't even worth talking about tbh. "Taking over the world" is not really that important a goal for people in the know in Worm, for good reason. Why does Eidolon want to rule the world for twelve seconds (to someone with his potential lifespan)? Others just can't do it, Tattletale especially is a massive overestimation. As if the PRT doesn't have its own whole division of Thinkers.

Worm deliberately shapes the world such that all the powers that can't be contained are more concerned with other things, or outright dead. I think it's generally quite thorough to the point of being hamfisted on this.

Contessa is, imo, the biggest break-down point, which is ironic because she holds things together a bit (why did GU go to the Birdcage? Why isn't Bonesaw creating a zombie plague? Contessa is the final line of defense). She's so strong her limits aren't as good at justifying why she doesn't do certain things, unlike other characters.

Also, you should have trouble reading Worm fanfiction about Panacea because they generally suck. Certain characters make better canon characters than fanfiction characters. See also: Coil.

** SPOILERS for Worm. (It's almost impossible to discuss without them.)

I don't have facebook, so I can't reply to EY directly, but:

Firstly, the shards are deliberately given to people who /won't destabilize the cycle/. Secondly, shards influence their humans to cause conflict. Thirdly, most of these can't easily take over the world because the others with equally broken powers would stop them. Fourth, the Endbringers target anyone who's doing too well at fixing things. Fifth, most of the Capes mentioned aren't doing as badly as all that:

The Number Man, Accord, Contessa and Dinah are already doing what's most important - using their Thinker powers to plan how to save the world.

Coil is taking over a city, but chooses to be cautious that is takes a long time. Tattletale did end up one of the most important people in said city.

Teacher was clearly working on taking over the world, and was reasonably clever at the attempt, but it didn't work out.

Richter - well, he was effective enough to get targeted by Leviathan. Who's to say he wouldn't have tried to fix things if he'd had the chance? Tinkers need time to work.

You overestimate Leet. When they say he can build anything, they do not mean it literally, and WoG is that by the time he figured out his limitation, he'd already burned out a lot of the best tech he could make.

Also, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.13577/][there is Panacea fanfic in which she does that sort of thing]]. I don't actually find it particularly enjoyable to read after the first few chapters.

** Ok, so Richter, Accord, and Bonesaw explicitly have (and spend much of the story working to overcome - well, substitute Dragon for Richter) shard-induced psychological limitations.

Panacea's /whole character/ is devoted to delivering the moral that an absurdly broken power is no use if you're a twit; so yeah, obviously she could be a god /if she wasn't a twit/. (For what it's worth, I think she's unrealistically bad at using her power, but then I also subscribe to the theory that her Shard was messing with her.)

Number Man and Countessa basically do rule the world. Tattletale, the Yangban, and Teacher explicitly /made/ their own bids for power; I think it's reasonably clear that their powers aren't that great, especially when you take into consideration that there are other people with powers out there opposing attempts to take over the world.

Leets power is ... variable in strength.

Eidolon, Glastig and Dinah believe, correctly or incorrectly, that there are bigger fish to fry than ruling the world.

I don't know, I was actually quite impressed by the levels of thought displayed in Worm. Not everyone is a "munchkin", exactly, but they do seem to have devoted a level of thought to their ability that you'd expect from someone whose day job is using that power.

** To be clear, I wasn't criticizing Wildbow. The original Worm does what it sets out to do as well as any story possibly could - it's trying (successfully) to be the Superhero Story To End All Superhero Stories, the category killer for its category, that doesn't let you ever look at superhero stories the same way again; the same thing I set out to do with HPMOR and Harry Potter fanfiction. Wildbow is rationalizing and therefore of necessity /preserving/ every aspect of traditional superhero stories, including Reed Richards Is Useless, excusing them and lawfulizing them as hard as he possibly can (and no harder). Even so the power balance in Worm is ludicrous but there's no way a human-level author could possibly avert that, given that they were trying to rationalize something akin to the Marvel or DC multiverse to start with; you just can't have economic balance or the weakest inexploitability given that many different superhero-level powers. Wildbow has thrown on at least four layers of inhibitors to try to rationalize why his Earth goes on spinning despite that, and that's the most he can possibly do without changing the nature of his universe.

What makes the voices start shrieking in my head is when I read a fanfic that's unaware of this, and depicts happy cheerful sane Amy not taking over the world (nor being attacked by the Simurgh or blocked by Contessa).

**** I disagree. I think seeing things from Taylor's perspective leads one to buy more into her character as the reason for victory.

Pretty sure she wasn't the only person doing this. In fact, her decisions in many cases didn't really help because the people who knew better weren't jumping in for a reason.

In fact,in many ways she did just really bumble about. The whole "go to jail" thing is a prime example, a complete miscalculation based on what information she did have but she doesn't see it because she wants to be a martyr.

Taylor won because Wildbow stacked the deck in such a way as to help her win while rendering all her rivals for the victory ineffectual. Attributing it to dispositional factors and leaving out the situational ones is no bueno. And I don't just mean that on a Doylist level; see how that fight went, inside the story.

Contessa or Eidolon don't have less willpower than Taylor, they don't care less about the Earth than Taylor. She doesn't win because she conceived of a sacrifice they couldn't imagine. There is no level of brutality or hardheadedness that Taylor could discover and sink to where she wouldn't already see the evidence of Cauldron's passing.

She won precisely because 1- they failed and 2- they can't do as she does (and not because they're dumb or weak either). Eidolon going Khepri is an extinction-event of its own, and it never seemed necessary or possible...until it was too late and he had already lost, precisely /because/ he is stronger etc. (Scion never felt a similar need to just precog-kill Taylor, though he did fuck with her with it) . Not to mention that Wildbow sets up a situation where necessary bits of information are only available to Taylor once that has already happened.

Maybe, on a Doylist level, that was what Wildbow was going for (self-sacrifice is worth more than sacrificing others) but I'll take a harsher stance than usual and say that he just failed, completely.

******* In some other stuff he wrote, he made it pretty clear that HPMOR takes place in a universe where complicated plans are much more likely to work than in the real world. He doesn't think he could take over the world if he wanted to, he just thinks that a Quirrel who made the same choices he would would be more able to take over the HPMOR world. As a matter of fact, that point is made in the paragraph directly before the one quoted. He lives in a world much harder to optimize than the one Quirrel lives in.

Imagine that HPMOR was instead a story about a power struggle in a kingdom of two foot tall gnomes that grant power to the person with the most martial prowess. Quirrel is a giant, at four feet tall. Eliezer comments that if Quirrel were as large as him, he would have an easier time of it. However, Eliezer is very aware of the fact that the real world isn't populated entirely by two foot tall gnomes who grant political power to the person most capable of beating them up, so of course he can't seize power in the real world simply by virtue of being taller than Quirrel.

Quirrel exists in a world with different constraints that the one Eliezer lives in. The fact that Eliezer believes he would have advantages over Quirrel in that other environment does not mean he also believes he could do what Quirrel does in that other environment in our world. Eliezer selectively crippled Quirrel's ability to think, in order to prevent him from being too gamebreaking. So, a non crippled version of Quirrel would necessarily be more intelligent than the actual Quirrel, and Eliezer can't be less intelligent than a fictional person who exists entirely in his head, as Quirrel can't think up a clever plan or solution that Eliezer couldn't also think up.

In summary, Eliezer is correct when he says he is smarter than Quirrel. He actually expressly states that that fact doesn't mean he could do the sorts of thing that Quirrel can. You are attributing to him a belief he doesn't hold. There is actually a reason why being as smart as Quirrel doesn't mean he could take over this universe as easily as Quirrel could take over his, intelligence goes farther in the HPMOR world. And Eliezer knows that.

Sorry if this seems a little combative, I just really don't like it when people get ridiculed for beliefs they don't hold. It's also possible I drastically misread the tone of your comment, in which case I apologize.

And 10 percentage points is just being a dick on the internet for the various reasons people do that.

/In real life/, the disagreements are kept quiet whenever it comes to anything that /actually matters/, on grounds that just because I think, for instance, that FAI is reasonably probable (viz: achievable by human effort) and hard takeoffs are less so, doesn't mean those estimates are into Mugging territory where I want anyone to actually disregard potential takeoff scenarios or difficulties where doing so could actually cause real damage.

Firstly: revealed preferences are almost always /irrational/, reflectively non-coherent "preferences". Secondly: all real agents are boundedly rational. Just because you, with your budget constraints and information, can think of something they can do that is much greater than what they actually do, doesn't mean /they/ can think of it, or that it lies within /their/ budget constraints and information.

Actually, what most makes that possible is common APIs on a variety of operating systems on a network that he initially opposed. Windows adoption of internet protocols was slow and reluctant - Gates was all about local private LANs running proprietary protocols (NetBIOS, LAN Manager) linked together via online services (Microsoft Network) using telecom style protocols. If he'd been successful there, there would be no Reddit for us to be having this discussion on.

The environment that Microsoft developed in was a very scary environment, business-wise. One mistake or missed opportunity early on, and Microsoft might not exist today, for better, or worse.

Very few companies are true innovators, but at the same time, most companies prefer to use their own ideas when they are of near-equivalent perceived value of other ideas. Especially when patents and money are involved. Microsoft is no exception.

The fact that Microsoft chose to reluctantly absorb outside practices by purchasing companies, taking open source ideas, and even engaging in shady bullshit is one reason why they are as big as they are. They are one of the 'last men standing' /because/ they were willing to internalize enough outside ideas to remain relevant.

It might not be pretty, and you and I would have almost certainly done it differently, but we weren't in charge. It's very possible that without Microsoft, the PC boom would have been much slower to take off. Businesses might have hesitated longer before adopting computers enthusiastically. Too many choices tends to frighten some people. A common architecture allowed the manufacturing world to build computer components for x86 machines much more cheaply.

************** Wall Of Text warning.

I think we're talking past each other here. You are talking about individual apps and components. I am talking about the bigger picture - the actual presence of non-research machines in places of business and government.

Windows consolidated the hardware market into a (mostly) common architecture. Apple had a small market share. At about the same time that Windows 3.x emerged, it was fairly clear that Microsoft was building a stable platform, and that hardware manufacturers were falling into a common architecture.

This made computers FAR less scary to businesses and government for everyday operations. As people who were making purchasing and staffing decisions saw the computer software and hardware markets consolidating, they recognized that there was less risk that what they bought today would be useless tomorrow. As more and more software was designed to operate in the Windows environment, there was less concern about a new company creating a better program on a different operating system.

Without that quickly-growing market of companies and governments buying computers because they were looking like good investments instead of risky, strange toys, there would have been far less collaboration, because there would have simply been far fewer computers. That said, computerized collaboration would certainly have happened anyway, but I'm confident it would have happened much more slowly without Microsoft, or some other company dominating the market like Microsoft did.

You need to remember that open source software is something that geeks like. Most people who do not self-identify as a computer geek don't want anything to do with open source software. Time-consuming learning curves and fiddly code settings are not attractive.

Now, as you say, the internet is growing to become more important for day-to-day operations. I agree 100% with this part of what you are saying. For some people and businesses, the hardware in their hands is nothing more than a bridge to the hardware on the internet. We would have gotten here without Microsoft, eventually, I think, but it would have been a much longer and more painful path.

Bear with me here for a minute, I'm leading up to something. I am 44. Barely old enough to remember a world without personal computers. I used Apple IIE's in my last year of elementary school, and went to college with an Apple IIC. I can remember when hard drives were first implemented. I remember being amazed by the huge amount of data I could put on a 3.5" floppy.

I can also remember when all groceries had paper tags on them, cashiers keyed everything in by hand, and fast food restaurants were strictly cash. Businesses did NOT want early computers for everyday use. Mechanical typewriters were replaced with electronic typewriters. Mechanical cash registers were swapped with electronic cash registers. Computers existed in those days that could easily emulate both machines, but they were scary, newfangled things.

Seriously, businesses and governments were scared of computers back then, for everyday use. They were complex, confusing, and everything about them seemed to change yearly, if not more often. Microsoft brought stability, even if they broke a lot of other things, and that's what businesses and governments want. Stability. It's hard to generate a five-year plan, when you can't predict your computer hardware and software expenses reliably.

Some businesses and governments stayed scared of computers for a long time. Examples:

Waffle House, a very large chain of restaurants that has been around for many decades, only started taking card payments about ten years ago. They only started using an electronic point of sale system about four years ago.

Clayton County Georgia Department of Motor Vehicles only started taking cards for registration payments five years ago. The Clayton County landfill is still cash-only when I take my trash there.

And you are correct, we are not on the same page here. I'm talking about worldwide computing infrastructure and the resulting attractiveness to businesses and governments which Microsoft helped to generate while it was reducing it's competition. You are talking about individual applications and components.

The fact that they killed off whole product lines was part of the reason for the overall growth of the computing industry in business and government. Remember that business and government generally do NOT appreciate lots of options, because that means they have to constantly evaluate all the possibilities.

When offered too many different plausible options in emerging tech, businesses and governments will sit tight and wait for the mergers and patent battles to start settling themselves before making a decision.

Business did NOT want to go with individual personal computers on individual user's desks. It was more expensive to support, it was more expensive to buy even with the relatively higher cost of individual shared computers. And it made collaboration harder.

Virtually every /real/ alternative to Windows (again, Apple wasn't ever in the race) was better. If pretty much any other player had won, everyone would have been better off.

***** Gate's maximalist attitude to copyright (cf [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists][Open Letter to Hobbyists, 1976]]) carried along with his success has done /enormous/ damage to the general purpose computation movement. If [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman][Stallman]] had pre-dated Gates, and his attitude of open-source, peer-reviewed, user-controlled software had prevailed over the MPAA and RIAA earlier (rather than Gates and to a lesser extent Jobs making common cause with them), I suspect that we would have advanced general computation by at least 10 years.

The Jobs/Wozniak dynamic could have played out differently too; Wozniak, like most highly creative hacker types, was not interested in preventing other people from doing what he did. Quite the opposite, the early Apple computers were extremely well documented. Wozniak understood that creativity is stimulated, not held back, by sharing. He wanted to see what other people did with his devices, in order to build better devices himself.
