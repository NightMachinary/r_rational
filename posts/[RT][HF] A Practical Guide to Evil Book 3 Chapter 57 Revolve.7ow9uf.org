** What a superb chapter. Sometimes this story's in a cycle of ‘merely' good set-up and skirmish chapters and I forget for a second these poignant character moments that eclipse so much of the material I read. PGTE has some great action set pieces and an enjoyably complex level of politics and scheming when appropriate but it's these defining character moments, these scenes with such feeling, where I can struggle to name more than a couple other stories, past and present, that compare.

*** I think it's important to stress that this setting, by design, is /built/ for interpersonal relationships. Names are people, so accruing power in this setting is built on dealing with people. Like, the canonical equivalent of having a nuclear stockpile is being pretty good friends with the right five folks.

** The third verse of The Girl Who Climbed The Tower:

#+begin_quote
  They say the third step is the cruelest,

  Walk when the moon is at her clearest:

  Love ends with the kiss of the knife,

  Trust is the wager that takes your life
#+end_quote

The first sentence of this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  The moon was out in full, and though part of me still grew irritated at the sight of the pale orb I'd learned to ignore it.
#+end_quote

So I'm pretty sure The Girl Who Climbed The Tower is a song about Cat and that each verse refers to each book (i.e. first verse - book one). If you think about it, what Cat just did was rather cruel, both to herself and to Kilian. The last two lines are still up to debate imo.

Before this chapter I thought their relationship would be re-established (Cat's trust in Kilian would be the "wager") and later Cat would be betrayed and die. However, the opposite happened - Cat finally ended her relationship for good.

So who's going to betray her trust? Could it be Black? Maybe one of the Woe?

*** Hmm. Remember that Akua has a agent in the higher ranks of the fifteenth. As for the third line, it could be that Black lets Cat kill him. It won't be a battle but a daughter tearfully killing her father to take his place

** u/sharikak54:
#+begin_quote
  “Does it get easier?” I asked. “Carving away pieces?”

  Pale green eyes met mine.

  “Yes,” he said.

  It was a lie. We both knew that. But I loved him a little, for saying it anyway.
#+end_quote

Reminds me of their interaction way back in chapter 1, and how later Catherine was glad that Black had lied to her:

#+begin_quote
  “Is this how it always is?” I asked, eyes still on the cooling corpse of the sergeant and the red smile I'd etched across his throat.

  “When you make the decision cold?” I heard the Knight speak from just behind me. “Yes.”
#+end_quote

(Can't find where she is grateful for the lie, someone help me out!)

*** u/haiku_fornification:
#+begin_quote
  “You know, the first night I met him, he told me it didn't get easier,” I told the goblin softly.

  A trickle of power ran through me as my Name stirred, strengthening my grip. Hand moving with swift purpose, I broke Hatcher's neck.

  “It was,” I decided, “a very kind lie.”
#+end_quote

Book 1, Chapter 26

I agree, it was a very nice callback. It also shows how much Cat has developed - previously she didn't realize Black was lying (he did say he was an exceptional liar), whereas in this chapter she called his lie straight away. Or maybe she's just a lot more jaded now, who knows.

*** I think Killian nailed that door shut, though:

#+begin_quote
  “Do you really think /friends/ is what I want from you? Getting just a part of someone after having had all of them can't be counted anything but a loss.”
#+end_quote

It's actually a really darn good quote for anyone who thinks you can go from being lovers to just being friends when you still have romantic feelings for each other. It's all but impossible, because at least one of the parties involved doesn't want to be friends!

Edit: Well, thanks for the gold anonymous stranger! I'm going to just pretend it was from EE and I have been blessed by the voice of the gods (above or below: it's not certain which!)

** I don't see how the proposition "cutting away pieces of you gradually becomes easier" is a lie. Humans can get used to ANYTHING if they're around it long enough.

Assuming it doesn't break you first.
