** Ana sums up my thoughts on this entire story:

“That is both really clever and the stupidest thing I ever heard,”

Why? Who comes up with this? How long do these things take to connect? Was Ana's name planned out like that from the beginning? Will we ever know?

Thank you, Scott Alexander, for this continuing masterpiece. [I] ain't guessin' where this one's going.

** #+begin_quote
  imagine the map of the mystical body of God overlaid upon *a map* of the Western Hemisphere
#+end_quote

/That's/ what I was doing wrong. I was trying to overlay the Sephirot onto a globe, and all of the parts were ending up in the wrong places or the measurements were wrong. Does anyone know what projection the map is?

I was doing Panama -> North Pole = 9000 km = two steps in the Sephirot, making one step 4500 km. I was confused because Juneau was only ~3500 km from the North Pole and from the midpoint of the north pole and Panama, and Baja California was about the same (~3500 km from Panama and from the midpoint).

** I have never heard that phrase and so I doubt it is one of the most popular of all time

Probably a USA thing

Also why does this work steering wheel work for the past 19 years if the autopilot doesn't? Both went through the canal once, but only the autopilot needed fixed?

Also it seems like a good way to change your true name
