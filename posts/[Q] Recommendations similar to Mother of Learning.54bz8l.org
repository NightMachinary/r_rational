I just finished reading Mother of Learning (as much as has been written so far at least) and absolutely loved it. The setting, the magic system, the quality, pretty much all of it.

The main thing I'm looking for more of is the way the MC steadily gets realistically and satisfyingly more powerful and more knowledgable (compared to certain parts of the setting) without outclassing the major struggles he faces and without making his allies obsolete (both common flaws in power fantasy).

Anyone have recommendations for anything that does that well? I'd probably prefer a roughly fantasy/sword-and-sorcery setting, +ideally original fiction, but I'm open to other settings and fan fiction too+ original fiction only please.

*Edit:* I think I underestimated how many responses would be fanfics. Unfortunately, I'm just not familiar with enough of the common fanfic canons to read many of them.


** l recommend [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]]. While it doesn't focus much on a protagonist getting more power (for one because there are many of those, but also because they're quite powerful already), it does involve the characters becoming more knowledgeable (one of the main settings is a University after all) and I think it is done quite realistically. The characters not only learn magic, but also history, politics, society and about themselves.

It's my favorite web serial among the ones I'm currently following.

*** This was pretty good, thanks for the suggestion. It does in fact start a bit slow and then picks up as it goes. Also, the main plot thread that begins within the first few pages of the story is very rarely addressed or progressed but the rest of the story is good too.

Also also, I don't think the title fits the story well--most of the gods seem to be trying their best and not actively being bastards or aren't doing anything meaningful. I think a better title would be "Arachne's webs" because that's a huge theme in the story.

As a comment: I don't think unfamiliarity with canon is a problem in a well-written fanfic. If it's done well enough you likely won't even recognize that it's fanfic -- for example, it could be argued that Mother of Learning owes more than a passing nod to D&D. The city of Cyoria bears strong resemblance to [[http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Waterdeep][Waterdeep]], with the dungeon under it mapping well to the [[http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Undermountain][Undermountain]]. It's been quite a while since I finished MoL, but as far as I recall the magic systems (clerics / wizards / psionicists) map well onto the D&D systems. Many of the monsters referenced were clear analogues from D&D. Obviously some of this is simply cross-pollination between fantasy tropes, D&D, and mythology. Still, the similarities are strong. Chances are good that you are not intimately familiar with the Forgotten Realms canon, yet you clearly enjoyed MoL despite that.

Some recommendations I would make, all of which are fanfic and none of which (in my opinion) require familiarity with canon:

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] A brainy magical girl (Ami) ends up in a fantasy world and accidentally bonds with an evil artifact. All the good people assume she's evil and fight her, and she has to defend herself without breaking her own moral code. There's a moderately uncomfortable amount of "clothes fell off" considering that the protagonist is 14 at the start of the story, but it's not too bad. The power levels increase gradually but significantly and it's highly rational.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]] A young woman from the modern world wakes up in a land of kung fu battle wizards and needs to survive. Her personal magic levels aren't much compared to those around her, but she leverages them into major power in very believable ways that often involve the proper application of explosions. The relationships and characterizations are especially good.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting up the Dark]] Written by my quest co-author [[/u/Velorien]], this is the story of a young ninja who is /not/ an idiot and uses his power in very munchkinly ways to beat significantly stronger opponents. It's smart, funny when it chooses to be, and the characterizations are excellent.\\
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest-story-only.24793/][Marked for Death]] /cough, mild self-promotion, cough/ This is a quest that [[/u/Velorien]] and I write. (If 'quest' is unfamiliar to you, as it was to me, it means that the readers vote on what the protagonist should do next, but the authors define the rules of the world and choose the actual path of the plot.) I've linked the story-only thread, but feel free to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][join the discussion]] as well.

Side comment: [[/u/FuguOfAnotherWorld]] (aka Jackercracks) was a co-GM on the Marked for Death quest until he got eaten by +a grue+ the video game Stellaris. (Come back, man! We miss you.) He writes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11402847/1/Roll-the-Dice-on-Fate][Roll the Dice on Fate]] which I like very much but I suspect leans too heavily on canon to fit what you're looking for. Still, I didn't want him to feel like I was ignoring him.

I do think that the story is great even by rather strict rationalistic standards and that the worldbuilding it has is stellar, but if OP is looking for a vaguely realistic power curve then that TGWP can't provide. A lot of the story revolves around the fact that the main character's superpower is utterly broken.

** The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheInfiniteLoops][Infinite]] [[http://infinite-loops.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Loops_Wiki][Loops]] might have what you're looking for, with some looking. Basic premise is /something/ happened to the machine that maintains the multiverse, and to stabilize things the various universes of the multiverse (as in, our world's fiction) enter time loops, each centered around an 'anchor' that is aware of every loop in that universe. Other characters from such universes eventually being looping some of the time and characters can wind up in other universes for a loop, but the core premise is that the loops won't end in a conceivable time frame, so all of the characters just have to find ways to pass the time.

A lot of it looks at characters after they've really hit their stride and the only possible challenge to their power are other loopers, so it's fairly character-interaction based, especially since most loopers trend to being relatively benign to each other, but there are also stories written about characters just entering the time loop for the first time, which you might like.

I also once read a Ranma 1/2 story called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/764256/1/Right-Moments][Right Moments]] which sort of fits the bill. Ranma enters a one-day time loop and learns more and more techniques and gets more and more powerful and knowledgeable, with appropriately more difficult challenges he decides to take on. Ranma generally goes it alone for most of the story, though, and the core time loop elements start to break down (long-term safety, multiple attempts) when he spends more and more time interacting with the spirit world. Even still, I found it a good time loop story for such an unsaturated genre.

Personally, I think if we could have agreed on two major camps we could have justified a weird situation where the Worm Loops were effectively two different main universes on Yggdrasil, where maybe it was and is a perfectly ordinary branch that got 'copied' to the junk space, in which Taylor wound up getting admin power. You would have two Taylors and other Worm Loopers, but that could be played out as an amusing quirk instead of a canon-breaking mess. But hey, if this works, it works.

The compilations are where someone took the snippets that count as canon and put them all together.

Heck, you don't even need to be familiar with the sourcework. I'm pretty sure I once decided to take a look at one of the universes where I had had no interactions with its canon, and came away with a respectable understanding of the source material.

As a side note, Innortal's a funny case. He inspired the genre, but his works aren't really in the greater style of the genre. They have worth in their own right, but don't expect them to be much like the compilations.

**** The main character in I'm a Spider was originally a human with a pretty unique writing style. It's important you find a good translation, because she speaks in a distinctive way with a lot of idioms and stuff that don't translate well unless your translator is pretty good. Here's an example of her style:

#+begin_quote
  Oh ho! All three meters went up by two, as did Offense and Defense, and Magic Power and Resistance went up by one. But uh, hey, Speed, what are you doing? I remember you being 348 before, and then you gained... twenty one points...? Isn't that a little weird? The other stats were a little more reserved about it... aren't you trying a little too hard? ...Offense, Defense, why did you go up the same amount? You're leaving Magic Power and Resistance in the dust, you know... Uuuuunbelievable...
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  After my successful defeat of the first squadron, the wasps started attacking continuously. I wiped out the second squad they sent at me without any trouble, but after that, things started getting a little hairy. They started sending multiple squads at once. No waaaaay! I mean, this is the right thing for the wasps to be doing, but, please look at it from my perspective! I don't want this many wasps to come! I'm still totally safe in my nest, but there's this constant feeling of pressure, you know! What am I supposed to do about all of these wasps constantly buzzing around me, day and night?
#+end_quote

The translator who I think does the best job is blastron01. The passages above are taken from his translation. His translated version only has up through chapter 106, but is the highest quality and captures the tone and quality of the original writing in a way I think others (including Turb0's) do not. You can read it here: [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents][(link)]].

Here's an example of blastron1's translation notes:

#+begin_quote
  Translator's notes for this chapter:

  #+begin_quote

    1. These lines are referencing the opening lines of I Am a Cat, a famous Japanese novel. “I am a cat. As yet, I have no name.”
    2. There's joke here that's difficult to translate directly: the protagonist says “I can't live a normal life”, then remarks that “life” (人生) contains the kanji for “person” (人), and that it would be more accurate to swap that out for “spider” (蜘蛛) to make “spider-life” (蜘蛛生).
  #+end_quote

This should give you an idea as to the quality of the translation. Very good quality.

**** I recommend RWBY if you like action anime with a character-focused story. I think of it as similar to Soul Eater, except I actually like the characters, setting, and humor. It's not perfect or rational, especially at the beginning, but it's more mature and intelligent than it seems. It's nothing profound, but I enjoy it.

It's still a goofy story about teenage girls in colorful outfits wielding crazy weapons going to a school for monster hunters, but if you don't mind the inherent silliness of that idea you should check it out. Just make sure to binge it, since it's written and paced like a normal anime despite the short episodes.

*** It does a good job doing a slow, realistic-seeming increase in power. It's also very nice that it's complete. In that sense, it has what you're looking for. However, I didn't enjoy the writing style or tone as much as I like /Mother of Learning/'s. MoL feels like professional quality. Not on the level of the best writers out there, but about even with more skilled new authors. I've certainly read worse in books that I purchased.

On the other hand, several aspects of TB (including the sex and the [[#s][surprise worldbuilding and character details introduced partway through]] felt very amateurish. Mostly in delivery, but also partly in conception. The interpersonal relationships read like they were written by a teenager, albeit one with good grammar and some experience with internal struggle. If copyright could be ignored and the story were eligible for professional publishing, I expect it would need a solid editing and some cuts first.

On the whole, I liked it a lot less than I expected to, given the high regard I saw it given on this sub. I kept expecting it to get better, and while it did in some ways, it didn't in others. I don't often abandon books or stories, but I also have pretty high standards, so I might have if I'd known how it would go. That said, it does have its good points, and others clearly weren't bothered as much as I was by the style issues. I expect that it comes down to the matter of fanfiction. This isn't a story that just happens to be about Naruto characters, the way /The Waves Arisen/ felt. It's fanfiction through and through. If that doesn't bother you, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. If it does, you'll probably have the same reservations that I had.

[Edit: For what it's worth, I didn't have much familiarity with the canon when I read it, and I was able to understand what was going on pretty well. YMMV.]

So instead I caught both her wrists behind her back with one hand and pulled her forcefully into another kiss, with my other hand tangled in her hair.

** For me, the training and growth of a character is by far the most satisfying part of fantasy. Mother of learning is likely to go down as my favorite book ever so it seems like our interests align. Here are books that I've liked based on the above qualifications.

1) firehurler. Indie fantasy book by a redditor that is incredibly well written and has a lot gong on. though the main character starts out with a ton of raw power, he gradually learns how to control it and how to use it.

2) lightbringer series. Book 4 of 5 is coming out really soon but it is well written and has a solid sense of progression of the main character

3) the waves arisen, Naruto fiction. Does run into the issue of making other characters obsolete, though not entirely. Very good gradual power up, though you probably want to have seen some Naruto.

4) Pokemon, origin of species. Unfinished currently updating rational fiction. Very well done, probably my second favorite currently updating web serial.

5) wheel of time. Certainly not rational fiction but if you haven't read it, well the main character goes from human power to good level without overshadowing the rest of the cast. There are like 2 to 5 secondary main characters who also power up in similar fashion. It may not be the most gradual power up, there are several jumps in power but in the end when he reaches his final level you feel like he has transcended to a completely new level both in power but also in his ability to deal with people and influence the story. It's incredibly satisfying after such much suffering and work though the work tends to be of thematic significance than actual training.

6) I haven't read this, I'm trying to finish off a few series before committing to this, but Worm is the obvious next thing I need to read.

** The "Schooled in Magic" series by Christopher Nutall. It's not rationalist but it is definitely one of my favorite works of rational fiction. The setting is a realistic take on what a medieval fantasy world would actually be like, the characters are realistic, relatable and often smart. No one ever holds the idiot ball and even the main antagonists of the series are not just doing things for the evulz like they seem to be at first.

Unfortunately there are a bunch of people on this sub who have given exaggerated, invalid or simply untrue criticisms of the series. It doesn't make sense to me at all that a work like Time Braid gets as much praise as it does and yet the Schooled in Magic series gets nothing but derision. The Schooled in Magic series is at least as good as Time Braid if not a lot better. I have read and enjoyed most of Time Braid as well as the entire Schooled in Magic series so far, so I do actually know what I'm talking about here. Both are well written and enjoyable, and it doesn't make sense for people to say that Time Braid is decently rational fic and not Schooled in Magic.
