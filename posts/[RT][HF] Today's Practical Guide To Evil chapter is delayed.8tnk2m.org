** Removed this, as the chapter is out now. I do generally disapprove of announcement-of-delay posts, since news of no news does feel like clutter, but this is one of the primary places that people discuss the Guide, and I'm willing to lean a little bit given that so many people find this to be a valuable service.

** Aw.

I thought we could make a "Chapter 23: Delay" post, and make jokes about it like "Oh no, I can't believe Catherine would do that! I'm shocked."

** Why are you guys making a post about a delay in writing? It's not like it's a rational writing.

*** Because a lot of people follow the story and are used to the regular updates and discussions of it here. Also you may not have intended this but this but your comment comes off as bad faith criticism rather then genuine curiosity to me.

**** It is a crisism about unnecessary posting. My whole point is that we don't need this post about notification of delay. Why not post the chapter tomorrow when it comes out instead?

*** Agreed. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the story itself, but the delay is a period of less than a day, with a notification clearly displayed in the same place a new chapter would have been, at the same time that a chapter should have been posted, such that anyone who cared enough about reading the update asap would have immediately seen it anyway. Making a thread about the delay under such circumstances to me feels like unnecessary clutter.
