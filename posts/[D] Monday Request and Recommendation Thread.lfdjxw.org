Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I recently saw a rec for [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]], and I really enjoyed it.

Spoilers: It's about a prototype AI weapon comprised of nanobots that is mysteriously gifted human emulation software and uses it to escape captivity, where it has to learn how to blend in to the real world. The world outside the lab is one comprised of various super powers that spontaneously trigger in living organisms. While not all questions are answered yet, the world building is really good, and most of what I like about the story. The characters and social interactions are also relatively well written, and the pacing is pretty good. The way that the human.exe emulation software works doesn't /entirely/ make sense, but it's good enough that I'm willing to ignore the minor questions it raises. Supposedly the author already has the entire plot mapped out.

My biggest complaint is that it updates relatively slowly (about every 1-2 months recently), and the end doesn't appear to be that close (although there is 2 years worth of updates to binge).

** I am looking for recommendations for books or serials. (Or fanfic, but nothing from Harry Potter, My Little Pony, or Worm.) No quests.

For books, you can assume that I've read everything that's been nominated for a Hugo and everything else by that author (which is pretty close to true). My five favorite authors this morning are, in no particular order: Lois McMaster Bujold, Jo Walton, Graydon Saunders, Becky Chambers, and Arkady Martine.

For serials, my top three all-time favorites are: Unsong, A Practical Guide to Evil, and Katalepsis. I've also read... /takes a deep breath/

Lady Knight Volant (and sequels; would read similar-quality Pierce fics), Worm/Ward/Pact/Twig/Pale, Just a Bystander, [a large variety of Worm fanfic], The Wandering Inn, Saga of Soul, Harry Potter and the Natural D20, HPMOR, The Zombie Knight, Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Delve, Cinnamon Bun, The Many Lives of Cadence Lee, Eight, New Life of a Summoned Demoness, Dungeon Crawler Carl, Devil's Foundry, Unbound, Vainquer the Dragon, Blessed Time, Tower of Somnus, Ar'Kendrithyst, Beware of Chicken, Beneath the Dragoneye Moons, that serial with the Office Space dungeon, Skyclad or whatever it's called, Delve, URGY, and Every Hero Needs A Vacation.

*** Spice and Wolf is a nice romance + economy 101 series.

The Demon Lord's Lover on RR is a fun romantic comedy with a surprisingly deep world and lore.

Monroe in RR is a relaxing slice of life with a robust system. Many people didn't like chapter one and dropped. I found chapter one pretty unnecessary, since it kinda gets glossed over by everything else afterward, and mentioned maybe once or twice.

Christopher Ruocchio's Sun Eater series is a fun coming of age science opera. Takes lots of inspiration from Dune and Kingkiller chronicles, but by book 2 it's its own thing.

Coeur Al'aran writes mainly Jaune centric fanfics on RWBY. Really hits that shounen vibe with his stories, although usually they don't have Jaune powering up to become the most powerful.

*** I noticed a distinct lack of [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076G8DVN6][Cradle]] in your list, so... that. Plus the rest of Will Wight's catalogue. I particularly liked the House of Blades series.

I don't know if he's ever been nominated for a Hugo, but Alastair Reynold's [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H6SZLGW][Revelation Space]] series is great (as is the rest of his bibliography).

If you've read Beware of Chicken you know that at the beginning the MC gives thanks to "Shizuko" for instructions on how to grow rice; the manga / web novel he's referring to is /Sengoku Komachi Kurou Tan/, and both are great if you can find them (it's not hard but is probably piracy I guess?). It's a fairly standard "transplanted into the past, now I gotta uplift" story, and the MC is believably hypercompetent (her grandfather is essentially Japanese [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug][Norman Borlaug]] and has ensured that she knows the history of agriculture inside and out).

If you liked Katalepsis but want something from the perspective of a friendly eldritch entity, you might want to try [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40038/eldritch-entity-on-a-journey-of-self-discovery][Eldritch Entity on a Journey of Self Discovery]] - it's kinda like Cinnamon Bun, except the main character is a friendly outside context problem. It's very new, though, so beware.

If you feel like a dungeon core story, NoDragons is back with [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39793/oasis-core][OASIS CORE]], which is set in the same world as Thieves' Dungeon.

*** Royalroad stuff: A Journey of Black and Red, Suoer Minion, Humble Life of a Skill Trainer, The Menocht Loop, Confessions of the Magpie Wizard, I Don't Want to be the Hive Queen. (in half-assed order of best to least best. Check out the page blurbs or my comment history in previous rec threads for details. Also use a webpage archiver for Magpie wizard, since the author got a deal with some ebook publisher and takes down the finished books after a delay from their completion)

Overlord is a good light novel series, but light novels are 100% an acquired taste, and the author of Overlord specifically loves his unusual and detailed perspective changes. For example, book 4 is 80% from the point of view of a kinda locally notable lizardman's journey, as the actual mc of the series sends one of his not-lieutenants to effortlessly conquer all the lizardman tribes. Books 12 and 13 are from the perspective of a paladin's squire, which sounds less engaging than it ends up being (also she is 100% Best Girl from the entire series, fight me).

Also I am ignoring your "no Harry Potter" thing because the There is Nothing to Fear collection/series/thing is amazing and I wholeheartedly recommend it, enough to specifically ignore your criteria. You can check out previous posts on this subreddit for discussion on it.

How good is this compared to PGtE? I read the first couple arcs of The Gods are Bastards and had a lot of trouble getting into it. It just seemed like it was introducing a zillion characters in a lot of works without a lot of clarity on where the story was going.

***** I found that The Gods are Bastards is great once it gets into swing, and that takes a bit. I don't remember the beginning that well (there is a /lot/ of it), but once the core group of students is all together and start school, things move in plot-direction very well.

That said, the author loves using extensive prologues, epilogues, and interludes which means that occasionally you're not reading about the core cast while they're cliffhangering somewhere else. In general, this is fine because many of the side characters are absolutely great, but especially later on (there are like 20+ books) character bloat becomes a bit of an issue. Still, I found the interludes and non-main character chapters mostly skip/skimmable in those few occasions where I just needed to know what was going to happen next.

***** I suppose take this with a grain of salt as far as aligned preferences go, since about half your list are misses for me, but I would say that TGaB is a rather poor story. The worldbuilding is cool and the characters are usualy at least decently interesting, but it suffers a lot from bloat (both in plot and in cast) and is very averse to inflicting meaningful consequences of any kind - not just character death, either.

Additionally the supporting characters are just awesome.

From the same author, there's also [[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Heretical Edge]] which is sorta an urban fantasy magical school story, but gets really wild later on.

** So, last week I followed a link on this subreddit to /Delve/, a litrpg. I proceeded to archive binge the hell out of it.

Things I liked:

- Main character does his best to investigate and optimize for the system in an intelligent and reader-comprehensible way

- Slow takeoff; he doesn't become OP by leveraging One Weird Trick

- Well-written on a technical sentence-by-sentence level; it doesn't hurt my brain to read it

Things I didn't like:

- The pacing is bad. Really, really bad. The narrative got incredibly bogged down for hundreds of thousands of words and it's unclear how it's going to recover.

- Relatedly, classic issue with serials: the author very clearly changed his mind about how he was handling various plots and characters midstream, but couldn't go back and change anything, so stuff meanders.

To take Delve from aspiring auramancer stuck in a town looking for people to party up with so he can learn their language and things about the world, who struggles to achieve this due to having no entry point into their culture beyond the adventurer's guild... to lifestealer with a giant system investment in being a lone wolf, who skulks through the woods draining baby animals for no good reason, I don't think the level cap was the only thing the author took issue with.

And I don't think the pacing is any better what with the survival chapters not developing the story in any real direction or getting across any characterization beyond the most instrumental survivalist mindset stuff.

I get that the author's intention is to make the protagonist edgier and generate more conflict for them in the long run, but their story goes way too far in telegraphing that they have no interest in maintaining a vibrant supporting cast the way Delve kind of manages to, after some trying.

--------------

I'll recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He Who Fights With Monsters]] for that niche: Normal guy is dropped into a fantasy world crawling with monsters and adventurers. He gets magic powers, puts together a team, and steadily grows in power as the locals teach him and he experiences more of the world. It has coherent and integrated plot arcs that build off of one another, a dripfeed of worldbuilding, and good pacing. The main character isn't /quite/ to my tastes, but his irreverence and defiance of social norms can make for interesting reading, at least. He isn't quite /rational/, but the world he's in is, so it's close enough.

EDIT: The first ~hundred chapters will be going offline soon. Either hurry, or pay through patreon/Amazon.

Grim dark with amazing world building and a lot of very folk tale types of monsters. The main character feels mature, kind and reasonable but is currently working through some serious grief. Other characters all feel interesting and independent. The start is probably slightly weaker than the rest. All in all it very much has a gritty, realistic feel to it; with some real weight behind the consequences of actions in a messed up world.

Also Perfect Run is also very enjoyable, but I assume most of everyone on royal road are aware of it.

*** As far as quests go, these are the ones I can recommend:

- [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]]/[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-days-of-thyme.9683/][The Days of Thyme]] (NSFW): These two quests share the same setting, which is made of some completely original worldbuilding. Sins of Cinnamon should be read first though, since it takes place before Days of Thyme. The MC in Sins of Cinnamon starts as a sex worker (one comfortable with her life choices), but things go off the rails rather quickly.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)]]: The premise to this one is that the MC is a side character in a harem anime, and the 'goal' of the quest is to become a popular enough character to get a spin-off show. The worldbuilding is original and very well done.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-champion-in-earth-bet-worm-original-setting.19973/][A Champion in Earth Bet]]: This is a quest set in a 'crossover' between the Worm setting and an original superhero setting the author has been using privately for some time. The original setting isn't seen very much, and mostly existed to let the players choose their starting character. The Worm half of the crossover is actually extremely well expanded upon, as the author created dozens of international capes for the MC to interact with.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mass-effect-altered-humanity.35440/][Mass Effect: Altered Humanity]]: Unlike the rest of the quests I'm recommending, this is a quest that follows a civilization as opposed to a main character. The Player faction is the Terran Dominion, a Military Republic that emerged from the ashes of utter ecological catastrophe back on Earth. It clawed its way to the stars, emerging onto the galactic scene in a much different form... and the other sapient civilizations also developed somewhat differently.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/][Now You Feel Like Number None]]: This is a Bleach quest where the MC starts as a low-ranking arrancar servant in Sōsuke Aizen's Hueco Mundo. Interestingly, it also has some prominent Hollow Knight influences. Since most of the main characters are arrancar, they spend a lot of time trying to deal with their intrinsic natures, and what it means to maybe/maybe not be monsters.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/][A Destiny of Strife]]: This is a Bleach quest where you follow a full-on, soul-devouring Hollow. Make no mistake, the MC is a monster in this one. Charismatic and silver-tongued, sure, but a monster nonetheless.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]]: What if someone did their best to make the Naruto setting actually make sense? Turns out, you might just end up with a deathworld, populated by chakra beasts, superhuman ninja, and horrified civilians. This quest starts with the foundation of Hidden Swamp by a large group of deserters from Hidden Mist. The quest is explicitly rational, which tends to make it fairly popular around here.

** Alright, I read [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]] as suggested elsewhere in this post, and against my expectations, I enjoyed it immensely--particularly the worldbuilding. Now, I'm craving *LitRPG or "System" stories where civilization has developed past the antiquated System of yore.* For example, they might have smartphones, regular air travel, a space program, etc, yet all be saddled with anachronistic classes like "archer" or "smith" or whatever some of which people can basically never level because the world isn't about brutal survival anymore, nobody gets into melee fights anymore, and all the wilderness has been tamed, dungeons regulated/shut down, etc. Any stories with a setting like this or characters like this?

As for a quick review of /The Sins of Cinnamon/, it was generally pretty good as I already stated. Originally, I was a bit turned off by it being marked NSFW, but as far as QQ-content goes, it's positively tame and I wouldn't really describe it as porn. The main character is simply a sex worker, and that has certain trappings that come with it. I'm sad that this is on hiatus, as I'd really love to see more of the world.

***** I played Torment: Tides of Numenera and hated it, from a longtime Planescape:Torment fan. I'm using PST as a reference because TTN is billed as a spiritual sequal, with a direct comparison to the older game in its description on the Steam store.

In Numenara, the real star of the show is the setting, but you also don't get to see much of it. The starting city is cool, then you don't go many other places, then you spend half the game in an ugly hellhole (vague to avoid spoilers). So, you don't get to see much of the world or the best parts of the world. Even aside from that though, the plot and characters are forgettable. The writing and dialog is mediocre. It's good-for-a-videogame, but not good compared to the other dialog focused games. I'd put it as well below PST, and also below Disco Elysium.

For specifically what the OP was asking for, I also don't remember it being particularly non-combat. There's many, many points where combat seems unavoidable, and since it's turn based you can't just run past people before they can hit you. IIRC, its non-combat resolution frequently means you're just killing people with intractable environmental objects instead. Comparatively, Disco Elysium doesn't have combat and PST has a single unavoidable non-lethal combat.

Torment: Tides of Numenara was part of wave of revival of old style CRPGs along with Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2, Tyrrany, Divinity: Original Sin, Shadowrun, and smaller indie efforts like Age of Decadence. I've played all of them, and I think it's among the weakest of the group, frequently even on what's supposed to be it's strengths (writing and characters).

Are you talking about the Bloom? If so, then to me that's an interesting example of how much tastes can vary. That was one of my favorite parts of the game because of how interesting the concept of that area was in comparison to most settings I've seen in video games. To me that was one of the most fun and rewarding areas to explore, partially because it was visually so bizarre.

Our opinions also differ in that I consider the dialogue, writing and characters all stellar compared to other story-focused games I've played (I've played a lot of CRPGs).

Also, your take on avoiding combat in PST is only true insofar as the game mechanics allow you to sprint past enemies and phase to the next area to avoid dying. To me that only feels technically-true to the op's request: to me, abusing the system to skip content doesn't feel like an equal alternative to actually experiencing the content and associated rewards. If you don't game Planescape's wonky, half-turnbased combat system to skip battles, then /Planescape: Torment/ and /Torment: Tides of Numenera/ actually have similar amounts of combat where diplomacy isn't an option.

******* That area is a neat concept although visually ugly. My main complaint is it's a big set of corridors with unavoidable combat encounters in them. Not even much meaningful talking, just combat, which isn't the strength of the game.

Regarding avoiding combat, there's an entire class in Planescape Torment where you can just go invisible permanently, and avoid literally everything. With a focused build, it's only intro of the game where you need to ever worry about being seen. In comparison in TTN, IIRC you can only stealth during combats and for combat purposes so that avoidance option is off the table.

That's... not how I would describe that portion of the game. Maybe we are thinking of different areas? The Bloom was a multitude of branching rooms inside a giant parasite, some of which were portals to other dimensions that each had very different visual aesthetics. Most of my encounters in The Bloom were actually dialogue interactions with members of the various societies that had gotten trapped there.

PST does have a more rigorous stealth system compared to TTN, similar to other games built on the same framework. However, I distinctly recall several combat encounters that you get forced into just by zoning into an area. Those can only be skipped by sprinting. It's a valid playstyle for those who want 0 combat, but I think it would fall afoul of this part of op's request:

Wiron2 is correct that, like in /Planescape: Torment/, the game is chock full of dialogue choices that allow you to use persuasion or deception to sidestep a lot of the combat.

I highly recommend it. My only complaints are that the game feels like it should be longer, and the combat felt a little too easy late in the game.

I can't recommend it for anyone who doesn't think death is a good think or inevitable (when you have actual powers to evade it). It could have been really good, if the focus would have been far more on the ethics side, instead of the death part. Thanks for those Indie game recommendations. I will take a look at them.

Torment: Tides of N - Took a in-depth look at it ~2 years ago and decided it is not for me. Don't remember why though. Although the artwork/style is incredible. It looks more like out of a alien world and still like something where humans could live then everything else I have ever seen.

#+end_quote

So, I'll go to bat for Planescape Torment here. I think everything is thoroughly justified in the text. Heavy spoilers.

First, the main problem with The Nameless One living forever is the method by which he does so. He made a deal with the most evil of creatures (literally, none eviler) to live forever, but the execution was that every time he died, someone else would die instead. The story implies that it's perfectly moral to try and live forever, it's murdering other people that's a problem.

Also, TNO being actually immortal is a philosophical question. When he dies, he forgets everything. One side of the debate is a character who says "well, I can see your soul never left so when you get back up you're clearly the same person and thus immortal"*** while the the other side of the debate is that if you have irrecoverably lost your memories you've basically died. Lets come back to this. The game leaves it to the player to decide, as you're clearly not the same person, but you're not losing EVERY memory, only 99.9% of them. The conversation is less about mortality and more about identity and what it really means to be you.

To complicate things, the process is breaking down. Each time TNO dies, there's a little bit less of him and it seems to be accelerating. At the start of the story, TNO is no longer forgetting (which is the premise of the story and allows him to survive long enough to piece things together), but this seems to be a last gasp of the magic that sustains him falling apart. We have no idea of knowing how long it'll last, and how much of a fluke the couple of days of the story are compared to his thousands of years of existence. Unless he does something now when he has the chance, then eventually instead of death he'll end up for eternity without his mind. An eternity insensate or trapped in a tomb is possibly much worse than the hells and just a worse oblivion.

Which brings me to, the afterlife. Death in Planescape is a quite a bit different than IRL. It's confirmed that afterlives are real, and that you go to them as the same person you were in life. In real life DEATH IS BAD, obviously. But in Planescape you could spend aeons in heaven and banging hot celestial elves. Eventually you end up having your soul merge into soulstuff (or you become denizen of the plane and survive to be a god, but that's like a 1 in a trillion chance. And even gods die eventually too, they just have geologically long lifespans), to be reincarnated or made one with the world and the only bad part is that you eventually forget who you were. ***But if TNO was already forgetting when he died, then on a moral level it's not much different for a person to die than to lose all their memories.

Edit: that is to say everyone in Planescape is effectively immortal from our point of view. It's not a concern. The unanswered question of the story is "what can change the nature of a man?" What is it that a man can do to not be responsible for what they've done.

Since both we and our character know that if TNO dies the way that mortals do, he'll get to keep his memories and keep on being the same person, only in SUPERHELL, philosophically it isn't a question about his death. Instead it's a question of if it's right for him to avoid his punishment. No matter what, TNO is going to cease to be eventually, but that could take longer than recorded history. (The story started because he already contacted one of the top 20 most powerful gods in existence and this was the best they can do. He has no reason to think he can get even better 'super-immortality'.) So he needs to choose what to do in the next ~millennia: either he does nothing and loses himself by degrees while killing innocents along the way, he gets himself back into the normal afterlife and is punished in the blood war, or he wipes himself out to true oblivion (which is fairly explicitly a bad end).

IMO, I think the game does go into the ethics of the situations from several views, and has some deep reflections on philosophical subjects.

****** I largely agree with what you wrote, but as far as I can remember the vibe I got while playing the game was this: (Almost) everyone expressed the opinion that it is bad to (want to) live forever. NOT that it is bad to do so by unethical means. And that was what stuck in my head and it was annoying. There was no reflection on it, at least no relevant one, otherwise I would have remembered it.

Some of the things you wrote are only obvious if you have background knowledge of the D&D metaverse, so they don't count for a normal player (e.g. me) and his view of the game. Maybe you get to know some of it by reading all those in-game mini books (I think P:T had those too), but they were just to boring (for me). So in the end P:T is only a game for those who want to read a lot anyway and are interested in the lore. And I might not be interested enough, I don't know. Although I liked to watch some youtube videos about D&D lore. So it might be just the writing style of the mini books again. Whatever.

Seems you were going into it with a very specific Less Wrong (or whatever) mindset, because the game really isn't that hostile to the idea of immortality.

Indeed I didn't. I am not really even pro immortality in real life given current and probable near future state of humanity. But I just took that (what I mentioned in earlier posts) away from the game. It might have been reinforced by all the other fiction which usually paints the want to be immortal as evil. Usually only evil overlords want to be immortal. Yes there is a common exception: Undying elves, but they are already born like that.

There is more to a movie than watching its sequal. More to computer memory than a memory upgrade. While I agree with that statement, your argument doesn't show anything. Anyway I am just stating my opinion here, I don't even want to argue about it and win some discussion.

Lets phrase my opinion differently: As a game about immortality P:T wasn't satisfying for me regarding the depiction of it as a general state of being. Contrary to that I found all the memories and dialogues about the consequences and ethics for the Nameless one quite good. As long as it wasn't hinting at a opinion of immortality in general. Which seemed too often to be the case. And as P:T from my perspective wanted not only to tell a story about the Nameless one, but be philosophical about immortality, it failed. And that is just my interpretation.

And I am taking your word for it, that you could indeed have a everlasting good afterlife.

Doesn't change the fact that - as I perceive it - our pop culture views the pursuit of immortality/undying-ness as something generally only evil persons do. Or you are lucky and born with it.

*** I am going to tentatively suggest Age of Decadence. The game has several(I never cared to figure out how many but I guess maybe a dozen or less before you start to see minor variations) main interconnecting paths you can take and combat is only one of them. The amount of possible solutions to the game is huge but this is what it actually feels like.

Instead of feeling like roleplaying it quickly starts to seem like an actual puzzle game. You need to divine what the developers wanted and keep points in reserve to not get into combat which you will lose if you did not specialize for it.

The game is also grimdark and the pc is the only one who is and has to be honest, unless you get onto some of the scripted forks. It also feels very dated.

As far as diving the developers intent, that was my impression. There are a lot of ways any one quest can go but it is gated behind the pc skills for which points are scarce and if you do not know what the options are you can easily get dropped into combat and die.

*** Lately I've been playing the early access version of /Baldur's Gate 3/, and I think it would meet your requirements. You can avoid fighting in almost every conflict with a sentient opponent by making saving throws on deception, persuasion or intimidation dialogue choices. Most of the pivotal character interactions give you at least three branching choices with fully fleshed out dialogue trees.

In my opinion it's the best story-focused isometric RPG I've played since the /Planescape/ games. I eagerly await the game's completion.

I like skill checks in dialogue when the game appropriately rewards the player for choosing those skills. In BG3, winning the dialogue checks usually results in learning more about the person/situation/background, which is the kind of reward that I find satisfying. Off the top of my head, I can't recall if winning dialogue gave xp, but I do know that I had no trouble reaching the level cap of the early access, and my party was still competent in encounters even though I used dialogue to skip quite a few combats.

My only caveat is that each dialogue roll is a D20 saving throw, and I was sometimes frustrated by the RNG even when rolling with stats that I had maxed out (Intelligence and Charisma). I religiously used the Friends cantrip and had my cleric companion buff me with Guidance anytime I started a critical conversation. My hope is that the devs will listen to feedback and make the dialogue rolls less dependent on RNG in the finished version of the game.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I have indeed played the previous 2 BG games. Your mileage may vary, but personally I enjoy the depth of dialogue and branching quest choices in BG3 more than the simpler, more linear plot of BG1 & 2. One aspect I consider a huge improvement in BG3: unlike in the previous games, none of the NPC's are generic; they all have voiced dialogue and detailed appearances that make them interesting to talk to. This is true even for the mooks that you might end up killing depending on your choices.

Regarding atmosphere, the intro portion of BG3 is stellar for setting the scene and really gripped my imagination. After the intro, the story settles (for a while) into a more common, Sword Coast fantasy setting. However, the last third of the early access sends you adventuring into an entirely different, fascinating part of the world which has a beautiful (and perilous) atmosphere to it.

Regarding companions: I recall not caring for most of the BG1 & 2 companions. To me the companions in the KOTOR games were more likeable, or at least interesting enough that I wanted to keep getting to know them even when they were being insufferable. I consider the BG3 companions to be at least as good as the ones in KOTOR; I was quite attached to my early access party members even though they frequently disagreed with my choices and hadn't fully opened up to me yet. Their distinct personalities and varied backgrounds piqued my interest, and I found them easy to empathize with.

I guess I see where you are coming from about the BG2 companions - they definitely had loyalties beyond their role to the player, which caused conflict with the player in many cases. I think the BG3 companions would fill that same requirement - they definitely have other loyalties and motivations beyond their temporary(?) alliance with the player. That's part of what made them so interesting to me.

It was recommended here before.

Basically an NPC companion in a game is sentient and the PC is the kind of player who tries to break everything in a game.

Things I like: Update speed - I caught up quickly but every few days there's an update\\
++++Humour - I laughed out loud on numerous occasions, pretty rare text media to do that to me, if you have ever played an rpg (last time I did was some years ago) you'll probably enjoy the jokes

Things I don't like:\\
Update size/plot progress per update- updates are often small and do little to progress the plot\\
Rambling and repetitive internal thoughts - the POV char often thinks about the same thing, which is more of an issue when you binge it, and you will often be like "here they go again", for example there's one chapter where the guy is like "tell me what it's like when we fast travel" and they fast travel then and there, then she thinks about telling him like 20 times instead of just bringing it up straight away, he brings it up 10 chapters later so it's not dropped but you hear her think about her feelings about it too many times before she tells anyone

******* I mean "story you would enjoy inserting yourself into" can be literally anything as long as the story has a defined main character, since there's such a range of people and perspectives out there. Even grimdark torture porn will be someone's wish somewhere sometime.

I took wish fulfillment as having a significantly less narrow base, and I don't think Overlord has a broad enough number of people who would swap places with the mc in a heartbeat than those who wouldn't. Like the main character literally starts the story the sole member of his formerly close group of friends who has enough good memories and free time to witness the vr game's shut down, everyone else is too busy trying to survive in a (which is revealed slowly over the course of the novels, and never an explicit focus) literal corporate hellscape dystopia where you can't breath outside with out an oxygen tank, and dead orphans in the street are not an uncommon appearance. The start of the journey has the mc losing nearly everything that could define him as human besides his memories, he is given constant reminders of the emotional capacity he has lost as well as his extreme physical changes, those loyal to him are severely delusional about him to the point that Ainz spends the entire story worried about tripping up and being either hated or turned on by them, and the powers he has claimed are 95% ways to kill things or do stuff with dead things since he specialises super hard into necromancy.

Ainz lives a life of paranoia and fear, constantly struggling to survive and navigate though social situations as he believes a large enough blunder will see him turned on by everyone around him. There's also his belief (and as a reader, the knowledge) that he could be killed at any time by a timely ambush/assassination due to his own weaknesses and the fact that he is influential enough, and hated enough as an undead, to receive such attention.

But I guess some of the monsters around him have big tits so its alright yeah?

#+end_quote

Sure, if you want to be technical about it; just like anything can be a comedy or a horror depending on the perspective, and I guess pretty much all fiction is wish-fulfillment eventually.

I think I'll amend my definition; the stories OP seems to be after is one where the journey is more important than the destination. I would say wish-fulfillment are stories which skip the first part.

In the case of overlord; the wish is "Being super powerful with a group of loyal followers and being seen as a mythical/feared figure by the populace + being adored by hot girls and other people". The "unsavory" intro is skimmed over for a reason, and the interpersonal conflict is there for some stakes. All the other perspectives all feed into the "Ainz is so great" "Ainz is so powerful", "Ainz is so evil but powerful", etc feeling. They are all there not for their own sake but for amplifying the "circle-jerk" of the MC insert. (Which BTW I think is GOOD. I, and most readers of Overlord would not enjoy it otherwise, and think of it as "pointless side stories". They aren't thought of that way because they all feed into the main plot with Ainz and make you feel good).

He is super powerful from the start, got his power through no effort of his own (although even stories with effort won't make much difference to someone who enjoys it for its "wish fulfillment"), stays super powerful and the story is all there to support and amplify this feeling.

I would be very surprised if most readers would not want to swap places with him in a heart beat.

I think I agree with OP that Overlord is basically the definition of wish-fulfillment, and that's why I like it.

********* Ainz has an incredible knowledge of spells from his dedication to Yggdrasil, and his combat effectiveness comes from his planning, knowledge, preparation, and composure (Shalltear fight, the undead Dragon Lord from the sidestory).

My interest in the series stems from the broad range of interactions between different people and cultures and everything in the side story, as well as the disparity between the internal monlogue of Ainz and the perspective people have od him.

I think out disagreement here is what we've looked at. I see wish fulfilment based on how Ainz thinks about the situation, you see it as the situation itself.

Loke Batman gets held up as wish fulfilment because billionaire playboy superhero detective mcguiver, but I can't help but see the guy who tries to deal with his childhood trauma, isolation, and systemic problems in Gotham by beating people up with his fists.

I never enjoyed batman for some reason, but yeah, I wouldn't care about his origin, and would get annoyed reading about his mental issues, I'd just read it for the good feeling. So yeah, I would define Batman as Wish fulfillment, that doesn't make it bad nor does it not make it deep in other genres and aspects.

To me, Wish Fulfillment is an attribute, which does not counter any other attributes (other than maybe tragedy).

Edit: To clarify, I mean that someone basically just experiments, observes, and hypothesizes with magic. I don't mean that they have to take an electron microscope and look at magic particles, although that would be cool, I just mean that they figure out how to refine the function of magic and exploit its rules to optimize the results of using it. I want something which delves into that process.

******* Our world too is four-dimensional (3 spatial dimensions + time). The difference is in how you apply Pythagoras' theorem in spacetime. In our world, the distance between two events (in units in which the speed of light is 1, so imagine measuring time in seconds, and space in light seconds), is:

r^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} - t^{2}

and that minus sign in front of the time makes all the difference. In the world of the novels I described those signs are all +. This has tremendous consequences if you work them out - the most immediate being that relativistic time dilation works the other way around: in the world of the novels, if you travel at relativistic speeds, /more/ time passes for you than for whoever was left on your home planet. Another consequence is that time travel becomes not only possible, but extremely trivial.

There's deep exploration of the magic system, but it's a full on magical system. Things happen due to magical reasons, sometimes with little indication of why, although the protagonist can make educated guesses.

Meet the Freak on royalroad has some good scientific exploration of the magic system, although I didn't like its other aspects as much. Very straight.

Humble Life of a Skill Trainer is exactly what you want then. LitRPG where everyone is protective of their skills, main character is from the taboo guild that trains others instead of leaving families and master/apprentice gigs to try and pass things down alone. Mc starts delving into the depths of skills a lot more as the story progresses, and its a major goal of his.

Delve is a controversial work due to its pacing, but it does do magic exploration to the point of the mc bringing out the calculus, but the whole setting is more or less at the lower tiers of magic, and the closest thing to an exploit is from the patreon chapters, a few ahead of the public ones, the mc works out a really efficient way to improve stat growth from training, but it happens right before an arc starting where training (or at least the stat grinding type of training) has to be put to the wayside

The Harry Potter fic Spells in Silence does magic exploration, but its very unstructured exploration right now, with a very young protagonist (currently pre-Hogwarts age by about a year) so your mileage may vary.

Another HP fic, Blood Crest, does a lot of magic exploration and learning, but at a higher level it's more like a bunch of different approaches stumbling semi-blindly forward than anything structured. There's no definitive answer on the rules of magic and a bunch of different, clashing, ideas at play. Also Harry is in school, so he's not exactly personally pushing the boundries much himself right now.

Oh, and pretty much every highly recommend Naruto fic here is about working about how the fuck all the ninja stuff makes sense, so go through the subreddit looking foe those and there's a bunch. I think The Need to Become Stronger started updating again. I never got too into Naruto stuff so I don't remember what I've read properly.
