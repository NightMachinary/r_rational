** Interesting to see that the White Knight has more marbles than many people gave him credit for, and has his shit together( what left that isn't Choir affected.)

*** The White Knight was raised in opposition to the Black Knight Who Was. For decades, the Black Knight demonstrated that no ordinary Hero could be raised to stop him. No enraged child swinging a sword could put a scratch on Black, no matter how powerful their Aspects.

And so the Heavens built a better Hero. Genuinely charming, even with his nominal enemies. Perfectly humble, so as never to abuse his power. Intelligent, to consider that his enemies are allowed to be smart, to think about what a smart enemy of his might do. Inspiring, to collect powerful individuals to him and so build an army.

He would have been a powerful foe for the Black Knight. Too bad nobody with that Name exists.

Now that I think of it, that might have been Amadeus' plan. He'd fought Hanno. He knew what he was capable of through his spies. He obviously recognized the story implied in their Names. He always did avoid getting into stories.

After all, the first time he fell into one, Captain died.

So, in order to survive, he broke the story. Burned up his Name, allowed himself to be captured. If there's no Black Knight, there's nobody for the White Knight to triumph over.

**** He destroyed the Black Knight during the invasion with his challenge. If Black had fought he'd have died.

Amadeus lost his power for ducking the duel, just like Vivian lost hers for not stealing.

My read of the story is that Hanno was meant to be a foil to Catherine when she eventually became the Black Knight. Black even states after fighting Hanno in the free cities that Hanno didn't seem to have the narrative weight for something like BK vs WK, and that the scope of his story at that time was small, as if he would not be one of the principal actors in the story. That explains why they didn't form a pattern of three.

While I think the inspiring kinda comes as part of being a hero, we haven't seen him make an effort to be charming. What attracts people to him is that he is not automatically prejudiced, and has the sense of peace to him that comes from the self assurance after giving up his right to judgement to the choir.

Similarly, we have not seen him being particularly intelligent against adversaries. I think his second fight with Black proves that. He spent so much time studying others' battles with Black, and seeing their opinions of him forming his strategy, instead of forming HIS OWN opinions on the matter. If so, he would have noticed that Black always uses tailor made strategies against his opponent, and wasn't above cheating Providence, and always uses stories to get an edge. He focussed only on the Martial aspect and forgot the wider narrative aspect and got victories that were only technically so.

It has been mentioned multiple times that Above prefers their tools to be powerful, but dim, and while Hanno has grown on me as a character and gotten some wisdom, he still, atleast to me, remains somewhat unexceptional for now.

And the idea that Black Burnes up his name as a counter to Hanno, while intriguing, is also ludicrous since Black didn't seem to have a good opinion of WK, and the name being Burned up was Below's doing in order to make him a claimant to the tower.
