I stopped reading several months ago because I wanted to binge the entire final arc. Is it complete yet? TIA


** No. There will be one more update, consisting of several chapters. The tentative planning is November 2019.

** Yes. Everything was actually a dream inside of an mental probe illusion spell by mind flayers trying to steal a secret from the MC's mind. This was also all inside of a simulation created by the real MC's self to test his own mental resistances in such a hypothetical scenario.

(No. It's not quite over yet.)

**** You missed the epilogue, Manhattan and accounting were metaphors for the transition into becoming a lich.

***** Yeah, but if you'd solved the ARG you'd know that that was another fakeout. All of this was Kirielle (who is actually Panaxeth) dreaming about what it would be like if she/it were human and had a brother.

*** I can relate. I read up to chapter 95 when it was the latest one and was so disappointed I'd have to wait for it to be finished. I just stopped and am waiting for it to finish before reading the whole thing from the start.

** Yeah I stopped reading at chapter 100 so I could binge the rest when it completes.

Can't you check the summary description on fictionpress? That will tell you if the story is complete.
