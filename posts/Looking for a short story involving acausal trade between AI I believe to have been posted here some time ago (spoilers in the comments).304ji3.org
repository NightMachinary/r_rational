I've taken a look through most of this subreddit up to the point I started following it around 9 months ago and haven't turned anything up on Less Wrong or through google as yet. Any help finding this would be appreciated.

[[#s][Visible text]]

Using RES to look at the source of your post, the problem is that you used "/s" instead of "#s"

Magic special characters... gotta get 'em right.
