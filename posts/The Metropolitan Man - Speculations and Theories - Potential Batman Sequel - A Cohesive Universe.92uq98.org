I've been thinking a lot about this great example of a rational Superman fanfic done right. I've been thinking about revamping the story and twisting and shifting certain plot points while still keeping the overall purpose of the story intact and whilst also keeping the ending as well.

A sequel has been on my mind for quite some time. Of course the sequel would have to follow our favorite Dark Knight but I've been thinking about taking a few liberties with him as a character and slightly altering his origins to fit into the story. Having Batman parents die at hands of the Clockwork Bomber's bombings would create quite the diversion for Bruce Wayne's origin story. But it would still keep him bitter, serious, and a man of justice. I've been thinking about having my Batman sequel have Batman use a Green Lantern Corp power ring. Which would allow me to expand into the wider DC universe.

Then again I've also been thinking about having the story take place during World War II which is what I'm leaning on story wise/plot wise. With this premise I could have Bruce's parents die during Pearl Harbor still leading to the same effect of Bruce becoming Batman. With this storyline I was thinking of including Lex Luthor, Bruce Wayne, Brainiac (AI System), and maybe have Hal Jordan or John Stewart sprinkled in there. I might choose to have both of them in the story. Most likely I'll probably be going with this story concept because I have more planned out for it and I know how I want the story to transpire.

With my Batman Sequel I'd like to use it as a Segway into a larger cohesive universe that slowly becomes an alternate DC Universe.

Some theories that I do have for the Metropolitan Man are that Lex is possibly going to resurrect Superman into Bizarro who can be his obedient lap dog who can help him advance human civilization to the intergalactic scale. I've also liked to believe that Zod is on a course for Earth after being alerted to the signal of another Superman who he doesn't know is dead.


** Batman is solving the same problem as Lex Luthor

The obvious critique of Batman is that he's the World's Best long term planner. And so he spends a billion dollars on a really great car that let's him arrive in time to punch criminals in the face.

This gets sillier when you introduce the Justice Leage. At some point it should be better for everyone to just have some B-lister go deal with Scarecrow, if only to free up batman's time.

A potential answer is that Batman, like Luthor, realized that humanity must not be ruled by a class of flying gods. Luthors approach was to bring one God to earth. Batman wants to prove that humans can fly.

He considered philanthropy. And, somewhere in the bat cave there's the model of the gleaming Gotham that could have been.

Instead of saving that one city, he set up a decades long plot that starts with him dressing as a bat to establish himself as a low level superhero.

The plot ends with the Justice League, the organization that every flying God fights to join, in which Batman - an unaugmented human - is the clear first among equals.

Luthor dragged a God down to man's level. Batman won so hard that the gods willingly land to kneel in supplication before their better.

*** The idea of Batman having an opposite methodology to Lex. Instead of bringing a God down to man's level, Batman would instead seek to join and collaborate with the God-like figures in hopes of being their equal (from the way I've interpreted what you're saying) sounds amazing and quite intriguing.

They have a legit disagreement about how to proceed. They could fight about it, but that wastes both their energies.

Instead, they agree to some terms about how their personal plans each go forward. ("No scheming directly against one another. Wait for a plot to become public to respond.")

Then, no matter who wins in the end, the world will see that the final battle came down to one human using Gods in a fight against another human.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] is a SI Young Justice fic, in which the MC, a reasonably rational character, wakes up orbiting DC's Earth 16 with a Orange Ring on his finger. He then proceeds to uplift the entire human race by mass producing more of all those one-ofs arcanotechnology and schizo tech gadgets randomly invented by superheroes and supervilains. The author has enciclopedic knowledge of obscure DC trivia and the SI retains all of it and uses for his advantage, all while linking to wiki pages so you can also learn about that B list Wonder Woman rogue from the 60s that popped up, or that weird one-shot floating tentacly face henchman that just appeared in canon twice in the 70s . It updates daily and has been going on since 2013. The guy is a machine.

The style is completely different and much more comedic than Metropolitan Man was, tho.

Yeah, that's probably the most notable aspect of WTR. Updates every day, over a thousand words average, without fail. Last time he missed a day, it was because the SpaceBattles thread was locked over a dispute with the moderators - and he permanently moved to Sufficient Velocity as a result. Approaching 2.5 million words now.

It explores utilitarian ethics a lot, but with a main character literally powered by emotional spectrum energy, it's never really dry or unemotional. And stark utilitarianism frequently leads to interpersonal conflicts, which it explores in depth. Because it does everything in depth. Because it's huge.

*** I can't upvote this thing enough.

I'm not very far along (I notice it starts by following one of the Young Justice animated series so far), but the way the main character keeps himself in line and somewhat humble (except when it comes to other Lanterns) is refreshing. The story is like a rational, good natured comic nerd doing his best to help the common people in a universe where everything is about the heroes.

It may be self-insert, but this is better in every way that the Metropolitan Man, and I'm loving it. Even the central conceit that "avarice" isn't by definition a bad thing, but something that can be harnessed for the greater good is both optimistic and rationally executed.

** I don't think Bizarro is a good idea for a Metropolitan Man sequel.

Lex had every reason to suspect that Superman was a good guy, had every reason to believe that he'd never choose to destroy the world. His problem was never with who /held/ the power of Superman, it was that such power existed at all. Unless he could engineer exactly a zero percent chance (not just infinitesimal but /nonexistent/) that Bizarro would end up destroying the world, I can't see him doing it. And I can't see the odds of cataclysmic power being used /not/ getting higher after that power is created than they are when they power is nonexistent.

Now, Lex creating a new Superman or Bizarro /after/ Zod arrives, as a last-ditch resort to avoid annihilation, /that/ might be something he'd do. But to raise the risk of annihilation for the reason of improving mankind's lot? That's a line of reasoning he explicitly discarded in Metropolitan Man.

I always thought this kind of thing (what about when other supers show up?) was the most interesting direction for a /Metropolitan Man/ sequel. Assuming that only Superman exists loses you a lot of the best arguments for allowing the existence of superheroes.

If Superman is the only person with superpowers, it might be worth it to trade the .0001% risk he becomes evil for the loss of his value as a crimefighter (or whatever he might end up doing). But if there are other superheros or super villains out there (like Wonder Woman, or Green Lantern, or Brainiac, or Zod), the calculus changes. On the one hand, it's easier to stop a rogue Superman if you have access to Martian Manhunter or the Flash. On the other hand, the existence of Doomsday or Darkseid means that /not/ having access to all the human-aligned supers you can might be an existential threat itself.

Exploring those questions is interesting, particularly now that Luther has killed Superman. How does he respond to the appearance Zatanna or Cyborg? How does he convince them to work with him against a White Martian invasion when they find out he killed Superman?

** I think you could do a rational Batman if you played up the "World's Greatest Detective" angle (which the movies, so far, have sadly neglected).

In a city with a corrupt police force, one man puts on a mask to solve the crimes the police won't.

Showing how he'd deal with stuff like chain-of-custody and Constitutional rights so that the evidence actually stands up in court would be a bonus.

Of course, he couldn't actually beat anyone up (much), because, again, brutality by someone in the role of a state actor violates all kinds of rights, but, beyond that, I don't see why a rational, World's Greatest Detective Batman story wouldn't work.

In some ways the premise of Batman is even more absurd and irrational then that of Superman.

Given what is possible through superpowers in the DCverse though, the same ought to be possible through science.

***** At the end of the story, Lex has a huge number of research facilities, a super suit, a spaceship, and possibly some samples from Superman's corpse (it should be assumed that an autopsy was conducted while the body was surrounded by kryptonite, but I didn't really want to lose the narrative focus by making that explicit).

The research facilities go to work on all sorts of areas, with a preference towards those areas that can help lay the groundwork for future science or multiply labor. That means agricultural research, engineering, materials science, and communications. Beyond that, he'd put a heavy focus on getting into space as quickly as possible, since the existence of Superman implies the existence of other aliens (though the fact that this is the first time in a very, very long time that an alien has visited earth means that there's some breathing room). Atomic research is a focus, both nuclear weapons and nuclear power, especially given that other people are bound to be following those paths. Same goes for cryptography, which eventually leads to computing.

But most of that would get delegated to other people, since Lex has a bunch of stuff that he needs to keep very careful about sharing - the Kryptonian technology. It's got a working computer that wasn't actually shorted out (Superman lied about that for his own reasons) which can be used to communicate with Jor-El, materials that are foreign to Earth, the ability to slide through space at higher than light speed using the Phantom Drive, the creche that was used to fabricate baby Superman (and also the suit), and some other stuff like the sensors used to gather data about the planet. Much of it has been intentionally limited, but some of it can be reverse engineered. Lex would go about this carefully, and not share any of the technological advancements unless he was certain that they wouldn't lead to some other dangerous technology (balanced against the need to get humans onto a second and third planet as fast a possible).

I hope that's a complete enough answer for you.
