** If I'm understanding Still Water correctly, the citizens of Liesse are not yet dead, right? More like they're just a ritual away from becoming undead?

I'm really not sure what Cat can bring to bear here so far as "hard measures" go. She's got a ravaged army, warp portals through Arcadia, the power equivalent of a Fae Prince, four Named (besides herself), and... that's it. She's going up against a force with a flying city, a bunch of mages, a Named, a potential 100k strong undead horde, and an as-of-yet-unnamed WMD.

What could she do to help level the playing field?

1. Portal or fly (on Zombie 3.0) Thief to Liesse to have her Yoink! something shiny. Targets could include Diabolist's multi-dimensional scrying artifact, captive members of the Watch, the WMD (if it's an item), or part of the Still Water ritual (if it has physical components).

2. Kill Akua's dad. Removes a very powerful mage, and will wreak havoc on her emotional state. Maybe. Problems abound with this - he's safe in the city, he's a powerful caster, etc. No idea how this would happen unless Thief could Yoink! him too.

3. Figure out some way to kill the fae royalty that Akua has captured and powering her wards. Maybe that involves negotiating with the King and Queen? IIRC, that captive is powering Liesse's flight. At least taking the city down will help level the playing field.

4. Maybe Pickler's got some good siege schematics for downing a flying target. Mortars loaded with goblinfire?

5. It's a good time for Hierophant to make a miracle...

6. If Cat can get to Liesse, she could potentially use Break or Fall on the city to take it down.

Forces that likely can't be used:

- Malicia can provide advice, but no real support... unless she's fine with Cat using portals to bring more Legions from Praes to Callow. Huh. Maybe that WILL work.

- The Calamities are out of action for the time being - last we saw them, Black is seriously hurt, Captain is possibly dead, Warlock is exhausted, and Ranger was doing her own thing in Arcadia. Assassin is... MIA? I think? So the odds of them sweeping in is slim.

- Reinforcements from other cities in Callow are possible (especially with Arcadia portals), but they're less trained than the Legions and hate Praes. Even with Cat to act as a figurehead, I don't see additional Callowans being added to her ranks.

- Getting help from a Good aligned nation is pretty much impossible, as Still Water alone would launch a crusade. This needs to be taken care of in-house.

From where I'm sitting, grounding the flying city is probably the only way to even the playing field a bit. And by grounding I mean "knock it out of the sky." It removes a huge tactical advantage, will likely reduce Diabolist's forces (and that includes the almost-undead army), and lets Cat's forces choose the battlefield. But I have no idea how they'll do that.

Thoughts?

*** Cat uses *Fall* - it's super effective!

Names are huge power modifiers. Adjutant could potentially use *Find* to locate the flying fortress and even though we know *Fall* doesn't literally make things drop to the ground, aspects do develop according to the needs of the story.

In addition, Cat has Hierophant. If she wants the city to fall, it will fall. The question is - is she willing to kill a hundred thousand people in the process? And if she is, who's to say their deaths won't be used in some elaborate ritual concocted by the Diabolist? It's one thing to start a war, it's another thing altogether to be directly responsible for so much death.

I agree with most of your points however I think we're seeing a transition in power within the Empire and Malicia will heavily push for Cat to take charge of the rest of the Legions rather than being hands off. Cat is basically Black's replacement so it makes sense to promote her as much as possible. She will be the "muscle" of the Empire, so to speak. Besides, the Diabolist is Malicia's direct political enemy and a rallying banner for all the nobility. It's in her best interest to remove her as quickly as she can.

****** Sure, I think it's entirely possible she might make that decision as a "lesser evil" thing. Personally murdering a city's worth of her own people for a tactical advantage, on the grounds that they're fucked anyway, would be a pretty dramatic character moment--a culmination of her slide toward rationalizing increasingly terrible acts, the kind of thing that might either shock her out of the path she's on or solidify her commitment to it. But that would probably be a last resort. I expect her to at least try to find a way to save them.

** I wonder if it's going to be explained at some point /why/ Cat is the last scion of Winter and the Seasons!Fae in general.

Did Akua's bindings keep the other Princess/Prince of Summer in captivity through the Queen's call(maybe in a pocket dimension)? Thus there must be balance of a conveniently Prince strength as noted in this chapter?

Or is simply that the King of Winter granted Cat free will by restoring her heart and releasing her from vassalage /before/ the transformation of the Fae was complete.
