Remember that (if there's any point killing him) this is an incredibly powerful mage, who has a strong preference against you implementing a third option...

******* Vern (the ranger) thought so, but only on the basis that there were no surviving witnesses to any magical deeds for several decades. Koschei never actually denies that he could still use magic, and might just prefer to talk for some reason.

**** That was basically my point. It's very hard to convince a lot of people to bear immediate & asymmetrical costs (evacuating & permanently submerging farmland, etc.) in order to mitigate a fuzzily perceived threat a century or two down the line. This is a medieval society that hasn't experience exponential growth long enough to understand it.

***** 2ndly, he does not have to hope for starvation. He should boost population as much as he can, and keep the carrying capacity high.

He'll be hailed as the Saviour as he basically saves billions (so that they can birth more billions), while still getting godless amount of mana when they end up dying of old age anyway.

Tho, that can be explained by him being a little villainy & didn't think of it.

** Interesting. Depending on how the spell interprets "killed" (Given that it allows for indirect means) you could:

- Make a spell that kills the germs in water, then replaces them with 5-50% clones of the dead germs, cleaning it while still giving you deaths by pestilence.

- Figure out how to cure various plagues, then withhold the cure

- Encourage the widespread practice of euthanasia in order to prevent suffering the last moments of the person's life, thus claiming their death

** Why'd Koschei go in that room? It doesn't look like Vern could do anything if left alone with the runes.

Doubling in twenty years means five-folding in a century?

Why would he channel all his power into the spell if he's going to Elder God status either way?

How does Koschei know there will be no more research breakthroughs? A thousandfold amount of wizards surely should be able to invent spells to combat starvation in any number of ways Koschei didn't imagine.

*** Good catch. I realized after I had published it that I meant to say "thirty fold" (2^{5} = 32). I will fix the typo. The results are correct, I think. (2^{5} x 60e6 ~ 1900e6) (2^{10} x 60e6 ~ 60e9)

Elder God status is due to return on investment from the spell that requires drain of all of the Dark Wizard's reserve, which he gets back many fold by subsequent bloodiness. Wizard's in this world are long-lived but not immortal by default. Sorry if that wasn't clear.

It's entirely possible (even likely) that technological breakthroughs will foil Koschei's plans.

Why did Koschei return to his secret lair? It's supposed to be in the middle of a forest, with no nearby settlements. He had stepped out to take a leak, when Vern crashed in. Perhaps Koschei didn't fancy fleeing without provisions...

**** Oh, him stepping in at that point was coincidence, I thought it was some ward alerting him, that Vern failed to account for because he thought Koschei wasn't there, and he only figured out Koschei has no power when he saw the bracelet say nothing.

I got that Elder God status comes from that, but it also would come from him investing half his total mana, and he would still get half of a billion, which is the same thing for all practical purposes. Unless he can't get proportional deathspring reward from lesser investment... yea that's probably it.

** I love it when people remember slavic folk heroes and/or villains)

That said, I highly doubt that "social forces" Koschei set in motion will keep fertility high. They are so unpredictable it's quite impossible to plan even for a decade forvard, forget about a sentury.

And yes, there is quite a few ways to deal with a wizard who has no power and whose only save is a bomb on a deadman switch. You can evacuate everyone in the blast radius, you can try to build a barrier around the blast and try to tank it. Or you can do a dangerous, evil and pragmatic move: imprison him, sedate and put on a mana drain, fueling some kind of great spell (welcome to immortality, bitch). Leaving him alone. on the other hand, is out of question: even if fertility rates will stabilize, he would still wield unmatching power and immortality, and the chance that one day he'll just go crazy and decide to wipe out humanity is just too big.

*** I love Slavic/European folk tales :-) I hadn't considered sedating the Dark Wizard. Intriguing. There isn't a 'blast radius' to tank. The damage is from breaching the natural dam that the downriver kingdoms/farmlands rely on.

**** Reinforsing a natural dam isn't hard, especially if you have some advanced magic. Alternatevly, it's possible to restream the flood current to a harmless route.

Sedation is generally one of the ways to deal with immortals. Putting a human in artificial coma is not easy, but isn't that hard either... especisally if you don't care about brain damage.

** Depending how the spell works exactly, there are possible counters to prevent Koschei from becoming a deathless god-emperor (assuming he can't be killed for the time being).

Since the main logic of the story seems to be that /overpopulation/ causes the deaths (as opposed to "being born", which is dubious -- the credit might then go to the parents instead, for example), a competing dark wizard could get around it by straight up murdering the population with lots of death spells at a time while plenty of carrying capacity remains (ensuring that no deaths are attributable to overpopulation on the grounds that they are all caused by being murdered). Alternately, they might try ensuring that overpopulation never happens via population control measures, or by expanding the world's carrying capacity.

For population control, one might try creating engineered humans who tend to be sterile when they are crowded by some measure (less than a certain amount of food, more than a certain number of neighbors, etc.). These engineered humans might be given a gene-drive like magical effect that makes sure the trait is passed on to all children. Or you could make them more fertile than baseline humans, e.g. faster maturation rates. They could also be selectively more fertile when interbreeding with baseline humans.

Another approach to population control would be a stasis spell that kicks in when people are too crowded or hungry. If it has a side effect of invulnerability, this could be helpful in preventing Koschei from getting credit, but that depends on whether he gets credit for you being killed due to someone murdering you while you are in stasis (since the death is now not something that /necessarily/ follows from overpopulation).

Finally, the option of expanding carrying capacity should be considered from the perspective of the world's mechanics. Does it have an unlimited number of planes, dimensions, pocket worlds, and so forth? If so, you could invest anywhere under 20 years creating new unpopulated planes without ever running out.

If the world is a planet in a solar system like ours, a considerable increase in carrying capacity (enough to buy several centuries of doubling time) would follow from developing its resources. Given that Koschei is vulnerable until enough people die to boost his power reserves substantially, adding a finite but large number of death-free replications might be enough to thwart him.

*** Interesting points. Thank you for thinking it through. What constitutes "responsibility" is deliberately not well-defined (as you and [[/u/fljared]] have pointed out). There are no known continents, or worlds reachable by realistic technology projections. However, magic IS technology. So, can't be ruled out. The funny thing about exponential growth (albeit unreasonable) is that addition of any bounded space capacity merely offsets the doom by a short period.

** In the /real/ world, infant mortality is way down from what it once was, but Western, advanced, countries are all reproducing at below replacement rate. Saying that "the social forces [he has] set in motion" prevents this from happening is a /huge/ handwave, because it didn't happen with identical social forces in the real world.
