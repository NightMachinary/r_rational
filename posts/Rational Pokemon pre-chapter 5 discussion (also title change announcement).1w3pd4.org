So I'm finally back in the states (and finally finished reading "Worm"), which means I can knuckle down and finish chapter 5, which is about 3/4 done.

Two things I wanted to discuss with you all first:

1) The title has officially changed! "Rational Pokemon" was a placeholder more than anything, as when I started I had little more than vague ideas of an overall story coupled with some more specific irrational aspects of our favorite pocket monster universe that I wanted to address. Now that the story has more or less crystalized in my mind, I've decided on a much better title, which I hope you guys will like :)

Henceforth, "Rational Pokemon" is now titled "Pokemon: The Origin of Species."

2) How to handle metamorphosis, or "evolution" as it's colloquially known in-world, is something I'm still wavering on. My thoughts are to either have it be a slow, steady progression of growth and change, meaning most pokemon simply continue to grow and develop new features over time (such as wings or extra arms). Alternatively I could stick to the system in the game, where pokemon utterly transform within seconds in a burst of energy and light.

The problems with the latter is it requires a rational (if not necessarily realistic) explanation for the many tangential details surrounding it. Such as: why do evolution stones or trading evolve certain pokemon? What's the energy they give off, and where does it come from? Can it be harnessed? Can it be interrupted, as in the games?

It's the kind of thing I can see myself going both ways on, so I thought I'd ask you guys and gals: which approach would you prefer to see as the "real" way evolution works, and why?


** You could have them go into an hour-long (or longer or shorter) coma to metamorph, during which they form a bioluminescent outer skin that stretches with the transformation.

You see, pokémon actually all share a tremendous amount of genetic material. All pokémon, at least by our world's definition, belong to the same species. Because of this, they need a secondary system of genetic material to control their form, a bit like epigenetics, except that it is totally physically separate from the normal genome, sort of like mitochondrial DNA, inherited from the mother. For simplicity, I will refer to the pokémon equivalent of DNA as PGM, pokémon gentic material, and the other system of genetic material as EGM, extra-genetic material.

In most pokémon, EGM is stored in glands until they reach a certain stage of maturity, at which point it is replicated and released. This induces the metamorphosis process. It should be noted that this does not occur at the same age in all specimens, but the condition of a pokémon's health. In fact, many pokémon go through their entire lives without metamorphosis; most pokémon exibit neoteny. It is theorized that metamorphosis developed as a stress reaction, expending a great deal of energy to make a pokémon stronger only when it was well enough fed to survive after the transformation, and was fighting enough to need it. Domesticated pokémon used for battling tend to metamorph much more than wild pokémon because of this.

As I said earlier, in most pokémon, metamorphosis is a response to being in combat a lot, but there are some other reasons for it to happen. The most common method trainers use to evolve pokémon is the utilization of so-called "evolutionary stones". Contrary to popular belief, most likely caused by the film industry's romanticization of the metamorphic process as a simple minute-long transformation capable of "saving the day" at a critical moment, a pokémon does not transform after simply touching a stone.

Actually, the stones are fossils containing archaic pokémon EGM. This EGM can be extracted from the stones and made viable, at which point it cam be fed to or injected intravenously into a pokémon, causing it to undergo a metamorphosis that it would not naturally be able to have. Such pokémon originally had normal metamorphosis, but evolved over time to lose it.

Another cause for evolution is love. "Baby pokémon", that is pokémon who do not exhibit neoteny and have not transformed, are the most typical examples of this type of metamorphosis. In the wild, they would transform as soon as they had enough food to sustain themselves. Trainers can provide them with this sustenance indefinitely, but the stress of a very young pokémon being raised by humans is usually enough to prevent the metamorphosis. As such, baby pokémon (and some others) transform only if they form a deep emotional bond to their trainers.

There are some other conditions of metamorphosis for some pokémon. A few need certain objects in order to transform. In this case the objects become incorporated into the final form; it is unknown how this dependency developed in nature. One fascinating case is that of the pokémon burmy, which covers itself in detrious it finds in it's environment. When female burmies evolve, this "cloak" becomes incorporated into their bodies.

There are many other causes and alleged causes for metamorphosis, but most are not understood or confirmed as actual causes.

I'm leaning more toward the idea that the stones are mineral-rich triggers for those EGMs that are usually found in the pokemon's natural habitat, which speed up the cycle of the pokemon's metamorphosis due to exposure over long periods: alternatively, trainers might build little "nests" of the stones, crushed into powder perhaps, for their pokemon to sleep on to accelerate the process.

This I see borrowing the previous idea instead: those objects have the same EGMs needed for various pokemon to evolve into their own unique forms. So a King's Rock might be a fossilized gizzard from any pokemon that the King's Rock normally helps a pokemon evolve into, and when one of those pre-evolved forms comes into conact with it, the dormant EGMs are awakened.

** You don't have to stick faithfully to canon in every particular. But maybe you could say that as a Pokemon grows and ages, it naturally prepares to undergo metamorphosis like a tadpole into a frog. For some Pokemon this is a natural aging process, that, at a certain point, ends up happening really quickly, if not quite instantaneously. For others, they need specific, rare minerals that can only be found a few places. When these Pokemon are taken out of their natural habitats by humans, the humans have to supply these minerals themselves in the form of evolution stones.

As for trading...maybe certain Pokemon have spent enough time around humans that they evolved certain responses? Maybe those breeds were abused to evolve too quickly so they could be sold faster at a profit, which damaged their long-term reproductive viability and, so some Pokemon didn't evolve until they had undergone a trade...somehow...and so the only ones that could breed were the "failed" delayed evolution types...or something.

In my version I think I'm going to do something similar in regards to an unbrainwashing program that removes their obedience from their original trainer and replaces it with the new ones, which could trigger the trigger you're referring to. In the wild, this trigger might have occurred in the species when a mating partner or parent died.

That would help condense the number of "weird" things you have to explain (like where all that mass comes from, assuming you actually want conservation of mass to generally be part of the physics) into the pokeball technology.

But it could well be that the energy from the pokeball, at the right time and circumstance, triggers an abrupt and massive metamorphosis.

**** The situations where a Pokémon would evolve are nearly all situations when you'd be recalling them to a Pokéball:

- After a battle where they've reached some trigger threshold (often XP, sometimes happiness/etc)
- After giving the Pokémon a certain item and then recalling it (this is the one with the least evidence)
- After receiving them in a trade (optionally with a trigger like holding a Steel Coat)

And while writing this post, I also thought of some more stuff:

Pokémon with odd evolutions to look at:

- Shelmet/Karrablast only evolve when traded for each other
- Nincada splits when it evolves into Ninjask and Shedinja
- Mantyke only evolves on level up if there's a Remoraid in the party
- Pancham only evolves on level up if there's any Dark-type in the party
- Inkay only evolves on level up if the 3DS is upside down.
- Sliggoo only evolves on level up if it's raining
- Feebas only evolves if its Beauty is high enough
- What the heck is up with Eevees?

Also, the original Japanese term is /shinka/ - this can be translated to "evolution" but also true value, progress or apotheosis. Possibly it was translated as "evolution" from whoever originally researched the process?

Trading is going to be done differently in this: it's basically going to be a de-programming/re-programming to forget the pokemon's training and attachment to their previous trainer and replace it with one to the new trainer. So basically the mental trauma of going through that is what triggers certain pokemon to evolve when released from their pokeball for the first time after being "traded."

This will have to involve simply interacting to the point where the Karrablast can steal the Shelmet's shell, then attemping to withdraw them afterward.

** You're going to run into even worse problems with the laws of thermodynamics as soon as you find a Pokemon that learns Ice Beam. And more problems with any telekinetic Pokemon. I'd recommend looking for all the places that you're going to run into this sort of problem and coming up with some alternate physics that cover all of them.

Given your new title, it sounds like you should focus on evolution, ecology, and biology as the sciences that are considered sacred, and let physics slip.

If I were to take a stab at it, I'd introduce a number of new atom-sized particles that bond correctly with normal matter but have their own nonsense properties. Like constantly generating electrons, or forming additional bonds at a distance, or absorbing heat. Just because breaking the laws of physics is on the table as an evolutionary advantage, doesn't mean evolution will behave any different than normally.

I think you do need a way for the aliens to break the laws of physics otherwise. Worm had the aliens span multiple parallel universes as a way to handwave all the apparent violations of conservation of energy (energy is still conserved, it's just being brought in from a vast pool nearby).

Psychic pokemon are one of the few that actually influence some of the humans around them, altering them in a way that creates a mental link between the trainer and their pokemon.

My idea for pokemon with ice powers are based on the concept of light or lasors that can slow atoms to the point of freezing. There's some recent technology that hints at such a possibility, though obviously it's nowhere near advanced enough for the kinds of magical feats seen in pokemon. Still, it strikes me as substantive enough to be a "bending" of reality rather than an outright break of it.

** For this near instant metamorphosis I could imagine that the Pokémon has to save up the energy over time. So that's because they have to get train first.

Hmm. When did I establish or fail to establish this, exactly? I feel like you're making assumptions outside of what I've written as yet.

The problem I think is that our minds are capable of accepting certain illogical things much more than others. A squirtle spraying out more water than their mass seems capable of holding? That's a problem. It's gotta be magic: there's just no way we can wrap our brains around a 3 foot turtle creating enough water for it to swim in, and with no apparent loss of mass to boot. Fill a pitcher with water, and that's all it holds: end of story.

On the other hand, we're willing to accept a pikachu generating thunderbolts much more readily. Some chemicals, some biological charge, and boom, lightning. We don't really conceive of energy the same way we do the other states of matter, like solid and liquid, so it bothers us less that a 3 foot rodent could generate more energy than his entire body contains, by many orders of magnitude.

So what solution do you propose? Because if you're not expecting Conservation of Mass/Energy to be broken in this story, I'm curious to know how you're expecting any electric pokemon to function, let alone the psychics that can telekinetically move objects with their mind.

****** My assumptions (and you're right, they are assumptions) come from a number of factors.

First, it's the default position as a reader. Fiction is like reality unless noted. Until you tell me otherwise, I will assume Earth rules apply.

Second, I am learning from Red, the reasonably intelligent viewpoint character. Red thinks "types" are silly. This tells me that it's fine that I'm thinking more realistically than the games. Red is surprised to read that Charmander's life depends on the flame, and he expects that to be wrong. This tells me that Pokemon probably don't depend on really weird woo-physics. Red is surprised when Charmander just throws fire, and he goes looking for an explanation. This tells me that /I/ should be surprised when Pokemon do things that are apparently impossible, and I should expect explanations for them. Red immediately finds an Earth-reasonable explanation. You're heavily reinforcing my Earthly expectations, and you're not doing much to make me think otherwise.

Third, compounding all of that, you dedicated an entire chapter to this sequence, right at the beginning. I have to believe that the way you're shaping my beliefs about your world is probably important.

It's still early enough to back out of that without being /too/ clunky, though it'd be best if you trashed those expectations right at the start. The solution, simply enough, is to massively violate Earthly expectations, and have every character be unimpressed, because that's just how the world works. I need to see Squirtle filling a pitcher without losing half its weight. I need to see a Pikachu throwing megajoules around like nothing. I need to see a Kadabra casually tossing an Onix around with the power of its spoon. Or, hell, I need to see a Magikarp pulling 200 kg and 20,000 joules of light out of nowhere.

While the existence of humans indicates that many "Earth rules" probably apply, the existence of pokemon indicates that, if this *is* Earth, these beings are not earthly in the way we understand the term: Earth rules may exist, but they don't necessarily apply to pokemon.

For proof, look at what we've seen of charmander: yes, he produces fire in a way that makes sense to earthlings, and yes, that fire is flung in a way that makes sense on Earth, opposed to some other planet or universe where fire could be "thrown." But that fire is produced at the end of his tail, fire that can grow to quite a blaze.

And yet it doesn't burn him.

Flesh and blood charmander may be, but that flesh is not Earth flesh, and it does not interact with energy/fire the same way we'd expect Earth flesh to.

Subtle, I grant you. I'll try to provide a more massive violation of earthly expectations soon :)
