Just heard about this. [[https://forums.webfictionguide.com/t/new-site-development/7479]]. There's still a good deal of work to be done, but by and by WFG will have a new administrator and, with luck, new entries will start flowing into TWF. This is wonderful news; I thought it was hopeless. Three cheers for Rocode.


** Awesome, I've been hoping this site gets faceted searches for a while now, hopefully it's on the list.

*** I think there's a whole lot of things on the list. Just semi-automated listings like they're talking about would be a huge improvement.

*** This is great news! I thought I'd missed the boat and that WFG was in dire straits. I'll post there as soon as submissions open again.
