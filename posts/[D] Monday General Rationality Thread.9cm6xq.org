Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** What do people think of MIRI as a charity?

*** I'm skeptical of its effectiveness, mainly because I've encountered more than a few people who believe that AI is what we should all be focusing on, and who still doubt that MIRI in particular is the optimal AI risk nonprofit. I haven't seen anyone write up something on what we'd expect from the ideal AI risk nonprofit, either, so as a layperson in a complicated field, I don't think I'm well equipped to judge MIRI's effectiveness myself.

**** Yeah , though there are not much more ai safety nonprofits either . And all of them are doing different parts of basic research so Its difficult to tell at this point which ones will end up being relevant .

How much competent researchers consider the problem important enough to work on it will probably be more important that money , unless you had the enormous amounts of money necessary to change that .

Miri has had some impact on the field , independently on how useful their research ends up being . But its not very clear if them having more money would change anything significant .

*** I have my amazon smile donation set to give money to MIRI, but that's mostly just because I think it's funny. My total donation has ended up being $3.62 so far, which I guess is enough for EY to buy most of a cup of coffee.

** So I'm planning to start my first ever quest. TL;DR the quest is about having strange dreams where you explore a world of horror in a bombed city.

Type - Exploration/Mystery/Experimentation

Genre - Horror/Mystery/Journey

Here's my current [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHLywZ8JPwUhB5CrGHwBW2dZEzShti6KAYdWhOsDLCI/edit][draft]] of the first chapter for anyone interested.

But I have questions about running a quest that I hope people here can provide advice on:

- I want to do an exploration/mystery style quest. This means that I don't want offer any choices and every post will be write-ins only. Should I expect issues with this?
- I have no idea what would be better to post this quest to. SpaceBattles or SufficientVelocity (or some third option I haven't considered). Or should I go with both and combine votes from both sites?
- I dislike quests where the character does things out-of-character depending on the vote. So I want to do a trait system where the character will have bonuses or maluses depending in how in-line the vote is with their (determined) personality. The trait system is inspired by [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/][Dragon Ball: After the End]]. Since it sounds like it might conflict with my desire to only allow write-ins, will this be a problem?
- What style of voting would work best? I know of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nettally-vote-tally-program.508853/][NetTally]] and am tentatively deciding on approval voting.
- A lot of quests have game mechanics, but I want the quest to be character-driven and to focus on the actions taken rather than stats. Will I run into issues without having stats?
- Anything else I should be aware of?

*** I've seen some threads where the Quest Master ends update posts with a note like, "voting opens 12 hours after this post" to give people a chance to discuss write in plans.

In your case, I might insert an extra step.

You make an update. Voters have 24 hours to suggest plans. You make a post that summarizes the top plans and opens things for voting.

You can even add a multiplier for plans that are especially in character

Yeah a moratorium would work well for that, and when I lift the moratorium in 24 hours, I can then post the plans made. Thanks!

***** I would suggest keeping the moratorium shorter than 24 hours; maybe two or three. Vary it depending on how much discussion you think there will be.

** I'm wondering if anyone is interested in exhanging notes from what we read or watch? Personally what I gain from notetaking is remembering better, and when it's meant to be shared I'm forced to be more organized, explain context etc. Receiving notes will of course yield a high gain low cost output, lets me know of its existence and see if it's worth the read.

It's supposed to be a “whenever the mood strikes” kind of thing - I'm in a reading heavy period now but I often go long periods without consuming all that much information. Neither do I feel like taking notes everytime I read. It would only be when either party feels like it.

Books currently on my reading list are: The Crowd by Gustave le Bon, Strategic Interaction by Erwin Gottman, Crystallizing Public Opinion by Edward Bernays, Notes On Directing by Frank Hauser, The Magus by John Fowler, 100 Deadly Skills by Clint Emerson.

**** So this bot seems to work by finding comments with the string "Sarah", "John" or "terminated" in them and making the relevant reply to that comment.

Honestly, I don't think it adds much to any given conversation, was probably made just to get experience making a Reddit bot, and should be banned.
