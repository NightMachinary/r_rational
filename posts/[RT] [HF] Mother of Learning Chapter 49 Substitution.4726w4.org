Thinking of Xvim as a rational person, he of anybody would definitely want to exploit the time loop. Perhaps by joining the time loop (which, despite Zorian's skill, would upset the balance of power between them).

If it's academic, he might be one I guess, but from what we've seen so far that makes for a relatively common title. His feats are not that impressive, the marble thing is clearly not intended to be done as directed, remember the tests was to knock students down some pegs, just sensing the mana isn't something he be shown capable of doing. Also you describe zorian as both "top mind magic experts" and "budding mind magic expert", and couldn't zorian could break his defense thanks to his mind magic's flexibility?

--------------

Here's a legit question: Why is the chapter called Substitution? My best guess would be Xvim thinking Zorian had been substituted. Nothing else I can think of works, and the titles tend to have more significance/relation to their chapter. This chapter has more than just that.

Now: the speculation.

Zach could be Red Robe, but that'd be a bit silly. I think Zach would be able to figure out it was Zorian from when Zorian said sorry to Zach before leaving to see the soulkill (if my memory serves). Also his skill during the fight (at least the coin).

There has to be more than Zach wanting revenge. I think that the relevant authorities were in on the invasion with the Ibasans. Perhaps Zach's families knew stuff about portals & the Ibasans. My memory is fuzzy on them, but they were military and /I think/ led the push against the Ibasans. Could the Weeping be man/lich-made? I think the politics must've been huge. Essentially, the Ibasans targeted the Novedas. When the Weeping didn't kill them all, Tesen Zveri was asigned as his caretaker to finish them off. It was all a conspiracy that Sudomir is taking advantage of. Please correct me on the Noveda family/Weeping if I'm wrong.

Regarding the scale of loop. First, the simplest thing would be to assume that the spiritual world exists throughout the whole universe too (or permiates). Now, it's also weird to assume that someone made the loop; I remember you writing that generally, previous mages weren't as powerful. Could the gates not be manmade, but god/spirit/something else-made. Something that either collaborated with the humans or the humans stole like every other piece of their magic.

Now, putting a limit on the boundaries of loop is complicated, eg. what would it be like outside of it? At the edges? Of course, it could be a simulation where say the Earth (or whatever it's called) is high quality, but the stars are lower. There may or may not be a boundary, like becoming high quality when viewed. But that's super complicated and has many nuances. So, if it was made by the gods/another powerful figure, then why not let it go across the whole universe, if the gods created it.

I like to think of it as a god taking the world as it is, then in a split second, preforming the simulation until it falls apart. Then, after the final loop, the souls that may be changed (time travelers) are affected. For everyone outside the loop, only the time travelers are affected. They are affected the point in time when the loop supposedly starts. I hope that makes sense.

The god puts (a) mechanism/s to interact with the loop inside it (soul switches, soulkill spell which I think is a switch, gates?)). Here, the two mystic gates aren't related. One is teleportation and the other is the single gate for the loops.

I guess this solves the stuck in soul trap thing and everything else. The looping construct would be just that, a construct. It's meant to fall apart (like the Matriarch said).

As for Kael's stuff: he can tell because Soul Sight. Second: his stuff is going to be used for something important. Perhaps there's another Soul Sight potion he's going to share with Zorian. Yeah, I'm a big fan of this theory. Also waiting on the purpose of the Silverlake chapter. All in good time, I'm sure. I bet they're going to meet soon.

*** Yeah, I always had the theory that everyone in the loop was just being "dreamt" by the primordial or something powered by it; the loop will eventually end once the primordial runs out of juice.

Furthermore, I feel like there's only going to be one soul that "escapes" from the loop. The Matriach's packet said something similar, about how there can only be one.

The final battle will be something out of Highlander; Zach throwing supernovas of mana, Red Robe summoning another primordial and Zorian, off to the side, ready to snipe whoever's left standing.

*** That seems kinda complicated. I think your theory needs shaving with an ocaam's razor.

I think it's pretty likely that there really are only two time loopers: Zach and Zorian. Only Zach and Zorian have that soul marker from when the lich did his evil spell thing, or at least, theirs were the only markers Zorian detected. If someone was concealing their soul marker, they would have to both 1. be a soul mage and 2. be in the loop. Unless the marker isn't indicative of someone who's looping.

We don't actually /know/ what Zach's motivations are, nor Red Robe's. If Zach was Red Robe, and if he had already deduced that Zorian was the other time looper, maybe Zach had no compunctions about killing Zorian because he would just be back in the next loop. Red Robe might be a simulacrum of Zach's. Have we ever stopped to consider why Red Robe disguises his identity? I mean, if Red Robe is in the time loop, then what does he have to gain from the disguise when no one will remember what he does in the next loop except for another time looper?

Maybe it's so that the ibasans don't recognize him as a noble from Eldemar, so he can gain their trust? While that does seem more like a Zorian tactic, remember that there is a possibility that part of Zach's soul was separated from him and fused to Zorian's, which could explain why Zorian got pulled into Zach's time loop. And Zorian has been fighting more openly and directly now than he used to, which seems more like a Zach tactic.

As for how the time loop itself works, maybe there isn't actually a time loop. Remember how the Aranea died? They never came back after the loop reset. Other people who die in the loop are back to life after the reset, but the Cyorian Aranea aren't. This feels like it should somehow be a big clue, especially combined with how "time travel is impossible" has been repeated so many times throughout the story it feels like forshadowing. So what could be going on?

I'm going to just take this theory and run with it for a bit to see where it goes.

Limits:

1. no time travel
2. not cosmic in scale. the phenomenon is limited to Eldemar and the surrounding nations, or maybe even just Eldemar if the Ibasans are already arrived at the start of the loop.
3. Zach is probably Red Robe, since it's pretty late in the story and no other major characters that we've met seem equally plausible as Red Robe yet. Even if Zach only has a 40% chance of being Red Robe, it seems at this point like everyone else is even less likely to be Red Robe.
4. the phenomenon is fueled either by the ambient magic, or the trapped souls, or some combination of the two.
5. It is possible for someone to be removed from the phenomenon. I.e. the Cyorian Web. Their corpses are still in the phenomenon, but their souls are no longer in it, otherwise they would be back to life at the start of every new "loop".

4 makes it seem like the phenomenon has something to do with the attempt to summon the primoridial, since that would be an obvious place for the ambient magic used up with each "loop" to go.

This rules out dimension hopping, because that would require the Aranea's souls to be erased from time after a certain point in all universes that are identical up until the "loop". Since that would be cosmic it breaks limit 2, and so is very unlikely.

Possible ways to remove someone from the phenomenon would depend on the nature of the phenomenon. If it is some sort of simulation (i.e. a "dream" of the primordial) then the Aranea could have been removed if their real bodies outside of the dream were killed. Supposing they're not time travelling, because of limit 1, they're not dimension hopping, which means that everyone in the story really is in the same place, which means that when the "loop" resets, everyone is replaced with a version of themselves that is one month younger. Or the changes to their souls accumulated from that month are erased.

Maybe all of the "loops" exist simultaneously, and Zorian is just jumping from one instance to another, replacing whatever version of him is already there. If that's the case, then maybe the phenomenon isn't being "fueled" by the ambient magic or trapped souls at all, and that's just an indicator of which "loop" he's in. When it "runs out" that means that Zach has been to every "loop". In other words, a finite number of "loops" all existing simulatenously. This is unlikely because it doesn't explain the mechanism for how Zach and Zorian are jumping.

Here's a thought. What if Zorian's soul /never actually/ escaped from its imprisonment? Nor anyone else's? If we're going by the simulation/dream hypothesis, then this would make sense, but it still doesn't explain why nearly every trapped soul is reliving the same month over and over without remembering any of it. Nevertheless, the "dream" theory is one of the simplest explanation so far that seems to fit in text evidence and it incorporates the soul-collecting machine better than the other theory above does.

I'm quite sure the starting points and ending points of the "loop" have to be very significant. Since Zach is the original "looper" we need to pay attention to what he does and what happens to him and in Eldemar in general at the start and end of every loop, especially the first loop. So what happens, generally? At the start of each "loop" Ibasans prepare to invade, Zach defeats his caretaker and runs away. At the end of the first loop, Zach was fending off the invasion when he got affected by the lich's spell. The lich's spell interacted with the phenomenon, pulling Zorian into the phenomenon. If we're going by the dream theory, and Zach had some way to remember things after every reset, then getting part of Zach's soul spliced onto Zorian might make Zorian remember too.

Maybe Zach snuck in some sort of device into the mansion to transmit memory packets to and from his trapped soul? This seems unlikely.

If we're still going by the dream/simulation theory, then we need a mechanism for how Zach remembers things after each reset. I think it's probably a memory packet. The question is how he's storing the memory packet. It would have to be stored in something that lasts through each reset. It could last through each reset if it's outside of the soul-collecting machine. It could also last through each reset if it's stored in something inside the dream that is still there with every reset. Maybe the memory packet is stored in the ambient magic that decreases with each "loop". After all, that ambient magic decreasing with each "loop" could somehow be hiding Zach's degrading memory packet. When the memory packet has completely degraded, Zach and Zorian will no longer be able to store new memories from each "loop" and therefore will no longer be able to "loop" and will lose their memories with each reset just like all the other trapped souls. The next question then is why Sudomir's soul would be in the machine if he's the one who created it. Someone would have had to kill his real body outside of the phenomenon. He said he created the machine for "political reasons". What sort of spell could he be gathering those souls for that would fit political reasons? He's not ibasan, and he's the mayor of Knyazov Dveri, and the people there love him, and aside from being a soul mage, he is not known to have been involved in any crimes or conspiracies against Eldemar prior to this one. It's clear from some of what he's said that he's not really on the Ibasan's side. He's just using them. So what could the Ibasan's give Sudomir? The ability to teach and practice soul magic openly perhaps? That doesn't really go well with his killing off of all the other soul magic experts in the nation. What about bringing someone back to life who is useful to him politically? Qtach-Ichl is the king of the Ibasans, right? Since he's a lich and that means none of his heirs could succeed him. Maybe Sudomir is trying to bring back one of Ichl's heirs, and is using the souls he captures to try to open a door to the spirit world? This would make more sense, but it would need some in text evidence supporting it. Hmm...

So in summary there are a couple of theories that are most likely:

-They're all trapped in a dream/simulation inside the soul machine -Zach is Red Robe -the reducing ambient magic with each reset is or somehow represents a degrading memory packet, and the memory packet is what is making the phenomenon possible.

I bet those psychic mice might have something really important to do with all this. They're clearly not ordinary evil psychic monsters. If they were, they probably wouldn't be any more dangerous or foreboding than a threatening Aranea tribe. While they could be being used by the Ibasans for spying purposes, i'm not sure if they've actually been in Cyoria every reset. Have they?

**** *If you're unwilling to read through my whole mess, [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]], read the bottom-most section, separated by the line.*

Yeah it still is kinda complicated and has elements not backed up by the story. Few things on Gods, Portals, and stuff.

In many ways it would be simpler to only have two loopers - one marker is better than two + the king's loop was only him. I'd say it's pretty likely that Zach knows Zorian's in it though: Zorian has given so many clues that if Zach was paying the least of attention and wasn't dumb, he'd have found out.

I'm not even sure it's possible to hide the soul marker; if so, it'd be super hard (probably). No hints towards that.

If Zach was Red Robe, he would've killed soulkilled Zorian already, considering he probably knows Zorian is a looper and Red Robe's 'kill every potential looper'/'kill hundreds/thousands of Araneans'.

Good point of the disguise. Of course, if capturing Zach went wrong (assuming diff people) then he would want the Simulcrum to hide himself.

How could he control the Simulcrum so well, though? We know for certain Red Robe isn't a telepath (otherwise Zorian would know). Perhaps when alone it would be possible, but probably not on the ground (as Zach) and attacking (as RR) at the same time. A potential solution would be Soul Switches bullshit, but Occam's Razor.

I could definitely imagine Zach!RR as a fourth party in the whole politics thing (Eldemar, Ibasia, Sudomir, Zach!RR). That would be more likely than him being good or bad. It's still problematic though (limping in when he first comes back sick, but he could've been fine and wanted to keep up appearenced for Zorian). Mmmmmmm, perhaps, perhaps. Doesn't fit with Zach's personality that Zorian's taken on though.

The Aranea plus *the assassins* were soulkilled, which is why in particular they are dead at the beginning. The time travel is impossible could be important, being right by simulation. We don't quite know what's happening with Soulkill though. I'd wager time travel is more likely than soulkill.

1. Difficult to say. Simulation's simpler than some other semi mind mess-with-people.
2. Again, what would happen when you exit the area? Especially by having an area so small, people would find out.
3. Less likely, yes, but not him more likely. There are more hoops to jump through with Zach than some random person. It's possible, but hard to tell. Random Idea:(With Daimen, Domagoj started off as world building, and just added that in as characterization for Zorian. Points for Zach?)
4. It's very hard to say. If more local, then maybe the souls, a very real possibility if the loop is what Sudomir wants. It fights the idea of the original loop with the king, though. Yeah, solutions, but Occam's Razor. | Regarding ambient magic, unless there's a well, the world is mostly a mana desert. (With the exception of the dungeons.) I was thinking alignment mana or something, heart of the world magic, or godly magic/mana.
5. There are definitely possibilities in every case as for why someone can be removed. As with some real time messing, it's simply trapping the soul (perhaps by attaching them to yourself in some way) to prevent them from returning to their body on reset. Or it could be souls leaving immediately after the reset. | A simulation would be a simple delete/don't return on something. A person with the marker could effectively have root level permissions to control the loop. That's the point of the switches. | As for your no real loop, it's less defined. Perhaps getting fully caught in Sudomir's soultrap? That would be debunked because of Kael(?)'s saying Zorian would be getting caught each time. It just gets more complicated to solve, which I definitely could.

Yes, the primordial could be involved in some way, but there is no confirmation on its existence. (Idea: it needs the soul container, but Sudomir would never let that happen if that was the case.)

Dimension hopping/Multiple worlds Multiverse sounds unlikely in either case. It's implied that the souls aren't actually killed, just moved/trapped/something else. Nothing requires they be erased, for anything. As for a godly or primordial dream, they would just be modified.

Mmmnn it's getting hard to respond. Sorry I'm tired. You're going into more and more speculation. More complicated than simulation anyway (not the most likely thing, anyway).

Of which there are many, that is, by a god, by a primordial, in the trap. The trap is unlikely because why would Sudomir go nuts? All of the dream ideas are simple in some ways, but have little basis in the story/foreshadowing.

  Zach defeats his caretaker and runs away.
#+end_quote

There's more to it than this.

Also Zach's first loop was not Zorian's first loop, right? At most a decade for Zach, I can't quite remember.

As for joining, parts of their soul swapped, and Zorian joined the loop. Thus, Zach keeps his soul and Zorian keeps his at the beginning of each loop. This is why they keep their magic abilities too: it's not just memory. The book actually says this.

I couldn't read your final paragraph. It was... uh ... too off base.

I love how you posted a long-ass response to me. That's awesome. However /you really need to reread the book/. Let me repeat, *you need to reread the Mother of Learning*. You're missing some important ideas that the story almost goes out and states for you. Without these proven ideas, it's really fucking hard to theorize. I've read 3 times, I think, and I'm ripe for a reread. Also, this is in my top two stories, so I love to theorize about it.

Forgive me if I'm patronizing or anything. I really don't mean it and want to enjoy the story with you :P

After you do that, we can come back and be theorizing buddies. Also, sorry for not putting quotes in front of each comment. Just pull up what you wrote along side what I wrote.

:\ It's probably real time looping and Zach is probably not Red Robe, but he could be.

Also, you spelled Quatach-Ichl wrong. Hell, I might've spelt it wrong.

In progress edit: The summary doesn't really need commenting on this. The brainrats have always been in Cyoria, just not always commented on. The Aranea have also prayed on them, too, especially after Zorian started helping them.

Thanks for the thought man. I'm also close to character limit, wow.

*** I just read this fic and love it. My theory is similar to yours. There were references to a machine or a room +that house Noveda had possession of+ (Black Rooms, mentioned in Ch 9. It was mentioned in the context of Zach's skill but had no connection to house Noveda.) for giving someone years of experience in a short time. I believe Red Robe used this machine as a basis for creating this time loop. It only works for House Noveda so he had to have Zach join to loop. Zach has the soul marker because that is how the machine identifies its master and give the master control of the machine. Red Robe did not expect Zach to be a problem because - he's young and incompetent, he doesn't know what's happening, Red Robe knows who and where he is and could disable him at the start of every loop if needed. Somehow Red Robe is able to join the loop without a marker, or maybe he has a market but can choose not to join or observe the effects from outside. The machine is protecting Zach's soul, which is why the lich's spell was broken. It may also protect his mind, preventing Red Robe from erasing his memory or something, which it seems Red Robe would have done already if he could have.

The powerful factions of the invasion are working together but not entirely aligned/trusting. The Lich knows there is a time loop but does not know the details. For example the Lich did not recognize Zach or know the loop could be messed up by soul magic, causing the whole mess for the invaders.

I predict they will find something wrong with astronomy as Xvim suspects. After the time loop completes it will return to the real world near the time when the loop began, though some time may have passed (minutes, hours, or days). Red Robe used a spell to remove the achanae souls from the loop/simulation. They will be alive as normal when the loop ends (it's possible they will remember the loop they died in). I believe Red Robe is currently trying to identify the other loopers by doing as little as possible. Maybe doing something to cause Zach to get out of the way so Red Robe can better isolate the other actors.

** I find it extremly unlikely that Red Robe is Zach.

What does this Red Zach /wants/? He wants to burn Cyoria to the ground? Well, he did it dozens of times by now. Why didn't he exit the loop? He wants to munchkin the loop before exiting it? Then why he wasted time on invasion, and why he wastes time on this game with Zorian? He wanted to play chess with himself, and then, when it bored him, he created Zorian to play cat and mouse? That's far too Occam-unfriendly theory, on the level of 'it's all just a dream'.

Really, even Daimen!Red_Robe makes more sense.

That said, everybody who paid attention know that Red Robe is actually *Veyers Boranova*, and this chapter's ending all but confirmed it. He is from Noble House, too, if you missed it.

Think about it. From in-story perspective, low morals --- check, bad temper --- check, motive to see Cyoria burn --- check, a reason to hide his identity (from Zach) --- check, political reason to help Ulquaan Ibasa --- check, opportunity to notice the loop --- check, access to resources necessary to hijack the loop --- check.

  "A topic for another time," Ilsa said without missing a beat. "For now, I want you to take notice of what happened when you dispelled the spell on the bowl -- it dropped like a rock, and if it had not been magically strengthened, it would have probably shattered upon impacting the table. This is the main problem inherent in all disruptor spells. Disruptor spells are the simplest form of dispelling, and *virtually every spell can be disrupted if you put enough power into the disruptor, but sometimes disrupting the spell can have worse consequences than letting it run its course.* This is especially true for higher-order spells, which almost always react explosively to disruption because of the vast amount of mana that goes into their casting. Not to mention that 'enough power' can be far more than any mage can provide. Place your bowls on the table and put a few torn pages from your notebook into it."

*** I think it's more likely that Red Robe (or whoever started the time loop) is another member of Zach's family (or someone else with a vested interest in Zach's survival), and that part of their "win condition" is that Zach needs to survive the events that they're putting into motion.

I've also been suspecting that it's Neolu for ages - or that, at a minimum, Neolu is working with Zach the way that Kael is working with Zorian.

From way back in Chapter 3:

"Neolu finished in only half an hour," said Akoja after a brief silence. "I bet she'll get a perfect score again."

"Ako..." Zorian sighed.

"I know everyone thinks I'm jealous but that's not normal!" said Akoja in a hushed but agitated voice. "I'm pretty smart and I study all the time and I'm still having problems with the curriculum. And we've both been in the same class with Neolu for the first two years and she was never this good. And... and now she's beating me in every single class!"

"Kind of like Zach," said Zorian.

"Exactly like Zach!" she agreed. "They even hang out together, two of them and one other girl I don't know, behaving like... like they're in their in their own private little world."
