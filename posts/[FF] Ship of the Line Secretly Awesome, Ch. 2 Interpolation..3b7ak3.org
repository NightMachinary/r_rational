** Introducing a Culture Mind into almost any story will result in a one-sided smash.

I feel that Willo's ship name lacks a certain gravitas.

*** GCU Sufficiently Advanced Technology would have made sense for Willo(w)

The Minds are a bit OP in most situations, I'm trying to work out what in the Buffy and Stargate universes could be a worthwhile antagonist. Janus et al as (partially) Ascended beings? The Culture's post physicals are very non-interventionalist compared to SG.

Sure, Willow &co will probably trounce anyone they encounter in this galaxy. At the very least, no one else has weapons with a range of several light years or more. (I'm thinking of effectors and displacers.)

But there's more to difficulty than military might. Consider the United States in the present day. The US is far more powerful than any force it might wish to oppose in the Middle East. Yet most would agree that the US is /losing/ ground there. Why? Well, in part, the US can't effectively use all its power since it would face opposition from its citizens and other actually-powerful nations. But even if it could, I'd still argue that it has a tough road ahead. If the US's goal is to make the Middle East flourish (rather than, say, to obtain max oil), then it can't just kill people until they start flourishing. The problem is a social / cultural one.

Although the analogy isn't perfect, think about what would happen if the Culture simply killed all the Goa'uld. Would that be sufficient for the Culture's foreign policy goals? Would it even be necessary?

***** Well, there are a few things from the SG universe that could be threatening (e.g. the black hole wormhole sunkiller trick) but yeah, a Culture vessel is pretty invulnerable unless they do something stupid.

Saying that, one of the gang does something stupid is the plot for a surprisingly large number of episodes of Buffy, so we shall see.

***** To be honest, I didn't google the meaning before I picked it from faint memory.

Please don't tell the other ships.

[edit] Retrocanonically it's a joke because Contact represents the Culture to the outside world.

******** [[http://i.imgur.com/44xRSVS.png][Nothing like this?]] If that's the case, just let me know what you want and I'll manually assign it. I've double-checked the subreddit settings though, and everything looks good there. (It might also appear when you first click "Edit". This might be one of those RES things that I forget other people don't have.)
