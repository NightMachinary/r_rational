The premise of the story is that it is a futuristic rational civilizations, where everyone has at least basic rationality training. But, one guy is a "Judge" or something like that, and he is going to be taking an exam where he has to meet moral, ethical and rational standards. A senior Judge calls him in and has him read a story about a person similar to him who is crash landed in a boat fron a shuttle explosion with 5 other people (a Medic, an accountant, an Engineer, +2) and they determine that one of them must be a traitor (the one who blew up the shuttle). The ending is basically that the judge accidentally helps the medic kill another person because he thought that the medic was trying to save his life, and the medic is the traitor. The real twist is that the lead character of the story is the person who was going to take the test's genderswapped clone (identical brain patterns or something like that) (inside a simulation) and that was his judge test.
