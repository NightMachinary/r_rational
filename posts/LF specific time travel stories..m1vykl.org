Sorry if posting the request to wrong community, unpublish the post plz, if that's the case.

Looking for 'real world' type of time travel fics, with the plot along the following lines:

MC is travelled back in time to younger self (or his current older self is travelled back);

MC doesn't have any obvious super powers (magic, lasers from the eyes or whatever);

MC does have knowledge of future events (more or less);

The story takes place in real world.

Recently found a nice example on royal road, 'Re: trailer thrash', was fascinated with how differently american author handled the plot, comparing to russian authors.

Will MC try to prevent some events happening in his/her country history, if yes, how he/she will do it, what those events will be?

Will it be ok for the MC to steal intellectual property in order to become reach?

Trying to expand my cultural experience horizon in a way, I guess.


** Adjacent to your request:

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (modern man goes back to Camelot)

How to Invent Everything by Ryan North (how to restart civilization if your time machine breaks down)

Tom series by Stephen Matthews, (modern man wanders back to the Stone Age)

All you zombies, short story by Heinlein... closer to what you're looking for, and... odd, but excellent.

The Cookie Monster by Vernon Vinge is an almost but not quite, and still short enough to recommend.

Start with all you zombies though.

Edit: None of these are really fits though...

**** [[https://xkcd.com/1053/]]

There's always someone learning about it for the first time.

Islands in the Stream of Time is another one similar to 1632, where a town gets sent back, IIRC. Haven't read it yet, but it's on my list. I love the books where modern day humans get sent back in time and bootstrap civilization forwards. Will try to think of some more.

And again, most of those I mentioned are... tangential to your original request. But I'll be interested to see what you think of All You Zombies. They made it into a movie (Predestination) which does a good job of capturing it. Just go in blind though, otherwise it spoils the ending.

***** Although read a lot of Heinlein, somehow missed this story before. Masterpiece of multilayer story with a bunch of inner jokes i've missed.

Sometimes there are layers of perception found in stories. Layer 1, character A did X, character B did Y. Layer 2, character A did X, but it was author's allusion to Z. This kind of layers.

Although the story is real good, I'm currently looking for smth more mundane.

*** It used to be pretty popular subgenre, yes.

In more serious patriotic type of stories, MC helps in WW2, or tries to save USSR, depending on time period.

In more cracky stories, MC just enjoys the life f@cking classmates and being basically adult in a teen body he is very confident and smart.

The common trend here, typically none of MCs see any issue with stealing of intellectual property.

Travelled back to USSR in 60s driving your Toyota? You can reverse engineer A LOT from it.

Travelled to 70s? Write famous pop song hits 5 years before the author.

In 40? You can 'invent' AK 47.

I haven't read a lot of time travel stories of non russian authors, and don't know what trend will be there, if any.

also there are a few fanfictions but all of them that I'm aware of are in alternate worlds.

I enjoyed trailer trash also, it's a nice to have the main character focus on problems that throwing money at doesn't solve.

Paramedic one is okish, although dropped it somewhere in the middle after he decided that he found his one and only love of his life, story became too sugar sweet to my taste.

Feel free to share fanfictions, i'm not too picky.

P.S. wouldn't describe paramedic as 'somewhat smutty', some chapters are up to 50% pure smut, not that i mind it :)

Time Braid:  excellent naruto fan fiction with some smut, it's highly recommended by people not bothered by the sometimes non consensual adult content.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid]]

From the Chinese web novels there is reverend insanity for those who don't mind a psychopath main character. This has really clever use of time travel mechanics and hundreds of thousands of words though it will never be finished due to the Chinese government.

And of course there is Mother of Learning one of my favorite fictions in any genre.  But chances are that everyone has read it by now, if they are interested.

****** it got censored for having themes that the government found questionable. I'm not sure exactly which ones but it is following a main character who despises being part of a group or society and that is a main theme of the novel. so it got to around 2600 chapters and then put on indefinite hiatus until approved by the government. the author has started a new very different novel that looks promising but im waiting until it is further along before diving into it

She shortly finds out that she has a /save point/ - a moment in space-time that she goes back to every time she dies. Also, there's an army of changelings invading, and she's going to stop them if it kills her.

Which it is going to do.

This is basically at the core of one recent Shonen Jump manga, "Time Paradox Ghostwriter". Sadly it wasn't very popular and got cut short, which in my opinion was a pity, since I actually liked it. But it still got wrapped up with a conclusive ending, at least. You might want to check it out, it's a short read.

** It's not what I would call a rational fiction, but I really liked The Time Traveler's Wife. It a romance, in traditional sense, but maybe more impressive was the way it all hung together and the way it unfolded, considering the concept was a single non-branching timeliness that was unchangeable. The main character had a unusual genetic mutation that would randomly send him to points in the past or the future without his control, often to points of significance to him. He was trying as best he could to live as close to a normal life as possible despite that. He met his younger and older self several times, and met his wife in all different parts of her timeline; she met him long before he met her.

** Doesn't hit most of that criteria, and is a fantasy setting, and the updates started slowing down, and now it hasn't been updated in over a year, but [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] is about an engineer MC thrown into a medieval fantasy land where he begins to uplift technology with steel production and standardizing measurements. But then magic is involved and he tries to objectify its rules and implement them into engineering as well. Big Bad is zombies who begin to counter eradication by somehow hive-minding.

A slightly side character with his side story is thrown into a different part of the world and takes the Become the Hero path, attempting to end slavery and other barbarisms. The two become aware of each other being from Earth, and begin communicating through letters.

The writing starts off pretty clunky but the uplift implementation was enjoyable for me, but like I said before, it's been dead for over a year now, right as things were really ramping up. At least as far as I know. I'll look into the author and see if he has another site he uses to discuss his works.
