Not clear as to who 'he' refers to in both cases. I'm about 80% sure it's Blue, but perhaps this could be rephrased slightly.

Did you mean viral? mtDNA is theorized to have a bacterial origin. However, it's retroviruses that integrate their DNA into the host genome, which may end up getting stuck there. Other than that, prokaryote vs eukaryotes actually don't share much similarities in their cellular machinery, for example [[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/rna-transcription-by-rna-polymerase-prokaryotes-vs-961]]

I was referring to the research mentioned in [[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/36108/title/Bacterial-DNA-in-Human-Genomes/][these]] [[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/03/humans-may-harbor-more-100-genes-other-organisms][articles]]. Viruses apply too, but apparently so do bacteria. Has this research been debunked since?

**** First off, thank you for the article, that was a fascinating read. I've taken a look at it myself, and I'd like to point out this blurb from it:

#+begin_quote
  Rather than looking for bacterial genes that had become permanent parts of the human genome, Dunning Hotopp's team searched for traces of microbial DNA in somatic cells---the cells of the body that do not form gametes.
#+end_quote

In this chapter, you pointed out the presence of bacterial DNA in the genome as an evolutionary artifact. In the article linked, they describe how different somatic cells (ex stomach) contain more species-specific bacterial sequences than others. If this were present as an evolutionary artifact, the bacterial sequences would be present throughout all somatic cells and the gametes.

***** Ahh, I see the distinction. The second article says there has been gene transfer between organisms throughout history, which I took to mean that it was there as the result of common ancestors, since I'm not sure how else arachnid or fungal DNA would show up in our genome. If that's the case, do we not yet have evidence in the genome of having evolved from ever simpler organisms along with other mammals, down to shared types of bacteria?

****** Two articles. Oh. Each word was a link. Oh.

Okay so first one's in 2013, second's 2015. Let's take a look.

Alright, so, this blurb:

#+begin_quote
  The paper doesn't give any hints as to how the genes---which now play established roles in metabolism, immune responses, and basic biochemistry---may have been transferred or the exact timeline of the jumps, he says. That will take more work.
#+end_quote

Fungal DNA is pretty straightforward, actually, we do get quite a bit of fungal infections so I don't find that completely out of the question for a horizontal gene transfer. Arachnid? More likely to be an artifact.

So what I think needs to be clarified here is the idea of conservation in the genome. A highly conserved gene is a gene that does its function so well, or has such an important function, that even changing it a little will result in a serious hit to fitness. In short, 'it ain't broke, don't even think about tweaking it'. The concept that this chapter seems to be trying communicate is that the human (and Pokemon) genome somehow has highly-conserved genes that are shared with bacteria, which point to us having evolved so long ago from bacterial ancestors. I'm making a point to say highly-conserved genes here, because if they weren't, they'd be lost very quickly to evolutionary time. A gene which isn't very important tends to get changed very quickly, much like a tool you use only once a year being lost easily. From my knowledge, eukaryotes don't share a whole lot of genes with prokaryotes. HOWEVER...

This brings me back to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) topic. You may have heard of this before: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis]] In short, it's a theory that mitochondria and plastids in plants were originally bacteria that didn't get successfully digested by our eukaryotic ancestors and instead became permanent tenants in our cells. Mitochondria and plastids share a LOT of similarities with prokaryotes. Additionally, mtDNA is very slow to change and mtDNA analysis is used as a method to differentiate very similar-looking species. Some reading for you here: [[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/organelles/]]

"Do new species of pokemon that get discovered still have the same markers in their genome?" Genome and mtDNA sequencing will tell you a lot about the history of a species. You'd look at the genome sequence first, then mtDNA if the genome is too similar. Here's a paper where they take a look at the mtDNA of sponges to see their evolutionary history: [[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-003-1178-5#/page-1]]

Edit: Ok, I'm good for now.

Another edit: No, I'm not. Here's some research that theorizes that our eukaryotic ancestors actually came from archaea instead! [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/05/06/newly-discovered-missing-link-called-loki-ties-us-to-our-single-celled-ancestors/]]

** Yay, another chapter from my current favourite fanfiction! Thank you very much. (And on my cake-day!)

Though I love listening to the group and their dynamics, I am looking forward to exploring the more overreaching plot. The traditional "journey fic" provides a good plot skeleton, but I can't wait until things get more serious and the characters are tested more extremely. It's nice to see you world build and establish the identities of the characters, but if it keeps going without a more serious plot to supplement it, it runs the risk of becoming boring.

I have a question about your release schedule. Is there any particular reason you chose once-a-month, rather than, say, in batches like HPMOR? Writing-wise, are you far ahead of the release schedule, or are you releasing just about as fast as you write them? Also, is there an email list? I sometimes forget to check at the beginning of every month.

*** I can definitely understand that frustration, as I sometimes feel impatient to get to some of the plot points I have in mind. A lot of what seems like random adventures or unrelated info will become relevant later in the story, and I'm probably not doing a perfect job of striking the right balance between the two. That said, now that a lot of the world building and characters have been established and begun developing, the distance between "important" events should be shorter :)

I write one chapter a month and release everything as I write it, not counting outlines or worldbuilding stuff. I decided against batches like HPMOR because I've found having a deadline really helps me focus on getting writing done rather than endlessly editing, which is a trap I've fallen into in the past.

There's currently no email list, but if you make a fanfiction account you can Follow the story and get email notifications whenever a new chapter goes up. I'm working on my website currently, and when it's up I'll be sure to include things like an email list or RSS feed.

How much research do you do for this fic when it comes to the science bits? Because it is seriously impressive to read that kind of science in a fan fiction about Pokemon, where normally everything just gets explained as 'it's Pokemon, accept it' by other authors.

I spend quite a bit of time researching, which is part of why each chapter takes so long. Sometimes I'll spend hours trying to figure something out, just to have it turn out that it doesn't work how I want or need it to to use in the story. That can be frustrating, but at least I'm always learning :) Glad to see it's appreciated!
