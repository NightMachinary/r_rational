A self-insert fanfiction is a story where a character or "self-insert" is inputted into a fictional setting of a preestablished fictional universe for which the character has omniscient knowledge of. Using their knowledge of the past, present, and future, the self-insert has to adapt to the fictional setting they were placed in. In self-insert fanfiction the SI is usually placed in the setting by a ROB(Random Omnipotent Being), reincarnated, or my preferred option, inexplicably transmigrated.

Most self-insert fanfiction can be deemed irrational. Self-insert fanfiction has a tendency to delve into wish fulfillment, SI's ignoring glaring canon plots he should not be able to avoid, SI's easily becoming overpowered compared to their fictional protaginists/antagonists, and SI's focusing on romance rather than solving canon problems of the fictional world.

Is there any well-done self-insert fanficton that can be deemed rational? I have found two.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][*With This Ring by Mr Zoat*]] Set in the DC universe, the SI find himself awake at the moon in his pajamas with an orange power ring. He uses his preexisting knowledge of the DC universe to his fullest advantage. 1.1 million words and still ongoing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10531500][*Kaleidoscope*]] Set in the naruto universe, the SI is reincarnated to the infamous Uchiha clan. He knows the culling is coming and he must do everything he takes to survive it. A warning for this one. The first book is very rational and you can stop there if you are not in love with the naruto universe. The sequel is more fluff. Complete.

If anyone has any other suggestions please let me know. I also reccomend Worth the candle but we all know of it and its a very unique case. The MC is basically an SI in his own original universe. It has most of the qualities of a self-insert fanfiction but the reader knows nothing about the fictional universe which makes it so special. It's a mystery for everyone including him.


** Like all rules of writing, I think the rule "Don't write self-insert fiction" is subject to the following caveats:

- Any rule can be broken, if the writer is good enough.
- Unless you can articulate the reason why the rule shouldn't be broken, why your story doesn't run afoul of that reason, and why your story /needs/ that rule to be broken, you're probably not good enough.
- The vast majority of writers aren't able to pass that test, and you're likely to be in the vast majority.

That said, some of the best fiction out there is the stuff that breaks the rules. /Someone/ has to be on the leading edge when a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope][cyclic trope]] cycles back, and they're generally lauded for it.

I think HPMOR is a very good self-insert fiction; WtC skates a little too close to wish-fulfillment for my liking; Stephen King's self-inserts are really freaking weird but don't quite break suspension of disbelief, and pretty much every other SI I've read has been written by someone who shouldn't have broken the rule.

**** With this Ring has good and bad points.

The good : it's arguably fairly rational fiction. The author tries to accurately model the crazy mix of magic, schizo tech, and flat out power rings that is the DC verse. Villains who shouldn't be able to harm a guy with a power ring - like the Joker - get arrested like kittens.

The bad is that it's really, really long, and a lot of the content is semi filler. Really it does have regular bits of drama and action, it's nothing as bad as Robert Jordan books, but it still starts to drag.

The final problem is that it's full of comic references and story references and moderately difficult to follow if you haven't read the comics.

I guess YMMV. I agree it's very long, but it's pretty action-packed nevertheless. Probably something to do with the speed of updates; there are chapters that would feel like a let-down if they were a month apart, but with them arriving every day, it can get away with being long.

And he can't always help everyone, [[#s][eg]]. If anything, the unrealism is not so much in the main character pointing out reasonable things, but rather the frequency with which other characters actually take good advice. Though that's still /far/ from always.

I'll probably get around to WTR eventually, but "1.1 million words and still ongoing" is not a project that I want to undertake at the moment.

** Even the best SI tends towards wish-fulfillment. This can be okay... I I just need to moderate my expectations and be prepared to drop it if it drags on or loses too much tension by making the main character OP. With this Ring was/is right at the threshold of what I consider worth reading... if the main character was just a little bit more successful or if other characters were just a little bit less willing to call them out when they act crazy I would have probably dropped it. Worth the Candle avoids a lot of problems and intentionally deconstructs a few others... I think the fact that the author is writing a younger version of themselves helps them avoid some of the sleezier wish fulfillment.

In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/in-my-time-of-troubles-dnd-si-sorta.426130/][My Time of Troubles]] it is a DnD (Forgotten Realms) reincarnation SI. Main character is an Orc cleric/priest and goes about trying to improve Orc civilization. It has the semi-continuation/sequel (original still in progress) Young Justice SI The Dark Shard: Enemy of The Light, where the MC is again reincarnated this time in the DC universe. They go about trying to better organized the governments capacity to deal with magic. Very long. Rational/rationalist to a reasonable extent.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon][Walk on The Moon]] is a Naruto reincarnation SI in which the MC goes about trying to accumulate the raw power to escape Ninja life... making them self miserable and isolated in the process. Plots dragged on some but the character development is solid. Rationalist in an edgy kind of way.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10796824/1/Dragonfly][Dragonfly]] Naruto reincarnation SI. The SI doesn't have what it takes to relentlessly seek after power, so instead they make the best of things in their own way. A short and sweet story. Kind of the opposite of Walk on The Moon. Maybe anti-rationalist by what most people expect from the genre, but rational in its realism.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dreaming-of-worm-complete.440227/][Dreaming of Worm]] features a case 53 SI. There ability to influence canon is limited by their semi-lucid state, but they try. Short and Sweet.

*** I'll second a recommendation for Walk on the Moon, though I think many would object to it being called rational. The most generous interpretation of the main character is that she has some significant character flaws and biases that make her life far more difficult than necessary. A less generous interpretation is that she's non compos mentis and would be diagnosed with something pretty major in the DSMV (I'm not quite sure what).

Others may draw a different line, but I would nonetheless call it rational. Despite being nuttier than a fruitcake, the main character intelligently uses her resources in a systematic manner to achieve her goals. In some ways, it serves as a deconstruction of SI fiction, as, perhaps, it is not only plausible, but likely, that a person would not be entirely sane when entered into such a situation with such knowledge.

** I have great distaste for ROBs. Hate them on general principle. It nullifies, any stake or value or meaning to a story to have a ROB just set it up for you.

I prefer reincarnates when alternatives are not possible.

That said I also feel like a story can probably be better served with a none-omniscient characters. And most of the time I find self insert fiction to be a kind of authorial crutch.

An author writes themselves because it's easy to ask "what would I do in this situation?" Which is essentially a step of simplification down from asking "what would X character do in this situation?"

Personal preference, it's not something that is impossible to overcome or do well. But I feel like the successes are more in spite of self-insert fanfiction rather then because of it.

That said I'd argue that Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality reads a lot like Eliezer wrote a amnesiac self insert into Harry.

Also although it's not Rationalist it's useful to remember that Dante's Inferno and Paradisio was effectively Bible Self-insert fanfiction. So it's not strictly speaking a guarantee something is going to be bad either.

Personally I don't hate them, I just think that they're an uninteresting setup. In my opinion, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/corrupted-data-files-star-trek-si.510418/][Corrupted Data Files]], a third-person comedy fic where the SI took Data's place, did it right by not addressing how or why the SI came to be where he was. And besides, if you're reading a story on the Spacebattles forum, you already know the deal.

Following that logic, I can't think of any SI fanfics that wouldn't be improved by removing the ROB chapter and any references thereto.

*** Funnily enough, EY's response to the argument that Harry is a self-insert in HPMOR is to consider it a compliment. He feels like /everyone/ in it is a self-insert, to an extent, so people acting like only Harry is instead of everyone means he wrote everyone well. Not trying to debate the point, I just find it interesting

Although that does lead into a larger point: if a writer has to contain everyone and everything they write in their head (which I don't necessarily agree with, but I've seen a lot of people that do), to what extent is a character /not/ a self-insert? For the purposes of this thread's discussion, it's "when the character is intentionally made as a self-insert", which is why I'm saying this as a response to you rather than as a response to the OP

I think in many ways this is more important because it helps give different voices to characters. When you already are writing one character as you its easier to write everyone as you without distinguishing characteristics or contrast.

That said if you want to see how this kind of thing can work spectacularly well inspite of this "rule" go read " the man who folded himself. "

Then the fallout of living in the bloody mist for 11 years despite being exposed to normal earth values for her 20-odd year life beforehand, and she ends up only partially functional, which is nice in an SI.

How do you feel about ROBs when they're dynamic characters who are omnipotent /relative to the protagonist/, but not relative to the setting? Like, say, the Greek gods in any story with multiple Greek gods; or The Architect in /The Matrix/ movies? Basically---someone who has root-level access to the simulation the protagonist resides in, but where the ROB still also resides somewhere and does not have root-level access to their /own/ reality, and where the protagonist may potentially have effects on the ROB's "level" of reality that the ROB can't just magic away?

Because, er, I've been planning on writing a story with characters like that. (Imagine the setting of /Portal/, but with a VR world instead of a bunker. Would the GLaDOS of that setting be acceptable?)

**** It is more in how they setup the framing device and in particular the use of ROB as done in space battles where especially with a self insert they just call it a "Random Omnipotent Being" just... if it's that meaningless and arbitrary of you to have a plot device why are you bothering?

The arbitrary but some how focused on specifically the one being with no context, meaning, goal or instrumental reason behind it? that is what I dislike.

As soon as you start defining a ROB as something other then an arbitrary entity you drop the random from it.

As soon as you make it not actually omnipotent then your dropping that.

So yes I'm fine when it's not literally a ROB I'm just incensed and have to work about four times as hard to even bother reading a story if their 'hook' is "So this thing I don't care about at all and could be literally just some dude writing a story to make the situation sets up me in this situation." It's like not just an self insert, it's a self insert with an double mobius reach around self insert writing the self insert with the self insert acknowledging the bullshit of the self insert and why are you bothering to do this author I don't care if you just wink at me about it like that shut up.

** ROBs ruin any story, even though the idea was to make it easy to get started.

SIs are better being OC SIs (so the main character is still a character) and preferably doesn't know anything about the setting/story. Reincarnation makes things even smoother, but aren't 100% necessary.

Orange Lantern is better because he doesn't know the precise setting and plot, but essentially has magic knowledge that's indifferentiable from a lantern database, and so becomes a mere universe transmigrant.

Kaleidoscope was okay because it only focused one particular plot point (instead of no knowledge), but wasn't terrible because he didn't know the whole plot and anything about Itachi.

There's another Naruto fic I liked a lot because the SI knew nothing about Naruto at all (it didn't exist, he's a ressurected soul in a baby). If you try to search for it, he's raised by the Sannin and acts like a senpai for Minato. It's a few hundred thousand words. I can't remember its name.

ROBs suck because an omnipotent power makes everything seem kinda pointless and life untrustworthy. It makes a goal of going back or being normal pointless (common goals, although plot forces the mc to not do that). Zelretch as an excuse is similar, but not nearly as bad.

That Naruto fic I mentioned is great because of how well it ties together SIness with the story.

Inexplicably transmigrated works, but you need to be careful of everything becoming stupid. It's generally worse knowing about plot here, rather than knowing about it when being reincarnated. The idea is generally to make a new plot and don't follow the old, if you know about the plot in the first place. You want to make the story feel real, and following the plot while knowing it breaks the fourth wall too much. Being in the same setting while knowing how life could be if you weren't there is ok, being explained by multiverse differences.

Essentially, you can't know the same plot while you follow it, because that breaks the fourth wall too much. The plot has to be different and the SI needs to accept that. This rule can be bent if the SI only knows a little bit about the plot/setting/characters. The thing is, the characters shouldn't feel like they're in a story, but living life, as all characters should.

In a way, good SI fics are those that turn it into an isekai/reincarnation fic.

I'd be interested in a good quality counterexample to refine this rule.

*** To date the best ROB stories I've read use the ROB as a possible explanation that is in doubt.

Or it's actually not quite a ROB but is a god and the story is about that sort of disparity.

There is an amazing pony story about celestia pretty much creating everything from scratch gradually ands slowly and the conflict of that story is within her being unsure that anything in the universe matters because it was something she invented for herself "from dust"

** Going a bit meta, commercial fiction has a different sort of payout for me than self-published amateur work.

Commercial Fiction needs to tell a reasonably complete story in 80k-160k words. There needs to be a big climax at 90% of the word-count. And the work needs enough mainstream appeal to cover the costs of marketing and production.

To make a food analogy: Commercial Fiction is like a a high-end Italian restaurant. We expect excellent polish and presentation. The food is comforting and tasty, but the variety is constrained by the form and the need mass-acceptability. The result is something "Well Rounded."

Amateur work is what happens when my foodie friends call me over and say, "Hey! You've got to try this!" I don't expect that their Szechuan-Peppercorn-Infused Brownies will be comforting or well-presented. They might not even be good. But that's not the point.

Instead, experimental work, at it's best, is someone pushing an idea as far as it can go. Often, this involves sacrificing other aspects. The result isn't "well rounded" in the sense that commercial fiction is. But it's often very interesting.

ROBs are a way of hand-waving a premise. That would undercut commercial fiction. But I don't mind them in experimental fiction. They're a way for the author to jump straight to the interesting part of their idea. And, I'd take a ROB over a couple pages of unnecessary setup.

SIs are an experimental technique. The technique isn't great in most stories, which is why commercial fiction doesn't use it. But, "With This Ring" is all about the author using the technique to do something interesting.

I'd argue that Fan Fiction is a shortcut in the same way that ROBs are a short-cut. You can start off with an authors note like: "ROB takes level 1 Intelligent Hermione, Harry, Ron and Daphne and drops them on a tall ship. They can't see land. They don't recognize the stars. Magic doesn't work."

This lets us get straight to the interesting idea -- what would a group of teenagers do if they were stranded on a boat in an unknown location -- without the 40k+ words of fluff that commercial fiction would need to tell us that one is courageous, one reads, one whines and another is haughty.

The cost of experimental fiction is that, if the interesting idea falls flat, then you don't have all the other fluff to fall back on. And, since most ideas don't work, there's a lot of terrible fan-fiction. But, amateur works are still one of the few places where I run into really novel ideas.

*** This is a great distinction, restaurant quality vs home experimentation quality.

I'd further add that although amateur work can sometimes be well-rounded and complete, there is always a cost to that. Some people don't have the experience or skill to do a complete work - but still have an interesting and thought-provoking idea to get out there. Some simply don't have the time to write 100K, or have so many different ideas that they'd rather write 10 * 10K. Dismissing work purely because it takes shortcuts would just mean that you don't hear those ideas.

  A self-insert fanfiction is a story where a character or "self-insert" is inputted into a fictional setting of a preestablished fictional universe for which the character has omniscient knowledge of.
#+end_quote

This is kind of a weird definition of a self-insert that seems to be completely different from how I've heard it used everywhere else. A brief google search indicates that I'm not misremembering here. It this definition unique to rationalist circles?

The ordinary definition of a self-insert is when an author inserts themselves into the story. I.e. a character in the story is clearly based on the author of the story. This can range from having a character with a similar personality to the author to having the character literally be the author, including awareness that they are the author. The latter seems to be common in comic books, with characters having discussions with the author character about plot points or other things.

Omniscience has nothing to do with it. Sure a self-insert could be omniscient, but so can any other character. A self-insert could break the 4th wall, but again, so could any other characters. Those are properties that are orthogonal to the concept of a self-insert.

*** Yeah, to me the prototypical example of a self-insert is the SI is a new kid at Hogwarts and Harry and Draco both want her to be their girlfriend, and the SI just blushes a lot, gets straight As, and is the star of the quidditch team, but doesn't actually have any sort of omnipotent knowledge.

I guess the overlap with the Rationalsphere and the whole concept of munchkinry makes the genre-savvy variant more beloved here.

** That's not what "self-insert" means. An SI story is simply one in which the author appears in the story, almost always but not necessarily as the main character. There's nothing wrong with SIs per se; the reason they draw hate is because the SI often ends up being a Mary Sue. As to omniscience...I've read a lot of SI stories and, even in stories where the SI is familiar with the setting, I have literally never read one where the character is omniscient, or even omniscient about the setting.

Some good SI stories:

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]] SI is reincarnated as Shikamaru's OC sister. Sticks a little too close to stations of the canon to be ideal, but it's rational and a lot of fun.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/11402847/1/Roll-the-Dice-on-Fate][Roll the Dice on Fate]], by our own [[/u/Jackercracks]]. The SI is born as a baby, orphaned during the 9-Tails attack, and needs to do everything he can to avoid being inducted as one of Orochimaru's experiments, up to and including becoming Gai's disciple. Derails canon almost immediately.

For the opposite reason, willingness to divert from canon, I would recommend Roll the Dice on Fate, as the main character works effectively to derail canon even as a child.

It's also why I stopped reading. There are so many things the MC could have tried, but they just turtle up and train? That seems insane. As in, literally not right in the head. I could not understand how his plan was supposed to work, and indeed it did not work at all. I stopped reading after everything happened just as predicted and he was "killed" with the rest of the clan. His plan did not have any noticeable impact at all.

  I also recommend Worth the candle but we all know of it and its a very unique case. The MC is basically an SI in his own original universe. It has most of the qualities of a self-insert fanfiction but the reader knows nothing about the fictional universe which makes it so special. It's a mystery for everyone including him.

WtC has some problems for me and some of them take root in it being a direct self insert. It also is a wish fulfillment to an extent, rather slow and earned one, but still. Not even counting the literal ROB in it. There is a lot to discuss about WtC and i already posted a lot of my problems with it in respective thread. Instead i want to talk about the description you gave to the "self insert" stories and their tropes.

#+begin_quote
  Using his knowledge of the past, present, and future, the self-insert has to adapt to the fictional setting he was placed in. In self-insert fanfiction the SI is usually placed in the setting by a ROB(Random Omnipotent Being), reincarnated, or my preferred option, inexplicably transmigrated.

  Self-insert fanfiction has a tendency to delve into wish fulfillment, SI's ignoring glaring canon plots he should not be able to avoid, SI's easily becoming overpowered compared to their fictional protaginists/antagonists, and SI's focusing on romance rather than solving canon problems of the fictional world.

Your explanation of self insert fits almost perfectly to any Isekay\transferred to another world fiction, even some of the trapped in the MMO ones. I think the problem is the writing style and what authors want to achieve\tell with their story, not exactly the self insert itself.

With this ring pulls off the self insert trope so well because the DC universe is so expansive. Every character you are introduced to has its own back story already established due to years of world building the author does not have to get into.
