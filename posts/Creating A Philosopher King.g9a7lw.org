Due to current events, I've recently been entertaining the idea of a 'Leader Caste' which would be best suited for administrative and civil work. From there my mind went off the tracks and wondered if it would be possible to train a human being to be a good leader from birth. Would some form of genetic engineering be required, or would nurture suffice? Exactly how would such a child's life be structured, and what if the experiment were to fail? What lessons would they be taught - what would be considered indispensable to good leadership and what would be window dressing? How would you do it?

I've only read of one work which had a similar premise: Rex Electi by W.P. Kimball. In this work the Roman Empire never fell, and to prevent horrific succession crises and even more horrid rulers dozens of children (all genetically children of the current ruler) are raised by noble families and introduced to various adversities to see if they have what it takes to be the new Emperor or Empress. It's alright, though the editing from what I recall leaves something to be desired. Your thoughts? Is there anything you've read that has a similar premise? Please let me know if this should instead be posted elsewhere.

That seems like just a bad idea on its face. Human history (since agriculture, anyway) has been the story of groups getting power and then using that power to benefit themselves over other groups, often inventing reasons why they deserve those advantages. Democracy, as it has been said, may be a horrible system of government, but it's better than anything else we've tried because it's designed to be resistant to that particular flaw.

I think nurture would be sufficient. There's nothing specifically genetic about effective leadership. That said, there are several obvious choices to make if you're going to make genetic changes for the sake of leadership - making the person physically attractive always helps, and removing some of the natural illogical biases would definitely be a good idea.

As for what you'd want to learn, critical thinking would be number one, paying special attention to what kinds of logical fallacies the human mind are easily led into (both to avoid them yourself and to exploit/protect against in your followers), followed by public speaking, and building a vocabulary of languages and cultures to encompass everyone you're going to be leading. They should learn enough to be a jack of all trades in all of the major aspects of the economy, to know how they support and interact with each other.

And have them travel between all of the various cultures of the world and interact with people, families, and villages from each of them, to recognize that they are people exactly the same as they are.

If you were actually to try this (again, I think shutting entire classes of people out from power is a bad idea, both historically and ethically), the best way to do it would be scientifically. Make a list of all of the aspects you want in a leader, and try different approaches to raising children until you have one that yields the best results.

I remember a short story set in a prison, where everyone in that prison had been raised into a caste, including an administrative/leadership caste, and they try to plot an escape; I don't remember the name of the story or the author.

#+end_quote

If you're suggesting that genetics do not play any role in leadership, this is not true. There is definitely a genetic correlation to intelligence as we've found in studies of genetically-identical twins who were raised by different families. There is also a [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Bratko/publication/23302097_A_Behavioral_Genetic_Study_of_Trait_Emotional_Intelligence/links/00b7d517fa7861daf8000000/A-Behavioral-Genetic-Study-of-Trait-Emotional-Intelligence.pdf][genetic component to emotional intelligence]] which has shown fairly strong correlations with things like assertiveness (0.74), adaptability (0.73), social awareness (0.80), impulsiveness (0.76), etc. High intelligence and emotional intelligence are both definitely contributors to effective leadership, so the impact of genetic correlations with those traits has to be taken into consideration.

Of course, as you've said, beauty will play a role in leadership as well. For example, people tend to correlate [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4020344/][beauty with trustworthiness]] which would obviously improve leadership effectiveness, even if there no difference in real leadership ability.

Of course, to tie this back into the original topic, if we can fiddle with genes to improve IQ, EQ, and beauty, there's no reason to limit this to a leadership caste. An entire world of smart, emotionally-intelligent and beautiful people is probably better for everyone than a world where only a small leadership caste is like that.

No, that's not what I meant at all.

What I mean is that the aspects of leadership that relate to "nurture" are so much more important than they completely overwhelm the "nature" aspects. A "natural-born leader" without leadership training will probably be completely outperformed by someone who is less genetically suited, but has been properly trained for the role.

#+end_quote

That's another one of those ideas that seem good on the surface, but become problematic the more you think about them.

Let's leave aside beauty entirely, which is difficult to define objectively and universally.

The problem with boosting IQ is that it corresponds to a very specific subset of "intelligence:" mainly math skills, language skills, and abstract thinking. And, fair enough, when people are good at those, they're generally smart in other ways as well. The problem is that the IQ test seems particularly vulnerable to Goodhart's law (when a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric). You'd end up with these people who are good at taking the IQ test, but not at applying intelligence practically.

I'm not as familiar with EQ, but I imagine it would be vulnerable to Goodhart's Law as well.

Tinkering with people's intelligence through genetics seems like a crapshoot: sure, it could go really well, but I can imagine just as many ways it could go really poorly. Cybernetic augmentation (adding processing and memory capacity to brains, but leaving the underlying wetware mostly unaltered) seems like a much better option.

I think it's probably like sports aptitude in this sense, which means the upper limit on leader quality is still genetics limited. As some people just have tremendous natural charisma that can't be really be "faked" (if anyone figured out how for one you'd expect more charismatic politicians).

Your talk of Goodhart's Law in the context of genetic engineering for intelligence rests on some questionable assumptions about genetics which this SSC article goes into: [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/04/myers-race-car-versus-the-general-fitness-factor/]]

Essentially given what we know about genetics, it's entirely possible you could create geniuses by simply giving an embryo the most common allele on every part of their genome. Since mutation load seems to be a really massive factor in both intelligence and other complex polygenetic traits.

#+end_quote

Well, sure. I mean, to use the most obvious example, experience in leadership roles produces a higher quality leader, and the amount of leadership experience a person can gain is genetics-limited. So, just in that one sense (and probably a bunch of others), you can't reach the extreme maximum of "total leadership quality" in a human being without genetic engineering.

However, past a certain extent, with most qualities, there is a diminishing return, past which point the resources you commit to improving the quality aren't worth the cost of continuing that increase. To continue with the same example: past leadership experience improves present leadership quality and future leadership results. However, the difference between zero years' worth of leadership experience and one year's worth is a lot more than the difference between twenty and twenty-one years' worth, despite still being one year's worth of experience in each case.

If we genetically engineered our perfect leader to live ten years longer, would that create a higher ceiling for better leadership from that person? Probably. A /measurably/ higher ceiling? Maybe. A /significantly/ higher ceiling? I doubt it.

Yes, the leadership quality you will be able to achieve with genetic engineering will be higher, and perhaps even measurably higher, than you could without. But I don't think it would be /significantly/ measurably higher. Sports aptitude is physics-limited, so the physical properties of the body are significant. Leadership aptitude is largely two pieces: the ability to make good decisions (and, possibly, to make good decisions /quickly/), and the ability to convince other people to follow your decisions, neither of which has limits in physics that you would need genetic aptitude to overcome.

Again, I'm not saying that there aren't genetic changes that you could make, that would be advantageous to creating a talented leader; I made that point myself in my first post on the topic. However, per the Department of Pulling Numbers out of My Ass, I think that where the typical, untrained person starts with maybe 20% of maximum leadership potential, whereas you could get your perfect leader up to 30% when they're untrained, and the average person would top out at 99.9% of maximum potential, to your perfect leader's 100%.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'm... not sure what questionable assumptions that you're talking about. I'm not saying "Selecting for intelligence will inevitably make us genetically less fit" because that's not what evolutionary fitness is. My point is that "intelligence" is hard to pin down, and selecting for IQ will bias the results towards a /specific/ kind of intelligence.

To use the article's example of the Askenazi Jews:

#+begin_quote
  Several highly mercantile societies independently evolved the same set of genes producing higher IQ. The most notable were the Ashkenazi Jews, who have an average IQ 12-15 points higher than their European neighbors and whose genes show strong signatures of recent selection for intelligence; this most likely occurred during the Middle Ages when they were the mercantile class of Europe, since non-Ashkenazi Jews show no such effect.
#+end_quote

What kind of skills would be useful for a merchant? Math skills and linguistic skills would top the list, in my opinion, followed by salesmanship.

Now, let's go back to my criticism of IQ:

#+begin_quote
  The problem with boosting IQ is that *it corresponds to a very specific subset of "intelligence:" mainly math skills, language skills,* and abstract thinking.
#+end_quote

So, let's say that I take the premise for granted that Ashkenazi Jews were naturally selected to be better merchants than the average European because of centuries spent as Europe's mercantile society, and thus are genetically better at math and language skills. That's *exactly the kind of intelligence I have already stated that I would expect to see reflected on an IQ test.*

Myself, I'm pretty good at language skills and mathematics; I would expect to have a decently high IQ score if I ever had it formally measured. However, I couldn't point out Sudan on a map; I couldn't tell you which countries were involved in the Hundred Years' War, let alone the reason why it was fought; I can't compose music that doesn't sound identical to whatever I was listening to a half-hour before; I can't intuit what gift should be brought over to someone's house when they invite me. I am in possession of a very specific and limited subset of the quality that you might call "intelligence;" it just happens to be the part that lends itself to being measured by the IQ test.

Are the types of intelligence that would allow someone to internalize history and geography, culture and custom, originality and creativity - are those useful in a leader? I would think they /absolutely/ are. And if you select for "intelligence" based solely on the results of an IQ test, they're exactly the kinds of intelligence you /aren't going to get/.

/That's/ what my Goodhat's Law invocation is referring to; not some idea that there would be a malaria/sickle-cell anemia tradeoff, but that changing IQ from a passive measure of "how smart is this person?" to a target of "how smart can we /make/ this person" is a recipe for a hyperfocus on improving only the aspects of intelligence that IQ is good at measuring, which does not include all of the aspects which are useful for leadership.

True, but here obviously the question is more general, as in, can you define some sort of LQ (Leadership Quotient) that is measurable, genetically inheritable, and could reliably make for better leader material? Probably not either, and Goodhat's Law still hangs on the issue (always easier to game a test that actually master anything...), but it wouldn't have the specific problems that IQ has.

That's the thing: it's impossible to game a metric that /actually measures the quality you are trying to optimize/. I mean, yes, you can /cheat/ the metric, but "inputting bad data" isn't what Goodhart's law is trying to describe; that law describes a breakdown in the statistical relationship between the quality being /measured/ and the quality being /optimized for/. If they're the /same quality/, there obviously can't be such a breakdown; there will always be a 100% statistical correlation between a quality and itself.

If you create a metric that actually measures the quality you are trying to instill in your future leaders, the only way to actually boost that metric (short of outright cheating) is by boosting the quality.

Developing such a metric is, of course, easier said than done, because if you get the metric even slightly wrong, it is /absolutely/ vulnerable to Goodhart's law (which is why I'm so adamant that using IQ, as opposed to a metric developed from scratch for this project, is a bad idea). Luckily, we're not actually trying to develop a leadership caste, so actually, scientifically, rigorously constructing a metric to use for LQ isn't something we actually have to do.

My implication was more that no metric will ever actually measure 100% the thing you're trying to optimise, because "being a good leader" isn't a quantifiable thing to begin with. By turning into one or more numbers you're automatically reducing its complexity, mapping it into a smaller state-space and thus losing information.

Yeah, precisely. Though even without wanting to go all eugenic aristocracy... it'd be interesting to go through the process, if only to think around the issue "what makes a good leader?". After all that's a useful question to answer even if you want to design, for example, improvements to the democratic model, rather than replace it with the rule of chosen superhumans. We certainly are in sore need of that, and I think making improvements forward would be a good protection against being pulled backwards. I don't think the place we are in right now is likely to be stable; half the world thinks it's too authoritarian, and the remaining half that it's not authoritarian enough.

I'd argue it's pretty measurable. It can really be broken down into three pieces: a compulsion to take responsibility, the ability to make good decisions, and the ability to persuade people to go along with your decisions.

Now, none of those are /simple/ things to quantify, but I wouldn't say that any of them are unquantifiable.

Although figuring out what makes a good leader would be /somewhat/ useful for a democracy (especially a /representative/ democracy), there's no guarantee that the public won't just throw out whatever criteria you use, dismissing those leaders as "elites," and elect an inexperienced, temperamental, narcissistic sociopath. It seems like it'd be more useful to first determine what makes a good /electorate/, and strive for that.

*********** My take on that is that the electorate is also shaped by the electoral system. Like for example a First Past The Post system encourages two party systems; but two party systems encourage thinking about issues in sets of binary answers, which is horribly reductive and produces polarisation, which degenerates in... the kind of shit we see now in the US. Not saying it's /all/ the electoral system, of course, but the two things are linked in a feedback loop.

No system is perfect and no system can resist the dogged, persistent assault of an electorate hellbent hard enough on self-harm. Because after all democracy isn't about government being good or bad; it's about government being /what the people wants/, and if the people really wants bad government, well, it would be undemocratic to deny it to them. But we can still design the system so that it at leasts forces the electorate to exercise the kind of skills and mental habits that tend to produce more sensible decision-making.

One thing I'm a big support of for example is: more politics even at lower levels of daily life. Too many people never have to grapple with the reality of compromise and the difficulties of managing anything bigger than their own home, and so don't recognise these problems at the higher levels of government, and end up lumping together a honest and well-meaning politician who simply happens to not succeed entirely at maintaining their promises with a grifter who never had any intention to do so in the first place. Having more personal experience of a similar reality on a smaller scale might help people empathise and understand better what's involved in making the sausage, so to speak; and that would make them better judges of politicians. Another thing I'd be in favour is issue-based voting. Don't vote in a President and a whole Parliament that has to do everything. Vote each individual Minister - Economy, Defence, Environment, and so on. If I want less tax but also more environmental protections don't force me to pick between the only options are "left" and "right", let me express myself. And if that means that politicians from different parties will have to get to grips with each other within the same government, good! Let them discuss, let them compromise. That IS politics, that is what represents the actual conflicts within the nation. They'll have less incentives for slinging mud at each other if they know they may have to lay in the same bed. We've been too worried about efficiency in governance and too little about said governance actually doing its job of representing the people, and the result is a major loss of democracy. There's people who are basically /never/ heard because their vote is always drowned out in a different majority. For them, life isn't that different than it would be if they were living under a monarchy; it's just that their "king" is other people.

************ Oh, absolutely. I can't disagree with any of that (I live in a country with a FPTP electoral system that hasn't been reduced to two parties, but it's hard to deny that power mainly flows back-and-forth between the two biggest parties). Figuring out the best qualities for an /electoral system/, or whether we want to include more direct democracy (e.g. deliberative democracy, or liquid democracy) are good questions at any time.

I just think trying to figure out the best model for a /politician/ needs to come /after/ improving the electoral system and the electorate, because if your electorate isn't going to vote for better politicians, the effort spent improving them will be wasted.

************* I guess my point is, the two things go hand in hand. If you can identify the most desirable qualities, you can try to design a system in which those qualities map more closely to what's actually necessary to win.

For example one could argue that the way e.g. an electoral debate is set up may promote one or another style of argumentation. If you let two people shout over each other unchallenged you're more likely to have the loudest jerk come off as "the winner" than if you put them in a situation which promotes a calmer approach to answering, or that forces them to face the facts if they try to falsify them. I think the same could apply to electoral and political systems too. You want to make them straight up /unappealing/ to the sort of entitled narcissists who wish for power for power's sake, or at least able to control and neutralise them. "A single President with nigh unlimited executive power" for example really is /not/ a good way to do that.

************** Yeah, I guess I was thinking about defining a leader with a bit more precision than that, but I see where you're coming from. For instance, how the "party primary" system can provide incentives to run as a more extremist candidate, where an open primary might attract more centrist candidates.

Yes, I suppose I can see how having a broad definition of the leader you want to be electing could help design the electoral system.

It just feels a bit undemocratic to design a governing system with the deliberate intention of shutting out a certain kind of person from being elected, even with the best rationale behind it, and less so to build a system that a system where anyone can, in theory, be elected, and then instilling a preference towards effective leadership within the electorate.

That said, I certainly agree that removing incentives, and adding disincentives, for corrupt behaviour is a necessary part of any project to rebuild democracy. But I see that less acting as an incentive for leader quality, and more as putting limits on the authority that anyone, even a saint, could have. There's a saying that "If people were angels, we wouldn't need government; if governors were angels, we wouldn't need restrictions to hold them accountable." Reversing the latter part of that, if you install proper accountability into an office, you /don't need/ the people you appoint/elect to that office to be angels. You can trust the restrictions of the office, so you don't have to trust the person.

Of course, if the mechanisms holding them accountable become corrupt, then you're right back in the same mess, but I think that applies to the incentive/disincentive motivation as well.

Isn't that what all democratic systems do? It was the original intent of the Electoral College in the US too. Democracy isn't absolute; you need some hard lines that can't just be legally budged even by majority decisions, such as human rights or the democratic form itself. Because the people may be sovereign, but should not be an /absolute/ sovereign; 60% of people can't vote to kill the remaining 40%. There's always a tradeoff between popular will and the rule of law, and this is about that. All decisions about the system will incentivise one or another kind of leader, because the meta-game, so to speak, tends to optimise itself around the rules. Inaction is the same as action - both lead to a biased outcome, just a different one.

All you can do is build defences and trenches. If there is a minority that tries to subvert the system, those might slow them down long enough for the majority to take back control.

The key thing you don't seem to be giving enough credence charisma's has a hugely disproportionate effect on leader quality, and charisma is plausibly as genetic as intelligence. Whether you want to win elections or just build a cult of personality around oneself charisma is possibly the most important trait for leaders that aren't unaccountable (and even dictators are ultimately accountable their countries elite).

The issue with this is the long history of tests designed to measure the kinds of non-standard intelligence you describe end up either failing basic test criterion or mapping onto IQ, with the potential addition of specific personality traits and knowledge. There's no indication there's some special component of intelligence that wasn't being selected for in ashkenazi. Since were that the case you'd expect them to be underrepresented among certain specific groups/professions relative to their intelligence and you'd expect noticeable differences in specific aptitudes between ashkenazi and IQ matched controls.\\
It's also strange that you seem to be dismissing IQ, based on things it isn't reasonable to expect from it. Most of what you describe boils down to knowledge and preference. As for creativity that is just another type of intelligence which many IQ tests already measure in various ways.

So while alleles that are only beneficial when heterozygous, and conditions like torsion dystonia seem like potential traps, they are only issues for specific approaches and shouldn't be hard to counter. After all genes that are harmful when homogenous should have that effect be more obvious in data samples than any small individual impact on G. Plus as mentioned in the article directly engineering heterozygous disease alleles isn't even an issue if those individuals know what that entails.

Ultimately while you could get negative side effects by say selecting for rare alleles associated with intelligence most proposals don't do that, and should produce geniuses who are also extremely healthy and attractive compared to natural geniuses (who are already on average healthier). When positive traits are so heavily correlated and much of the variance comes down to mutation load it just doesn't seem like you just should expect weird negative side effects like you're suggesting.

I disagree. Mostly.

First, I think you're getting things backwards. People don't follow leaders who are charismatic; they attribute charisma to leaders that they follow. The best example of this could be seen in the last two US Presidents. Barack Obama is erudite, with an even temperament, and a kind demeanor; Donald Trump is plainspoken, emotional, and quick on the attack against those he sees as the enemy.

For each of these people, about half of the United States of America's population of 300,000,000 people see one of them as charismatic, and the other as a corrupt, idiotic, hateful leader, worthy of prison if not assassination. There are probably a few exceptions who see neither or both as charismatic, but they are exceptions.

If two people with such completely polar opposite personalities can both be considered "charismatic" by people who agree with them, and "not charismatic" by people who don't, it seems to indicate that charisma is subjective to the observer, and thus is very unlikely to be attributable to genetics.

Again, I concede that physical attractiveness is probably part of "charisma," but, beyond that, if you want me to believe that you could breed charisma into a leader, beyond simple physical attractiveness and emotional intelligence, you'll have to convince me that charisma is something that can be:

- defined exactly, in terms of the person's personality,
- objectively measured in the absence of a crowd of supporters, and
- statistically correlated with something genetic.

As it is, I'm not convinced.

#+begin_quote
  The issue with this is the long history of tests designed to measure the kinds of non-standard intelligence you describe end up either failing basic test criterion or mapping onto IQ, with the potential addition of specific personality traits and knowledge.
#+end_quote

Yes. /Some aspects of intelligence are not easily tested for./ That's a large part of my point.

#+begin_quote
  It's also strange that you seem to be dismissing IQ, based on things it isn't reasonable to expect from it.

No, I'm dismissing IQ as a stand-alone metric for intelligence *because* it isn't reasonable to expect certain things from it.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

YES!

#+begin_quote
  which many IQ tests already measure in various ways.
#+end_quote

NO! Again, I haven't taken a formal IQ test, but I've heard them described, and I don't remember, a storytelling component. Or musical composition. Or artistic ability. Or... really, anything else that would showcase creativity.

The current gold-standard IQ test, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale#WAIS-IV][WAIS-IV]], measures the following:

- Verbal Comprehension
- Perceptual Reasoning
- Working Memory
- Processing Speed

So, language skills (verbal comprehension), logic/math (perceptual reasoning), short-term recall and manipulation, and speed of answering the questions. Where do you see creativity represented /anywhere/ there?

#+begin_quote
  Blah blah blah (the last two paragraphs of your post).
#+end_quote

Stop arguing against a point that I never made, and that I have explicitly said that I'm not making. To quote myself /in the post you're replying to/ (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  That's what my Goodhat's Law invocation is referring to; *not some idea that there would be a malaria/sickle-cell anemia tradeoff,* but that changing IQ from a passive measure of "how smart is this person?" to a target of "how smart can we make this person" is a recipe for a hyperfocus on improving only the aspects of intelligence that IQ is good at measuring, which does not include all of the aspects which are useful for leadership."
#+end_quote

I will clarify it again, since you don't seem to be getting it:

I do not think there will be negative health or intelligence impacts for selection based on IQ.

Once again: *I do not think there will be negative health or intelligence impacts for selection based on IQ.*

For those in the back who are having trouble hearing, like, seemingly, yourself: *I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE NEGATIVE HEALTH OR INTELLIGENCE IMPACTS FOR SELECTION BASED ON IQ.*

What I'm /saying/ is that *you do not get what you don't select for* (or, at least, not at a rate better than random chance). If you believe, as I do, that "intelligence" encompasses more than verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed, then, if you select based on IQ (which measures those four things), you will not get someone who is more intelligent than average in any kinds of intelligence that are /not/ included in one of those four things.

And, if you don't think that there are forms of intelligence that are useful for leadership beyond verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed (or that every form of useful intelligence maps 100%, genetically, to one or more of those four traits), then I'm not going to try to convince you.

You're setting unreasonably high standard for the existence of natural charisma here: The fact people's perception of charisma differs isn't a point against charisma, because it's hard to imagine how things could be any other way. After all perception of intelligence or almost any positive trait is going to be heavily dictated by how much somebody likes that individual. It's also strange that you would demand that charisma be defined in terms of specific personality traits, since if charisma /is/ a trait like intelligence it might correlate with certain personality traits (like intelligence does) but wouldn't be defined based on them. It's important to distinguish what would be the charisma equivalent of "G" from purely the results that charisma produces. Since there are plenty of other factors to charisma linked outcomes like elections: Such as having popular policies and how much people dislike your opposition. With that in mind it would be unreasonable to expect a 1:1 correlation between getting elected and charisma. After all Obama and Reagan had landslide victories whereas Trump lost the popular vote and was running against another very unpopular candidate.

You bring up "exceptions" that even people who don't agree with them could still admit are charismatic, but I think this a larger problem for your model than think. Trying to reduce charisma to just attractiveness, emotional intelligence and training doesn't really work. After all one must remember that increasing charisma is a big market in politics and other areas, however despite the massive effort put into it there's just no training that can reliably turn attractive emotionally intelligent people into somebody like JFK. If charisma wasn't a genetic trait like intelligence or personality the fact incredibly high charisma is both rare and only trainable to a very limited extent would be inexplicable. To put it another way given politicians who have a fair amount of emotional intelligence and attractiveness aren't uncommon, and politicians already pay big bucks on trying to be more charismatic so if charisma is nothing extra /you shouldn't expect to see it be such a limiting factor/.

#+begin_quote
  Yes. Some aspects of intelligence are not easily tested for. That's a large part of my point.
#+end_quote

This seems like a cop out, after all charisma isn't too nebulous for researchers to have developed metrics for. Plus even if you don't trust those metrics (after all they hardly have the same evidentiary basis that IQ has) there are other ways you can go about measuring it observationally. The point of my paragraph about ashkenazi in the previous comment which you seem to have missed, was to point out that if there existed a Goodhart's law effect working like you propose, then that should be detectable. Even if you don't have a direct metric for the parts of intelligence you are concerned about importantly they should still be something you can select for by getting enough data from groups you should expect to possess those traits.\\
Overall though while I think there's solid basis for thinking there is a charisma equivalent to G, I don't think there are likely to be additional major components of intelligence that don't strongly correlate to IQ. Simply based on the track record of alternative intelligence tests which seem to invariably end up either having massive methodological problems or are heavily correlated with IQ.

While I think it would be good to also select for creativity (though that will already happen to varying degree with certain intelligence tests), I'm not actually sure very high creativity is that useful for leaders. Since their job is generally not to come up with new policy ideas and deciding between existing policies isn't that creativity based.

If you want to argue that the definition of "charisma" is so obvious as to not require an exact definition, the best definition for charisma I've seen is its sociological one, which describes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma]["a particular type of leader who uses values-based, symbolic, and emotion-laden leader signaling."]] If you can convince me /that's/ genetic, I'll be impressed. Otherwise, find me a better, /objective/ definition of what charisma is, and how we might recognize it in a person, absent a crowd to be inspired by the person.

Did you somehow miss the entire paragraph addressing that? Of your three demands only the last one makes sense.

My point was that Trump winning the way he did provided much less evidence of his charisma than a landslide election not based on negative partisanship. While I think Trump isn't that charismatic by presidential standards (that's just obvious from his approval ratings), I absolutely still think he's charismatic. After all you need a fair amount of charisma to attract a massive cult of personality around yourself and his track record before office speaks to his charisma as well, even if it was being used to con people.

I was pointing out that if it were true they were being selected for the parts of intelligence that comprise IQ then you should within your model expect some noticeable mediocrity elsewhere.

This still misses why Goodhart's Law works. In the wikipedia article /all of the mechanisms actually described are based on people gaming the metric/. If you want to use Goodhart's Law totally differently than all the examples then you actually need to know what the mechanism would be. If people can't game IQ tests and IQ correlates to other areas of intelligence it doesn't directly test, then how /exactly/ would this correlation disappear as a consequence of selecting for IQ?

As for your second reply, everything you talk about is common knowledge among those who work with IQ (the increase in average IQ over time is called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect][Flynn Effect]]). It seems as though you are objecting to IQ as it's misused by laymen: The test is normalized to a bell curve because that makes it the best at distinguishing relative performance for most of the population (those in the bulge). Intelligence may not in absolute terms be distributed normally (like a lot of polygenic traits it's probably a skewed bell curve), but trying to construct an absolute intelligence test is a fool's errand.

The test doesn't measure intelligence in absolute terms /and this isn't a bad thing/, because the test still has impressive predictive power and works for the purposes scientists need it to.

Interestingly, that link describes charisma as "more as a set of skills, rather than traits." I reject the idea that a skill is genetic. Either a propensity or a talent for a specific skill might be genetic, but skills are, by definition, both learned and teachable.

That one link you've provided has basically wrapped up my /entire argument/ that charisma is more acquired than genetic for me, so, thanks for that.

#+begin_quote
  you can't escape the inability to feasibly measure charisma without social interaction
#+end_quote

Sure you can. If charisma is something intrinsic to a person, it should be measurable by, say, studying them giving a performance in an empty theatre. If you can't measure it without an audience, then you're implicitly conceding that charisma exists /in/ the mind of the audience, and not in the speaker.

#+begin_quote
  I absolutely still think he's charismatic.
#+end_quote

Let's go back to that link you gave, and run down the list of components of charisma.

#+begin_quote
  Emotional Expressiveness - this is the ability to accurately and spontaneously convey emotional messages through nonverbal channels.
#+end_quote

Okay, I'll grant Trump the ability to convey emotion. Pass.

#+begin_quote
  Emotional Sensitivity is ability to read and accurately "decode" others' emotions and read nonverbal cues (of attitudes, dominance, etc).
#+end_quote

Here's a quote of someone who had been involved in a conversation with Trump:

#+begin_quote
  Now, at a fair table with four people, each person is entitled to 25 percent of the conversation, right? I'd say Melania got about 0.1 percent, maybe. I got about 1 percent. And the governor, Jesse, he got about 3 percent. Trump took the rest. It got so bad I had to go outside and burn one before returning to the monologue monopoly. Listen, I came up through Hollywood, so I've seen narcissists. This guy was beyond. It blew my mind.
#+end_quote

Ability to read social cues? Fail.

#+begin_quote
  Emotional Control is both the ability to regulate and control your emotional communication/expressions, but also the ability to hide felt emotions, or mask them with a different emotion
#+end_quote

This is the guy who sends out 1:00 a.m. Tweetstorms because he sees an insulting ad on TV. Fail.

#+begin_quote
  Social Expressiveness - think of "Extraversion" and being able to "work a room" or speak spontaneously and fluidly on just about any topic. Charismatic people are verbally fluent and articulate.
#+end_quote

HAHAHAHA Fail.

#+begin_quote
  Social Sensitivity is being able to read the characteristics and "demands" of the social situation in order to behave appropriately. Charismatic people are in tune, both with others' emotions (ES above), but also with the social climate.
#+end_quote

This is the guy who was laughed at by the United Nations, for claiming that he had accomplished more than almost any administration, and then said that he "didn't expect it." Fail.

#+begin_quote
  Social Control is self-confidence in social situations that develops because the individual has sophisticated and well-developed role playing skills.
#+end_quote

You know what? Pass. The last thing I'd claim Donald Trump to be is "not self-confident."

So, of the six metrics on which the link you provided would measure charisma, Trump massively, /brutally/ fails at four of them. Objectively, measuring qualities and skills that pertain to /him/, he isn't charismatic.

And yet he has a cult of personality. This is a strong indicator, to me, at least, that the charisma /needed/ to lead a cult of personality is something /attributed/ by the followers, not something /possessed/ by the leader.

#+begin_quote
  I was pointing out that if it were true they were being selected for the parts of intelligence that comprise IQ
#+end_quote

First, as the first sentence of the paragraph you've quoted should have made clear, I /don't/ take that for granted, and, as my other post should have made even clearer, I don't trust IQ as a reliable indicator of all that much (certainly not of anything genetic).

We're into the weeds of hypotheticals at this point, so I'm just going to drop this thread.

#+begin_quote
  I was very specifically talking about charisma.
#+end_quote

No, you were /very specifically/ talking about how creativity wasn't useful for /decision making capability/ (which was clear when I quoted you). Being able to /convey the reasons why you are making a decision/ (which requires a measure of creativity if you don't want to sound like an algorithm) is a useful skill for a leader.

#+begin_quote
  As for those parts of the test current AI could do well on, that doesn't say much because the questions were picked for their predictive power among humans. The fact that say reaction time has some ability to predict performance on other intelligence tests in humans doesn't mean it requires intelligence.
#+end_quote

Yes! YES! This, exactly! /This/ is what I'm trying to say.

You are trying to use a metric that has been found to be useful in humans to /create something transhuman/. The thing that you're trying to create /isn't subject to the same statistics as a typical human/, because /you've been tinkering with the mechanisms responsible for those statistics/.

Whatever it is you're creating, while perhaps not a full speciation (i.e. it might still be able to interbreed with stock humans), will be a statistical outlier, in probably more things than just intelligence, therefore /the metrics that are predictive in normal humans won't work as well/.

#+begin_quote
  In the wikipedia article all of the mechanisms actually described are based on people gaming the metric.
#+end_quote

There's only one mechanism actually described in that article (targeting number of cars sold instead of profit, leading to a drop-off in profit).

Regardless, that example should be enough to illustrate my point: those car salespeople aren't trying to "game a system;" they're trying to /meet a target/. They aren't /trying/ to make less profit for their company; on the contrary, they probably have other incentives (e.g. a commission) to sell at the highest price that they can. However, because their primary target is the number of cars sold, they aim to sell more cars, which leads to them lowering prices, which destroys the statistical correlation between "cars sold" and "profit."

If you call "trying to meet the target given" "gaming the metric," then sure, call it "gaming." But that car dealership is directly analogous to what I'm trying to say here. If you make a higher IQ the target, with the goal of having a higher level of intelligence useful to leadership, then all you're guaranteed to get is a higher IQ; you might not /get/ someone who can intelligently perform the kinds of tasks that leadership entails. Instead, you should create /new tests/ that *directly measure the thing you want to maximize*. That's what I've been trying to say all along.

#+begin_quote
  The test is normalized to a bell curve because that makes it the best at distinguishing relative performance for most of the population (those in the bulge).
#+end_quote

Which makes it /far less useful/ when trying to /engineer a statistical outlier./

#+begin_quote
  trying to construct an absolute intelligence test is a fool's errand.
#+end_quote

Perhaps. But trying to construct a test, much more hands-on than the very abstract, theoretical IQ test, that measures /leadership intelligence/ should be a lot easier.

My point is, once again, that /you don't get what you don't target/. I'm not going to get back into whether IQ usefully measures /any/ quality, but, at the very least, IQ doesn't measure intelligence /as it pertains to leadership ability./ So, if you're going to engineer a leadership caste (and, since it's been a while since I've said this, I think you /absolutely shouldn't/, that's a *horrible idea,* /DON'T DO THAT/), you should, as your target for intelligence, be using a more /practical metric for the kind of intelligence you want to optimize for./

********** I am now going to go into a rant about why "IQ" is garbage, beyond its narrow definition of "intelligence." Let's start with some statistical theory.

There's a phenomenon in statistics called the "central limit theorem." The basic idea is that if you take a lot of random samples of a particular data point (let's say, the height of a person), in such a way that one data point doesn't affect another data point, you'll end up with a normal (or Gaussian) distribution. So, your height data will probably show that the mean height is very close the the median height, that most people are close to being the mean height, and that the further you go from the mean height, the fewer data points you'll find.

Normal distributions are very useful in statistics. For example, there was a poll done last year, that I think was right before the November US State elections. A pollster released one poll that was way out of tune with every other poll they'd done, they said, "Whoops," re-did the poll, and it came up as normal. But the first, outlier poll is exactly what you'd expect: every once in a while, you're going to get a statistical sample from that outlying region that is going to be much different than the others. That's just how statistics works. The outlying poll was a good sign that they were properly getting random samples, because any large-enough set of random samples should have outlying data.

Why is any of this important to the IQ test? Because the IQ test is cheating.

Good, random data, for a large enough sample should follow a normal distribution, and the designers of IQ tests know this. Therefore, they /design/ their tests to have a normal distribution (the mean and median are both 100, and the standard distribution is 15 points).

"But, surely, this is good," you say. "That means that it's measuring something real!" That's... not how statistics works.

If you rolled 10 dice, summed them up, and then repeated that a thousand times, [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10+dice+rolls][the results would follow a normal distribution]], clustered around the mean/median of 35, and tapering off to a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 60, and a standard deviation of about 5.4. That is, about 700 of the 1000 rolls would fall between 29 and 41. That's what you'd expect. It follows a normal distribution.

But let's say you're only rolling one die, 1000 times. That probability distribution [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=role+one+dice][looks different]]. It's not a normal distribution; every number has the same probability of being rolled. But let's say that someone /wanted/ the distribution to look random. Well, they could say, let's create a value called the Dice Quotient (DQ), and say that it is equal to (8 minus the square of (3.5 minus the die roll)). Suddenly, your 3s and 4s are worth 7.75, your 2s and 5s are worth 5.75, and your 1s and 6s are worth 1.25. Instant normal distribution!

"But that's stupid!" you say. "You're not measuring what's really being rolled; you're just changing the numbers to make your results look like they fit a normal distribution!"

That's what the IQ test does. It wasn't able to find a natural normal distribution, indicating an actual random process at work, so it /normalizes/ the process to make it look like it's found something inherent and randomly distributed (like height is).

This, of course, brings us to the second problem with IQ, which is that the scoring for the test needs to be constantly updated. If more than 50% people are scoring more than 100 on a test, that means that the test needs to be re-normalized. If 50% of people score above 100, but more than 19% score more than 115 (or below 85), then the test needs to be renormalized. So far, this has happened to the WISC test [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect][multiple times]], with un-normalized IQ scores rising about 3 points per decade. So, in addition to not representing something random and inherent (but being manipulated to make it look like it does), your IQ score doesn't even represent anything inherent about you, it only has meaning in comparison to the rest of the population.

Which should be obvious: if IQ is related to something genetic, then I wonder what kind of natural selection could possibly have occurred to raise the US national average IQ from 80 to 100 points in 65 years, from 1932 to 1997 (based on the 1997 test). Once again, a score of 85 is mandated by the test creation parameters to be the point that only 19% of the population will fall below, and this is 5 points /below/ that, and half of Americans wouldn't have made that bar in 1932. Was WWII really, really good at disproportionately killing stupid Americans, to the point that almost none of them were left to have grandchildren? No, of course not (and war didn't kill nearly enough Americans in that period to account for the discrepancy anyway).

IQ is just a really, really, stupid, meaningless number. Really, if you took the test in 2003, time travelled to 2014, and took it again, you'd get a lower score, despite having /exactly the same intelligence/. That's how meaningless the number is.

So, if I seem to be dismissive of using it as a metric to create a perfect leader, that's probably a large part of it.

**** I think the problem is more, the way those things interact to make an actual good leader is way too complex to be genetically programmed somehow. You can have someone who's smart and puts that intelligence to evil. You can have someone who's empathic and lets that make him indecisive when he needs to make a hard call for the sake of the needs of the many.

** I think everytime this experiment has been proposed, ever since Plato's Republic, the process and result of a program to breed and train rulers has been a smokescreen for the author's political views. Basically, if you personally want to write on the topic, firstly be aware that there is no rational answer as there is no successful solution in real life. There can only perhaps be a process of rationally educating someone in rationality and superficial leadership traits. However, that must in turn be rooted in the program's implicit support from the rest of the ruling caste for its results.

So educating the ruler is only the last step. The first step is contriving the rest of society to obey such a ruler and contribute the resources required to support them. Equally important is ensuring that society does not revolt, which will probably requiring its utter defanging to ensure the ruler caste's dominance.

In the end, educating a ruler from a ruler caste is unlikely to result in an especially just or desirable ruler. If society is too vibrant, expansive, and rich, the ruling caste will be obsolete due to the fact that as generations pass, inevitably their training will fall out of date, or you leave their training at the mercy of too many uncertain factors. A society where a ruling caste can be a viable solution requires that a static, unevolving or only slowly changing society where the ruler is also materially superior to those whom he governs so that revolution is unthinkable and impossible. Thus, don't train a human to rule humans. Train an AI, or an immortal superbeing.

** Two pence:

Training-to-be-a-leader is something that has already happened in noble or politician families, to various degrees of success. 'The Prince' comes to mind first as a book filled with good insights (and with nice examples!), but I'm sure there must be far more about good obtaining, holding onto, and using power.

I liked the idea of the 'Philosopher King' when first coming across it out of context, and then when learning more about the details and the context became rather disillusioned with it after gaining the impression that it was originally propounded by a philosopher--essentially someone saying "You know the thing that I do, that currently has little association with ability to hold onto or do much with power? We should put people like ME in charge." A bit like a certain Greg Egan book in which a character says "We should let ME mostly shape the Singularity, because I'm a casual science journalist, and so who better?"--bias of viewing one's own field with a better impression than others might view one's field.

** There are a ton of problems with this premise.

1. Creating a caste hierarchy diminishes empathy by its very nature. You could get around this with genetic engineering to increase empathy; however, lots of perfectly good, empathetic people are willing to stop their empathy at some pre-defined boundary. See every genocide ever.
2. Leadership is not some mythical quality that solves all problems. A good instinct for leadership without a functional bureaucracy means an ineffective leader.
3. We already know how to create a bureaucratic caste and it works really well. Examinations to enter, pre-defined performance reviews, universally defined salaries and advancement for self-chosen educational activities, internal accountability review boards, etc. Basically take people, tell them they can work a job for life with fair pay and no worries, as long as they are educated and do a good job.
4. Genetic engineering would help, because it could raise average intelligence from on the current scale 100 to 120. But we already have a ton of people on the normal end of the curve already.
5. Our mechanisms for making functional bureaucracy work astonishingly well by Historical standards. Most Westernized democracies live under some of the most effective least corrupt governments ever by Historical standards.

** I think that you're not thinking meta enough to have any chances of success. No matter how you initially resolve the nature/nurture question, the /main/ problem is how to set up the whole system to prevent its erosion, otherwise it's doomed from the beginning (like irl Rome was).

This is not something we have figured out irl, even though we are really incentivized to. Democracy and regulated free market economy is our best approximation.

So don't think what combination of eugenics and education the 'leader caste' would employ. Think what mechanisms would force feedback to ensure the 'leader caste' has a vested interest in raising well-being of other castes. Then think what mechanisms would prevent the leader caste from dismantling the feedback loop. Basically, think what would happen if the worst possible individual gets to be the Leader, think how the worst possible leader is stopped and replaced. Don't think how to create the best potential leader.

** That system in Rex Electi is, um, literally how Rome worked? Of course membership into the ruling class wasn't random, it was a wealth and lineage based class system. But ultimately the nature of the Roman political elite was roughly similar to that. Children of the elite are given a education and are expected to work their way through the ranks of the political system via success in business, administration, law, war and whatever they could get their mitts in. It worked for a time but didn't exactly prevent the rise of shitty Consuls or the ascension of people like Sulla who were kings in all but name. And eventually it was the power struggles between this learned political class that broke the Republic and help bring about the Empire in the first place.

Even during the Empire it was never solidly feudal style familial succession. Most emperors were already well situated as statesmen or generals before their ascension. Becoming Emperor involved a lot of politicking, a lot of adoptions, a lot of co-Emperors, and a LOT of coups and ascension of Emperors via the popular support of the soldiers, far more so than the title just being passed to an heir. The Roman political class persisted through all of this and, again, didn't exactly prevent shitty Emperors.

Honestly, to get ideas for this subject it'd be just as well to read history. Read what the Romans or Greeks or Persians or whoever thought about statesmanship and their political philosophy. Read about the civil service examinations of Imperial China, that sort of thing.
