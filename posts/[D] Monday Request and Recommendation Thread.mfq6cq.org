Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mao94s/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gsid2tl/][reposting]] in this thread on suggestion from Eliezer)

I'd like recommendations of stuff (not necessarily ratfic) containing metaphysics / nature-of-Reality porn (for the lack of a better term). Things like:

- Erogamer ([[/u/groon_the_walker]], maybe you had inspirations or sth?)
- Eliezer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover]]
- Scott Alexander's blogpost, through it's not really a fic [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/01/the-hour-i-first-believed/][The hour I first believed]]

*** So as I never noticed before, "The hour I first believed" was posted the day after "The Most Meta Chapter" on Erogamer. Probably just a coincidence, but if you believe the fan theory that Erogamer was inspired by FUMMC, and then suppose that Hour I First Believed was at least partially inspired by Erogamer, you could claim that all four of your examples share a single literary continuum! Which, uh...

...yeah, good metaphysics porn is /really rare./ Even good multiverse porn is rare---three examples that come to mind are Chronicles of Amber, The Incomplete Enchanter, and Silverlock. But none of those have the same property /of metaphysics porn/ as the four you named.

Check out Egan's Quarantine and Egan's Diaspora if you haven't already, and Scott's Unsong, but I expect you already have.

Illuminatus Trilogy is not what I'd call /coherent/ but it at least doesn't have a /boringly uniform metaphysics,/ let us say.

*** I'd absolutely recommend qntm's [[https://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], both for its rational-adjacent themes and for its metaphysics. I don't want to say more as the way metaphysics comes into it is in itself a spoiler, but there turns out to be a very good in universe reason for having a structured, programming-adjacent magic system.

I've also heard that Fine Structure by the same author is in this category, but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet.

**** I'd definitely recommend fine structure, having read Ra first. It doesn't really get quite as metaphysical as Ra does, although it gets plenty weird. I'm not sure which of the two I prefer. I also keep forgetting that it was originally meant to be a rational-ish take on superheroes (which is what it says in the back-cover description), but the story goes so far into 'sci-fi epic' territory that once you're reading about people flying around with super-perception, you don't get the 'superhero' vibe at all- compared to most 'rational take on superheroes' stories, where the core thing seems to be the /atmosphere/tone/image/ of superheroes in capes with special names and teams, and everything else in the story has to allow for those to exist. Not so here- it's a story that includes people that can fly fast and punch, and it all feels like sci-fi. Very cool.

**** I thought about adding Ra (which I read), but decided against it because I thought it's not quite what I meant - solving magic with the solution being "advanced tech is indistinguishable from magic" is very satisfying, but after it happens it's just a hard sci-fi 'mundane' world.

Through now I remembered the details, and the Tanako's world related stuff sorta fits. I've also read Fine Structure, it is good and probably a closer fit than Ra. Like the A-layer being the same / isomorphic to the Universe, information being a physical thing

Some of the qntm's short stories are actually closer to what I meant now that I think about it (...probably; the concept is quite faint/ineffable/hard to pin down); [[https://qntm.org/library][I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library]], [[https://qntm.org/responsibility][I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility]].

*** Don't want to speak for the Walker, but I know from EG that Chronicles of Amber and One for the Morning Glory were influences. I'd personally recommend both, Chronicles is a fast-moving fantasy about a (fratricidal) family with the ability to walk through possible realities, and One for the Morning Glory is a metacommentary on stories that is funny and a bit moving. If you haven't read it, Golden Compass is also a great series with some explorations of reality:

** I finished watching Hikaru no Go last week. It's an anime about a boy who comes across the spirit of an ancient Go master in an old Go board, and agrees reluctantly to let the spirit play games of Go through him, in his dream of playing the "divine move". The story goes in slightly different directions after that, but I don't want to spoil anything, because the growth is really interesting to see.

I think this anime was uncommonly intelligent in theme and progression for something as under-the-radar as it is. My favourite aspect was probably the main character's character arc though - I've seen the same thing in concept in other animes, but it felt slightly more powerful here than in most.

*** The manga goes on past the point where the anime ends, and is paced and looks a lot better, in my opinion.

The anime adaptation is very much an early 2000s long running TV anime, meaning pretty low production values and pacing that bends to the realities of the format rather than what might be artistically for the best. The material is strong enough that it's still worth watching, I think, but for people who might struggle to stomach it the manga is a great option that I would recommend first.

It's always been a favourite of mine, and despite (and maybe in part thanks to) not knowing much about Go beyond the basics, I've found very few pieces of media more engaging and dramatic and satisfying.

** Can someone recommend an isekai in the style of Destiny's Crucible, 1632, GATE 自衛隊 彼の地にて、斯く戦えり, The Salvation War, or arguably HPMOR? That is, a story where humans go to another world (or in the case of HPMOR, a hitherto unknown part of this world) and blind the natives with SCIENCE?

I've recently been reading Deathworlders, and it scratches a similar kind of itch: It is basically an isekai where the entire human race is transported into a sci-fi future.

I would prefer something where either the protagonist needs to bootstrap a tech base, or something with a military theme (and preferably both).

I am also open to recommendations for rational military sci-fi or military fiction in general, where the focus is on decisions, strategy and maybe logistics instead of tactics and action scenes?

** Just yesterday I started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis][Vigor Mortis]] and, hot damn, am I glad I did (and it totally deserves its spot on RR's toplist).

If I had to boil down what I like about this, it's that the author doesn't seem to be afraid to write what she wants to write and embrace it. The escalating levels of insanity are also fantastic.

Even though they're vastly different in, well almost every way, the two closest works I can think of that exemplify this glorious-descent-into-insanity style (and are also totally awesome) are:

- [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]]
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23539/super-science-fast-romance][Super Science and Fast Romance]]

From a more authorial perspective, I'm impressed because doing this is /hard/, especially when you're writing a web-fiction where you get instant feedback. It's all too easy as an author to cave in and abandon or twist your creative vision to follow the hordes of commentators who think they know better, and even worse, when you have a live following, it makes you scared to take the risks you'd have taken before (when you had a smaller or no audience).

This all ties back to something that I've been wavering back and forth on for a while (right now I'm on "no"), namely the old "do your read the comments" question that comes with publishing any sort of online content. On the one hand, the live feedback and praise feels good, but the scorn feels even worse. Even if you have 100 positive comments, one mean one will weigh far heavier on the psyche than all those other ones put together. Also--and sorry for not mincing words here--but most critique/suggestions/recommendations/fixes/hints outside of basic SPAG that authors of webfiction get is complete garbage. Some sites are notorious for this (*cough* spacebattles *cough*) but the RR comments section can also devolve into creative-toxicity quickly.

*** The Last Sovereign got a big discussion here the other week, people talking about how it was surprisingly good and rational and all. It's an RPG maker game instead of traditional erotica, set in a traditonal-ish fantasy erotica world with way more depth then that setting normally gets, but spent so long as purely text-based anyway that the distinction isn't very relevant. You can get a guide to breeze through the content a lot easier if the gameplay itself isn't your thing. I played it a few years back and enjoyed it before taking a break, but I've been meaning to go back to it for ages. I'm always terribly unmotivated to go through half-remembered works again, I don't think there's even half a dozen movies/shows/games/novels I've intentionally revisited unless it was to get a refresher on a work-in-progress to appreciate the coming ending better, and I had like 16 hours playtime my The Last Sovereign savefile years back so that's a lot to get through.

** I'd like to give a recommendation for the anime “Kaguya-Sama: Love is War” which is a high school coming of age slice of life rom-com. The story follows the life of the student council at a prestigious high school and more particularly the relationship between the president Miyuki and Vice President Kaguya. The big twist for the shows premise is that both characters want to trick the other into confessing their feelings which leads to dramatic thriller-esque scheming battles center around romcom tropes.

The first season is available on Hulu.

The first and second season are available on funimation (free w/ ads).

Looking for recommendations for anything that's particularly great or anything that's particularly great popcorn trash. Bonus points for any or all of:

- queerness,
- extremely non-standard theology,
- characters who actually spend time with each other (which doesn't preclude adventure; see The Boneless Mercies)
- characters whose biggest power is being nice to people
- compelling, entertaining, or clever banter

*** I went through all my KU purchases to make this list. Ironically, it made me realize just how shit the catalogue is and I cancelled my subscription(again).

Recommended:

- Ash and Sand Trilogy - just great\\
- Cradle - I've become increasingly down on it since uncrowned, but I'll still read the next one when it comes out in a few days.\\
- The Salvage Crew - I really liked this because I went in blind, so I recommend you do that too. But if you need to know a bit more to get interested: it's a sci fi first contact story\\
- Aching God - fantasy sword and sorcery dungeon crawler\\

Recommended with reservations:

- The Traveler's Gate Trilogy - positive: anime characterization/fight logic/pacing, negative: anime characterization/fight logic/pacing\\
- Daniel Black - based on how he writes women/relationships I suspect the author has never had a conversation with a human female, but the base building and magic muchkinning are just unmatched and make up for it I guess\\
- Small Unit Tactics - the author is very knowledgeable of medieval combat, but the narrative structure is just fucking odious.\\
- Shadeslinger - overlong and too much "marvel banter"(which I fucking detest), but ultimately pretty good for a VRMMO litrpg(which I fucking detest)\\
- Destiny's Crucible - first 4 books are OK besides harem, bad pacing and a bit too fawning of the MC, but after that the author goes through a classic case of "I don't know why people like my books", changes MC and stops writing uplift isekai.\\
- Life Reset - beginning is wack with the lawyers and the time dilation, but I like the base-building\\
- Disgardium - positive: dystopian russian vrmmo litrpg, Negative: dystopian russian vrmmo litrpg(which I fucking detest)

Did not like, but many on sub like:

- Bobiverse - the author is incapable of producing narrative tension without making his MCs carry idiot balls(which I fucking detest)

***** I was being hyperbolic. And I don't mind the erotic novel part, it's that the author seems incapable of portraying genuine intimacy and affection that I dislike.

An example of that is how whenever Daniel does something nice for his wives(which is a very low bar to cross), they will reciprocate with sexual acts, even explicitly saying so out loud: "Thank you so much, you're getting so luck tonight" or "I'm going to give you the best blowjob of your life for that".

Whether the author intends to or not, it comes across as a transactional exchange of sexual favours for "nice" acts, rather than a genuine display of intimacy between loving partners. It's the equivalent of a trophy wife begrudgingly giving a blowjob because he took her shopping. Not a healthy way to think of relationships.

I've read multiple works of this author, that's just how the guy writes relationships. It's unfortunate because he writes magic and base-building in a very satisfying way, but there you go.

*** Unfortunately, you have just described Homestuck. Good luck.

No but seriously, Homestuck meets all that criteria, unless you're particular about spending time with your friends online rather than in person not counting. Or if you exclusively want cleverness in your banter rather than the range that Homestuck has (I mean, Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff is an in-story webcomic created by one of the characters, with worse quality than what an 8 year old who's sole source of media was Adam Sandler movies could produce, but its like that on purpose, because something something satire). It is definitely a slog to get through the early acts though, it took me 3 or 4 attempts to actually start it successfully when I was getting into it about a decade back. There's a fanmade voice-acted read through that's been going under production for yonks now that I've been meaning to give a listen to after someone linked it here a couple months back: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jMzJaztnFs&list=PLHO1rc05qiGtAidSBy_8jsEOlHXR6x4cd&index=2][This Link Here.]]

Edit: Uh maybe Love Crafted by RavensDagger (the guy who's doing Cinnamon Bun and like 5 other works right now or something)? I'm keeping up with their work Dead Tired right now. I also got to 35 chapters into Cinnamon Bun before deciding that while it wasn't bad, it didn't really grab me enough when I have a bunch of other stuff I'm keen to read. Love Crafted was a bit better, its about a fledging magic student accidentally contacting a Lovecraftian Elder/God/Entity/Thing when they were binding a familiar, and the new familiar spends its time trying to understand the world it is currently in, and also be careful to not shatter reality too much since people are using that right now. I stopped 24 chapters in because, iirc, it was one of those times I got caught up in reading something a few hours past when I should have gone to sleep, and it was similar to Cinnamon Bun in that it was pretty solid overall but I have other things I also want to read and I'll just go back to it later (although I do prefer Love Crafter to Cinnamon Bun, and also LC is apparently a finished work according to RoyalRoad).

I don't remember the work being queer, or any of the author's works I've read getting too interested in attraction or romantic relationships particularly. I'd call Lovecraft non-standard theology since its pretty incompatible with standard religious frameworks. Since the stakes aren't particularly dramatic so there is time for spending with one another rather than a hectic rush to avert world-ending disaster constantly (although I think the two works I put on hold to read kinda went a bit too far towards low stakes that it got a bit boring/aimless, but your mileage may vary). Being nice to people is definitely a major aspect of Love Crafted (and the entire motivation of Cinnamon Bun). The banter wasn't really a thing. I don't remember the dialogue standing out, just that its a young student and a horror that primarily exists adjacent to reality, so casual conversation isn't exactly their ballpark. For the record, Cinnamon Bun and Dead Tired do have a bunch of puns and wordplay, so I'll leave judgement on how clever you think puns are up to you, since I'm definitely too much of a glutton for pun-ishment to be fair here.

*** These are webcomics, not prose, but they're free either way:

- [[https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2002-01-21][El Goonish Shive]] is a long-running comic centered around the interactions of a group of high schoolers with access to (secret)transformative magic and technology. Much of the plot is them talking out differences, understanding why they do or don't work as a couple, coming to terms with being queer and what to call themselves. Elliot is the "greatest power is being nice" character you're looking for, or something close. The beginning is rough but it's *rich* in minor details about characters that get explored later.

- [[http://www.leftoversoup.com/first.php][Leftover Soup]] spends a good amount of its time exploring some characters various queer/polyamourous relationships, though it does get heavy at a few points. Multiple times a sitcom-eque shenanigan set up and then defused by actually being mature and talking about it. The rest is mostly communication about interests and goals, and tabletop roleplay.

*** I watched 3 episodes [spoilers for the first 3 episodes ahead] and had problems with it. I am curious if anyone else experienced these same problems. This is in no way trying to make anyone feel bad about their enjoyment of the series, but more me just complaining that this type of stuff takes me out of stories like these: [Hopefully spoiler tag past this point worked]

1. Awakening powers in a world where there have been powers for at least 2 decades (Omni-man has been on earth for at least 17 years, cause that's how old his kid is) does not come with registering or letting people know about it. (Seems crazy to me that a person could just continue going to school with no one knowing they could exactly destroy parts of the school or hurt someone [e.g. see what happened with practicing landing and the garbage bag])

2. The Red Rush (flash-like super hero) doesn't win every single fight they are a part of (unless it includes someone who can move faster than them). Based on what is shown in the 1st episode Red Rush seems to move orders of magnitude faster than Omni-man (he is seen taking away civilians and putting them on a far away street corner much, much faster than Omni-man taking away soldiers who have been flung into the air, also later Red Rush seemingly leaves a picnic to stop a villain and the women he is with only barely notices his absence). Anyone resembling the Flash or a speedster should not lose any fight unless they go against someone who is of the same speed or faster than them, especially when its canon in the show that his perception is always sped up to his "speed" (see episode where he explains this during the picnic). I hate it when any superhero show or something analogous to superhero has a speedster. It almost always blows all of my suspension of disbelief instantly.

3. Darkwing captures 2 people breaking into what is assumedly an important building (based on Darkwing saying he knows what's in the building and who their boss is). He then handcuffs them and leaves them hanging from the handcuffs which are magnetically attached to a metal thingy. Their hands are above their heads and they have no support for their feet. After receiving an emergency beep on his wrist-thingy Darkwing says something along the lines of: "Ill see you gentlemen later, maybe you'll talk then" (not the exact quote but this is the sentiment of what is said).

4. Cecil tells Robot that he is an excellent leader, so excellent that he would like Robot to take on the leadership duties for the premiere super hero group in the world (I believe they are the number 1 super hero group in the world). Robot was previously leading Team Teen (teen team?) which has members of its team in high school. After the scene in which Cecil tells Robot this it cuts to a scene in which one of the members (Eve) of Team Teen returns to the headquarters of Team Teen (they were at the funeral and arrive from the Funeral still in their formal garb). There this person's boyfriend is having sex in the headquarters with another member of Team Teen (kat). Eve's boyfriend lied to Kat saying that Eve and him had split up, this was untrue. While I think this is possible I do not think that this scenario is a scenario that makes sense if the leader of this team, Robot, is one of the best super hero leaders in the world and because of that pedigree is being offered to lead the #1 super hero team in the world. Having sex with a co-worker at your place of business would not be allowed or considered good behavior at a starbucks, let alone for a group of superheroes who are dealing with invading armies or rescuing people from death.

Anyway, its possible some of these things get explained or dealt with in some way that I might find satisfying, but a lot of it just seems to point to a show or comic that doesn't have very good world building.

Again, I'd like to emphasize that if you like this show, that's awesome, and I genuinely hope you continue to do so.

Now that could be true that we just don't know the background here, but its never explained nor is there a throwaway line regarding it.

And even if you take away the "weapon" part, you could argue for flight, as flight paths in every airspace are incredibly relegated. So, that, at least, would 100% require some registration and policy attached.

****** Also, I think in general when people are discussing a story there sometimes is a tendency to say, "Well, if this is true then _____ makes sense." And that is almost always totally correct. But I feel, and people may disagree, when criticising or applauding a story, it doesn't feel correct to point to things that do not exist within the story to legitimize or support things that do exist within the story.

An example: I think someone could say, "Harry Potter sucks as a moral story because the wizards within it can produce water at will (aguamenti) and we never see anyone do that for the homeless or starving or to help crops in impoverished places."

Now to counter that you could say, "Well maybe drinking Aguamenti created water for a long period of time is harmful." And while this could be true, we have no evidence of it in the story, so I would consider this a bad counter.

A counter with evidence in the story would be, "They can't because it might break the Statue of Secrecy." We know in the story that the statue of secrecy exists and it has rules to prevent muggles from knowing about magic.

Regardless of whether you find that initial statement or the counters compelling is besides the point, I just feel like the above statement of "If so, their attitude towards weapons coupled with a photogenic superhero, a competent law firm and a bunch of friendly-minded Supreme Court Justices could easily lead to such a state of affairs." could be completely true and makes perfect sense, but as far as I know, we don't have any evidence in the story that happened.

**** With regards to speedsters, they should only be that overpowered /if/ their speed comes along with things like "being able to throw things at that speed" or "having the physical strength that would be required to actually move at those speeds". If literally all they do is "move fast" through some kind of hand-wavey physics breaking, even if coupled with "perceive fast", and if their power does not grant them the ability to impart momentum to other objects, or to hit with increased strength, then it's much much less OP. We are not given explicit answers as to whether or not Red Rush's power set does or does not include these things, but given that he doesn't use them, it's probably safe to say that he is the "just moves and percieves fast" kind of speedster.

With regards to #3....what is your criticism? That Darkwing is just kind of a shitty person? Ok, yeah I agree. that's probably true. There is nothing unrealistic about that. Look at the kinds of abuses that our /real world law enforcement/ engage in. Now imagine the kinds of abuses that totally outside the system, unregulated "law enforcement" would engage in. Why /wouldn't/ you expect abuses?

With regards to #4, again what's your criticism? There is no indication that this behavior was /allowed/, and if you think that it's unreasonable that teens would do disallowed things behind their boss' back, or if you think that a good leader should 100% be able to control the behavior of a bunch of teens, then it has been too long since you have spent any time with groups of teenagers.

Really, only the very first of your criticisms seems like a mostly valid (from a rational fiction perspective, you are obviously allowed to not like whatever you want) critique. And as the other commenter pointed out, in the US, it's possible (although I agree that complete anonymity would be unlikely even in the US).

Also, given that the governmental organization is /literally monitoring everything going on in the house/, the Government /does/ know who these people are, to the point of being on a first name basis in the hospital /even with an explicitely non-aligned hero family/. These people are not strangers to the government, and they have even clearly had /extensive/ interactions. It seems likely to me that some kind of loose oversight, even when not embedded in some kind of command structure, is heavily implied.

I could see how maybe Red Rush cannot defeat Omni-man, although I think with that type of super speed and the ability to think on the problem for a very long time (relatively) it shouldn't be too hard, but I think it is very hard to say that Omni-man could ever grab Red Rush, based on the speeds we have seen both move at (although the beginning of the fight seems to imply that Red Rush doesn't move 1/100th of the speed that he says he moves or does move in the picnic scene)

Regarding #3 This all depends on how you feel the series is treating Darkwing and the other members of the GDC(sp?). To me, they seemed like they were supposed to be very much good-two-shoes, paragons of good deeds, almost so much so as to be cartoonish (e.g. War Woman's line regarding her company making the world better [this just isn't how publicly traded companies are allowed to operate]). If you buy into that very LAWFUL GOOD look, then that particular scene breaks that pretty hard. But this is, admittedly, fairly subjective on what you think the show is communicating regarding Darkwing and his co-workers. That being said, just because in the real world abuses of law happen does not mean that the superhero in the fictional world is necessarily doing the same or would be doing the same. Ultimately this is a story, so it doesn't have to be the most realistic, but just consistent with its own rules (like in rational fiction, magic isnt realistic, but if the magic system is consistent and things work how they are set up to work, then its rational). And Darkwing, to me, being on the Best and Goodest superhero team in the world but also committing huge abuses of law enforcement doesn't get together to me.

Regarding #4 My assertion is not at all about what is and isn't allowed but the disconnect from being told that a person is one of the best team leaders in the world, and is therefore being promoted and then in the next scene seeing a team that is horrendously broken and doing things that are almost certainly against the rules and would and did definitely lead to problems regarding teamwork, respect, and efficiency. Again, you are comparing these teens to real world teens, which makes sense, but ultimately this is a story, and the narrative of the story in the previous scene was: Robot is one of the best team leaders in the world, so much so, that he is being promoted to lead the best super hero team in the world. That, I think, is very dissonant with the fact that the team he has been leading and presumably teaching just about imploded due to one member really fucking up. If I told you that Person X is the best person in the world at Y and then you turned around and saw Y implode, you might doubt that Person X was really the best person in the world at Y.

Regarding Government I might be mis-remembering or maybe you are but the government doesn't start spying on Omni-man's family until after the Demon Detective entity implies that Omni-man or one of the GDC super hero group was the killer. It is before that that Invincible gains his powers, and while Cecil seems to know about Omni-man's family that is very different than there being some sort of official registration or official acknowledgement of a new Invincible (haha, its the name of the series) Hero with incredible super strength, some amount of additional speed, and regeneration. For me the lack of this seems insane. Like Invincible, who is a minor (17 when he gets his powers) fights an invading military force without, it seems, any official prior training or paperwork being done (this could have happened in the background, but i saw no mention of it). This, for me, beggars my suspension of disbelief hugely. Although, it doesn't have to for you.

Curious about the "heavily implied" part (regarding government oversight). Can you do a follow up on that?

****** For most of the points, we will just have to agree to disagree I guess. They don't seem unreasonable to me, but they do to you, and that's fine.

For the last one, you are correct that htey don't start monitoring until after the second meeting with the demon detective. My point was just that they already know who these people are, they didn't have to find them, they already knew where they lived. What's the point of paperwork? They know their names. They know where they live. They probably /don't/ have a method of enforcing any kind of real control, so they don't try (in order to not completely break the facade of government control), they just try to work together in whatever capacity the heroes allow. The heavy implication was that, as soon as they see Omni-man's wife, they are all immediately on first name basis. They have clearly interacted extensively. It isn't just that the government knows who these folks are, it's they have spoken to each other enough to be relatively informal. This implies (to me at least) some degree of interaction/oversight, as much as is possible for individuals for whom the state no longer has an enforceable monopoly on force. I understand your disbelief that the government would be /ok/ with this state of affairs. It's just not unreasonable to me that the government would have any real /choice/ in the matter. If Omni-man (or any of the top tier heroes) says "no", then what are they going to do? They need heroes to protect the world from threats that the government is incapable of dealing with. They are not capable of directly forcing the cooperation of top tier heroes. So they have set up the greatest degree of cooperation and oversight that the heroes will allow them to have, while not forcing a confrontation that they will inevitably lose, resulting in greater losses of face/legitimacy

******* I think the best way I can convey my disbelief with the situation is to talk about nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of such destructive force that they strip away a lot of possible government intervention *once they are made* therefore there is a lot, a ton of resources dedicated to finding out about the movement of chemicals and materials that make nuclear weapons and there are international bodies that help to relegate.

The issue with force that you bring up doesn't seem to be true because the US military seems to have its own super hero group that operates under their purview. Therefore, your assertion regarding someone saying "no" and there being no recourse doesn't seem to be true.

Also, of all possible entities that exist in our current world the American military is probably the one I would give the best chances of coming up with a way of solving (read: detaining, capturing, neutralizing, killing) super hero threats, especially since it does seem they have had 2 or more decades to work on it.

Also, while officials might be informal with each other or friends that doesn't preclude official documentation. Just because a government employee knows your name and your wife's name doesn't mean their son or daughter doesn't have to get a drivers license (bit of a dis-analogous comparison, but hopefully you understand my point here).

Also, for your point of they already knew where they lived, doesn't that point to there probably being some official documentation? So why isn't there a new step when a power shows up in someone that doesn't have a power? I don't know, again, all subjective, but it really bothers my suspension of disbelief.

Happy to keep going back and forth and trying to find out more, but we might be at a "agree to disagree" point? Regardless, I hope you've found my words to not be aggressive or insulting in any way. I am not trying to belittle any of your points, just point out where I disagree. And I've enjoyed seeing another perspective on this stuff.

*** What's bothering me in this, and every other superhero story really, is how casual the heroes are with their superpowers. The scene where mark and his father throw balls around the earth and the ball almost hit a plane and kill hundreds of peoples is pinnacle of that.

During mark's first cape fight, he throws a guy through a building, and flips over a pedestrian car, then he pats himself on the back for a job well done...No dude, you have just injured or possibly killed innocent bystanders.

** I would like to recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bootstrapping-multi-cross-book-2-now-in-naruto.770733/][Bootstrapping]] a multi cross OC Self Insert where only after 350k words has the MC left the first world, Highschool DxD.

Not really rational, (though it has some rational themes), and I found the beginning a little wonky, but I love it.

The main character is reborn as a normal human in the world of DxD, and decides that the most intelligent thing to do is to fuck off, try not to interact with canon (specially with Issei, being a woman with boobs), learn how to become stronger and how to leave a world of beings that can destroy it with a fart.

Reality doesn't acknowledge her wishes, forcing her to form connections and make friends (the horror), and she learns "World Script" which is kinda like the programming code of the universe and Fuinjutsu from Naruto.

Why do I like it? Many reasons, I like Self inserts, the characters make sense and are internally coherent, the story is interesting and has a subtle charm to it. I dunno.

You can found it on ao3, SV, and QQ if you're allergic to Spacebattles, though it's there where there is more discussion. Just today the prologue from book 2 has been posted, where she appears in the second world, the one of Naruto. Currently "when" is not known.

*** Any story that follows the "Hero's Journey" mold where the protagonist is raised in relative obscurity, by people who may or may not be their "real" family, to go to do incredibly significant things, while a mysterious and wise old man guides them and there is some sort of prophecy in the background? Harry Potter, the Belgariad, Star Wars, etc.

Oh, and The Truman Show probably works for a more focused answer to your question too. And yes, these are all fairly well-known works that most people are familiar with, but for myself I've not actually seen any of the original Star Wars movies, bailed on the Belgariad partway through the first book, and have had a copy of The Truman Show lying around for over a year at this point that I still haven't got around to actually watching. That said wikipedia plot summaries and cultural osmosis have left me aware enough to mention them even if I'm not technically properly familiar with them.

At least prose is functional, which makes it better than almost all of other xianxia on RR. It feels better than average, but hoo boy it also feels like the most overrated webnovel I've ever seen.

Slouching Towards Nirvana (mentioned after the main post, I've gotten up to date on it since then) is Worm/BNHA crossover fic that probably fits the best towards combat-focused. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-heroic-chronicles-of-a-young-man-youjo-senki-my-hero-academia.875316/][The Heroic Chronicles of a Young Man]] I've read since making that post, and it also fits the combat-focused theme, and also munchkining. Its technically a crossover with Youjo Senki (The Saga of Tanya the Evil), but its really just porting over personalities/values rather than memories and abilities, so its somewhere between crossover and homage rather than fullblown crossover. Daymare was mentioned and described in the post I made but is a little awkward to recommend, since while it does have the combat and quirk understanding focus, the story and worldbuilding the author puts together is somewhat average, but their ability to write evocative descriptions is beyond many professional works I've read, so its very much a "your mileage may vary" work.
