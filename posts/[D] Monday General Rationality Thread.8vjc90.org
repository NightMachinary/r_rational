Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** How might a world work if it ran in the opposite direction to our universe - starting from maximal entropy and moving towards order? What would physics look like? Biology? I'm willing to stretch outside of the strictly scientific realm here, so "exactly like our universe, but backward" is not really a useful answer. Using as a base for a fantasy setting.

*** I'm not sure. But have some wild speculation, reversing entropy and nothing else:

In that universe, highly organized matter is stable, low energy. Disorganized, disparate matter is high energy and unstable. Crystals represent matter with useful energy removed. Mixtures like murky water and diffuse, low-pressure gas represent energy sources. Miasma is fuel: sold crystal is waste.

Their universe has dark energy, a mysterious force pulling all matter into denser shapes despite the expansion of the universe.

Everything cold and dead turns to dense, highly-ordered crystalline matter. Miasmas with many components are rich feedstocks. Stars are molten, with gravity providing energy to keep them from crystallizing. Stars try to release light and cool, but as they become more dense and ordered they heat up and don't crystallize. Light from stars can hit crystals and break them apart. Living things can feed on the entropy present in components trying to reassemble.

Anti-crystalline plants focus light to better break apart substrate. The plants have partially crystallized chemicals in them, but live by expending the energy released when their internal miasma becomes more ordered and crystalline. Excess miasma spreads from them.

Animals breathe in the miasma, condense it, and leave droppings of crystal. Alternatively, plants don't exude miasma: animals just eat plants, let the miasma contained in them condense into stable base crystals and then leave droppings of crystal. Filtering waste from food biologically is easy--you get energy while letting your food filter itself in your body. You want to eat the messiest, most disparate plants you can find. A plant that isn't a cloudy mixture is a plant without nutritional value.

It's a strange world.

**** It /is/ strange! That's why I like the idea. Hmm.

*** Philosophically speaking, it should look indistinguishable from a normal entropy-increasing universe from the inside. This is because cognition itself relies on processes that increase entropy. Learning about the environment entangles the mind with its surroundings and increases their mutual information, which correlates to entropy increase (I think; I'm not a physicist). So there must be something else different about your fantasy universe to resolve this philosophical discrepancy. Perhaps the inhabitants increase in entropy while everything else decreases.

**** Physics is not fully time invariant. There are physical processes which we can observe that will show us the direction of time even if time itself reverses. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation][Neutrino Oscillation]] for example is not time invariant.

***** This does not matter to the issue of cognition. The time directions are distinguishable by such oscillations, but there is no objective "forward" dimension: the type of oscillations you associate with "forward" is arbitrary. Wave function collapse also cannot provide a time direction if you assume basically any QM interpretation that is not Copenhagen. Only entropy can provide a sense of time direction, and it is deeply tied to cognition. (Source: Sean Carroll's time lectures on the Great Courses)

****** All true. I was just pointing out that this universe would not look "...indistinguishable from a normal entropy-increasing universe from the inside. " is all.

**** Oh, I totally agree. I'm basically postulating "magic aka different physics" as the handwavey explanation for why it's any different at all, I'm just curious about what the world might look like if some version of magic let us cogitate anyway.

***** The 2nd law is quite mathematically sound, so I think your options are 1) the entropy of conscious beings increases while that of everything else decreases (for some magical reason), 2) mathematics works differently in this universe on a fundamental level that may involve actualized contradictions, 3) something something a very precise magic causes brains to increase mutual information with the environment in a very precise way that technically lowers entropy but still gives the benefits of memories (I'm not even sure this is conceptually possible without falling into option 2, and I cannot fathom what it would look like).
