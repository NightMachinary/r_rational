** Wait. No more "People Whom the Stars Watch" ?

As for my two cents on how to make a rational Avatar-verse, you would have to start at the beginning. The original HP canon makes some modicum of sense, people use magic to communicate, to travel, to build and enchant houses and even make food (house elves count). But every time benders don't use their powers for solving basic problems and situations is a demonstration of irrational behavior.

Lack of rock cars, rock houses and plumbing everywhere in Earth Kingdom, communication towers, and even better roads is failure of rational expectations. Omashu and Ba Sing Se are the two place in all of EK where some of the obvious bending potential is shown, but even then its a small part. And even so how did the Fire Nation plan to take over the EK? Destroying it does't do shit. 2 EK benders can rebuild a town in a day, or even make a deep underground town. Good luck setting it on fire when the enemy can leave whichever way they want. Or defending against attack from the rear.

FN techno advancement makes super sense in this context, but what little technology we see in ATLA is insufficient to deal with overwhelming earthpower of EK, to say nothing of attacking the water tribes while staying in water. Air ships should have been present from the beginning and the sole reason why FN could have killed the entire Air Nomad population.

You could make make a rational LoK story if you go with the idea of benders having too much power in society that depends too much on them. In which case Hiro Sato making technological breakthroughs and working with the Equalist movement is a good idea. This could maybe even works a Good vs Good plot of EQ wanting a better power balance and white lotus working to integrate bending in every faucet of life as a means of making lives of everyone easier and better.

Man I write a lot. Anywho this is all a 5 sec thinking done in terms of rational Avatar, im sure there are lots more things I missed.

Ah yeah I forgot about the rational vs rationalist thing. I'm definitely leaning rationalist. It's a lot easier to just take the Avatar world as given.

The point of razing the earth kingdom was to destroy their /hope/. Because without hope, we have no hope. /begins to tearbend/

What is a rock car?

and yeah how /do/ you attack using a traditional infantry an army that can erect walls in the middle of your formations whenever they want?

**** Bend cylinders, 2 long and thin, these are your wheel carriers. Then bend 4 big short cylinders, these are your wheels, next bend a plate with 2 long holes on side, these are your steering and wheel supports, front hole is wider to make room for steering angles. Put long cylinders in holes, stick short cylinders on ends, secure with small rods where necessary. Push cart, receive cabbages.

Increase design complexity by necessity.

** Or, /In Which writingathing Absolutely Stops Giving a Shit./

Fuck it. Just fuck it.

I don't even care anymore.

I can't fucking do this. I can't fucking make /Legend of Korra/ work. It's not just bad writing. The pieces of the show are fundamentally /broken/. They can't be fitted together in a way that /works/ as a story. You know what should be done with Mako and Bolin's characters?

Me fucking neither. They are fucking useless. Holy shit, you could literally erase Asami from the entire series and nothing would change, and even /her/ character is more relevant to what happens in the show than those two fuckers.

So fuck them. And fuck everything else about the show that just doesn't fucking work. I'm taking Korra's attitude and just not giving a goddamn /shit/ about any of this fucking stupid mess.

Korra's going to punch her way through the hypothesis space, and I'm going to punch my way through this story.

Is it rational? Who really gives a fuck but the answer is yes sort of maybe. Not your typical rational fic with some fuggin nerd who can't stop lecturing people in authority about how dumb they are because he's been in their world for all of ten fucking minutes and has that shit figured out. No, but this is going to be a story about Korra getting a head on her shoulders. She's half-Draco Malfoy (hpmor verson obvs), half-Hermione (ditto), half George of the fucking jungle. but with a bit of inspiration she's gonna bend the friggin moon i fuggin tell you

Air is the element of science. It just is. That shit's as canon as dementors being death is.

Asami's a physics grad student because I want to see her suffer even more than the writers of the show do. And she's being taught by professor Unalaq spoilers lol because fuck it half of season 2 should've been him teaching Korra stuff.

The dominant theory of bending is that the elements work by manipulating the fundamental elements of phlogiston, elan vital, corpuscles and luminous aether. lol korra ain't standing for that shit.

and in general politics! and intrigue! and factions! and good vs good! and not really taiping revolution! and...and...and motorcycles and puppies and kung fu and stuff!

Shit yeah.

so anyway what do you guys think a rational!Korra fic should need? let's get some discussion going here I WILL EAT YOUR IDEAS AND SHIT OUT FANFIC

oh that reminds me i will like totally pander and shit i don't even care you want korra to use ninjutsu she will be shadow cloning the shit out of everything you want her to make out with asami then she'll make out the shit with asami you want kai ground up into slop and fed to pigs then that's happening to that dumb little fucker WHY IS HE EVEN IN THE SHOW JESUS CHRIST WHO WRITES THIS CRAP

oh

oh right

it's the same people who did /Avatar: The Last Airbender./

well...fuck.

*** To save useless characters, give them skills. Korra knows magic. Great.

Give your useless characters knowledge. Physics. Biology. Herbology. Toxicology. Chemistry. Geology. Okay, so you can bend Earth. I'm designing a mining complex. I want you to punch these holes in these orders. You can't affect metal, so we use that as dowsing to find veins and clusters. Okay, so you can bend Air. Suck the nitrogen out of it and stick it in the soil by these plants.

Change the characters, change the world. Your enemy mages should also have science consultants.

**** The problem with Mako and Bolin is that, like Ron, they really don't have a reason to exist. They're not just useless per se, but they don't have a role in the story and by virtue of their personalities and abilities /shouldn't/ have a role in the story. At some point they just become OCs, and ones forced into the story just to conform to a superficial aspect of the show. If I ever need a pair of minor male characters to do something they'll probably be named Mako and Bolin.

***** They're pretty important in canon for the relationship plots and the pro-bending. You could argue Sokka and Katara didn't have a reason to exist either ...

You have to re-write the characters to some extent to make it rational. Mako is a detective. How much does canon harry have in common with hpmor harry? Almost nothing...

*** Cutting out Mako and Bolin is probably the right decision. I'm brainstorming for a Korra fanfic right now centered around Kuvira as the Avatar instead of Korra (Aang died early and the Red Lotus accidentally killed the Water Tribe avatar) and the first thing I knew when considering how the AU would work was that Mako and Bolin would not be characters. They really are fundamentally useless compared to how important the characters of ATLA were to the plot. I am going to use the Beifongs though since at least they had some political value between Lin as the police chief and Su as the leader of Zaofu.
