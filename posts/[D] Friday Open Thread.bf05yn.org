Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** A while ago, I wanted to read a deleted Harry Potter fanfic, specifically a deleted HPMOR fanfic.

It took a while, but I managed to recover [[http://www.mediafire.com/folder/bwx8buculgy2h/Hermione_Granger_and_the_Tesseract_of_Merlin][Hermione Granger and the Tesseract of Merlin (Worm x HPMOR)]]!

I did it by downloading the Harry Potter-specific zip from [[https://archive.org/details/fanfictiondotnet_repack][fanfiction.net-repack]] and finding the single story in it.

For now, I have about 13 gigabytes of Harry Potter fanfiction downloaded to my computer and if there is anyone else who wants to look for a deleted story, I'm willing to look it up and share them if I have it. I'll probably delete them in a week or two. Make sure to include the author with the title if possible as well.

I'm not taking down the story I spent time looking for though. That link's staying up there for as long as possible.

Quests are games where the QM controls the world and npcs, while the forum/players control a single person. Most quests work by having the players work on and vote on a plan together, with the QM replying with how the plan turned out in the form of an in universe story.

** Should I apply to business school next year? Help me identify my cognitive biases and gaps in my thinking.

Background: Will be attending law school next year. Original plan was a dual JD/MBA. Years of work experience in running my startup, tech, and automation.

Long term goals, in order of importance: My personal happiness, financial stability (I never want to be poor again), maximized global utility.

I never intended to practice as a lawyer so the JD-only path was unexpected. I had vague thoughts of legal tech, e.g. automation tools for lawyers and clients to increase availability of legal service for all. Not committed to this path.

After only being accepted to law school, I realized that I could accomplish my legal tech goals without an MBA. I'm not sure how much if that is post-hoc rationalization.

Pros for MBA: Relatively easy re-application. I only need to rewrite a couple essays. Foot is already in the door because I'm in the JD program.

Cons: 1 extra year of my life. 65k tuition. Unsure of marginal utility of JD/MBA vs. only JD.

I'm leaning towards reapplying because the application process itself is quite easy. However, I want to fully think through whether I even need/want an MBA before submitting an app and mentally locking myself in.

*** You need to look at whether a MBA is going to get you anything that your experience of running a business hasn't already gotten you. Degrees are fundamentally about giving you the tools you need to be successful in the realms you want to pursue. If you already possess those tools, then the degree is thousands of dollars that is unnecessarily spent. Seeing as you also don't seem to want any kind of professional certifications either, the degree is only providing tools. Masters programs in general are more for people who want to go super specific down one lane of their expertise, and honestly I think you already have that with JD. What you want to do seems to rely more on the understanding of legal processes, and while an MBA might give you the tools to achieve that faster or to a greater success. It's not gonna give you tools that you can't necessarily gain on your own.

Personally, the Cons seem to be very big long term things, whereas the Pros seem to be very short term benefits. I would personally just stick with doing the JD in your place. But at the same time, if you think the tools an MBA would give is worth more than the costs, go for it.

** This is going to be very damaging for my productivity but does anyone have any paid android games to recommend that don't have ads or IAP? I'd much rather pay $4 for a decent game than get a "free" game that requires me to buy gems to make decent progression or sit through ads in between every two levels. I don't want any of those games that you pay an IAP to remove the ads but there are still other IAP for extra "clue scrolls" or whatever shit, and though I'd love a completely free game I'd also love to support a more "honest" business model.

My recommendations:

- Achikaps, a real time strategy game. The free version has 50 levels and no ads. The paid version has ~150 levels, no ads, and more features

- Mini Metro, a puzzle game. I don't think it has a free version but it's extremely addictive even if there's a bug at the moment that makes some of the achievements almost impossible to get.

(And yes, my phone is rooted and does have an ad blocker)

*** The amazing free Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup has an android port. Rougelike, eg. terrible graphics, permadeath (no save/reloading), high replay value, focus on interesting decisionmaking. Grinding is against the games philosophy, there is for a example a button for autoexplore, autotravel, you have ingame-wide search.

Highly addictive, but great for inducing flow (and rage!)

*** A few excellent boardgames have had Android ports without shitty business models. They are noticeably more expensive upfront, but you pay for quality.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.czechgames.tta&hl=en_GB][/Through the Ages/]], excellent civilization-style optimisation card game. Currently ranked [[https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame?sort=rank&rankobjecttype=subtype&rankobjectid=1&rank=3#3][3rd best boardgame of all time]] on boardgamegeek, and I tend to agree. Very good port

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.czechgames.galaxytrucker][/Galaxy Trucker/]]: a frantic real-time spaceship building phase, followed by an extensive scoring phase where your ship will go on adventures and slowly fall to pieces.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fowers.paperback][/Paperback/]] and/or [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fowers.hardback][/Hardback/]], two solid deck-building word games. /Paperback/ is the simple clean design, while /Hardback/ has more complex boardgame mechanics.

**** I have put Through the Ages on my wishlist - it's expensive but if it's good then I'd love to support it!

And the "related" games that show up on the sidebar give me some more places to poke around.

I've got the old Androdominion deckbuilder (not available anymore, but the apk still is) on my phone which is fun to break out every now and again, so Paperback and Hardback might be perfect for me!

Galaxy Trucker isn't grabbing me. I wish Android had a more lax refund policy because if I had a couple of hours to try it out instead of 15 minutes I'd be willing to take a gamble on it. Still might do it though but again another wishlist one.

It's much more combat-focused, so instead of managing and crafting items, you spent your time on costumizing your characters' stats and tech tree. You can even built instructions for your npcs, the extreme being making a flowchart to fully control the combat. There's not much to do once you've sent your party off to an adventure, though you can check the adventure log to see how they are progressing and follow along.

** Anyone know how difficult it would be to code a solid forum designed specifically for writing? When I do get time to write again, I would like a decent place for it, and I can't find anything I like.

Some features that I would like to see:

- Authors have full control of their threads.
- multiple sub threads for each fiction thread.
- heuristic reading suggestions based on other people who like things you like.
- heuristic moderation so the community can moderate itself.

For instance, if I create a thread for a story, I will have three sub threads. Beta. Release. Edited.

Beta could be password protected. Release would be open to all. Edited could be password protected.

Each subsection would have a full thread devoted to each chapter.

Chapter threads would actually be properly threaded, in the old school News Net style, so multiple unrelated conversations could happen without diluting everything.

I believe that heuristic moderation would end up requiring some sort of user validation.

Perhaps a fee of 1.00 per month to validate accounts, and allow comments and liking/disliking?

Perhaps redistribute those membership fees back to active writers based off of who the paying customers read?

Allow users to donate at will, to individual authors or to the writer's pool as a built in feature?

In essence, I would like a site dedicated to both writing and reading fiction, at multiple stages, with automatic protections to prevent botters and zergs.

I want this enough that I might even consider paying to have it designed.
