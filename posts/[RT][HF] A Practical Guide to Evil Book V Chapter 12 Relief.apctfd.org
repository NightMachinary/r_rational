*** I've thought it was heading that way for a while. Why else would it keep switching to the view of some random Callowan who's a foil for Catherine? I'm not quite sure why Erratic keeps offscreen killing fairly major non-Named, and then gives a relatively unimportant character like Captain a bazillion funerary chapters.

I really hope it doesn't end with Queen Abigail though. Giving tons of power to the military is never a great idea for any civic society.

**** Nauk has, as mentioned elsewhere ITT, ceased to become an important character after his first death. He's no longer a major character in the plot unlike Akua or Black or even newer characters like the Tyrant or the Sisters (and thus semi-invulnerable to sudden death).

I'm not sure what EE was going with this by killing him off a second time, and I understand people are kind of miffed on why. Seems like a dropped plot line. What was the point of his revival?

***** It seems like theres a bunch of characters that are important to the plot but not important to the Plot getting killed off-screen.

Maybe unimportant is the wrong word though. they dont have the kind of Plot weight that Akua/Black/all the other Named have, and so them living or dying happens at the mercy of the Plot momentum swirling around the other characters. My guess is that Cats friends dying off is Below putting their fingers on the scales in order to try and shape Cat to their liking.

** I'm puzzled by the granite / marble / limestone tidbit. Marble and limestone are worse materials to make weather-exposed sculptures out of, because they get dissolved by most acids (including ordinary rain) as they're mostly calcite ; while granite, being mostly quartz, doesn't dissolve. It's harder to carve too. It's usually uglier though, I'll grant you that. I'd expect granite and marble to be comparably rare and expensive to extract ; whereas limestone, which is just sedimentary, is typically the cheaper plentiful kind of rock, being common and very easy to carve.

*** While I don't think Cat is a Mary Sue (you really have to do some definition stretching and be generally uncharitable towards the story to conclude that imo) the loss of Nauk needs to be put in context here. As i see it:

1) Nauk was arguably already dead or at the least was so drastically altered after the Summer Fae so as to make the loss feel less significant.

2) Transport Cat to Aerb and have Joon look into her soul. I guarantee you that Nauk is not among her top 20 values. Cat may care about Nauk but there are numerous people, events and goals that are of far higher importance to her in the story.

3) Nauk's loss is the sort of loss that has little effect in story. Is Cat's behaviour going to be strongly impacted by his death? Do Cat's political goals change? Is Cat's military strategy or value strongly impacted? I would argue not.

When people argue Cat's a Mary Sue because she walks into the Everdark with little to no plan, blunders on in ignorance yet walks out with an army of super people, increased autonomy and more individual power, then the loss of Nauk is...not a slam dunk counter. (To reiterate, I don't think Cat's a Mary Sue).

**** I don't know about more individual power, honestly. We saw what happened when she worked the Night here. It tired her out in a way she didn't mention under Winter. I think she actually has a shallower well and less endurance now, albeit more finesse and no chance of a spiral of principle alienation.

*** I don't really see how her friends dying confirm or deny Cat as a "Mary Sue".

It's to my understanding that a Mary Sue is someone who gets everything handed to her on a platter and can do anything and has no actual flaws. Cat clearly doesn't, even if it works out in the end for her (since she's the protagonist and there wouldn't be a story if she dies for good).
