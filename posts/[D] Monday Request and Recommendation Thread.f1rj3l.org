Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** What are your top 10 favorite works of fiction?

 

I'm talking about the best of the best that you've seen/read/experienced across any medium whether it's books, movies, tv, anime, video games, web fiction etc anything really. Doesn't have to be rational either. I would like to see what people here like in general and maybe find something new to experience.

*** 1. *The Mysterious Island* by Jules Verne. During the time American Civil War, little group of people end up on crashing on a tropical island, where they survive using mostly their bare skills. When I've read it for a first time at 6, it was astonished. But whats more important, when I re-read it to my son when I was 30, I still found the book enjoying, which is a very rare thing for fiction books I've read through my life - most of them you just overgrow in due time.
2. *HPMOR*. It was really a life-changing book. No less, no more.
3. *Mother of Learning*, by [[https://www.patreon.com/nobody103][Domagoj Kurmaic]] aka nobody103. Lots of info about it here on Reddit, so I presume, no additional comments needed.
4. *The Arithmancer* trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]]. Harry Potter fanfic, but centered around Hermione, who, opposed to original books, is really smart, and not kinda-smart-by-plot. Also, with a very strong dramatic part.
5. *Worth the Candle* - its still in progress, but there are huge amounts of text already, and it is really good. It has its weak spots, but overall - its great.
6. *Age of the dead* trilogy by Andrey Kruz, russian writer and ex-military officer. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2018, and there are no translations and the moment. However, this is a wonderful zombie-apocalypse-themed books with a protagonists that make rational decisions. I mean, not /always smart/, but /rational./ So, they are mostly ordinary people, but without plot armor or plot-induced-stupidity. Also, the zombies are slightly more complex than usual dumb and slow walking targets, which win only because of protagonists' plot-induced stupidity.

These a books, that I /will/ eventualy re-read. Of course, there are lots of books, that I've already read more than once, but most of them I will not read again - the life is not infinite, and there's so much more to read.

*** *Hyper Light Drifter* - absolutely gorgeous and immersive. Conveys itself perfectly to the player without the use of written language, which perfectly fits into the "drifter among aliens" concept of the game.

*Hadestown* - never actually seen the musical, just listened to the album, but it remains a favorite to listen to while relaxing.

*My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected.* - absolute guilty pleasure, the most light novel-ish light novel to exist. Still great.

*The Gnoll Credo* - short and packed full of content, really appeals to a minimalistic mindset. Good kick in the pants to read every now and again.

*Helck* - the genre shift to end all genre shifts, all perfectly foreshadowed in a way that makes perfect sense after the fact. Tears and laughter for days.

*Witch Hat Atelier* - medieval-era harry potter in a world of nuanced morality and a bitchin' magic system, and absolutely gorgeous art on every page.

*Dennou Coil* - deceptively slow-paced, absolute gem of a world (google glass + internet wild west = pseudo-supernatural AR shenanigans). Really tries to lull you into boredom then smacks you in the face with the last 6 episodes or so of pure hype.

*Worth the Candle* - gets shilled all the time in here so just read that not this.

*Permutation City* - great on its own merits but also one of the first books that really got me into scifi/fantasy and thus holds extra sentimental value.

*Calgary's Gideon Keys* - not a straightforward recommendation. While the execution is not overly great, the /aesthetic/ of urban supernatural found tales is exactly what I was looking for when I first stumbled across it. Similar to The Holders Series before that community got infested by terminal edge syndrome.

*** In no particular order:

1.  [Book] *Master and Margarita*, I really feel like this is a book which is /perfect/ at what it does. I couldn't think of a single thing that could be improved.

2.  [Book] *HPMoR*. I kinda see why people might dislike it, but for me, this was a life-changing book.

3.  [Series] *BoJack Horseman*, which has /by far/ the best representation of mental illnesses in all of television. Watching it is probably my most painfully relatable experience with media.

4.  [Webcomic] *Romantically Apocalyptic*. It's a pleasure for eyes, and I really enjoy deciphering the highly cryptic plot, much more so than in Homestuck, for comparison.

5.  [Videogame] *Factorio*. More like Cracktorio, amiright?

6.  [Manga] *Made In Abyss*. Haunting and engaging, and damn if it's not the most beautiful manga I've ever seen.

7.  [Book] *Atlas Shrugged*. Before you skin me alive for having the worst taste in reading ever, I'd like to note that I recognize all its flaws and like it because it's something /I could've written/ when I was 16. Down to the mistakes, to the characterization, to the plot points, to the ideas, to the style... I read it and was amazed at how /young me/ this book was. It's the nostalgia of the highest caliber, and nothing has ever come close.

8.  [Web Original] *CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good*. I like it for reasons that can't be disclosed, and if you aren't familiar with this story, please don't try to learn more---just go ahead and read it. Literally once-in-a-lifetime experience.

9.  [Videogame] *Baba Is You*, the best puzzle game I've ever played.

*** That's a question I ask myself all the time. I think right now they are probably, in no particular order:

Worm by Wildbow (aka. John McCrae),

Sufficiently Advanced Magic,

The First 15 Lives of Harry August,

Ra,

14 by Peter Clines,

Delve by SenescentSoul,

My Hero Academia (more for the FF Iv'e imagined. I think you could pack all the anime I've ever watched together into one recommendation. It's fun to watch but generally doesn't leave you with much afterwords. So you could add Sailor Moon, R+V (the manga) and such like Doctor Stone and Naruto. Nothing particularly amazing but, still.),

The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury,

Harry Potter (I loved it when I was a small child, not so much now but it's certainly become a part of who I am),

And perhaps a bottle of all the ‘rational' fiction I've read. Even though a lot of it is self aggrandizing it has a tendency to get you thinking about your own behaviors. I know I act irrationally more often then not and examining the motivation, or lack of, behind my choices is fairy fascinating. That's not a work of fiction though so, perhaps

Doctor Who (though it's dragged on, as it tends too, and I've neglected to watch the recent episodes. Much like HP, it has become a remnant of my youth.)

And there is a dossier on my interests. I wonder how much I've revealed about myself on reddit...

tl;dr - Read ‘The First 15 Lives of Harry August by Claire North'. It's a fairly high quality piece of fiction revolving around what reality might be like if certain individuals lived their lives over and over again.

***** I feel like The Wandering Inn is underrated. It's got solid character development, distinct character voices, quite consistent worldbuilding---I was rereading the first volume recently and was actually impressed at how much foreshadowing I'd originally dismissed as throwaway fluff---and is just all-round my favorite ongoing text serial right now. I will admit that there's something about that feels guilty pleasurish, but I can't quite pin it and I don't think it fits in that category for me personally.

Homestuck, on the other hand, has plenty of guilt-inducing elements that I'm not going to bother listing, but I also admire it /as a literary work/ for its originality, themes and the raw creativity of the whole work. Its takes on predestination, identity, etc. are interesting and engaging without being preachy. It's something I could see being brought up in a literature class, for its clever use of medium and the sheer ambition of the project if for nothing else.

OPM... it's a good work of fiction. I enjoy reading and watching it, but not as much as some of the others on the list. There are some interesting themes and characters in it, there's an original premise, but that's really the most I can say about it. ONE doesn't impress me as much as Andrew Hussie, and One Punch Man doesn't entertain me as much as the Wandering Inn. It's a guilty pleasure not because of anything wrong with it, but because I can't name anything special about it beyond "I like reading it"---which is perfectly fine, that's the ultimate goal of entertainment media, after all! But if it hadn't been specified "top ten", it wouldn't be on the list at all.

I think this is part of the author really making an effort to add humor and 'slice of life' elements that create atmosphere. A lot of authors just skim by that to keep everything tight and related to the plot, but pirateaba isn't afraid to let characters breath for a bit.

*** I ended up with more than 10 because you said /any medium/. That sort of loose wording is how you get Professor Moriarty breaking out of a holodeck simulation, you know. Bolded things that I suspect would jive well with this community, conveniently narrowing it down to 10.

Film:

- *The Man From Earth* - Science fiction / philosophy thing consisting of a bunch of people talking in a cabin.
- I'm A Cyborg But That's Okay - Romantic comedy set a mental hospital and the shared delusions of the cast. It's zany, it's sweet.
- Ong Bak - Still my favorite martial arts movie.
- Princess Mononoke - I really enjoy Miyazaki's moral stance, and I think it comes through best here.

Plays / Musicals:

- *[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJir5uPRXcM][Into The Woods]]* - Fairy tale deconstruction. Hilarious, bleak.
- *[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjKUVK9A7rI][The Pokeon Mewsical]]* - Pokemon parody play. College production, so don't expect the execution to be perfect, but it's still hilarious and gives me warm fuzzy feelings.

Video games:

- Earthbound - The humor and writing in this really are great. I like video games but this is the only one I particularly want to recommend as fiction instead of as a game.

Serial television (mostly anime):

- Battlestar Galactica - I felt like every episode of this was twice as good as the last until midway into the second season. Unfortunately the third and fourth seasons are increasingly a mess due to studio meddling.
- *Ghost In The Shell* - Excellent zig-zagging between transhumanist mysteries and cool action sequences. I think it's at its best when it's doing one-off episodes, and the also-excellent Psycho Pass does a better job of telling a multi-episode story.
- The Eccentric Family - A nuanced, thoughtful look at what it's like to be a magical talking raccoon in modern day Japan.
- *Kino's Journey* - Kino goes on a quiet adventure, visiting towns based on science fiction or philosophy concepts.
- *Shinsekai Yori* - I don't really want to say anything about this. It's certainly a trip.

Serial fiction:

- *[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249][Worth The Candle]]* - Isekai deconstruction/reconstruction.
- *[[http://daystareld.com/pokemon/][Pokemon: The Origin Of Species]]* - This has displaced HP:MoR for me, I think it's the best version of this concept so far.
- [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] / [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]] - Ward is better, but it's a sequel so start with Worm of course.

Dead tree fiction:

- *[[https://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]]* - Transhuman space horror. WORDS.
- Hitchhiker's Guide - Timeless sci fi humor. Or I assume it's timeless, it's been decades since I last read this.
- Reaper Man - It's been ages since I read Pratchett, probably outgrew him by now. But he's a lot of fun, I liked his Death series the best, and I liked this the best out of those.

Bullshit:

- *[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NNHmV3QPw][Human History Movie]]* - Hour long well-produced cartoon where the author explains the history of the Earth according to his new age / all conspiracies are true / crank magnetism world view. It's a shame that somebody actually believes this stuff, but taken as a fiction setting it's an amazing alternative to orcs and elves again.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] is a Naruto fanfiction centered around time loops. It's fairly popular around here.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] features a protagonist who gradually grows in power, somewhat like Zorian does in Mother of Learning. There's a magic academy arc, but it's not a major part of the story. You may have heard of this one already - it's one of the best works of rational fiction out there - but in case you haven't, I'd highly recommend that you check it out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] resembles HPMOR more than MoL since it's, you know, a Harry Potter fanfiction, but it fits the criteria of being rational and set in a magic academy. It's also hilarious and full of munchkinry. Note that while the first and second "books" are complete, the third one is unfinished and hasn't been updated in over a year.

***** A bit late, but I also read Time Braid before knowing anything about Naruto (or Oh my Goddess) and enjoyed it. However it was very confusing to read Naruto fanfiction later because Time Braid is a rather unique reinterpretation. Generally it really does assume Naruto knowledge, though you can fill in the gaps for most of it. Probably worst of all the climax is a massive Deus Ex Machina without knowing something about Naruto (I was seriously annoyed by it). However you can probably skim the wiki and get the idea.

Also it's pretty good overall, and the first book of it is great. Though later on I feel like it's weighed down by under-using some of its best characters and relationships. Overall, best summary is this quote by [[/u/NotACauldronAgent]] in one of the comment threads: “That is both really clever and the stupidest thing I ever heard.”

Sports recommendation: bouldering has a lot more puzzle-solving elements than I expected, and is actually pretty videogamey. Would recommend if you're looking for physical activity and it's available in your area.

Rec request: Looking for a short, archetypical xianxia story. Good writing would be a plus, but being short is a substitute. Doesn't have to be rational or deconstructionist at all.

It's a pretty straightforward Fantasy, but mixes things up by questioning /why/ a fantasy world might exist, and what might happen if it started to go through an industrial revolution. The biggest draw here is the characters, who are excellent, and there's a lot of them. This is currently ongoing, with a mostly consistent update schedule. It doesn't come at things from a rational angle, but the characters act consistently and generally rationally, the world is internally consistent, and it hits enough of the same themes to be relevant to the same audience, I think. I also think it deserves more support and viewership, so try it out.

[[https://wanderinginn.com/][The Wandering Inn]] is an excellent LitRPG - but instead of becoming the hero, the main character instead decides to run an inn. Starts off a bit slow, but is currently one of the most engaging web serials I follow, with an extremely well thought-out setting and a wonderful cast of characters, along with very good writing. This is currently ongoing, in its sixth book with a consistent (and extremely robust) update schedule.

Let's say, for example In the ‘Completionist Chronicles' my immersion was completely destroyed after the MC asked his in-game god if he could not be a priest because ‘worshipping' him when he was Catholic IRL went against his beliefs. Like what was the point of that? It wasn't a major plot point or anything, there wasn't an overarching story that involved an analysis on in-game religion and moral choices. It was a throwaway line in what is, in my opinion, a mediocre but not terrible story.

It just ruined the series for me, or it made me feel like reading it was a waste of time when stuff like that was included with such little purpose.

Also Unsong is a ‘rational' story that has a lot of stuff about the Bible in it. I liked how religion was handled in that one. I'm not at all religious myself but the way it was all handled in universe was fascinating. The story kind of asks the question of ‘what if the Bible was mostly true' in a world like ours which quickly devolves into the esoteric. I said this already but it really was a fascinating read and is definitely in my top 20.

I have read sufficiently advanced magic and shadows of what was lost.

Also is there anywhere I can go to discuss cradle with people? Now that I know book 8 is coming out in March there is so much I want to discuss and theorize before it comes out.

I guess for recommendations Id like to recommend two pieces which have probably been recommended in this sub before but want to mention them in case it slipped by anyone.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis][Chrysalis]]. It is an isekai similar to Im a Spider, So What? In that the protag is transported to another world as a monster. Unlike Im a Spider, it keeps that lighthearted tone from the beginning throughout, up to its latest chapter. It is not finished but has a huge chunk of chapters and updates almost daily, but in short bits. It's fun to see a protagonist be lighthearted but also consider the ramifications of their actions. It is not rational, I wouldnt even call it rational adjacent, but the character isnt dumb. Any dumb mistakes made by people are in-character for them, rather than forcing the plot to progress. The only downside is that the updates are often rather short and leave you watching more, so when you catch up Id leave it for a week or two at a time and then read the updates in one burst.

*** The only other xanxia I have found that I liked almost as much as Cradle was Street Cultivation. Someone else on this sub described it as xanxia + capitalism, and it's set in a much more "modern" world than most xanxia. Book 1 is available on Amazon, and book II is currently updating on Royal Road.

The only criticism I have of it is that the main character looks at everything a bit too...coldly? Maybe? Not sure how to describe it, but it results in him not really seeming entirely like a real person. This is partially due to his absolute laser focus on cultivation/advancement/etc. which is sort of a staple of the genre, but there is just something that very subtly yet consistently triggers my "would a real person really react like that/think that?" reflex. But even with that criticism, I still thing that overall the characters are well written and the dialogue is mostly pretty good, including the MC. If you liked Cradle, I'm pretty sure you will like Street Cultivation.

***** What elements of xanxia do you think are missing of from Street Cultivation? And what do you think the difference is between xanxia and "power creep fantasy" (which I'll admit to not having heard of as a genre before). "Power Creep Fantasy" sounds like a pretty good, succinct (if incomplete) way to describe xanxia to me. Street Cultivation is definitely different than most xanxia, but that's kind of the point. It is taking a lot of the common tropes and ideas and putting them in a substantially different setting and seeing what it looks like. It's literary fusion, and I'm really not sure what other genre you could call it that would be more informative to a prospective reader than "xanxia", since that's very clearly (and explicitly from the author) what it was inspired from.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/familiar-pact-worm.629776/][Familiar]] has Taylor die during the Cell arc, and be summoned from the Abyss by Molly Walker. Not dead according to the author's beta reader.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mans-one-shots-and-snippets-worm.624913/#post-51845468][The Barber]] by the same author - three chapters of Taylor triggering with the Barber's powerset.

*** Sorry, I really don't. Pact was a weird place for me, because the entire time I was reading it I thought it was pretty good, I guess...but I miss Worm and why wouldn't he just start up the sequel immediately? And now...it's something I keep thinking about. Just especially the karma and "spirits watching you" parts. Like, you can gain an upper hand by declaring that you will not be hurt...but if you are hurt, then you lose a lot more than you would have gained. Very cool. Sorry I haven't looked into good fanfics for you.

** Lately I've had an itch for what I'm going to call "overwhelming odds isekai". A protagonist ends up in a world or siituation where the bottom rung of the food chain is still about ten rungs higher than them and only survives^{\}) through luck, time loop shenanigans or being amazingly careful.

[[https://thesnekreport.com/][The Snake Report]] is my favourite (and also only) example of this (made up) genre. Person gets reincarnated as a tiny snake in an everything-eat-snake world and survives mostly due to luck and resourcefulness. And the mercy of the tiny snake god.

I'd appreciate any recommendations or nudges towards the real name of this genre, if there is one!

^{\}Survival of the protagonist is not necessarily a requirement, but I imagine a story where the protagonist permanently dies in the first two lines would be rather short. (And very funny))

*** I guess there's Chrysalis, an English web novel where the MC reincarnates into an ant monster, the weakest monster there is. Pretty good actually, if you can ignore the MC's occasional bout of stupidity.

Of course there's also So I'm a Spider, So What?, where the MC reincarnates into a weak spider monster. One of the best out there.

Honestly I just call that genre monster reincarnation. The weakest organism they reincarnate into is always some weak monster that even other weak fodder monsters can easily beat, and it's fun to watch them go against the odds and go from a weakling to a walking cataclysm. It's hard to find other such novels, there's very few examples of it, and most of them end up being terribly written too.

** I've read many fictions that get dropped or put on permanent hiatus, but it's been almost a year since I read [[http://alexanderwales.com/glimwarden-prologue/][Glimwarden]] and I can't get it out of my head. I love the setting so much. I think there are three aspects that I love about it. 1) I like the "it's a big scary world, and man is eking out an existence, and it's not perilous necessarily, but anything could be out there" setting of it. I think I especially like the use of a beacon to hold back the "darkness". 2) I like the superhero aspect where everyone "gets one power" and judicious munchkining is expected. I've read a lot of superhero fics in my day. 3) I like the "kill monsters, gain essences, get more power"aspect. I've been reading tons of lit RPGs lately, and they're so addictive to me.

Any recommendations that might scratch that itch? I haven't really looked for fan fiction or anything of it, but if there is any decent fanfic of it I would read it, or anything that . I read [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/the-story-so-far/][Pyrebound]] to current about a month ago, which kept reminding me of it, but never actually scratching that itch. Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good story in its own right, but doesn't fill the hole that the few chapters of Glimwarden somehow created. Halp!
