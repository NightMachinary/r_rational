Hey everyone! I have been following this sub for a long time. I should have thought to discuss this here sooner. I am a new author, and I am writing my MC in a way that is causing some angry reviews. I believe it is far more rational for someone to take a long time to adjust to a world of killing. I always read stories in which a character will flip a switch and absolve themselves of all the emotional ramifications of such actions. Any thoughts? I have considered posting my link here, but I do not want to attract low ratings, or bring something to the sub that would not fit what you all enjoy.

/Thank you to everyone who responded. This has been an excellent discussion. If I have not responded to you I will do my best to correct that after work. My problem here was that I misunderstood what rational fiction was or at least could be. I need to work on my explanation, reasoning, and background thought process in this case. I feel my understanding has grown and I will continue to work on it. When I feel I am there I will post my story to the sub./

Thanks again!!


** Honestly? It makes sense for it to take sometime for one to truly adjust to a world where violence and bloodshed is the norm. Progression Fantasy has a heavy power fantasy edge to it, so the MCs have weaknesses like not being a murder on a dime psychopath can detract from the appeal for some.

But in the end, it's often a matter of taste. And I for one enjoy watching a MC harden up from their experiences.

**** Make sure that the characters reluctance for violence makes sense in the context of the world and the story. Sometimes its frustrating as a reader to read about a character whose skills are exceptional but artificially gimped by his morality to give everyone else a chance.

This is especially frustrating when it doesnt make sense in the context of the story. If your character grew up in a rough and merciless environment, he shouldnt have any problems with violence as a general rule. On the other hand, if you explain that he grew in a peaceful, out of the way village, or in the nobility, etc, his reluctance then makes more sense.

** "I don't like this violence" is realistic. Police and military studies will tell you that many (not all) people have great difficulty with killing, especially early on.

Unfortunately, simple doubt and suffering isn't very interesting to read. It doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't change anything, it's pain without meaning.

You can fix that, though. You just have to make it pain /with/ meaning. Show the /change/ it drives. Show the /useful impact/ of the doubt and turmoil.

Show how the turmoil leads to a more effective or unexpected path.

How are your hero's doubts and turmoil interesting? How do they lead to distinctive progress?

Examples:

(1) Troubled by killing, the hero discovers a coworker who also hates it, and they become tight friends in this uncaring world.

(2) Troubled by killing, the hero discovers a way to become a surgeon instead of a soldier.

(3) Troubled by killing, the hero finds someone who can reveal the secret history of how this world went violent.

(4) Troubled by killing, the hero with his questions earns an invitation to a secret spiritual order among the warriors.

(5) Troubled by killing, the hero resolves to win a rank that will let him insist on more mercy and less cruelty in his new people's wars.

If all you've got is, "no, he does what you'd expect, he's just sad about it," then I think you should summarize his sadness the same way you'd summarize his eating, sleeping, and brushing his teeth.

In real life, turmoil happens, and we suffer whether it's interesting or not. In fiction, when turmoil is more than a summary, it should not just be realistic -- it should be interesting.

** Rationality isn't a specific course of action, it's explaining what the character is thinking and why they are making the choices they are. You could have a character that is happy to kill all the time and it would be perfectly rational if you explained why (somehow, not necessarily by writing down every thought).

**** A bit of a weird way to turn it about, but look at Evangelion: a deconstruction showing what happens in relying on emotionally broken children to put themselves in harms way to save the world.

A whole lot of people took from it “Why won't he just get in the cool robot and kill stuff!”

There is always going to be people who want it to be a straight power fantasy, or are not particularly interested in an exploration of topics. Or there's a certain genre savviness that comes from imagining dealing with the situation (and awareness of outcomes) versus /actually being in that situation/. It's easier for someone to go “Yeah gotta murder that dude because I might get caught / betrayed later” versus /literally having to murder someone/.

**** SpaceBattles? SufficientVelocity maybe?

Yeah, ignore them and write what you want. If you are concerned that the MCs turmoil is a poor simulation of reality, I don't think you have too many worries there. If you had 100 characters, 95% of whom were in similar turmoil, you would probably still be on defensible simulationist grounds.

Also, from the perspective of simulationism, the MC being "Childish" is a non-sequitur.

Lastly, if you want your MC to be rational about this, the important thing is how they respond to it. If they freeze up at a critical moment, do they take that into account when strategizing? If an ally horrifies them by killing someone defenseless, does the MC make sure to never leave them alone with a defenseless person again?

If they view it as a liability, do they try to desensitize themselves? If they view it as important, do they try to prevent desensitization? If they are confused, do they notice their confusion?

Don't help normalize the idea that avoiding killing is weakness - it is strength, just like if it ends up necessary and is the least wrong choice, admitting and expressing the trauma and dehumanization it causes is a sign of strength. Lack of empathy / lack of sensitivity to violence are signs of damage and weakness, not weakness and definitely not rational, nor do they have a place in RationalLit unless it is to illustrate the problem.

** "Rational" does not mean an inherently better approach. Also, again, you can argue both ways- maybe it makes more sense for someone to be unable to flip a switch, but maybe someone who puts thought into it struggles with their first kill and gets over it quickly. Plenty of popular stories here have some highly utilitarian protagonists. Sometimes the killing doesn't get addressed and sometimes it's addressed post-hoc. And even then, even assuming it's written and presented well and is engaging (which it might not be), people are going to react to it different based on how it's presented. You also have to say something interesting about it, because both "I don't want to kill" and "murderhobo time" are both takes that have been done to death before.

Most of the most popular stories here don't just have it as a flipped switch. Mother of Learning takes a while to build up to it, desensitize Zorian over several time loops and his own deaths, and still has him reflect on his actions afterwards. Worth the Candle swings around- Joon's thoughts on it definitely start out reasonably freaked out before swinging around to the DnD adventurer mentality, but it's pretty explicitly in the "hey, this may be a TTRPG standard and is sometimes needed, but maybe don't murderhobo your way out of every situation as your first reaction." Based on how you count them, something like half of the conflicts are resolved by diplomacy checks. Not a rational fic, but Tales of the Abyss does a fantastic job dealing with it early on and has the character development part with regards to killing be more than just flipping a switch, without letting the issue overstay its welcome from a narrative or character development perspective.

** Can't really give a proper critique without reading the story in question, but here's some ideas anyway.

Consider the audience. Royal Road is focused on power fantasy stories on a reason - that's what the audience there wants. If the MC feels weak at any point for any reason then a portion of the readers will dislike it on general principles - that sort of thing is simply not what they go there for. There's nothing you can really do about that.

A more thorny situation is where the MC complains about having to kill in ludicrously justified circumstances - say, him being directly threatened by several opponents about to kill him.

Now, this is obviously a realistic emotional reaction. I don't believe anyone but a legitimate sociopath would be completely unaffected by killing another human being after a relatively peaceful life. But it can still be annoying to read yet another character angst about it, especially when the "correct" answer to the dilemma is /glaringly obvious/.

The best way I can think of to handle this sort of thing is to simply make the character acknowledge to the reader that this is an emotional reaction they have little control over, not an issue of beliefs. It's kind of similar to anyone in the modern world eating meat but balking at killing animals themselves. You /know/ you're being a hypocrite, but you can't really help it - so at least acknowledge it. You'd be surprised how much that helps.

***** Only if your taking a multiple choice test, and the instructions say so.

Which is least wrong - 2+2=5, or 2+5=5? Is either correct?

If your given the choice of torturing your Mother or Father to death or making them torture you - is any choice correct (except maybe choosing to rejecting the scenario)?

If you believe killing other sapients is wrong, is it suddenly right if they attempt to kill you? Or is it still wrong, but a transgression your willing to make to save your own life?

From a more pragmatic view, if you accept "least wrong" as "correct" then that sets a precedent, and removes the need to look for a better solution, or try to examine how the situation got to that point and head off future scenarios in the future.

A shooter enters school, and starts killing students. A police officer shoots the killer to prevent additional children dying. At that moment he feels it is the least wrong solution.

Imagine the shooter is a 14 year old boy. Still maybe least wrong, but is it right?

Imagine shooter is a 9 year old girl with a significant disability. Officer might still feel shooting her is least wrong in the moment, but will we be satisfied with the answer after? Were there other solutions? Could this have been prevented earlier? If so then I would rally hesitate to say it was "Correct" - and I expect the officer would spend the rest of his life wondering and mourning too.

I think the real world is very very rarely a matter of "Correct / Incorrect, or Right / Wrong, Evil / Good. " And any time we disregard all the grey to be satisfied with an absolute answer, we are really at a significant risk of starting something worse.

** I think it depends a lot on the presentation. If the main character is irrationally against killing to the point that they endanger their friends and loved ones, I get very turned off. If they try very hard not to kill but end up doing what they have to and suffer emotionally, that sounds like great character development. Many people in real life would struggle to kill in a life or death situation, but I don't want to read stories about them and they would probably end up dead themselves. Having a protagonist like that who succeeds feels like deus ex Machina in a highly lethal setting.

So much this. I watched the first /The Purge/ movie a few weeks back, and I still get angry when I'm reminded of it. The whole main family is so actively stupid they deserved to die, except the father who argues for all the sane decisions - and is naturally the only one to die, after being told over and over again how he's a terrible person for wanting to sacrifice one kidnapper and would be murderer to save four innocent people. And the film ends with the survivors/idiot family members choosing to let a bunch of actual killers-for-pleasure go free without prison time because they want to 'do the right thing'.

Everyone who had significant input on the writing on that movie is a bad person and should never be allowed to create ever again.

** When writing fiction, you have to juggle two forces:

1. Your story must make rational sense and the characters must act in a coherent manner.
2. Story must be digestible and entertaining, which means you have to somehow bend reality and use expected tropes even when they make no sense.

A perfectly rational story would be dry and boring as a pile of sawdust. We read stories to enjoy adventures and escapist themes by proxy, and the appeal of escapist adventure is that it is different from reality.

If your character takes a long time to adjust to killing, then either you have to rewrite the setting and plot so that killing is a rare and big deal, to everyone, not just the protagonist, or write the protagonist in a way that allows him to solve the problems without killing (like the Doctor, usually).

Havign a character that takes a long time tro adjust to killing is not only boring to the reader (especially if the protag monologues about the suffering of being a killer) but also not realistic. IRL, people in war/combat situations kill very easily and adjust to a reality of killing frighteningly fast. THey do not mope or bemoan their fate prior or during the killing, but AFTER, when they get PTSD, often months and years after the fact.

Ask yourself:

1. WHY are you writing progression? What is the appeal of that? Can you write a story that touches the same feelings as progression fic without falling into its pitfalls?
2. WHY KILL? Why is killing necessary at all in the story? Can it be circumvented?
3. WHY WRITE A PACIFIST? If somehow you need to have deaths in story, why insist on a non-psycho protagonist?

" I always read stories in which a character will flip a switch and absolve themselves of all the emotional ramifications of such actions. "

Because that is how it happens IRL. Read some stories on the Vietnam War, WW2, or people being recruited into gangs and terrorist organisations. Violent circumstances sneak up on you, and then you just pull the trigger not emotionally comprehending that you are destroying a life. Adrenaline (and often, brainwashing) shields you from the moral implications for a while...except on that one night, 3 years after when you wake up screaming and put a gun in your mouth, because the moral weight have finally reached you.

** I don't think it's a bad thing at all, one of the things I like a lot about Delve is the fact that the MC responded naturally and realistically to his life in the new world and the trauma he suffered. That said him acting "weak" is probably the most common criticism about the work. I really think that's mostly because the overall genre of rational/adjacent/related works has so many much more violent characters, and that that's the sorry of wish fulfillment a lot of readers are hoping for. Because of that for many a character like that send strange and unrealistic, in the same way that coconuts sound more natural than real hoofbeats in a movie

Personally I strongly think that this is one of those "don't listen to the fans, chasing after them will pull you away from the story and people you want to write in a worse direction" and not a "listen to your fans they have valuable insights in a more productive and rewarding oath for the story to take".

If you'd like someone that is more predisposed to the sort of story you are writing to take a look is be happy to take a look, you can PM me, it's certainly possible to go too far in the other direction... But in a genre filled with murder hobos you'll start getting criticism long before you actually go to far in that direction, so I find it unlikely.

** My personal theory is that this isn't a rationality issue, it's just a tired trope where readers are bored of hearing about protagonists struggle with killing people. Is there anything interesting you can do with the idea, create some novelty?

What if you reverse it, have someone who thought they would be deeply affected but just aren't? What if they get worried about the fact that they don't care?

What if they're ashamed that they aren't hard-hearted enough, that they're not like the Berserker on Stanford Bridge, mowing down Englishmen? What if they've idolized a fantasy warrior culture that never actually existed?

** What makes you think it's rational to take a long time to adjust to a world of killing? Just from the little bit you have written, you sound like someone who thinks that all killing is wrong.

In any case, you need to differentiate between your own ideals vs. your character's ideals, unless your story is a self-insert.

Who is doing the killing? Who or what is being killed? Why? These are just 3 of the questions that can change a person's feelings about killing.

** I disagree. When you are in "a world of killing", there is a lot of adaptation pressure, from everywhere around you. Humans are usually quick to adapt and to adjust to new environments. Want to fit in. When in Rome ...

It would be way more traumatizing / abhorrent to have e.g. a night elf appear bound in your current living room, and be told "kill it or else!". That would not be in tune with your environment, with the moral framework around you!

However, when you are surrounded by people killing, in "a world of killing", I think going with the flow would be easier than you'd evidently think. When you're totally immersed in a different culture, it's hard to cling to your old one, especially if your old one would also go counter to your survival instinct.

** Pardon my late contribution, but I think that it's worth mentioning that in modern combat, only one in four men will fire their guns. So if you're going to make killing a more common thing in your world, you'll need to show why.

- Is there a pervasive xenophobia throughout the world? If so, why?
- Is the value of a human life in your world less than in our own? Why/ Why not, and how does this change other things?
- Has the world been so desensitized to violence that killing is less traumatizing? Why/Why not/How does this influence other things?

A good example of something similar is Sanderson's Mistborn series. Why didn't the people rise up to fight the Lord Ruler? Well, in part it was because he had Soothers and Rioters spread throughout the capitol, suppressing passionate emotions and encouraging depression/apathy. It wasn't perfect, but it helped to serve as an explanation to why these people didn't do what would come naturally to us: revolution.

One thing I should have explained in my initial post is that my character hasn't even come to the point where he will need to kill another human. The issue he has is first killing a living creature that is not intelligent then moving on to having to kill civilized monsters that are capable of speech. Part of his struggle lies in that he is stranded on this planet and these creatures are the first he sees that he may be able to communicate with. The other part I had him deal with was essentially what right does he have to kill in order to live. How many lives could he take with the justification of his own being on the line.

I love the mistborn series. It is part of the inspiration for my book. I made my character a rogue because of Vin.

**** It should also be noted that in modern combat the vast majority of bullets fired don't actually hit anyone (I've seen estimates like 250,000 rounds fired for one combatant killed) both because most fire is intended to control the movement of the enemy so other people can kill them and because hitting what you're aiming at is really, really hard. Though obviously this doesn't account for harm done by stray bullets.

So if you get to the point to where you have to think about how much seperation there is between a character needing to use a gun vs having to actually intentionally kill someone the answer is way, way more than you think.

AFTER that, they get tremendous PTSD, but the first kill is often easy, especially if the "enemy" is sufficiently dehumanised.

In world war I and WWII , one of the biggest problems that both German and "Western" forces had is that most soldiers would just fire into the air or ground rather than at each other. It takes quite a bit of indoctrination, training, or attempted subjugation to get humans to kill strangers.

The more we look, the more we see bias in the most "influential" (sensational) studies. When the same data is examined with more rigor, the results are consistently showing a much less violent species than expected. About the first time you start seeing large scale violence is when we start developing land "rights".

A big part of the book is trying to figure out why we all so easily accept the notion that humans are so ready to kill, and why debunked research like the Stanford Prison Experiment still get credence and why the story of the Killing of Kitty Genovese was so distorted.

** A story can be well-executed either way, or it could be poorly executed either way. Without having read the story in question, the only thing I can say is: The story is about whatever the text is about. If you advertised a story about violence and wrote a story about moral ambiguity, the readers you attract will be frustrated by the lack of violence. Meanwhile, the kinds of readers who would like your story won't pick it up because they aren't interested in reading about the kinds of violence you advertised but didn't include.

If the draw of the story is creative violence in a fantasy universe, you may want to consider skipping ahead to the part your readers are actually reading for. Contrariwise, if the story is about someone coming to terms with moral ambiguity, that's what the story is about; when the protagonist undergoes a change (loss of innocence, or preservation of innocence and loss of something else), that story is over, and there will be no more space left to tell a story about creative violence in a fantasy universe.

In other words, if you intend for the story to be mainly about violence, don't waste your audience's time with 50k words of buildup that isn't about violence. If your story is about morality, don't waste your audience's time with 50k words about violence.

**** "About the plot," sure, but I'm going to double down. On some level, your story consists of a linear progression of sentences. Each sentence (assuming it's a complete sentence) consists of a subject, object, and verb. If you sum together those subject, object, and verbs, there must be patterns.

/Worm/ is a good example of a story that's /about/ fighting. The protagonist progresses from one fight to another. The plot is driven by the outcomes of fights. The first chapter is about why the protagonist chooses to fight, and the second chapter is about the protagonist starting a fight. If your story is aimed at people who liked /Worm/, they're there for the fighting. The climax is resolved by a fight; if the fight had gone the other way, the story would have as well.

Other stories are about emotional turmoil. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone contains fights, but it's not about fights. Look at the climax; Quirrel/Voldemort is defeated by Lily Potter's love. There's no rule in the magic system that enables Harry to defeat Voldemort, no spell, no trick, no plan, no strategy, no amount of force. The story is about the emotions of the characters, not the mechanics of the combat system.

If there was an elaborate, hard-sci-fi magic system in /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/, it would have been wasted when Voldemort was ultimately defeated by love magic, which isn't covered in the book at all, which is not associated with any spell or any rule, and which is only explained after the fight is over. The story was about love, not magic.

If your story is advertised as being about violence, if your audience is there for the violence, if the draw is the rules behind the violence, then your critics are right; your protagonist, like Taylor Hebert, should have taken the gloves off in Chapter 2 and started using the appropriate degree of force without remorse or sympathy. If that doesn't fit the story, you need to cut the first X chapters, making the new Chapter 1 a summary of the events up to that point and the new Chapter 2 the beginning of the first big fight.

If the draw is about the emotions and personalities of your character (meaning that the climax will /also/ be about these things and you will never transition to a violence-based story) then your critics are wrong and they should find something else to read.

Whatever the point of your story is, get there ASAP and don't tease the readers with implications that it might be otherwise. /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/ is about love and not fighting, it doesn't pretend its magic system is enough to carry a story, and it doesn't pretend Harry is capable of fighting Voldemort on his own at age 11. /Worm/ doesn't pretend Taylor is restrained, as evidenced by her inflicting life-threatening injuries on a deserving target in Chapter 2.

***** Yeah I read some advice from a well established serial author that was similar. If you put in certain aspects of your story for your synopsis you can avoid upsetting people that were expecting something else when they initially choose to read your book.

I believe the best way to put it is that in many parts of the book violence is the vehicle but never the destination.

I do love writing the fight scenes, but the book is more about unraveling the history. The series is about what events thousands of years ago led to the current system. I even include that in my series title in a blunt way. (Ramifications of the agreement)

I agree with you. The only part I would stress that I slightly lean away from what you are saying is that violence is extremely prevalent in my story, yet never the sole focus. I advertise that my story is about a mans journey through an unknown world. While there are violent scenes, a resolution never comes from those actions. Sure you get levels, stat points and cool items, yet winning a battle does not bring back lost loved ones, or fix broken parts of a man. It's not just that he struggles to kill it is that he has to kill while simultaneously deal with other traumatic events. One of my edits is going to be to highlight that. Thanks for your detailed input. I believe my understanding has grown considerably!

Having the MC take his time to change his entire worldview is fine - harping on and on about how murder is bad is not engaging or interesting to read.

Angst is almost always boring. If I read a fantasy book I expect to read about orcs, not angst. Include it if you need to, but keep in mind that it's blocking the path to the next paragraph on orcs.

Also, if it's realistic and /expected/ then, well, it's expected. I know how this ends so I'm not looking forward to any twist on how the angst progresses - again, angst is boring. Maybe it's not /fundamentally/ boring, but in practice it it's written boringly.

So IMO keep it to a minimum - allude to it if you need to, maybe even have a throwaway line or two in between the killing of orcs.

*** Yeah if I wanted to write this with such a simple premise I would not have taken months to plot out 50 years of back story. I am writing more of a slice of life where that would fly, but my characters growth and changes are not just about killing orcs. I believe fantasy books can have great characters. Brandon Sanderson never stops proving that for example. Depression if written correctly can be an interesting read. Thanks a lot though now I have to go an read the Dwarves series to get my fix of Orc killing!

** One interesting subversion: Have a protagonist who comes from a place where violence is unnecessary and slightly taboo (eg most parts of most 21st real-world wealthy nations) and is a prosocial member of society who has never been in a fight since grade school. Have them show up in this new world where violence is expected...and they find that not only are they good at it, they enjoy it. There's all kinds of character development to be had there, as your protagonist first thinks of theirself as a monster and fears that they might go too far...and then they slowly come to accept the new reality and adjust.

** Personally, I think "forever" is a reasonable amount of time to take to become inured to killing.

There's a comment later by [[/u/DXStarr]] about military and police becoming inured to killing that makes me react with "that's how we get war crimes".

** u/yakultbingedrinker:
#+begin_quote
  I believe it is far more rational for someone to take a long time to adjust to a world of killing
#+end_quote

It makes sense for it to take a long time for someone who wasn't comfortable with violence to spend a long time getting comfortable with it, but I think there's a couple important caveats to that

1. If violence is extremely adaptive in that world, you can't cheat by having the main character engage in prolonged hesitation and vacilitation, where the logic of events would have normally killed him for such weakness, but he gets away with it because the world stands by conveniently on pause? Someone who is poorly attuned to their new circumstances taking a long time to adjust is normal, but if they are so poorly attuned that they are only surviving thanks to plot armour, that's unconvincing. If a pacifist gets dropped into a hellworld, they may naturally maintain their pacifist sensibilities, but they will need something like a silver tongue, or very fast legs, or an intense and proactive risk aversion (or a strong ability to go against their inclinations) if they want to survive. -- It needs to add up, it needs to make sense.

2. "heroes" are expected by default to be fluent with violence (not neccesarilly "comfortable", I suppose). Departing from isn't a big deal or renegement but should come with a bit of lampshading explanation just so readers can get their bearings: Why are they uncomfortable with violence? Are all earth humans constituted so? Or is it more a matter of time and place, upbringing, experience, values, etc? -Don't take the default assumption (the assumption that is normal here on richer parts of planet earth circa 20XX) and privilege it as a shared assumption between yourself and the reader. If they're all killing each other like flies over there, it's because of some circumstance about the make up of that world. If the hero, by contrast, was lucky enough to to live in a world where a prediliction for violence isn't a necessity, that is a circumstance too, highly interesting in itself (including for the way it goes against genre convention) and deserves firstly a nod and hopefully some investigation and exploration.

In short, just make sure that you are treating it as a character trait which exists in the character (who exists in the world) rather than a divine impetus which the world warps itself to make room for and accommodate.

edit: I'll add a "this is just my take" disclaimer (that was it right there) because it looks like lots of other people have said similar things and I feel obligated to make such a disclaimer when speaking with a crowd.

*** Yeah that's my story! I just love dark and gritty characters. My goal going into writing the MC was more of a question of how could someone who is naturally gentle and somewhat against violence turn into someone who was. That transformation is something I am going to really focus on when I do my next round of edits. I have the bones there I really just need to build it all up more.

**** Cool! Always nice to have a new story to try.

Did you ever read David Gemmell?

I'm rereading Waylander at the moment and it's weird how directly the beginning of the book parallels the topic.

(I'd love to say more but it moves pretty fast (the issue is pretty much on discussion from page 1) and anything I could say would be a spoiler. )

edit: though I suppose I should specify that this particular question is given more of a philosophical than psychological treatment. All of the concerned characters are pretty hardbitten. In particular the guy who is hesitant to kill isn't hesitant to die (badly), and internal psychological struggle hasn't been the main focus.
