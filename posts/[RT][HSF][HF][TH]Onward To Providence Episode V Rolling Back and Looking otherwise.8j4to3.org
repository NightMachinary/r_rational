I think this is probably on the longer end for one of my 'chapters' / 'episodes' also this is pretty close to finishing up on 'establishing' characters.

Next up we are going to be starting to get into a little bit of adventure. But that is for later.

Always appreciate feedback and discussion, even if it only amounts to yelling at me to fix my grammar/spelling!

** This is really fun! I liked your Deep Rise comic, especially the late game with the Royals forcing the protagonists into space, and this looks like it will be a continuation of the genre (if not the story). I love your mix of cute and horrific!

*** I feel like I probably will need to look up what genre my writing is some day, but I'm glad the character of it has continued!

Maybe Nighzmarqulian will become a thing some day.
