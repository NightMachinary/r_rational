I'm all caught up with mother of learning, been checking every day for the next Chapter.

Is there a way of just getting a notification?

** I have a IFTTT applet that says: if on reddit there's a new post from search: "subreddit: rational title: mother of learning" than send me a notification. Sometimes I get a false positive but it works for me. [[https://i.imgur.com/fOuLbRH.jpg][Example image.]]

I have one of those also for Worth the Candle, Ward, One Punch Man, The Tutorial is Too Hard, etc.

** Click the author's profile and he has expected release dates.

Additionally, get an RSS feed reader.

There are also browser add-ons that monitor a page for changes periodically and notify you. Use google.

** You can follow his patreon without actually donating, I have an RSS feed on my phone's homescreen, you can turn a subreddit into a feed just by add .RSS at the end so reddit.com[[/r/rational]].rss is a feed.
