Hard sci-fi with a gripping concept as well as valid questions that are fun to ponder.

It's about human beings reacting to a 37th (40th?) dimension being wanting to accelerate the development of humanity by providing them with CrAzY ALieN tEcHNolOGY (Gone political/Nearly began WWIII).

Title: Seikaisuru Kado (Kado - The Right Answer)

Episode count: 12 (sub), 8 (dub)

Toei Animation. /Warning: 3D/CGI animation (tho it's pretty good imho)/

It's a pretty solid watch. Don't let my shabby description deter you from watching it.


** I literally finished watching it 15 minutes ago.

It's kinda fine up to 9th episode, but the end is... butchered. I feel they were up to something bigger, maybe some intrigues, but Shindo's (protagonist) abilities were... wasted.

If they had more material, for maybe 20 episodes, and richer scenario, it had potential, but it just didn't live up to the hype it created.

I may sound negative now, but I really enjoyed watching it, it depicts humans dealing with something just out of this world with believable procedures and generally the background is nice. Visuals are nice too, but it lacks... depth.

Actually, if I cover the 'sci-fi' theme with a 'magic applied', it feels better.

** it had some interesting exploratory concepts in the beginning but most of the last third is not really good...

*** Gonna have to agree with you on that one. It started off strongly but began to fall victim to quite a few typical anime tropes and predictable twists.

Eh, overall, it was an enjoyable watch for me, at least.

** IMO Kado is not even close to rational. It's that pop-scifi nonsense that looks good on the surface as long as you avoid actually thinking about whether anything anyone is doing make sense.

Admittedly it's just about decent enough to be watchable (I've watched the first 10 episodes so far) but that's not really what this sub is about. Rational fiction is about thinking, not themes.

I'm avoiding going into specifics because I don't really want a proper debate, and if other people liked it more than me I have no reason to object. But if people are unconvinced I could give a few specifics.
