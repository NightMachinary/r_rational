Have only watched the first episode yet, but it seems like quite an interesting concept. There seem to be additional rules in that universe that the characters take intelligent advantage of.

What's your take?


** I'd say it's rational adjacent. It makes some efforts in that direction, it has some moments that people in this sub would likely love, but I wouldn't call it actually rational. More like a halfway point between rational and shonen. Fully awesome, though.

** Don't know about the non-Brotherhood version, but the manga that Brotherhood is based on is fairly close. There weren't any "plot demands it" that I can remember, the antagonists have somewhat unique beliefs and values, characters use intelligent solutions to problems, the world... sort of has consistent rules?

The magic is really the main bit of fuzziness to be honest, it's sometimes well developed but there's no real explanation given as to why some alchemists are experts in some things versus others. Sometimes the reason for an alchemical secret is revealed, but often times it's not, and you're just left thinking "Well I guess he just had a secret rare formula/diagram."

That aside though, it's pretty fantastic and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for new anime.

**** Yes, but mostly because it's more rigid.

In Harry Potter for the most part you have spells that do the same thing every time you cast them. Some get stronger based on your emotion or "energy" you put into them, but once you know what a spell does you can guess how it will be used in any given circumstance.

(The exception to this is wandless/wordless magic, which doesn't play any major part in the story and is mostly spectacle)

In FMA the the magic, alchemy, is much more freeform. The basic laws are understandable, like you can only change matter's form, equivalent exchange, etc, but somewhere between drawing the circle/clapping the hands and the finished product there's a black box we're never privy to, and the enemies often have a wide range of abilities unknown to the protagonists, so it's much easier to be surprised by what someone does with alchemy.

***** Pinging [[/u/ywecur][u/ywecur]] because this is my favorite tv show of all time and there's no way I'm not going to take the opportunity to talk about to someone who asks.

I completely agree with you about how great FMA: Brotherhood is, but not on what keeps it from being perfectly rational. I don't think the black box nature of alchemy is the biggest "rational sin" of the magic system. The show doesn't go into detail about how to draw transmutation circles because it wants to spend time on things that are more important to the plot and themes, it would've just been additional exposition. For me, the biggest issue with alchemy is that the definition of human transmutation seems rather inconsistent.

Early on, it seems like it just means trying to resurrect the dead and we see alchemy used to alter human bodies. However, we later see Ed use human transmutation on himself to escape Greed and there's a tense scene in the final battle where the homunculi injure Riza to try and force Mustang to perform human transmutation to stop her from bleeding out. Maybe it's made more clear in the manga, but Brotherhood did not explain the commonality between these plot points.

The only other inconsistency I noticed, though it bothers me much less and is more of a central conceit of the plot that can't be rectified, is that the alchemy that can bind souls to suits of armor is literally the only "spell" that isn't based around manipulating matter. From a distance, it seems like an odd exception to an otherwise thematically consistent magic system and was presumably included just so Al could be a more interesting character. Thankfully, it worked.

****** Yeah, I just figured "human transmutation" meant anything to do with the "soul," such as reviving someone from the dead (rather than just recreating their body) or binding Al to the armor. Both of those are the thing which caused the boys to see Truth, so I figured transmuting parts of bodies is just treated as any other matter.

It did bother me that the idea of Al being a spirit tied to armor isn't explored more, though.

****** Souls exist in that world.

If blood is connected to the soul, and souls interact with other nearby bodies shortly after death, the blood seal fits.

I believe the philosopher's stone rituals also use blood to transmute and that's the only other thing that uses souls. Its consistent, just no extra examples.

***** Isn't the magic in HPMOR as much of a black box though? What's the difference between drawing a circle to create magic and waving a wand and creating it? From what I've seen it's the same circles that do the same thing, no? So it should be just like HPMOR.

****** In Alchemy the circles are full of all sorts of writing that we don't ever learn about, presumably some formula or runes that tell the magic what to do. In that sense it's like wand waving, but we don't actually see the runes, so we don't actually know what a spell will do ahead of time, or how flexible it is. Also when they just clap their hands together to do alchemy, or snap their fingers if Mustang, they're shaping what the magic does entirely with their mind: we have no idea what they're about to do, other than some basic contextual clues.

How do they aim the magic, if it needs to be aimed? How much distance can it cover? What shape will the construct be in? What chemical composition, exactly? All that is decided apparently in their heads, and is variable.

In HPMOR, the blackbox is entirely on the back end. We have no idea WHY magic works the way it does, but we know exactly HOW it works: make the right wand movement, say the right words, get the predictable effect.

If HPMOR was more like FMA's magic, spells wouldn't use incantations at all. They would just wave their wands in some arcane and mysterious way and different effects would come out, the way we sometimes see advanced magic users do it.

********* Yes. I always assumed there was a mental component. I can't recall that ever being mentioned, but maybe it's just such a common element to magic systems that aren't wholey learned, where there is some crucial factor that you either have or don't have, that my brain just pattern-matched away the gap.

** No because the defeat and demise of almost all the antagonists is based on them making a continuous chain of stupid\ineffective decisions.

The beginnig arcs were pretty decent in this regard because at that point the author was just gradually unveiling the setting, and the "villains" didn't have to be muzzled yet.

But afterwards the main characters had to start winning somehow against incredible odds, and so the antagonists became bumbling caricatures of their previously depicted selves.

Also No because the most basic premise of the story, the idea of equal exchange, is flawed with "humanity bias". Just because we-the-humans see some things as having roughly similar values doesn't mean the objective universe would have the same notions.

This second point can be ameliorated somewhat by saying that magic\"alchemy" itself comes from a conscious, subjective entity. But that would be a rather cliche handwave explanation for problems like this.

** I think a rational Edward, at least at the point when he understands what Sloth is, would probably just build Al a hommunculus body and anchor his soul to that instead of the armor. Tattooing the blood seal onto the thing of course
