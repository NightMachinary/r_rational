** Just a FYI, you have quite a few typos, problems with capitalization being the foremost among them. I can't speak for everyone, but for me it makes the story less appealing.

I've read the first chapter, and here are some thoughts:

- From a storytelling perspective, it's really annoying when you use "/they/" instead of stating who "they" are. It's something I've only seen in manga, and I have to assume it's a cultural thing, because it doesn't really work in English.

- Proofreading is a must. A character changes the spelling of their name several times throughout the chapter.

- When you start dialogue following an action, it's always capitalized (like a new sentence). E.g.

  - He looked at me blankly "what are you talking about?" /vs./ He looked at me blankly. "What are you talking about?"
  - There are more rules, I would suggest reading up on them since it might help clear a few things up. [[https://firstmanuscript.com/format-dialogue/][Here's]] a site that gives some examples.

For some quick and easy corrections, I would suggest just copying your text into Word. I tried it, and it highlighted some grammatical mistakes.

*** Wow, I was previously relying on Microsoft Word to pick out the typos for me, I didn't realise just how bad it was. Taking everything you've said into account I've gone over and fixed all the writing that's up on the site to the best of my ability and will continue doing that for future content.

for the 'they vs saying who they are' part, is it fine to use 'they' or he and she as a substitute to prevent repetition? from what I can see I only use they after mentioning them once, I didn't want to continuously refer to them by their names in every line, is this the wrong way to go about it?

or I also use 'they' in the context of 'unnamed characters'

for example :

Outside of the entrance of the school, there were several groups of students hanging out, the most notable of them was a group of 12 boys and 5 girls, they were all wearing matching yellow jackets symbolising that they all belonged to the same gang.

I knew them, they were a part of the most powerful gang in the school, CHN12, a group of Chinese school thugs that had ties to the Chinese triad crime syndicate based in New York, these guys were well known for their notoriety.

am I good to use 'they' here?

Thanks very much for pointing out the problems with my writing, if you decide to continue reading and find that there are more problems with my writing please let me know, I'm always trying to improve!

**** The thing with pronouns like "they" is that they have to refer to something. They are substitutes for nouns who are already named or understood in the context they are used.

In that case it would be fine because you already say "a group of 12 boys and 5 girls" so we can identify "them." The problem is that in you story you don't do that. It just feels like you're trying to keep something a mystery that isn't and shouldn't be a mystery in the first place.

For example,

#+begin_quote
  He walked up to me and said, "Give it to me."

  He walked up to me while I was on my phone and said, "Give it to me."
#+end_quote

Without indicating what "it" was it's confusing. But adding the object "it" is referring to clears that up.

In your case, you start out with:

#+begin_quote
  I have an ambivalent relationship with this place, I've lived here my whole life, although it's been hard, I was able to meet /them/. No matter how hard it gets I can't bring myself to completely hate it.

  A large gust of cold wind had woken me from my stupor, and it was getting late, /they/ had probably returned home already. I should get back before I ended up worrying /them/.
#+end_quote

First off is the emphasis using italics. In this case there's no real reason you should use it here. There are ways you can use italics (see [[https://www.ignitedinkwriting.com/ignite-your-ink-blog-for-writers/using-italics/2017][here]]), but this isn't one of them IMO.

Second, "they/them" have never been identified. I would put it a bit differently, like this:

#+begin_quote
  I have an ambivalent relationship with this place, I've lived here my whole life, although it's been hard, I was able to meet *Arielle and Bryan, my two best friends and roommates*. No matter how hard it gets I can't bring myself to completely hate it. (bolding just for highlighting)
#+end_quote

You can tweak it a bit, but the point is to specify who "they" are first. This way, you can use they/them because we know who you are talking about.

***** Ok, I've gotten that part down.

I see, I was trying to make my writing a little more 'complex' by keeping who they are a mystery until they were revealed, as a way to further emphasise their importance?

But it seems like I went about it completely in the wrong way, and made it annoying instead, I'll edit that part then.

thanks again.

****** Do you enjoy that in stories?

Personally, a lot of things done for this sort of reason just feel anoying for me such as; - something in the future and then continuing the story in the past - unclear refferences, not tagging perspective changes, etc - a historical recounting at the start of chapter on its events or for flavour. - any exerpt for world building or flavor not part of the story. - other perspectives over the same event (i dont want to read about an event twice) - lack of timeskips (i like timeskips and summaries of events) I could probably think of more but that's it for now

#+begin_quote
  Abhorrence is a planned to be long-running web serial which is set in a modern-day world and follows the life of Callum, an intelligent and hardworking 15-year-old orphan growing up with no family, only his two friends Bryan and Arielle, struggling to survive day to day life in a cruel world.

  As a result of his awakening, Callum is thrown into a more dark and complex world scene full of moral ambiguity, he tries to stay rational and level headed on the choices he makes and how he faces the new challenges thrown at him as to not stray from the â€˜right path'.

  The side characters have their own unique personalities, goals, and roles they play beside their relationships to the main character. They are generally unhappy, and there are no winners in the story.

  How will Callum continue living in a world that abhorrently rejects him?

I'd much rather have a more welcoming attitude toward authors promoting themselves, even at the risk of having works promoted here that are not rigorously rational in nature. If this hypothetical problem ever rears its head, I will happily re-examine the need for gatekeepers.

Until then, we have a different problem of alienating and sapping creative energy of budding authors who very likely are fans of rationalism. They're here, after all.

******** Then we have a difference in opinion. My preference is for the subreddit to actually serve its purported genre. We already have enough trouble defining rational fiction without throwing a filter to the winds.

Nobody is "alienating or sapping creative energy of budding authors" by telling them not to self promote here if their story doesn't fit the sub. That's dramatic demagoguery. They can self promote in the many other subreddits or talk about their story in the weekly recommendation/open threads or Discord.

Content moderation is an essential part of a subreddit's identity. Though the mods are already quite lenient from what I can tell.

Your baseline position in these comments is that authors aren't welcome here, are spammers, and are irrelevant to the subreddit.

If you look elsewhere on this thread, you'll see others asking for the author to provide rational context without the attitude of exclusivity. It's fine to insist on rationalist discussion - just try not to imply an author doesn't belong here until they prove otherwise.

Editing to add: The context of this entire discussion is important and bears some thought. If your comments were made in a Friday thread about anything, they'd simply be taken at face value. The fact is, however, that the comments were replies to an author offering up a work for review by the users here. What you wrote is implicitly about that author and their work.

************ Your interpretation is absurd. I have no idea where you're getting that I'm saying authors aren't welcome, are spammers or irrelevant. I made a simple if then statement: if you're going to self promote, at least explain why your story is relevant to the sub. My baseline position is that people shouldn't promote stories that have no relevance to the sub or make low effort posts with just a link and plea for readers. I thought that was obvious.

You paint my attitude of exclusivity as a negative, but that's exactly what the sub is for: filtering for rational stories. I don't see any need to tiptoe around the point. Also, no I didn't insist on rational*ist* discussion or imply the /author/ doesn't belong here, just that they defend their /story's/ appropriateness.

*************** Except when the argument is about the subjective interpretation of a comment. Then what people feel from that is all that matters.

But I feel this is kinda getting too heated, I (and I would assume the others commenting) don't really think you did anything wrong, as you say your comment is completely valid from a logical stand-point (Although I actually wouldn't mind more low-effort posts on this subreddit but that's neither here nor there).

I just wanted to argue that yes, your comment does feel a bit like a "piss off" in context even if it doesn't literally say that (And the fact that others think the same IS important because this is purely subjective.), and yes, this WOULD discourage many writers. Whether they *should* be discouraged or not or whether they wouldn't survive long anyway is irrelevant.

Constructive criticism without any sugar-coating has the same effect as above, but I still think its a good thing, and I would think most people do too. It doesn't change that its discouraging to many people and if not given carefully can be subjectively taken as a dismissal/condemnation.

My goal isn't for you to change your comment, I just wanted to point out that your subjective experience in this case is not shared by at least the few people I know/have seen which would take this the wrong way.

**************** There are two arguments here which are getting mixed up. One is that we shouldn't gatekeep irrational stories. Two is any gatekeeping alienates or discourages authors. I've already made my position clear on the first. As for the second, I haven't been disputing whether someone can see my comment in an aggressive light or be discouraged by it, because I don't care to sanitize the optics of my comment to make it politically correct to every sensitive person who could be discouraged by such a plain request. What I am disputing is the other poster's statement that my baseline position is hostile towards authors in general, which isn't supported by anything I wrote. Looking through the discussion, it's probably because they're focusing on one of my sentences in particular (This subreddit isn't for spamming self promotion just to get more readers) while overlooking the surrounding context. If you ignore everything else I said, then sure I can see how that sentence would be an indiscriminate "piss off".
