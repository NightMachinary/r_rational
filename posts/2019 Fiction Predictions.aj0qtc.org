Seeing as it's the season for predictions I thought it would be fun to make a few regarding the big three [[/r/rational][r/rational]] stories: Worth The Candle, A Practical Guide to Evil & Mother of Learning. Feel free to add your own and/or use my predictions as a template. I'm not as involved in Mother of Learning as a lot of the sub so I likely missed some good ideas for predictions there. I titled the thread '2019' but the predictions aren't time sensitive because I suspect some won't be answered this year. I did limit PGtE predictions to Book 5 though as I think the end of the series as a whole will be well into next year.

There's MAJOR SPOILERS for each of the three aforementioned stories.

*WTC*

- WTC will be completed during 2019: 40%

- Amaryllis and Joon will end up together: 75%

- Fenn will be brought back to life: 60%

- Juniper will turn into Looniper (level obsessed Juniper) again: 25%

- Uther intentionally created or became Fel Seed: 20%

- Uther is Fel Seed: 10%

- Juniper will revisit Earth: 30%

- Amaryllis is a clone of Dahlia: 30%

- The water mage is Juniper's mom: 60%

- Earth is a simulation: 40%

- Shia Labeouf will be summoned: 30%

- The 'A Key For Seven Locks' Achievement will be higher than 1/7 by stories end: 70%

- The 'A Key For Seven Locks' Achievement will be higher than 2/7 by stories end: 15%

- We will see Woodworking 100 by stories end: 45%

- Bethel will attempt to murder Uther: 35%

*PGtE*

- Malicia will survive Book 5: 40%

- Saint of Swords will survive Book 5: 35%

- Black will survive Book 5: 75%

- The Tyrant will survive Book 5: 55%

- Pilgrim will survive Book 5: 70%

- One of the Woe (Akua not included) die in Book 5: 35%

- Akua will betray the Woe in Book 5: 30%

- Akua will heroically sacrifice herself in Book 5: 30%

- Cordelia Hasenbach will be First Prince by the end of Book 5: 40%

- Procer as a nation will exist by the end of Book 5: 80%

- Black becomes Dread Emperor by the end of Book 5: 20%

- Black will /attempt/ to remove Malicia as Dread Empress by the end of Book 5: 40%

*MoL*

- MoL will be completed during 2019: 30%

- QLich will survive until the end: 85%

- Silverlake will work with QLich and/or Red Robe: 70%

- The primordial will be released: 15%

(I found myself using a lot of doylist reasoning for these predictions.)

*** In the comment section on Chapter 93 on Patreon the author said in reference to an earlier comment of his apparently, "I said there's 8-10 chapters left. So... the end will come far later than January, I'm afraid."

Also average may be more than 3 weeks, considering he has delayed most of the recent chapters by a week.

** Re: WtC completion in 2019

The [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][word count document is here]]. Average words per day (WPD) since February 7th, 2018 was 1085. There are 342 days until December 31st, 2019. Assuming historical rates of writing, that means that by December 31st, 2019, and assuming that it doesn't end, /Worth the Candle/ would be another 392,000 words longer than it is today.

For this, we need two probabilities:

- How likely is it that writing on /Worth the Candle/ will exceed an average of 1085 WPD?
- How likely is it that there are more than 392,000 words until the end of /Worth the Candle/?

I suppose two different people could have very different answers to both of those questions, and come to the same conclusions about end date, i.e. someone thinks writing will go really slow, but also thinks that the end is relatively close, and someone else who thinks the writing will go fast, but that there's a lot of ground to cover before the end.

For my own prediction, the only ones that I'll be making:

- 80% chance that work on /Worth the Candle/ will continue at a rate of roughly 1085 WPD until completion
- 70% chance that there are less than 392,000 words until the end of /Worth the Candle/ (21,000 of these are already written for the next update, and ~15,000 are already written for future updates)

**** Depends on the speculation. Sometimes it's a feeling of relief, because people noticed the things that they were meant to notice, and that I had worried were either too obvious or two subtle. Sometimes there are good ideas, which I wish that I'd thought of but don't have room for, or which are contradicted by the text in a few places.

/Sometimes/ though, it's speculation about things that I know won't come to pass, and I always feel a little guilty about not being able to deliver on things that people want to happen, because I'm not writing quite the story that they want, I'm writing the story that /I/ want.

I don't think guilt is the right emotion there! People like speculating on possibilities in fictional worlds, but that doesn't mean they are disappointed when something else comes to happen. If all speculation comes true, the story is too predictable :P

[[/u/Kuiper]] had a great comment about exactly that, which you've probably seen, but linking it anyway: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9jugqw/what_storytelling_techniques_have_you_learnt_from/e6uj7ld/]]

** My leanings so far:

*PGtE*

- Malicia will survive Book 5: No

- Saint of Swords will survive Book 5: No, and I think the Pilgrim will finish her

- Black will survive Book 5: inclined to say No, but...

- The Tyrant will survive Book 5: yes, and by exploiting narrative no less

- Pilgrim will survive Book 5: No

- One of the Woe (Akua not included) die in Book 5: yes, in fact I think 2 of them will die

- Akua will betray the Woe in Book 5: yes, but as part of a bigger double-cross, because come on it's Akua

- Akua will heroically sacrifice herself in Book 5: No, she'll move unto something else entirely

- Cordelia Hasenbach will be First Prince by the end of Book 5: yes

- Procer as a nation will exist by the end of Book 5: yes, it'll split north/south despite Cordelia's resolve

- Black becomes Dread Emperor by the end of Book 5: No

- Black will attempt to remove Malicia as Dread Empress by the end of Book 5: yes

Feel free to add a column for yourself, or add more rows with more predictions. I populated it with the predictions in the OP and added a few 'Red Robe is ...' entries.

--------------

My own take:

I haven't read PGtE, but for WtC I generally think joon will probably end up with amaryllis, uther is not fel seed, and both earth and aerb are simulations. (I also think that the DM has 'read-only' access to earth and runs aerb as a garage hacker project.)

Don't really have any idea where MoL is going, though, except I think

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

is kind of low, given nobody's statements about how many chapters are left.

***** Good question! I did not really think about giving a single reasonable probability distribution for a combination of events, just that I minimise the cross-entropy loss on each prediction. (That is the reason there are no 0 or 1s in there.) That said, maybe normalising the probabilities in this case would have been correct, I am not sure how the math works out.

** The way these headers are set up, a lot of people are going to skim down into the bulleted lists pretty quickly, probably without seeing the disclaimer about spoilers at the start, so maybe it would be better to /not/ write the titles in abbreviated form so people have an actual chance of knowing what they're looking at before they get too deep into it
