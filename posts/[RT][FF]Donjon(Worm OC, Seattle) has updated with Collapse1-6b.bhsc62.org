** I'm still liking the story, but this one was a little hard to read. I think it's because the PRT meeting never seems to settle down--it's a constant barrage of witty banter, angry outbursts, parenthetical asides and whiplash-inducing changes in tone.

For instance, we're in the middle of friendly introductions. Carmilla and Gasconade (yay Gasconade!) have a heartwarming handshake, then as soon as she sits down Bullrush just goes to town on her. We're obviously expecting Gasconade's power to take effect (which Carmilla should also be expecting), so there are a few moments of in-world confusion that the reader doesn't share, making it basically dead space while we return to the conversation at hand--which is immediately taken over by Presto, then vanishes without a trace when Carmen offers a tepid apology for what was realistically a pretty impulsive and dangerous thing to do.

A /lot/ goes on in those few paragraphs, but none of it seems to have any impact on the outcome of the conversation. Makes for kind of a dizzying read with little payoff.
