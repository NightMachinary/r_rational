** Wait for someone extremely rich and powerful to suffer a life-threatening accident, spam revives at them till it takes. With any luck it'll be explained away as 'oh they just died on the operating table for a few seconds'.

Intelligence is nice in a minion, but hilarious amounts of money and power are more vital for such an undertaking. Political leaders are nice, but democracy ensures you're paying for only a few years of actual use, and you can't really have them do much because in most cases their party can just have a vote of no confidence.

Next step, using my money and power to kill someone who has /all/ the blackmail material, like the director of the NSA. This time have some fancy detectors pointed at me (and if possible him/her) while reviving. I mean, I /probably/ can't recreate this phenomena, but on the off-chance I can then It's worth investing the resources.

At that point though I kinda peter out. There is no one person sufficiently intelligent or rich to conquer the world. Unless there is and they're competent enough that we don't know about it. Spend some resources to find out who the next most powerful or useful person on the planet is. Chinese intelligence head? Really rich dude? If possible use it on myself? Take em over anyway.

Attempt to blackmail all of the congressmen and senators and news agencies and what have you to slowly twist the world in the direction I want it twisted. Try to have people under my command be pulling all of the strings. That's about as far as I get though. I can influence the world and maybe turn it a little bit into what I consider a better place, but conquering it is unlikely.

Article V of the Constitution prescribes how an amendment can become a part of the Constitution. While there are two ways, only one has ever been used. All 27 Amendments have been ratified after two-thirds of the House and Senate approve of the proposal and send it to the states for a vote. Then, three-fourths of the states must affirm the proposed Amendment.

The other method of passing an amendment requires a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States. That Convention can propose as many amendments as it deems necessary. Those amendments must be approved by three-fourths of the states.

The actual wording of Article V is: “The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.”

I'm just wildly guessing. By Bayes' law, even a statement you know nothing about has some subjective probability of being true. 1% seems like a plausible number based on shallow guesswork. Something like:

** Three people raised from the dead to conquer the world.

I will assume that they will be capable of surviving for more than a short time. My power will give them the ability to live for many years.

The first thing is going to be money. We need someone who will have access to money, even if they have died and lost it. One of the Saudi princes would do. Resurrect them shortly after their death, before the transferal of power has occurred.

Firstly, they will have lots of money because of the simple fact that they are alive. Secondly, they just rose from the dead. This would definitely classify as a miracle to religious true believers, especially if they were dead for long enough that there was absolutely no doubt that he was dead. Even better if he was embalmed. (I don't know Islamic burial rites.)

I now practically own at least half of the religious population of the Middle East, and substantial blocks of Muslim true believers elsewhere. I immediately establish a Caliphate in the Saudi Prince's name.

Next up, Mahatma Ganhdi. Another miraculous resurrection. Cult of personality in India, funded by Saudi Arabian money.

And finally, George Washington. There's genetic material of his still around to prove it's him. There's a pretty damn good chance that the US public would be rather vocal about getting him back in the President's seat, and damn the constitution.

The Saudi Prince's money would go through Gandhi to fund George's efforts to get the 22nd amendment repealed.

Between the Caliphate in the Middle East, Gandhi in India, and the enthralled Americans, I now have secondhand control of about a fifth of the world population and a rather substantial percentage of global GDP.

That's a good start.

  3. John Paul II - again, his death was extremely verifiable, so he'll have a massive religious following after his resurrection.

Anyway, I believe that if Jesus was raised with wounds in his hands and feet and sides and I brought him to the Pope, we could probably convince him and others. Potentially if any holy artifacts are actually legit (blood of jesus/ shroud of turin, etc) there would be another avenue towards legitimacy.

As for Muhammed, I don't really know enough about him to make a guess but I would imagine there are ways. He did leave a major mark on that part of the world, after all, and probably knows some things that could be corroborated or explain some ancient texts, shrines, etc.

Dozens of people go to the holy land, turn crazy and become convinced they are Jesus every year. Barring him pulling actual miracles you'd have little more luck than they do.

** People vary way less in capability than in fame: the real treasure here is the fact that you're resurrecting famous people, which hints you want to get them elected into popular office. Abraham Lincoln/George Washington/Benjamin Franklin (maybe) would have a very good chance to be elected. Get Peter, Nevsky, or Catherine up in Russia. Have them forge radically close diplomatic relations. Try to wrangle China, which will feel threatened, into making a military move on India, where you may or may not have needed to install Bapu, then bring India into the alliance and crush China. If you can't get China to attack on its own, revive Mao and use him to attack. If you don't need him or Bapu, then you resurrect Mohammed.

I don't think you want to do Jesus because you don't have a way to verify his identity.

This is assuming the creation of an international coalition, turning into a world government asap, counts as conquering. If violent seizure of territory is the only option, then use your countries to create a very powerful space program with the aim of being able to drop giant rocks onto Earth, specifically on cities and power plants. There's not much they can do against this. There's no realistic way to avoid your territory then getting nuked, especially given the difficulty of destroying underground missile bunkers, but that's not a big issue because a seed population can rebound very quickly.
