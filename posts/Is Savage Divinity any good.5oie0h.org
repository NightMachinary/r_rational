** It was enjoyable, but there's absolutely no way I'd put it on the level of MoL or HPMOR (or even TGWP). It's far better than most of the Royal Road novels I've seen, though, and I did finish reading it.

** I read through Savage Divinity recently, and my 1 sentence review would be "I had trouble wanting to finish the story". It was right at the cusp of being interesting, but often was boring instead. The prose and writing for Savage Divinity is above average, and the world-building is merely average. The story tends too far into the Mary Sue trope though, with no serious negative events or outcomes for the protagonist. The characters in the story tend to be interesting and aren't one-dimensional, but this fails to overcome the weak story and plot. Overall:

- Prose: 4/5

- Plot: 2/5

- Characters: 4/5

- Worldbuilding: 3/5

** I like it. I usually get bored if a story's pacing is slow but it's OK here for me. The MC doesn't improve super quickly but there is a sense of progress and conflict in the story. I don't think it's as good or as addictive as mother of learning but it's still worth reading IMO.

** To me the writing felt about as more-ish as End Online, or How To Avoid Death. That's cool and I wish I could write like that, but the actual events and characters described just aren't very interesting.

***** That is why I wrote "almost nothing", I wanted to read more opinions.

And what's your deal anyway?so I submitted a new post, no one died.
