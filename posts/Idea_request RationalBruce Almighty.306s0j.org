I think that sort of premise is ideal for this subreddit, and could have been handled much better by the main character. Reminder: Bruce's omnipotence only applies to Buffalo, not to the whole world or universe.

What are your ideas/comments/feedback?

Bruce is quite selfish. The movie is his journey to a more altruistic person. Probably not going to happen with rational!Bruce.

** Here's the copout answer: Create Friendly AI

Some less cheap ones:

- Use omnipotence to find saintly people. Give them omnipotence that isn't limited to Buffalo
- Create safe, un-abusable general-constructor nanotech
- Build a beanstalk to geosynch
- Create the blueprints and all required scientific documentation for arbitrarily advanced technology, plus all the tech that would be necessary to achieve it. It would take a long time for people to master all of it and make use of it, but it shouldn't be more than a generation or three. By the end of that time humanity would effectively be gods through the power of science.
- Create full documentation on psychological / scientific methods of modifying the brain, but only to turn it into a brilliant, sane person. Make available.

** All the responses I've seen seem to be approaching this from the premise of "assume Perfectly Rational Being also becomes Omnipotent and Omnicient" and, even with the given constraints, that just sounds like a recipe for a rational circle-jerk, not an interesting or meaningful story.

For this premise to work, I think, you have to start with a flawed rationalist who, over the course of experimenting with his powers, discovers the flaws in himself. One possibility that jumps to mind, there is a, ah... /slight/ tendency for /certain/ rationalists to be a bit ... condescending, to anyone they perceive as less rational than themselves. So the character might start out focused entirely on trying to find ways to apply their omnipotence without violating free will, and largely overlook the full applications of omniscience as applied to people, namely, fully understanding others, what they want and why they want it, the full story of who they are and how they think and feel, both as subjective personal experience and objective truth.

Of course, there is also the little fact that this presumably-initially-atheist rationalist is confronted with a literal God, and presumably immortal souls and some sort of afterlife to go with it. It might well take him time to fully absorb this new information into his world view, and change his perception of life on earth which, in such a scenario, would in fact be a brief juvenile stage of life for an immortal being.

eh, bottom line, I can imagine good stories coming out of this premise, but I can imagine a lot more terrible and pointless ones.

** [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Fun_theory][Fun theory]] seems relevant. Utopia is easier said than done, even for an omnipotent god.

He'd need to expand control outside Buffalo. A utopia that tiny hardly matters at all. He could easily send jets full of supplies to the rest of the world, but there's a lot of stuff that needs to be done outside Buffalo.

Once you get to interplanetary stuff, omnipotence on an Earth city won't count for much. It will give him an edge for material science research. He could start a lab to research cheaper and more effective solar panels, to start work on a Dyson sphere. He could produce large amounts of them from just that city, but eventually he'll need to use what he has to start mining all the planets to build more. Then he'll need to work on starships to build Dyson spheres around other stars.

This utopia has teleportation and other magic.). That's 10k people per square kilometer, or 1.4 million people in 136 km^{2..}

Next, make the living spaces 10 feet high and stack them one on top of the other. Let's say that you get 1000 layers before you leave "Buffalo" at 10 000 feet up.

****** If he's allowed to alter geometry like that, then he can cheat a lot more. He can completely fill any volume with air, and ignore any gravitational effects this would have.

He could remove a point from Buffalo and warp the universe around it to grow it to infinite size, resulting in a wormhole to another universe that technically is inside of Buffalo. But it gets better. He doesn't have to stick to Euclidean geometry, and he can make the second universe have hyperbolic geometry instead. Locally, it behaves similar to Euclidean geometry, so small objects would work fine. However, on a large scale, the volume of a ball increases exponentially with the radius. If he gives everyone an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_triangle][ideal triangle]] to live on, he could fit everyone in the world within 31 triangles of the center.

I'd rule that that's too overpowered, and he can't increase the volume of Buffalo.

Moreover, let's bear in mind that a solar system sized volume of air has substantial mass -- more than our sun, for example. Packing that within a small room could result in some rather extraordinary gravitational effects.

Density of air at sea level = 1.225 kg/m^{3}\\
Mass of the sun = 1.989E30 kg\\
Volume of one cubic AU (radius of the earth's orbit) = 3.347929E33 m^{3}

For rough back of envelope purposes, we're talking 4000x the mass of the sun per cubic AU. If we were to look at something the size of the orbit of Pluto, it would be many of orders of magnitude greater.

One large problem to solve is identity tracking. If I can PAO myself to look like Nicholas Cage, how do you tell me from Nicholas Cage?

Another problem is law enforcement. What laws can you enforce on a population of level 60 wizard/sorcerer/archivists? Even if most of the dangerous spells are removed, it would be easy to escape into a private demiplane.

--------------

That's the standard and style of living I'm looking for. Non-Euclidean geometry to fit a large and growing population, universally available magic to give people their own lives, not dependent on my continued existence or one extremely powerful entity, that are still appreciably better than current reality.

Now there's the problem of relocating seven billion people to Buffalo, NY.

1. Create a demiplane that will fit the entire earth.
2. Create a fleet of utility airships -- invisible, permeable to matter, etc. Position them around the planet.
3. Have them duplicate all the non-human bits of the planet into the giant demiplane (except for the region within Buffalo that contains the demiplanes).
4. Have them teleport all humans into the corresponding positions in the giant demiplane on the cloned Earth.
5. Have them erase all hazardous materials from the surface of the earth and otherwise make it safe. No reason to leave trash around; keep the old Earth as a nature preserve.

Now the whole population of Earth is inside the Buffalo region, the old Earth isn't going to explode or melt down, and the new Earth is available for me to alter as necessary.

If that sort of power projection isn't possible, then I use my powers within Buffalo to create a giant airport and fleet of airships bringing anyone who wishes to Buffalo, free of charge. Perfectly normal airships, no divine power to keep them afloat or make them operate. I use my divine power to multitask enough to pilot them all, and I use divinely created satellites to communicate with them so I can pilot them remotely.

(Why airships rather than airplanes? Because they're more awesome. And I can land them with fewer facilities than an airplane.)

And if governments started imprisoning their populations, I'd have to deploy divinely created techno-kidnappers. Remove the problematic officials and bring them into my domain so I can give them a high quality life just like everyone else. It's kinder than assassination.
