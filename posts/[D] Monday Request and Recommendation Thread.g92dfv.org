Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I've been reading Enlightened Empire on royalroad for a while, and it updates again last week with a staggering 20 chapters. It's basically a transmigrator uplift story, but it has some positive points that make it unique.

*The Enjoyable:*

- The worldbuilding is very thorough and top notch. The world feels alive and consistent, and no matter where you go in the world the places are distinct and feel lived in. I had a few moments of straight up wonder when the main character describes the traditions and legends of their homeland. It's done with a quality that I don't see often in other webnovels.

- The main characters are for the most part well written. Of course, there are a few cardboard cutouts in the side characters and some of the antagonists are cartoonishly evil, but they have enough background to feel at home in the world they live in. Most of the main characters have depth to them.

- The technological uplift is done by drip feeding, with numerous, usually realistic setbacks along the way. The main character doesn't always have, say, the best methods to mass produce steel, or the best lathe to make a better lathe, and so on. Things take time to spread, and weapons technology takes time to develop. It's done in a way that feels realistic in the basically middle ages world that this takes place in. There is a big focus on logistics and bureaucracy, and ideas taking time to spread effectively, and that makes the story good imo.

*The Unenjoyable:*

- Hoo boy the politics. This story has a big focus on politics after the first quarter of the story. The politics can be enjoyable at times but most of the time it's straight up unenjoyable for me. Imagine xianxia esque politics, except it's /everywhere./ Every person prostrates themselves and ingratiates to their superiors while terrorizing those weaker than themselves. Plus there's a thing with controlling your emotions to retain face, but then somehow expressing them and shouting at times is acceptable, and slandering and counter-slandering -Just... Ugh. It's not my cup of tea, though it's competent for the most part.

- The pacing gets really slow after the first quarter, with a long period of little progress due to all the politics. That part I sometimes had to slog through, although now it's mostly evened out after the MC gets free of the situation.

Anyway, overall I recommend it if you're looking for another uplift story to read. There's a good backlog of about 650k words to read.

** I recently read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836728-the-rook][The Rook]] and found it pretty rational and enjoyable. The premise is that the protagonist wakes up with no memories then discovers that she's part of a superpowered secret organisation. There's exploration of the impact of memory on personality, rational problem-solving and a heap of interesting superpowers.

One of said powers was a person having one mind occupying multiple permanent bodies. It's a concept that I've never really seen explored much (outside shadow clone shenanigans), with the only other fiction I've read that exploits it being [[https://vi-fi.github.io/Cedric's%20Eight.html][Cedric's Eight]] (which was also quite enjoyable).

Any recommendations for things with that concept?

This is a fun and well-written fanfic of an anime, "Saga of Tanya the Evil", to which my recommendation does not extend.

Edit: in terms of rationality, I would argue that all characters in the fanfic truly act rationally, in the sense that seemingly all decisions conceivably result from their understanding of reality, which itself is based on reasonable (if wrong) interpretations of the evidence.

*** Be warned, this fic really focuses on the canon feature of Tanya misinterpreting situations, trying to sabotage herself to the point that she can finally chill out in a safe and secure position, but ends up wildly succeeding far beyond her expectations. Lots and lots of misunderstandings. And it can be fun to roll your eyes at this, but it can also get grating. I still had a fairly fun time, but I'm taking a bit of a break from it.

** Any recommendations on stories focused on the surgeon profession or something medical related (e.g. litrpg with system focused on being a better doctor)?

Recently reread Iryuu: Team Medical Dragon which is a pretty good manga about a brilliant surgeon and corruption in Japan's medical system. Not sure how rational it would be considered to be, but I'd probably say it is at least rational-adjacent. I will warn that it has a brief sex scene in the first chapter, but doesn't come up again in the rest of the manga.

** Request- Any stories where math theory is used in a prominent, meaningful way by the protagonist? So for example in Methods of Rationality, Harry is consistently using Bayesian statistics to update his views. Or in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_Zero_(story)][Divide by Zero]] by Ted Chiang, the entire story revolves around a theoretical mathematical concept. Greg Egan's works also have this to some degree.

Basically, any story in which more than foundational mathematics are used in meaningful ways; bonus points if it's statistics because that feels criminally underused.

Mary Robinette Kowal's Lady Astronaut books technically exactly fit your description, but almost certainly not in the way you actually mean - "math theory is used in a prominent, meaningful way by the protagonist" is pretty much half the first book, but the story is not about the maths and does not go into it.

**** Can only de-rec Lady Astronaut. For example I agree with [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2368358561?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1][this review on goodreads]].

I am also guessing we are more sensitive to plot holes here and despite the usual plothole that it is easier to build isolated biospheres on earth than on mars if you have the option, there are other really obvious plot holes. For example the protagonist somehow builds a (perhaps) accurate climate change model in the 1950s (I guess that is the math theory that OP wants?) (and more unbelievable is that people actually act based on the model predicting a catastrophe).

Same themes but different medium: I can really recommend "For All of Mankind" (Apple+). Other than a bit of orbital mechanics it doesn't have much math in it, though. The science is good (though it takes a back-seat behind the drama) and the cultural themes are handled with nuance.

I haven't read more than a summary of the book, but that's actually entirely believable. We knew about climate change in the 1950's - the basic physical principle was worked out in 1896 by Arrhenius, the first estimates at "a doubling in atmospheric CO2 will lead to mean temperature anomaly of X degrees" were made in 1955, and the first ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO2 started in 1958.

All of that work could have been shifted a decade or so if there were some massive pressing meteorological disaster, depending on how WWII went.

****** It's also how it's presented. She does the calculation in two evenings. She uses "Encyclopedias, almanacs, atlases and newspapers" as data sources. Then she gets a meeting with the president where the "calculations are on the chalkboard". The meteor hit the ocean. The model shows that the earth will cool by 70-100 degrees (no unit mentioned, I presume it's Fahrenheit) for several month, then by 2.2 degrees for 3-4 years, then it'll grow hotter and hotter within ~50 years because of the water vapor (feedback loop) from the Astroid making the earth uninhabitable.

Edit: Water vapor feedback is interesting and I found e.g. [[https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.441][[1]]] as review (in 2000). It was considered since the 1960s and Satellite observations seem to be important to confirm models. I guess the energy balance differential equation could be used in the 1950 to predict runaway water vapor feedback. Though there would be many unknowns...

******* That's a bit more of a stretch, because there wasn't really a lot of public research into the effects of individual events on the climate until like the 80's ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens][the explosion of Mt St Helens]] made people veeeeeery interested in that topic in 1980)

Again though, given a sufficiently large incentive, you could potentially do [[http://www.geo.umass.edu/faculty/bradley/bradley1988.pdf][the same math they did in 1988.]] Encyclopedias and newspapers would have had data on the explosion of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa][Krakatoa in 1883]], and almanacs would have had local temperature data in the years following. Alternatively, depending on her security clearance, she could have extrapolated from the work done on models of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter#Early_work][nuclear winter in the early 1950's]] - maybe both?

Given the time constraints I imagine she would have just drawn a straight line scaling the Krakatoa explosion to this meteor impact, which would have indicated a great deal of cooling. The rest of it, eh who knows - climate models are really hard, because there's always some variable you forgot to account for. She just needed to convince the POTUS of an existential threat.

Edit: though I do kinda agree - if none of this stuff is mentioned in the book, then I can see how it would feel like a handwave / cop-out.

**** The Arithmancer is basically the opposite of using math in a meaningful way. The applications of the mathematics are surface level at best.

It also perpetuates the idea that doing arithmetic quickly = mathematical ability, which is not only plain wrong, but also discourages people from seeking a deeper understanding of the subject (How many mathematicians have heard "You study math? Wow, I hated that in school"?)

** There's a couple of really great dungeon core-ish stories going on right now:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31096/dungeon-pearl][Dungeon Pearl]]: fairly standard Isekai as a fantasy dungeon core setup, but the MC experiments with his abilities and prioritizes projects in a rational manner (or at least as rational as he can be, given that his human ADD combined with dungeon core instincts make it hard to focus). One thing that stood out to me is that the MC's experiments often fail or only partially succeed, and in believable ways. Also has some slight rationalist themes, because the MC has to do some introspection to figure out how his thinking has changed since the whole Isekai thing.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31685/the-core-of-a-factory][The Core of a Factory]]: another entry in the "tech dungeon core" subgenre, in this one the MC is a self-aware machine intelligence who opens up a sort of system thanks to "owning" enough land. This story is a lot more rationalist and transhuman than the other entries in the subgenre I've run in to (specifically Bunker Core and The Laboratory), with the AI having a fairly well defined utility function and not being either a doormat for humans or senselessly hostile.

Edit: now that I'm not on my phone, here's some non-dungeon-core stories:

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085MT4QWR][Savage Cultivator]]: a light and short read. The setting is fairly rational, the main character is as well (at least, within his capabilities - he starts the book out at 12 years old and doesn't advance much from there, socially speaking). Very similar to Dungeon Pearl, actually, in that a lot of the book is "here's an entirely new magical context for you, figure it out" - though in this case the MC didn't get isekai'd, rather all the Qi turned into deadly poison all of a sudden.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29996/the-power-of-ten-sama-rantha/][The Power of Ten: Sama Ratha]]: I am super conflicted about this story. I have a lot of thoughts about it.

On the one hand, it really feels like it scratches that munchkiny optimization spot.

On the other hand, most of the fun of these sorts of stories (like say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & Nat 20]] or [[https://www.amazon.com/Two-Year-Emperor-Deor-War-ebook/dp/B011DQOT74][2YE]]) is seeing the fun rules-as-written-but-in-reality interpretations the author has, and following along with the munchkinly optimization.

Power of Ten is not a system you recognize. It's kinda like [[https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/97252/what-is-e6-why-would-i-use-it][E6]] - based on D&D 3ish, but you cap out at level 10. Oh, and also, once you hit level 3 or so, instead of gaining level 4 you can /basically gestalt another class onto your previous class/. And you can do this forever, until you run out of classes to combine, with no XP penalty. And also there's a bunch of new weapon enchantments, that basically let you treat your +X bonuses as something to be allocated. And also there's a bunch of feats that I wasn't able to find in any splatbooks but see *really* heavy use, because they're fairly overpowered. /And then the WH40k Warp shows up/. There's no way to follow along because you haven't spent decades playing this particular homebrew system, and there's no way to know if any particular piece of munchkinry is some "rules as written are crazy ha ha" thing or just the way it's supposed to be.

Back to the first hand though: the combat is really well written, it's dynamic and fairly visceral and characters make good use of their powers and abilities. The standard "reborn in a magic world" trope is deftly handled - Sama Ratha spends her (inevitably boring) childhood years trapped in a looping nightmare full of combat, and then eventually the story splits and starts alternating nightmare chapters with post-nightmare chapters (and later, what her fellow isekai-ers are doing) and it all works a lot better than those stories that are full of four-year-olds doing push-ups.

But on the other hand, all of the isekai characters /read exactly the same/. It's like they've all optimized their personalities to the point where they're basically the same person, but wearing different costumes. And they're all continually super smug at the NPC-ish people. And also somehow the isekai cadre are only people who are able to actually optimize and find synergy in their builds, despite every option they take being available to everyone. And then the book gets in to D&D Good vs Evil and it gets pretty creepy but also really dumb.

I think what broke it for me is the author's completely inability to use "then" and "than" correctly. It's a minor thing but I don't think I spotted a single /correct/ usage of those words in the 150ish chapters I read.

***** Honestly same. I only tenuously keep up with it nowadays. It started off being fun political maneuvers (~100 chapters ago) and slowly got more and more stuck in the same damn place. I think the last 10 chapters have covered a grand total of 1 day.

But I would say it's worth reading at least the first half, maybe a bit more. Some of the twists and trope subversions are well done, and the characters are pretty good overall, except for the obvious caricatures.

Anyone have a story with a 'dumb' rationalist? Rationalism dosen't require that you be well versed in moral or ethical theory, only that you operate on the information you do have to the best of your ability.

** So, as I promised in last week's thread, I'm doing a weekly read-along "review" of Luminosity, a great Twilight fan fiction that, much like 50 shades, really should be given a chance to stand apart from its humble inspiration.

So here we go, [[/u/weerdo5255]] , hope you can participate like you promised! And of course other interlocutors most welcome :)

--------------

So, I just finished chapter 6 (of 29) last night. So it'll take about two months for me to read the whole thing: strap in, cats and kittens!

Spoilers below.

--------------

My main criticism of Luminosity as a romance novel was that the vampire romances are magical and immutable, and that's definitely the case, but I forgot that back when Bella is human she goes through a whole lot of stuff to do with her relationships and those of people around her.

In particular, she:

- Identifies someone has a crush on her and tries to manipulate him and another friend of hers to get together (review: I've never done anything like this, but it's presented as sound and logical and she has no illusions that they're going to get married)

- Is carefully considering how she feels about Edward and the whole "forced eternal love" thing, however, she is, quite rightly growing resigned to the fact that she has no control over it, and if she's wanting to be immortal (stated early as one of her goals), she's going to have to give up to it.

- There's a great part in I believe chapter 6 (maybe 5) where she talks about how much power she has over Edward because of his magical "falling in love with her" thing, which was really cool.

So it's some interesting/good stuff about early relationships, but my criticism of it as a good example of romance is that it is lacking some features:

- Bella is shown to be very carefully calculating whether she wants to be attracted to Edward on some level; for me, a more "pure" romance story would have her being attracted to him and acting to determine how to act based on that. Writing it out, perhaps /that's the point/, perhaps she's meant to be carefully calculating whether she wants to like this guy, but... I don't know, I feel like what I /want/ is for her to be attracted to him and not be able to control that and try to work through all the pros and cons of that, whereas she seems able to be detached enough not to be affected by it. The conversation where Edward told his life story to her was a really good addition, though, as it made me feel like she might actually like him as a person, though understandably it was a bit annoying that it was more of a "tell, don't show" situation than I'd like.

- For me the main work in romantic relationships is /maintaining them/. Having fights. Making concessions. Growing and changing as a person thanks to your partner(s) advice/support and helping them grow and change. I've not seen any of that yet (but we're still early in the story so I wouldn't expect it). I'm going to keep an eye out.

--------------

Rationalist bona fides:

Something I didn't notice Bella did, that I think I need as a lesson in my life right now, is when she's mad she asks herself "is what I'm mad about stopping me from getting what I want?". I found myself asking myself that the other day when I was angry about something, and it was good.

*** Aye, I'm here!

I don't really disagree with the way you've gone about analyzing Bella and her relationship with Edward. The firs time through, and on subsequent reads I'm not sure if she's supposed to come off as Sociopathic or not.

She operates for the most part rationally, but like you stated she's comfortable enough in her understanding to manipulate others to achieve her own goals. I'm a few chapters behind on the re-read, but as I recall she does not ever utilize the relationship with Edward in a selfish fashion.

Or well, beyond establishment of a relationship with romantic undertones and immortality right off the bat.

I would tend to agree with the assessment that Edwards life story right off the bat is a little hamfisted, but from his perspective it is a marginally intelligent thing to do. He's already laid out the facts that he is a vampire, in utter love with Bella, and reluctant to make her immortal.

He thinks he's a Monster (which he is), he has no control over his infatuation, and the morality of his generation is still a factor in his actions. Attempting to contextualize his extraordinary claims is warranted.

As for the actual romance, meh. Even in this story it's not a very well written one in terms of actual courtship. One side is already committed no matter what, and that destroys most of the usual back and forth needed for relationship growth. Edwards just capitulates to Bella after token refusals, and or a teenage angst session.

It's likely on my mind due to the horrid looking movie coming out but the last good romance I came across with the things you're looking for would be this nice collection of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/17774][Artemis Fowl Stories.]] Particularly [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/382799/chapters/626026][In Another's Eyes]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/389481/chapters/638697][Fowl Ties.]] wouldn't recommend jumping into these cold as they are towards the end of this AU but relationship buildup is rife throughout the universe. Although In Another's eyes elevates two background characters to the forefront, so maybe..

Yeah, I think this is why I object when people point to Luminosity as an example of rational romance; it's got romance /in/ it, but the rationality is about all the Vampires Fighting Each Other type of stuff, and that is very cool. The romance is just background, even though it starts off so focussed.
