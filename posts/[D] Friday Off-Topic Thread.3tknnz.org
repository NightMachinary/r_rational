Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

****** Any conceivable mathematical structure containing computation power equal or greater to that which is required to compute our universe's physics (Turing or hyper-Turing) must be considered a possible simulator. The only prior you /might/ be able to induce over that is Solomonoff's or a hyper-Turing equivalent. The only evidence we have is anthropic.

In Tegmark-IV metaphysics, all possible simulators are actual, and without outside interference, indistinguishable. I don't believe this is a trap for inaction or an unresolvable utility function, but it is interesting to think about.

The simulation argument you're referring to is a (at least partially) wishful resolution to an anthropic problem. Why was the observer (the solipsistic 'I') sampled at the early stages of human history? One option is the Doomsday Argument; that it is not the early stages of humanity and the sample is typical of the distribution. An alternative is that the atypicality has been selected for/is illusory and that the observer sampled is actually at a typical point in a greater obscured distribution.

This might even be probable, but Tegmark would imply a simulator above that universe just as it would imply above this universe. The anthropic probabilities might change in the transition, but again, I'm not even sure what prior you would apply to Tegmark-type frameworks, if any are even applicable.

The info virus has me. I never should have read The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover for the twentieth time.

EDIT: I believe the point of TFUMMC may have been that there is no such thing as a 'real' universe, a 'bottom-level' in the Tegmark-IV multiverse. In a finite hierarchy of simulations, a bottom level is unprovable, only falsifiable by observing a parent universe through ascension (and this is relative to the observer). Since the outside context is entirely independent of the inside, you cannot know if you are in a bottom-level universe or not. We can only infer our status based on the measure assigned to Tegmark-IV universes.

Additionally, the only way out of a simulation is by a process akin to uploading, i.e. the remains of the observer in the child universe upon ascension is a don't-care variable. There is potential for continuous transition, which would involve the parent universe affecting the child and revealing itself as parent. But again, that's dependent on the parent universe entirely, and can't be relied upon to determine the child's status in a hierarchy.

EDIT: Also, consider the possibility of a [[https://intelligence.org/2013/10/25/bas-steunebrink-on-sleight/][simulational bungalow,]] concept derived from the collapse of an infinite reflective tower to a finite 'reflective bungalow'. Instead of ascension into the physics of the parent universe, the parent simulator forms another universe for the child elements to ascend into. That means that even within Tegmark-'real' finite simulational towers there lie infinite simulational towers.

EDIT: The brain could even be considered a simulator running a mental universe (it is a mathematical structure after all). It is akin to our universe being a bubble of subphysics in the superphysics of the theoretical Eternal Inflation, or one brane in a vast number. Ascension of a mind into a parent involving different physics would necessitate a translation process, another form of upload, where the causal relations of the mind are best translated from the physical encoding of the child universe to the physical encoding of the parent. This is almost entirely masturbatory, though.

******* TFUMMC got me too. I find it difficult to think any other way now. To make the conclusion here a bit more directly accessible:

For every version of you that exists in a hypothetical "base universe", there exists a copy in a simulated universe that is absolutely identical. This is not impossible, even due to entropic decay and conservation and complexity, because the universe simulating ours could have physics that support real computers! There exists a copy of you, with /identical/ mind-state, in a simulated universe that is not identical because it is discretized but still /indistinguishable/ because it is discretized on a sufficiently small scale as to be undetectable and the simulation has a higher-level model of you!

This is what [[/u/Transfuturist]] means when he says you have to infer "based on the measure assigned to Tegmark-IV universes". Your only option is to make decisions by averaging over every possible version of you based on how "likely" each version is, which is called "measure" in the math.

TFUMMC also raises the interesting idea of "rescue simulations", which I find to be extraordinarily weird but intriguing from the perspective of my own personal consciousness and potential immortality. There are innumerable versions of me that were arbitrarily uploaded from a version of me a fraction of a second ago, and another innumerable set that will be arbitrarily and randomly uploaded from a version of me from ten seconds from now. The only question is, again, /measure/.

******** Rescue simulations are the only rational formulation of a heaven for the would-be dead. I love the concept in fiction. There were a few Friendship is Optimal fics that used this, one of them Balthasar999's incredibly excellent [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/211153/friendship-is-optimal-somnium][Somnium.]] This concept (when referring to post-death reconstructive simulations in the probably/mostly-same universe) is also referred to as logical/digital immortality, which I discussed [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/mu2/digital_immortality_map_how_to_collect_enough/csi5?context=1#csi5][last time I was on LessWrong.]]

For some reason the idea of getting your random sampling on the historical individual's specification wrong was referred to as 'acausal trade,' as there are universes with alternate Everett histories to the historical individual's observed history that nevertheless awake the 'correct' version, and there is a chain of misplaced mind specifications that eventually travels up to the Everett history that that individual would find correct.

This 'acausal trade' is not even necessary, as when you have true random sampling (using our own universe's random number generator) there will be one future Everett branch that undeniably contains the 'real' individual in question. Never mind the fact that the resurrected individual will not care or notice anything different about themselves.

It is most certainly a form of simulation ascension. :D

I'm not sure that discretization is necessary for hypercomputation, which could certainly enter the picture when talking about parent simulators. But yes, any level of discretization may be possible. Picture tenths of a Planck length. Picture Planckths of a Planck length. We don't know if our form of quantum physics even uses real numbers, there's no way to tell yet.

I was raising that mostly to bring up the idea that what matters is not the measure of the simulations that contain a mathematically-identical world, but rather the measure of the versions of you that you could be given your current observations. Like you said, weirdness in the human brain with simulations arising generative models.

******** On the one hand, I'm pretty sure I'm confused now.

On the other hand, if you can't /causally/ interact with the "other versions" of you, in what sense do they exist? Sure, blah blah measure blah blah conceivable, but without causal interaction, you never /have specific reason/ to expect to be an accurate simulation of yourself with greater probability than you expect your arm to morph into a banana (which could also happen in a simulation). And without causal interaction, it's not like you can control what happens to you anyway, soooooo...

These all feels to me like an artifact of our brains mistaking generative arrows for causal arrows, when in fact only a very few generative arrows are causal arrows, and most generative models are extreme compressions that abstract away much of the real causal mechanism.

This makes me wish I know enough about current statistical work on causality to write an algorithm that can tell the difference.

********* Well, start with this question: You have some observations; how do you know which universe your observations come from? You don't. What you do have, though, is in some sense a huge set - way up the arithmetic hierarchy - that is the set of universes that agree with your observations. And then you can ask questions to that set like "what proportion of these universes contain event X?". And that's how probability works in that situation. The set of universes where events conspire to cause your arm to morph into a banana is /smaller/ than the set of universe where they don't, because morphing your arm into a banana is a much smaller "target" for a simulation to hit, in an information-theoretic sense.

Eh, generative models are basically a neat way to do a numerical approximation of Naive Bayes. They don't work unless you have a model that reflects reality in some way. The key is that your neat trick lets you then use it to make decisions without having to compute the inverse, which can in many cases be really super hard.

Also, the problem with saying my arm is unlikely to turn into a banana because it's information-theoretically harder is that Tegmark 4 includes universes and multiverses which are only computable with an uncountable infinity of Turing Oracles and in which /information theory doesn't work the same way it does here/. There's no such thing as a well-founded simplicity prior over Tegmark 4, to my knowledge.

******** That is precisely what the concept of injection in Permutation City is about. Functionally it is no different, just another form of universe "transfer." There's the question of when the measure of the observer in that universe having a falsified parent is greater than the measure of the observer in that universe genuinely descended to that universe. Then there's the idea of descending through upload, but actually ascending because the upload was an interface that the parent universe was reading from. This shit is an undirected web of substrates.

I referred later, however, to an information-theoretical sort of falsification, where interference from the parent affects the child, violating the physics of the child universe. To use an analogy, the zero geodesic of the child universe in its configuration space is modified, possibly to a set of zero geodesics that are very low probability.

I'm unsure as to whether this would ever result in a reasonable confirmation of a parent universe; once interference ceases, the child resumes a zero geodesic through configuration space, with a past that 'never actually happened,' yet is evidenced by configuration that does not seem consistent or even possible, e.g. intelligent minds that are all disconfirmed in one or more beliefs. A fictional example could be Flash Forward, where (non-canon) a simulation of Earth is fed a Navikov-consistent vision of the future state of that simulation (which doesn't have to be computed to convergence; the parent can simply accelerate the universe's configuration trajectory wholesale). Or perhaps a monolith replaces Times Square and has always been there, or a large quantity of people think Nelson Mandela died earlier than he actually did.

My own intuition on this was fooled upon encountering the Berenstein/Berenstain controversy. The last two are real-life examples (ridiculous for it), and my System 2 prevailed, but System 1 was virtually convinced. With /some/ physical configuration, it will eventually become more plausible that the observer was entirely formed from Hawking radiation than wrong about the 'false' memory and right about everything else. What evidence would be required to convince a rational observer of a parent universe?

***** FiM has comparatively more abundant per capita high-quality fanfic (from the perspective of someone with societally-conformist male preferences), as, opposed to the FF.net crowd, the fimfiction crowd tends to be slightly older and rather male-er.

For example, I have slightly less than 170 pony fics currently tracked (although most have stopped updating) and have read dozens of oneshots, while I also have about 170 non-pony fics being tracked (it's a little weird how that worked out).

It does help that fimfiction is superior in most ways to ff.net, and is better for non-smut fics than AO3.

edit: I misunderstood your post as asking why there were a lot of FiM fics in particular, but I'll just post this anyways.

*** When I was younger, I had limited computer internet access, and I didn't have a cellphone. Plus, back then, smartphones weren't a thing. They didn't start rising in prominence until the early 2010's where I grew up. So I use to manually copy and paste FF.net fics into a notepad file (fuck those authors that had like 100+ chapter fics :( ), parse them with a program called jsplit into 4 KB chunks and read them on my 1st gen ipod Nano. The notes program didn't let you read past 4 KB back then, hence the need for splitting. I say that to say, I USED to be a determined little bastard about saving my favorite fanfics, for later perusal.

Now, I mostly don't bother, as the only reason I'd have to save them is if I lacked an internet connection, as I figure I'll remember or re-stumble across any fanfiction that's worth a re-read. And since I have data on my phone (and prefer to read on it anyway) and wifi at both home and work, there's little reason for me to save them. I do, however, have a number of novels on my kindle app that I've downloaded, such as the Name of the Wind series of books, the Martian, the Tao of Badass, etc.

Everyone involved would have root on the server.

There's a lot of work involved in getting tools to co-operate, so it makes sense for some hackery types to collaborate.

Things I'd like to see

- Centralized single-sign-on. This would most likely take the form of a django app, authenticating against PAM (local unix accounts) and things like facebook, github, whatever. Using python social auth. It would provide an oauth authentication endpoint for other services we run. We could just set up LDAP, a lot of things support it, but I hope this will provide more flexibility.

- Rocket chat, as an IRC bouncer and a way to talk to clients.

- seafile, as a dropbox alternative.

- Email, using mailur.

- Web hosting, for any clients or blogs. Using nginx.

- Git hosting, probably just using ssh.

--------------

There's a lot of sysadmin stuff, and it's my hope it could be divided amongst a few people who do this kind of thing. Basically, run it as a shared unix enviroment for some tech professionals who want self-hosted solutions.

As for everyone involved having root, I'm imagining this would be a handful of people who more or less trust each other. Their real names would obviously be known.

#+begin_quote
  Some of the podcasts I listen to (that make sense to recommend here):

  - Hello Internet: "Two-guys talking" podcast about a variety of topics. Alternates between interesting discussions and somewhat silly jokes/callbacks. One of the hosts (Grey) is a transhumanist and sometimes says things that make it seem like he has to have read some of Less Wrong.

  - Cortex, Reconcilable Differences (Two podcasts): Similar in genre to Hello Internet, but a bit less silly. Cortex has Grey from Hello Internet.

  - ATP: Like the above but with a tech news (esp. Apple) focus. Can be boring if you aren't interested in that, but is often fun anyway.

  - Rationally Speaking: Julia Galef (CFAR President) has conversations with people about their ideas.

  - Econtalk: Conversations between Russ Roberts and various economists/people in related fields. Not fun to listen to if you dislike libertarian ideas.

  - Worm Audiobook and HPMOR Podcast (Two podcasts): Enjoy great stories while doing other things!

  - Dear Hank and John: Kind of embarrassing to admit, but I like this, even though I stopped watching Vlogbrothers videos a long time ago.

  - The Weeds: Conversations between journalists about policy issues, rather than politics. Just put out a good episode about Basic Income Guarantees.

  - StartUp: Short episodes about the business of being a Start Up. Very well produced.

  - About Race: Occasionally frustrating exercise in overcoming anti-SJW sentiments through exposure therapy / conversations between mostly reasonable sounding people about why race is still a big deal and we should care a lot.

  - Waking Up with Sam Harris: Smarter and less crazy than you'd think if you've moved away from "New Atheism". Haven't listened to many episodes, but I've enjoyed those I have.

  General Podcast Tips:

  - Think of something you like. Now google that thing + "podcast" or just search for that term in itunes or your podcast app.

  - Slowly increase your listening speed. I listen at 3X speed, and it's great.

That's usually enough to get me through occasional long drives (my commute isn't long enough for me to listen to even a short podcast). "Here's the Thing" is of variable quality depending on the guest, but it's usually pretty interesting conversation.

*** Here's a few I haven't seen other people mentioned:

- /Death, Sex & Money/ is fantastic podcast about the things people love to think about but never talk about.

- /Radiolab/ does long-form reporting on fascinating stories.

- /In Our Time/ is a show sponsored by the BBC (I think) about a huge range of scientific, historical and philosophical topics.

*** [[http://theleagueofnerds.co.uk/][The league of Nerds]] (The podcast for the modern nerd!) is one of my favorite podcasts. It's a fun and reasonably varied podcast about science, pseudo-science, anti-science and conspiracies. The two hosts produce it purely for fun as a hobby.

[[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w/episodes/downloads][The Infinite Monkey Cage]], a bbc 4 radio show also available as a podcast. Hosted by Robin Ince and Brain Cox, tends to invite over a mix of comedians and scientists to talk about sciency stuff.

If you're into (pc) gamiing I'd recommend the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE010B0EEA9E5F06][Co-optional podcast]] (We do occaionally talk about video games!). Where if they're not talking about random nonense, they talk about the games they've been playing, gaming related news of the past week and upcoming new releases. They can be silly as hell, which I find quite amusing.

** Speaking of japanesegameshows, has anyone seen Takeshi's Castle? It's what MXC was based off of, to give it some context.

Watching it in the original japanese with subs is pretty fun. They're all like "Try your best!". It's very endearing. I find MXC pretty unpleasant, but Takeshi's Castle is alright.

** Does anyone else here also like making plans that can extend years in length?

It doesn't have to be to extensive, just something at the minimum of making reservations at that expensive theater for next year, pledging a Kickstarter project that won't pay out for years, saving money over the course of years to pay for a new car, or anything where you know that you won't see any sort of payout for a long time.

Because I hypothesize that people who are more rational will have a greater amount of self-control for delayed gratification, and one super quick and crude way IMHO to estimate self-control is to see if people here are more likely to make very long-term plans.

*** I admit that it's way fun to steeple my fingers, pretend to be Gendo Ikari or Tzeentch, and then, years later, stand in the shower and realize that the broad strokes have gone JUST AS PLANNED, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!!!

For instance, this year I've actually finished grad school, got a fairly cool real job, and started volunteering in the lab where I want to do my PhD.

But oftentimes the real pride is when details work out better than you did plan or could have planned, and yet did so because of something you did.

*** When it comes to things like reservations, the problem I have is that I don't know where I'll be in a year. Maybe my preferences change and I don't want to go to that expensive theater come next year. Maybe I'll be in a foreign country, unable to go. Maybe my wife will be giving birth that day. I don't like to "lock in" my decisions so far ahead of time, because there's too many things that can change over that span of time. However, if I can cancel the plans without penalty, then I'd have no problem making the reservation.

*** I usually find that planning something beyond a certain optimal period is less effective.

The optimal period depends on the specific context, but generally its within the 6-12 months, where the further plans should have less invested into them as they are more likely to be changed or even cancelled.

Anything beyond 12 months is almost always purely theoretical planning.

** I won't be at the New York Secular Solstice this year, because a friend of mine is making a Solstice in Washington. He says he wants less Unitarian Universalist-style pseudohumanism and more straight-up transhumanism.

And he's letting me suggest things for readings and songs.

Leonard Cohen's /Who by Fire/ is very plausibly going in there.

I promise to appear there in my True Form. If you think my True Form is a Kamina cosplay, that's your problem.

***** Fracturing a large base of political adherents into a radical minority and a moderate majority harms adherence. The sectarian sociopolitical force is subtracted from the majority's, weakening the push, and the minority is placed at odds with the moderates, even though their cause may be made more attainable by paying lip service to the more moderate stance.

I'm betting you've seen tumblr. SJWism, whatever that might be defined as, tends to be a radical sect of liberalism that has polarized according to a political center that is not nearly the internet's average, let alone their nations'. They remove themselves from discussion with conservatism and even liberalism that they consider conservative for the sake of purity. They attempt efforts that are oblivious of their nations' and the internet's true political center, and they don't support more moderate efforts because compromise with conservatism pollutes their ideological purity.

Sectarianism is, in other words, disregard for consequentialism in order to preserve ideological purity. Those who do so have been taught to value their own righteousness over actual progress (whichever direction it may be in). A body politic is only shifted gradually.

I see them as completely orthogonal. Transhumanism is the belief that humanity can (and should) be improved - transhumanists are pretty diverse in their views of just to what end humanity needs to be improved, and even there, for example, I'd wager our views differ radically. Humanism, on the other hand, is a pointless nihilist circlejerk at best, and careless hedonist individualism at worst.
