** Thoughts

- it was fun to see so many chekhov guns go off! AW must have fun writing these chapters
- hell-a-copter was a real delight, not to mention doom sun, chaos moon, yellow-fall
- we could call that he'd seen Fenn from a mile away, but it was still great
- It was surprisingly fun to see Lisi! Didn't know she had it in her to do something badass like this.
- Tension was really high, first from the chilly meeting with the DM, then the frantic tension from Mary showing up and the slow reveals of all the bad shit going down

I have to wonder why DiceGuy acted the way he did. He seemed so /final/ - but at this point, the party's plan for hell extraction was already underway. Was he just lying? It all seemed just /off/, and I have some crack theories about DiceGuy not being as in-control or all-knowing as he seems, but it might just be that DiceGuy was playing the thematically appropriate role of the contemptuous DM.

Don't get me wrong, the Plan had to have been in motion for 3 years for this to make sense.. and that could be the case. But Fel Seed bottling Juniper, really? That's the kind of 180 move you make your villain pull if the party does something to suddenly, if not deserve, open the possibility of victory.

I think the DiceGuy intended it to be final, and but he really really wanted to keep it going just like with Uther, so when Juniper asked him give them a fair 2nd round he retconned the bottling and the rest falls into place easily.

Infernal negotiations take a backseat to a reunion of sorts, even if a (lack of subjective) time hasn't cured any wounds in the interim. It seems appropriate to the characters involved.

Ah, so Juniper /was/ bottled by Fel Seed. Curious. Certainly very genre-savvy. Or perhaps he had some use for Juniper's soul? But the soul magic exclusion would prevent most of those...\\
Maybe the Fel Seed entity read /Degenerate Cycles/?

I find myself curious about the failed ways to extract someone from the hells. The rune magic exclusion (I'd found the possibility troubling) was from the (non-void !?) antimatter bomb. The actual soul retrieval method might not have itself been exclusion-worthy.

It's impossible, but that's the point of the thought experiment. Because p-zombies are /logically/ possible, it follows that there is an insurmountable gap between explaining the physical (which includes the functional components of consciousness) and qualia (subjective experience).

Chalmer's book is probably the best source if you want to read up on the precise reasoning. Keep in mind that there are some steps in the chain of logic that people disagree with. Personally, I find that any argument that stems from logical possibility very odd, but I'm not a philosopher.

I doubt anyone reasonable seriously considers the actual existence of p-zombies, but the fact that, even with a perfect understanding of the physical world, it's impossible to prove someone else is not a p-zombie is what's so interesting about them.

I agree with your second point, like I mentioned.

********* in order for a p-zombie to effectively blend in with real humans, there must be someone or something smart and perceptive enough to write out a list of most possible situations the zombie will encounter and a list of responses the p-zombie must make for each one. but to actually write out those lists requires having a map of a hypothetical person to imitate in the first place. the intelligence writing those lists would need to visualize that hypothetical person in enough detail to actually write those lists in sufficient detail to fool real humans.

for all "you" "know", "you" could be a p-zombie without "realizing" it. the only way to "know" would be to find "yourself" in a very particular niche situation where you "know" for a fact that you would have a "mental", "emotional", or behavioral response to it if you were "thinking" "feeling" and acting like "yourself", but instead "you" have no response at all. and then "you" would need to "notice" that, assuming that "noticing" it is even a response on "your" list of responses to begin with.

if "you" do "notice" it, "you" may also have a response on "your" response list which says to say the following sentence or a paraphrased version of it, whether or not anyone is around to hear it: "that means there was a situation which this zombie encountered which its list of situations did not include, or which its list of responses did not include a response for."

It's impossible to be a p-zombie without realizing it. If you have qualia, you're not. The whole point of p-zombies is that they're physically indistinguishable from beings with qualia.

qualia are just sensations/feelings, which is something the brain does.

the essential "domains" of the human psyche loosely match up to functional brain anatomy:

Mind= left brain aka the more logical and analytical part

Soul = right brain aka the more emotional part of you which tends to be more involved in music and art etc.

Vision = back brain aka the part of you which "absorbs signals from sensory stimuli" which is another way of saying "sensation" or "qualia".

Will = front brain aka the motor cortex aka the part of you which outputs actions.

************ Yeah, they might be impossible. It's a hotly debated topic. I think you're begging the question, though, but I might be, too.

The metaphysical possibility of p-zombies implies that qualia is distinct from the physical world. I think that part is mostly agreed on, it's just their possibility that's in question. They're used as an argument against physicalism, and, if I understand you correctly, your argument is essentially 'physicalism is true, therefore p-zombies are impossible'. I only agree with the logic, not with the premise.

Qualia is not just sensations or feelings of the brain, which are both purely functional concepts. I know it's a common objection to p-zombies, but I don't understand how anyone can make that statement. Makes me wonder if people who say so are p-zombies. (Just kidding - I don't believe they're physically possible.)

Maybe it's simply too depressing a possibility to consider? If it's true that qualia is non-physical, the most likely explanation seems to be that it's generated by certain physical processes as a byproduct, since it apparently holds no causative power. That means that, if one identifies with their qualia, like most probably do, one is nothing more than some kind of completely passive, internal movie, strung along by one's body like a puppet.

************* define "physical". as I see it, the mechanistic and fluid facets of a personality are just their mind and soul. mechanistic processes are what the mind sees because it tends to specialize more in hard skills like analysis, organization and logic. the soul sees fluid essences instead because it tends to specialize more in soft skills like imagination, intuition and empathy.

in a lot of ways the mind and the soul are just two different facets or angles/lenses for viewing the same thing. a more mentally oriented person is more likely to see themself as a physical, mechanistic process, something their brain does. A more spiritually inclined person is more likely to see themself as a spiritual, fluid process, and their brain as merely a container for it.

but there is no real meaningful/functional difference between those two views except for the format/manner in which they're expressed, and what aspects of the subject matter are emphasized more. i was talking in more mechanistic language because most rational fiction readers are more mentally-oriented rather than spiritually inclined.

i suppose if someone's right brain was removed theyd become a mind without a soul, assuming that didn't just kill them. a human being kinda needs both to survive imo. but if they do survive the loss of their right brain they probably are young enough to have enough neuroplasticity that their remaining half a brain takes over the roles/functions of the half that was removed.

still not the same thing as a non-conscious non-person mimicking sentience. even the coldest and most emotionally flat people still have some feeling in them. and if their soul is that underdeveloped they probably developed their mind a lot more.

************** It's incredibly difficult to give a precise definition of 'physical,' but it's roughly 'matter, energy, the laws that govern it, and everything that supervenes on (follows from) it,' plus whatever other processes in the purview of physics there are or that we might find in the future, but that makes the definition a bit circular.

Physicalism is the belief that there is nothing beyond the physical, which I used to ascribe to. Now, the hard problem of consciousness makes me uncertain.

P-zombies don't actually have anything to do with character traits, or mind vs. soul stuff, or anything esoteric. They're functionally sentient, functionally conscious, have feelings like love and anger, and have a soul, if that's what you would like to call the structures in the brain that give rise to personality. The only thing they lack is qualia: the personal, subjective experience of those functional aspects of neurophysiological processes. It's arguable whether that would make them a non-person.

(One of the problems with talking about these things is that most terms we use are loaded with a dual meaning: consciousness, sentience, feelings, emotions etc. can all refer to the functional, physical aspect that can be completely explained with science - what part of the brain effects them, what behaviour do they cause, how do they influence the rest of the brain, etc - or they can refer to the completely subjective 'what-it's-likeness' to experience them, to the qualia they relate to. P-zombies only lack the second.)

*************** and im saying you cant have one without the other.

also when physicists talk about physical laws to me it sounds like a map-territory confusion. like "our mental math models (which are a form of thought) have gotten so good at predicting how the universe behaves that it must mean the universe is obeying a mental math model aka one of those equations we call "universal laws of nature".

yet every time we become able to put more energy/effort/technological advancement/thinking power into our investigations, we uncover more details, we find mismatches between our thoughts and reality. every time. and i dont think well ever reach the "end" of that process no matter how many times we iterate it. as the number of iterations approaches infinity, the number of new mysteries we can uncover and explore also approaches infinity, not 1.

the very idea of a universal law of nature that is always the same everywhere and never changes, well that is a mental model, a /thought,/ which puts hash marks on reality to make it easier to measure, and then says those hash marks are a deep fundamental aspect of reality rather than merely guideposts we placed to make it easier to compress the reality we observe into a form that fits in our minds.

*************** religious leaders make the same mistake physicists make but with their feelings and intuitions rather than thoughts. they notice that their feelings and intuitions are really good at helping them effectively interact with the world around them in general including other people. so they assume the world must be made of the same stuff, that reality must have feelings and intuitions. they therefore conclude that reality itself is sentient, that it has a soul and they call it God.

but reality as a whole is NOT a person. it doesnt have feelings or intuitions, just like it doesnt have thoughts. thoughts feelings and intuitions are reflections, echoes or impressions of the reality they exist in by their very nature.

so when religious people talk about gods, of the very essence of the universe itself in general as a sentient being, theyre mixing up the mirror and the thing it reflects.

likewise, when physicists talk about the universe always 100% obeying a set of universal laws all the time regardless of circumstance and /just not knowing what those laws are yet/, I hear the equivalent of "the lord works in mysterious ways". theyre mixing up the map and the territory.

how could we know these always true universal laws exist if weve never seen them?

And I think that's something someone would do for themselves or someone else they really liked, and I didn't get the sense that Reimer was that close to Arthur. That one piece of information is being weighted very heavily in my contemplation of this mystery, and that weighting pushes Arthur past Reimer.

Just fake all the infernoscope feeds, noone is ever escaping the hells and it's not like you can count all the 9 trillion demons. That's what I'd consider ethical game design, anyway. Had I no ethics, then I'd still do it for efficient game design. Really, given the backend portal having Schlossvolk influence, that's probably their job. To make the illusion so damn good, that everyone thinks, the hells are real. Procedurally generate and retcon on the fly.

If I was to be a player in the game, I'd also totally manipulate my internal processes, so that whenever I consider the illusion, I'll not find it convincing.\\
That's all gonna be in the sequel "We are selling so many candles! Fuck yeah!", though. It focusses on VR game design, corporate politics and the societal ramifications of readily available hyperstimuli.

The timing felt off (I didn't understand why Fenn appeared when she did, I hadn't guessed at the 3-year Fel Seed bottled time skip). Narratively, I assumed that he'd have lots more time to either acclimate as a hermit hidden away in an upper hell or to become a broken, kept mortal with no hope of escape.

My hypothesis was that the infernals had somehow messed with his perception of time, and had introduced Fenn and subsequently Amaryllis after breaking them both, in an attempt to produce maximum suffering. "Convince Juniper you're here with a grand rescue plan or we'll resume another subjective century of torture" would be indistinguishable from everything we already saw.

Hells are just as creatively awful as we were promised, and this is supposed to be one of the nicer ones. Reminds me a bit of the hells in Iain M Banks Surface Detail. It's easy for descriptions of hell to become uninteresting as pain as an end in itself is monotonous, but details keep it concrete

Fenn being back is cool. I'd forgotten how snarky she was. And her dislike of Juniper at the point she died. Opportunity maybe to demonstrate a bit of his character development in dealing with her. The summary of all the insane things that happened in the relatively short time since she died was funny as well.

I hadn't been anticipating them at they'd be able to use the threat of Valencia to gain leverage in the hells, but it makes sense given the infernals have organised to deal with it, and the prospect of genuine death would be terrifying to them. Would be interesting to get some insight into the psychology of the infernals themselves, their design makes them pitiable and tragic in their own way. Possibly that they'd welcome the change given the option.

If Mary becomes one of the few people who has returned to life, it would likely afford her a great deal of political power. If you're a friend and she asks you to do something which might get you killed, you'd probably be much more willing to trust that she can bring you back.

In this example we'd end up with a distribution that covers values from 1 to 1000, with a peak at 400. The average of such a distribution is necessarily above 400.

I can see where you're getting the 799 from, but I don't remember enough math to recall whether standard distributions had to have defined upper and lower bounds.

I mean, couldn't the bin for [Down 1 Hell] and [Down 800-8999 Hells] have equal probabilities of occurring and still be considered a standard distribution? It would shift the mean, sure, but it should still be standard, no? The range of the numbers don't matter, just the probability of a value in a population falling within them?

That said, Mary's statement can still work with a clipped curve, for example, if fall depth of 800 is outside of 3SD interval. That way the mean depth and the peak will be different, but /roughly/ the same, and the average number of jumps would not change because it's an integer.

It's not explicitly stated if an EZ is created on the location of a calamity vs the origin of calamitous magic, but the latter makes more sense given that exclusions are sometimes non-calamitous ("silent" exclusions); the RMEZ could be centered on the rune forge where the bomb was created, for example.

*** Previously, on WtC Chapter 175:

Juniper looked into the spirit of Speculator Masters and found a construct made by Uther that let him see the Outer Reaches, a plane of abstract ideas. The denizens of the Outer Reaches are able to retroactively instantiate modules of content on Aerb. Uther called those modules "schloss", German for castle, in honor of the story of a dude who woke up one day and apparently had been living next to a castle his whole life and never noticed it.

So what Lisi is getting at is that Mary created a way back from the hells into Aerb by retroactively making it so that way back to Aerb had always existed.

This also tells us something about the limits of magic in the Outer Reaches, since if Mary had her way, I doubt she'd have intentionally created a way back to Aerb that required human sacrifice. So it's probably something like, you can only retroactively create stuff in the flavor of what's already there.

** Wait, I'm a little confused about the infernal plot, correct me if I'm wrong. June dies, Mary spends 3 years searching for him with Val continuing to kill infernals slowly to look for evidence of him. This slow killing unifies the Hells though against what specifically, they don't know. They don't know why their being killed, only that their being killed. During this cold war, they make plans to hit back at Aerb to destroy this weapon and are questioning every mortal to find out what this weapon is. Mary eventually bombs Flesh City and this somehow tells them that someone with a connection to the weapon died there?? Within the space of that day, the information spreads to the entirety of Hell and they now know about Val.

Why are the infernals even fighting back? Aren't they notoriously selfish? And since Val can kill literally the most powerful of them as easily as the weakest, there'd be no leadership, just the vague banner of defiance to rally around. If they just give Mary and June what they want, they get to exist; refuse, and oblivion, wouldn't most make the same choice as the interrogator?

The idea of trees that tortursynthesize on nausea is demented and very interesting.

Why would Fel Seed bother bottling June?

Do dragons go to Hell? Would they be a delicacy or would they be too much trouble to bother torturing?

I know there was a 3 year gap but from a story perspective it still seemed like the Hells were a cakewalk. In and out, 5 minute adventure. For something that was hyped as flatly impossible, that's a little disappointing.

Also, it's interesting to note but 60 chapters ago, Raven mentions they got the warning that the schlossvolk had begun interfering again; I wonder if Hell to Aerb portal was the change they made. The schlossvolk kinda seem like the answer to a lot of the intractable problems. No way to do something? Schloss! Now there is! They are straight up reality warpers and if they could just be friendjitsu'd onto Junes team...

*** The infernals reasonably suspect that the second coming of Arthur might be related to the weapon. They know June died in the Fell Seed exclusion zone and set up a system to quickly respond to his appearance in those three years, which got triggered before the team found him. The bombing would probably start their plans or at least put them on high alert. Once the descent starts, the suspicion is confirmed and they're forced to make their move.

They're fighting back because Val can't actually kill the leaders quickly enough before they unify and invade Aerb. If they don't, she'll eradicate them all eventually. IIRC she has killed them completely at random so far to mask the killings as a potentially natural or at least undirected process, because if she'd start killing just the leaders, the infernals would mobilize too quickly.
