Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Aaand I just spent my week reading the whole of /Worth the Candle/. Curse you, alexanderwales! Hope you're planning to do something really evil and world-shattering with all these weeks of free time we're /sacrificing/ to you!

Seriously though, it's funny how many works of alexanderwales I've read that I expected not to like from the blurb/high concept and from the first chapters; usually I find myself with nothing to do and thinking "Eh, may as well read this weird thing he wrote, how bad could it be?", and bam, there goes my day/week. /Worth the Candle/, /The Dark Wizard of Donkerke/, /Shadows of the Limelight/, and /Branches on the Tree of Time/ so far (still can't get into the Frozen one, though).

On the one hand, maybe that means the author should advertise a little harder (I know the current blurb would have attracted me way more than the blurb at the time the story started). On the other hand, I think it's just the normal investment problem, where you can't really know if a story is worth investing hours into before you've invested a few hours into it, and that point you're kind of trapped either way.

** I'm genderfluid. I just found out this week and that revelation has resulted in me feeling really /really/ good these past few days. I thankfully have no body dysphoria or depression related to my gender identity, everyone I've come out to has been very supportive, and I don't think I've ever felt this confident or secure in my persona before.

This is like a childhood dream come true. I feel like a shapeshifter who can wake up each day as a different person who's still me but likes different things. This week I've been a woman, a man, and somewhere in between while always being validated by everyone I interact with. I'm excited to explore my femininity and I feel like I finally get to be masculine on my own terms.

Tomorrow I'm going on the first shopping trip that I've ever looked forward to. My style has always been very bland and purely utilitarian, I think because I was so insecure in my identity, but now a whole world has opened up to me and I can't wait to experiment with what I like. Granted, I broke new ground yesterday by willingly wearing a long sleeved button up shirt so everything will probably feel novel.

I've never really tried to express myself with my appearance before, but now that I am I feel much more extroverted and less anxious when socializing. I'm not as uncomfortable around people when I present myself the way I identify and boy is that liberating for someone who finds communication difficult. I'm so lucky to be in the position I am right now.

One of the reasons it took me so long to figure this out is that I have a fetish for transformation and crossdressing, which I of course felt really insecure about. It was this week when I realized none of my sexual fantasies involved myself. It never felt like a fantasy because it was still just me and changing felt normal. At the same time, I'm glad I've had this much time to educate myself and others in preparation for my self discovery.

**** I especially like the point the writer makes about advocating for "normal" causes that are almost as good as your weird ones. I've long played with the theme in my writing that "perfect is the enemy of good," especially with the moral absolutism I see prevalent in US nowadays. I see a lot of people demanding moral perfection from their politicians, leaders, heroes, and historical figures, and failing to realize that people are not perfect, even the great ones. I see people denigrating Stephen Hawking for his younger misogyny as if that completely discounts the man's incredible legacy as a scientist. I get the waters are hot right now, but it's just something that bothers me that I've been trying to articulate in a way that doesn't make me sound like I'm just complaining about SJWs (because, on the whole, I am a left-leaning individual)

(sorry OP for hijacking your original post, I'm very glad you're sorting out your gender identity, I just wanted to speak on a point in this article)

***** I see this argument a lot wrt us politics, and it's horseshit. Because generally, the policies held up as good instead of perfect are actually bad, just not the worst possible policy. Take for example "medicare extra for all." It purports to be a liberal compromise with medicare for all, but it drops the most important part: health insurance companies delenda est.

It's not a new thing, either. The same tendency drove the campaigners for compensated manumission in the lead up to the civil war.

Historical context is what allowed them to do the terrible things they did like own slaves, kill Native Americans, treat women as objects, and enact policies that served elitist agendas. All things that still happen today and should not have ever happened.

Perhaps I was just particularly irked that people went around my feeds calling people out for admiring Hawking for his achievements, implying that people who did admire him were complicit in his misogyny somehow. I don't think admiration of someone's good traits is approval of their negative ones, but I've been bothered by the assumption that if I praise a historical figure for one thing, I'm praising them for all their things, which should be obvious is not the case.

***** As someone who has recently had a weight lifted off of my psyche that has been beating me down for my entire life, I think it is /extremely/ important that we fight against the culture of abuse and discrimination in our society at every turn regardless of the pedestals it targets.

I was raised a straight white man and grew up believing things that dehumanized other people and stunted my own self actualization. I have improved significantly and didn't know what I do now, but that doesn't make up for the objectively harmful things I did, believed, and enabled.

I think people have a moral obligation to criticize that wherever it shows up, even when that criticism targets someone who did as much good as Hawking. When I criticize him or anyone else past or present for the same, it is not intended to discredit his accomplishments but to point out that that we all need to watch out for that.

I don't think of myself as an SJW because I associate that term with a person who thinks they are above prejudice, which I definitely do not believe about myself. I must be criticized as well and the burden is on me as much as anyone to show compassion for people who lack the privileges I do.

If that sounds hard and like it could easily rationalize self hatred, you're right. But I'll do it anyway because I cannot compare the pain I feel to the suffering others endure that I believe people should never suffer. I've had a only small taste of that suffering and it was worse than anything else I've ever felt, if I had had it any worse it would've broken me.

**** I think this is a useful strategy for the persuasion of people whose views are based on ignorance, but I don't currently have a reason to consider compromising the way I present myself and even if I did I wouldn't be willing to.

If a person didn't accept me after I had explained myself, effectively choosing to be prejudiced in spite of my evidence, then any value they gave my life by being in it would not be made up for by the emotional pain they would cause me.

I'm very lucky to not have any prejudiced people in my life, but if any of them were I would've just cut them out of it. I'm not going to feel empathy for people who refuse to feel empathy for me. Trying to love someone who hated me was how I got emotionally abused by my own sibling.

***** I completely agree with you overall: "don't light myself on fire to warm other people" is a pretty good common sense policy.

That said, I kind of disagree with the "effectively choosing to be prejudiced in spite of my evidence" part. People don't choose to be prejudiced; ultimately, we're all Bayesian machines all the way down, some with different priors.

I think that arguing convincingly to prejudiced people -as in, not "argue really well to prejudiced people and shake my head sadly when they disagree", but "argue in a way that sometimes convinces prejudiced people"- is a valuable skill that you would probably benefit from, given what I know of you.

And yeah, I really don't respect sticking to norms for the sake of it, or [[https://xkcd.com/137/][censuring yourself to blend in]], but I think that there's something to be said for seeing where "normal" is and working from there. I see it as leverage, I think?

It's a little abstract, but it's like, metaphorically... being aware that it's not enough to push, you need your feet to be on solid ground. Knowing "my position" and why I believe in it isn't enough, I have to know "normal", and why people would be there; what obstacles there are between "normal" and my position, and respect these obstacles as serious enough to warrant a true effort.

I think this is a process a lot of people fail at, because they see a different opinion, they see their opinion, and they just fill the gap with generic [naïveté / cognitive bias / prejudice / pure evil / a society that never taught them better / stupidity] in a way that's reassuring (my position is the right one, but people disagree because they're stupid and they grew in a prejudiced society) but not actually good at finding ways to "bridge the gap". So they just say "this is why my position is the best, you really need to realize that", and that's only enough for people who are already almost convinced.

And... I'm pretty sure I'm not getting through to you, but I'm mostly writing for myself here, for future reference. Sorry for being a nag :(

**** Thank you. I don't actually have any actionable requests for people, but that's an attitude I think everyone should have toward LGBTQ+ people. I've been considering going by they/them pronouns by default, though I personally don't have a problem with being misgendered.

Even using public restrooms hasn't been an issue for me because of my lack of body dysphoria, I'll use a urinal for the sake of convenience any day no matter how I dress. All I really care about is being treated as my currently preferred gender identity, which isn't going to be as big an issue online.

I guess all you can do for me here is think of me as not being a specific gender and see that as normal. Some days I'm one or the other, a mix of both, or something not quite either. It would be nice to know that people are making an effort to be better even when I can't tell they are, and it might help out more people than just me.

****** Well it wouldn't really look like anything to me since I can't tell what people are thinking, but it is the way I think about myself now. I was forced into a particular view of my gender that does not represent people in general, let alone me, so now I just dress how I feel and want people to see me. I can't tell if people online are doing that, but I can ask them to think about how they view me.

Yesterday I wore a salmon jacket with a necklace and swayed my hips as I walked, which led to female coworkers inviting me into a discussion of fashion. The day before I had baggy masculine clothes on and fit in with the guys on the assembly line. That doesn't represent everything about me and what I want, gender is not binary and neither am I, but it's what has happened so far and I liked it.

I really do feel like a shapeshifter who can look like whatever I want. I want to be recognized as me no matter what, but I also want people to acknowledge that the way I choose how to look is indicative of how I feel and want to be treated. That doesn't come up online as much, so it becomes more about asking people to examine their biases about gender for the sake of LGBTQ+ people in general.

How do you think being genderfluid affects your sexual orientation or romantic desires, if it does at all? Basically I'm wondering how your experience of gender relates to romantic relationships, but I understand that a lot of people wouldn't want to discuss something like that.

****** It's not a problem for me at all, though thank you for being so consider are. As far as I know, sexuality is completely independent from gender identity. The way I feel about myself does not effect how I feel about other people.

My personal experience with romance is that I figured out I was pansexual years ago and have only been in one sexual relationship with a gay man that I broke off for reasons unrelated to sexual or romantic preferences, though we never went “all the way”.

If I find a romantic partner I do not know if they'd have to be bisexual or pansexual or something else. It's possible that I would be fine if they were attracted to men since I do not have body dysphoria and might not have preferred pronouns.

I would want them to still be attracted to me regardless of which gender I present as, but their attraction could be conditional solely on anatomy or be completely independent of it like my own. You could ask [[/r/genderfluid][r/genderfluid]] or [[/r/DualGender][r/DualGender]] for people with more experience.

"Xe/Ze" marks you firmly in blue tribe, which means not only will conservatives not use it, but even left leaning people who don't want to loudly signal their own political affiliation will avoid it. And I also speculate that both of these are unstable. The words sound remarkably close to both "he" and "she," which (fun fact) is how "he" and "she" morphed into their present forms.

The word "it", when applied to people, is used for the purposes of dehumanization and depersonalization. Examples include a bully saying "Look everybody, it speaks.", robots being called "it", and wild animals being called "it" while pets are called "he" or "she."

The talk of "being a shapeshifter" in particular reminds me of labels I'd tried to put on myself back when I was in a teenager in therapy. Trying too hard to fit reality into concepts and all that stuff.

Again, it's great that you found your niche, but... maybe be aware of that part of your brain than wants to place labels on everything?

**** That's a fair concern and I don't take offense to you bringing it up. I was worried about it too and I‘ve had to remind myself that masculine and feminine are things I get to define for myself instead of falling back on stereotypes and norms.

However, I think this is actually a case of me overcoming my tendency to overthink because I had rationalized away my gender identity until this week. I woke up from a dream about genderfluidity and knew that was how I felt.

I'd felt unsatisfied with my gender before, but I had always thought it was only a fetish since I didn't have the dysphoria transpeople do. But that morning I knew that I had gone to sleep feeling like a man and woken up feeling like a woman.

Then I remembered all the times I'd felt off before and how I'd wanted to be able to change since I was a little kid. I realized I'd always been this way and had been taught to deny it. I have literally felt euphoria since then because I feel like I'm...more.

It's like I've only been allowing part of my mind out my whole life and I finally get to experience the whole of who I am. I no longer feel forced into being a certain way, I can be any way I want and change it whenever.

I'm ready to explore these “new” parts of myself and my loved ones are there to help me. I have fears and doubts, but I feel more confident and courageous than ever in facing them. Not because I feel like I'm special, but because I finally feel like /me/.

***** I don't really get how the ontology there is supposed to work, but good on you, and it's nice to hear you're not overthinking things again. I would say you should try to avoid spending too many Weirdness Points on your genderfluidity in highly memorable ways, just in case at some point you do find your internal maps of yourself being updated again.

(Same reason I never got a tattoo. Though your sense of self does seem to stabilize as you get older, it doesn't seem to completely stop updating.)

**** You could be agender, non-binary, genderqueer, or something that I haven't heard of yet because identity is complicated. Let me give you some advice, don't settle for the “default option” just because you're used to it and you think it‘s easier to stick with.

That's the rationalization that kept me from figuring myself out for years after learning about genderfluidity and my self discovery has been euphoric. Do some research about how your feelings compare to others and liberate yourself from what you think is normal.

** Recently came across a show called [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WTOaGLSSXE][Thunderbolt Fantasy (youtube link to ep1)]]. Written by Gen Urobuchi, it is an action show in the style and medium of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove_puppetry][Chinese Glove Puppetry]]. I have almost zero interest in puppetry, but I respect Urobuchi enough that I decided to watch 3 minutes of this show.

"I'll give it 180 seconds, then I'm going to go back to reading," I thought.

30 minutes of enraptured watching later, I was immediately looking for where I could find episode 2. It's available on Crunchyroll for Americans, not sure where else to legally get it for non-Americans, or if Crunchroll bought the license in your jurisdiction.

Prepare to be amazed.

*** An em is running on a simulation. A dream of an em is a simulation running inside a simulation. As such, it will be /far/ less complex, the same way that our dreams are not completely accurate physics simulations. If, for some reason, the em could borrow the processing power of the computer running it, then the dreams would probably be considered "real". But otherwise, the dreams characters wouldn't really be any more conscious than our own dreams, which is what I assume you mean by "real."

**** I agree with you on all counts, but I'm not sure the line between the em and the computer would be so easily defined. It's possible that a digital mind could scale their processing power up and down, so that they're “borrowing” resources whenever they think at all.

I imagined a hypothetical scenario in which the em needs to be given the ability to dream, as opposed to just entering standby, which could be as important to their mental health as human REM sleep. There may not be a clear ontological difference between the levels of simulation.

If that were the case, what are the implications? Does their imagination create a form of life that it would be inhumane to delete? Would singularity-level AIs dream whole worlds into being? What could and should be done with dreams that are determined to have created new people?

I've never liked the hypothesis that we are living in a simulation, it's unprovable and I never saw a reason to create self aware simulations anyway. This possibility I've envisioned about digital dreaming has me interested, though. I'll discuss it more at the next Worldbuilding thread.

The more power the mind uses, the more detailed their dreams need to be in order to keep them sane. So society is left with the question of what to do when someone's mind accidentally dreams people into existence and don't want to just delete them.

I'm kind of imagining an inverse Westworld. Transhumans decided that artificial life was still life and the standard of free will is arbitrary when the creator has absolute power, so they keep any simulation going that demonstrates sentience and try to integrate it into their civilization. What kind of sci-fi world would that be where dreams are foreign nations and that people emigrate from?
