Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  *Destructive problem-solving*

  Something as apparently benign as a list-sorting algorithm could also solve problems in rather innocently sinister ways.

  *Well, it's not unsorted:* For example, there was an algorithm that was supposed to sort a list of numbers. Instead, it learned to delete the list, so that it was no longer technically unsorted.

  *Solving the Kobayashi Maru test:* Another algorithm was supposed to minimize the difference between its own answers and the correct answers. It found where the answers were stored and deleted them, so it would get a perfect score.

  It turned out that the algorithm's strategy was to place its move very, very far away, so that when its opponent's computer tried to simulate the new greatly-expanded board, the huge gameboard would cause it to run out of memory and crash, forfeiting the game.

** So... At least a few of you are aware (probably, I think) that I've been working on a sequel to HPMOR for quite a long while (like, over 3 years). Maybe you saw the rough draft I posted /15 months ago/ and saw that I said I'd probably start posting chapters within 3 months. Gotta love Hofstadter's law, right?

Anyway, I thought I'd ask if anyone would be willing to do me a favor and look at the most recent update and tell me if you think the writing itself is at a point where I can safely say I'm done editing it, so I can move on and finish editing the rest of the chapter and the nine chapters that follow it (there's no new information, it's still just the first half of the first chapter (and nothing beyond that is coming out until editing on all of the first ten chapters is done and they're all ready to be released simultaneously)).

Beyond the writing itself, I've incorporated a /lot/ of expository stuff in an attempt to make this thing more accessible for people who have either never read HPMOR or who haven't read it in a long time. If you have a strong opinion about that and feel like it's too much and needs to be cut back, I'd be interested in which expository bits you feel are unnecessary, or which bits you feel are overdone and need to be more subtle.

Anyway, if you're interested, here it is:

**** Partly because I'm trying to pull off some risky stuff in the first few chapters and I need people to be able to binge their way past that or it might turn people off. It's going to turn some people off regardless. There's also an organizational problem I'm running into.

I'll give you the first 6 chapter titles (as of right now).

#+begin_quote
  Something to Protect: Tom Riddle

  The Truth, Pt 6, A Riddle Unraveled

  The Truth, Pt 7, A Riddle Reiterated

  Refraction

  Interlude: All the Myriad Ways, Pt 0

  Into the Forest
#+end_quote

As you can see, we're /mirroring/ HPMOR's naming conventions a bit, up until "Refraction," so you should be able to easily figure out from where Harry is in the chapter I've posted that it's going to involve the Mirror of Noitilov. "Into the Forest" doesn't follow that pattern, and that's extremely relevant and a very big spoiler if you figure out what it means.

My working drafts originally only had "The Truth, Pt 6, A Riddle Reiterated" for a substantial part of the story's development, but there's too much stuff that needs to happen for that to only be one chapter. My "organizational problem" that I've been dealing with for - god, has it been a year? Longer? - is that I have all of the stuff that happens in the first three chapters written out, but multiple huge chunks keep getting shuffled around between those chapters, which in turn necessitates shuffling all the other stuff and coming up with new transitions, and the "Truth" chapters themselves keep swapping names with each other. I /desperately/ need for "Pt 6" to have the "Reiterated" title, and it doesn't right now, which means I'm not done. It's a thing that /must/ happen, because "reiteration" is "a step where one re-uses a previous step. In practice, this is only necessary when one wants to take a hypothesis which is not the most recent hypothesis and use it as the final step before a deduction step." Harry is the "Riddle" who has been "reiterated," and Quirrellmort is the "Riddle" who we "unravel." It would be swell if in the "reiterated" chapter we could use "reiterate" in the other sense and re-answer the questions from HPMOR's "Truth" arc, and if we could use "unravel" in the other sense in its chapter as well, though being specific on either sense for that one would be pretty spoilerish.

At some point in the (relatively) near future, I'm going to get a bunch of note-cards and write out /all of the things/ on them and physically lay them out and move them around by hand and see if that helps. I might become extraordinarily ballsy and change the order to "Truth Pt 6" "STP: TR" "Truth Pt 7," but I would be extraordinarily dissatisfied with that ordering.

That's a big part of the reason you're only seeing the first half (or third, or possibly quarter) of the first chapter, I'm not going to publish a draft of chapter one that includes material that's almost certainly going to be in another chapter. There are a lot of earth-shattering revelations in a very short period of time, and I need to be very careful about when everything gets said in relation to everything else. The reveal about the true nature of the mirror has been in all three of those chapters at some point. The reveal about David Monroe has been in all three of those chapters at some point. If you take the set of "all the things" that are in all three of those chapters, almost all of those things have been in all three of those chapters in multiple configurations. This isn't a delay due to writing or editing, it's a delay due to figuring out the most logical causal chain of events. I know I'll hit the right configuration eventually, but I have no way of predicting when that'll be.

Now, beyond all that, chapters 4 through 10 are pretty well close to done, it's the first 3 chapters that are being disagreeable and refusing to cooperate.

****** Thanks, would be a /great/ suggestion in most use cases, but I feel like I need to keep iterating on this thing until it "resonates" with my own brain. I have many versions, none of them have resonated, and when I get a version that resonates that'll be the version I clean up and edit. This is literally the first work of fiction I've ever written (I played around with an idea for a few months about 6 or 7 years ago and at the time I thought I was "writing," but I really wasn't), and I want it to be something that comes from my own mind (insofar as that's even an accurate thing to say in the first place; nothing is /truly/ original, every idea anyone has ever had has originated outside of their own mind).

I get what you mean, like, take two or five of the versions I've already decided not to use and let other people react to them for a fresh perspective and kind of triangulate a causal chain based on their feedback, but I really want to do this myself. "Elizabeth" doesn't exist, she's a pseudonym, so I'm never going to get any credit for writing this and I'd at least like to feel the accomplishment of having managed to do the whole thing myself, y'know?

******* I think you're overthinking the pseudonym thing.

Actually, since we're on the subject, what do you mean by "Elizabeth doesn't exist"? Like, I get that you're not named Elizabeth, but the person you're answering to probably isn't named "Xamuel", and I'm not /really/ a French sentient blue knife (well, I'm really French and sentient, but that's about it). Do you mean that you act out a different personality while online?

--------------

Regardless, I think you're overthinking this. If this is your first work of fiction, you're supposed to do it "start-up style": start simple, iterate a lot, and move forward with new content instead of redoing the same thing until it's perfect.

If you have content, even discarded content, and people who might be willing to give you feedback, then you should release it all.

As it is, I can't give you any useful feedback because I have a ton of questions where the answers would be "It's explained in the next chapter".

** Reminder: Reposting is a /good/ thing.\\
- Option 1: Nothing can be posted more than once in a subreddit. A person who hasn't seen the good submissions of yesteryear /never/ will see them, unless he takes the time to look through the archives himself or the submissions happen to be crossposted elsewhere.\\
- Option 2: Reposts make up a high proportion of all submissions. A person who already has seen the good submissions of yesteryear will have his front page and his [[/r/all][r/all]] clogged with them, unless he takes the time to downvote the ones that he considers to have been reposted too heavily and refresh the page. (Being a savvy Redditor, he obviously has activated the setting that automatically hides all submissions that he has upvoted and downvoted.)\\
- Option +1+ 2 is better than Option +2+ 1 because being forced to downvote annoying submissions in your front page and your [[/r/all][r/all]] is /significantly/ less tiresome than being forced to sift through the archives of /dozens/ of different subreddits.

*** Whether option 1 is bad depends on the relative quality of the posts. If you are in a subreddit where content is easily replaceable and there are no high-quality outliers (I can think of a few), then a repost might be a net-negative: Some people have seen it already, so for them it's a value of, say, 0.5 of a baseline post. The majority has not, they get a 1.01 post. Obviously those numbers are pulled out of thin air and up for debate, but I think they fit many subreddits. (Ones with lots of qualitatively similar content, where reposts diminish a post's value significantly.)

In those cases, a steady stream of new content is the desirable state, and you want to encourage that. Sadly, voting does not address this problem, as most users just see a 1.01 baseline post, and act correspondingly. (Rightfully so, I might add.) Thus, the local incentives do not line up with the global optimum. I believe this is---in an abstract sense---why you see people complaining.

Note that the above does explicitly not apply to the case you are describing, where you are trying to see /all/ high-quality submissions.

It probably isn't that difficult to do, but I imagine it isn't worth it in terms of hardware. Checking every post if it's a copy of any other post in the history of that sub would get somewhat costly for the bigger and more active subs, and costly in terms of CPU time translates into additional cost for running servers. For a small wuality of life benefit, it's not a good investment. Plus, if people actually didn't like reposts, they wouldn't get upvoted so much.

Also, if the algorithm has to check not just for whether a photo is identical to a previously posted one but also whether or not it's very similar (i.e. you can't just crop one row of pixels and have it get through) it would get even more costly.

*** Option 1 is also better than 2 (although both are extremes) because it caters to long time members as opposed to an influx of new ones. Option 1 means that there is less content per refresh of the page, but it means that the people who are dedicated to that sub in particular will be able to open a new link without having to check if they've already read the content. Every new link guarantees new content, even if it isn't always high quality. And catering towards long time members is beneficial because those members make up a disproportionate number of the people who make comments and make new posts (when posts consist of user created content, in contrast to some news subreddit that posts links to articles that the submitter didn't make).

Having no reposts also means that new content is much more likely to be seen by the userbase, because it doesn't have to compete with the best content from the past. This encourages people to try new ideas, instead of sticking with variations of the already popular content.

Option 2 is probably much better for the membership numbers of a sub, because it constantly shows off the best the sub has to offer, and also because a single repost of a popular submission is much more likely to cause someone to subscribe than for an existing member to unsubscribe, but it's bad for the more abstract health of the sub.

*** Reposting a review I wrote a few months ago:

--------------

I think /A Practical Guide to Evil/ is a mix of three genres: young adult anti-hero epic, political intrigue, and meta-story telling. I tolerate the first, love the second and hate the third.

Catherine is basically the archetypal female young adult character. She's grown up in a difficult environment, seen suffering and misery, learned to fend for herself, she's the Chosen One but she's building her own destiny. She's baaaasically Katniss Everdeen with more agency, and a rationalist spin ("most heroes try to do X, X doesn't work, I'm going to try Y instead"). So if you don't find this type of character compelling... yeah, ain't gonna work out.

Personally, I love the worldbuilding and the political elements. Stuff like the idea that Amadeus made the Imperial Legion more popular by having it patrol areas controlled by corrupt nobles and corrupt police forces, or the idea that Callow and Praes are doomed to fight because Praes has a constant overpopulation problem and needs to invade Callow to either cull its population or import food (which was also a theme in OotS).

On the other hand, if you forget the big picture plan of "unifying Callow and Praes through common enemies" for a moment, the day to day reality is pretty grim. Catherine is working for an Empire that has consistently been an oppressive Tyranny for centuries, and just happens to currently be getting more progressive. Her plan to unify the region entails a lot dying, suffering, and civil-war-ing. The story doesn't pull punches on the fact that every battle has casualties, and every manoeuver requires sending soldiers to their deaths. Maybe you don't like the frequent reminders that a lot of people are dying in the depicted conflicts.

The meta story-telling is when a character goes "I'm a villain and he's a hero, that means he's going to win because stories!". I don't have much to say on that except I don't like it. It's another thing that drawn from /Order of the Stick/ (Black is basically a cross between OotS' Tarquin and Darth Vader), and... I dunno, it's not very interesting to me. I'm not really a fan of 4th-wall breaking, unless it's used sparingly in comedies, so the whole idea of "We know we're in a story, so let's use strategies that will work because we're in a story" doesn't really appeal to me. I prefer the parts about logistics and politics.

Also, I know that "Evil" is in the title, but I don't really like the parts where they start to discuss Good and Evil. Despite what Star Wars would like you to believe, there's no ideology of Evil. There are weird Satanist cults, and philosophies of rationalizing why it's okay to be selfish, and you can always use some variation of individualism and "The only virtue is being strong because Darwin / because good and bad are subjective / whatever", but essentially, everyone either believe themselves to be "Good", feel like they're not "Good" but would like to be, or don't care and think the idea of "Good" is pointless.

So while I understand that the setting has a whole divine eternal war between order and individualism and how they basically map to Good and Evil in human societies, I still find it weird when the protagonist goes "We are the villains!" even though she has a pretty strong sense of ethics. Same thing for Worm, I have trouble taking someone seriously when he's saying "This person is a villain!" Who does that? If you want to use labels, use "criminal" or "murderer" or "scumbag", but having cops talk about "villains" is just silly.

--------------

Overall, yeah, the writing goes from kind of mediocre to amazing. I definitely recommend you give it a try for a few chapters.

** My last update for Heroes Save the World stated that it would be returning in mid-April. The time that it's taking me to recover from eye surgery is forcing me to put that on the back burner if I want to stay on top of school and so on, so expect it to resume updating in August instead. I have an outline for the next thirteen chapters and several of them are written up already, but I want to wait until the sequence is complete before I release anything (so that I can revise earlier chapters if necessary).

** [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/thunderbolt-fantasy/episode-1-code-of-umbrellas-716075][Thunderbolt Fantasy]] is probably my favorite new "anime" series of the year so far (as in, that I've watched since 2018 started, not that has come out). It has one of, if not the, best Trickster Thief/Rogue character archetype I've ever seen. There's also a fantastic Wandering Swordsman archetype in the main character. Both are unique in ways I can't discuss without spoilers. The movie is fantastic too.

If anyone's bothered by the medium, I was a bit too at first, but stopped even noticing they were puppets within 2 or 3 episodes. Give it a bit to see if it draws you in with the great writing and music and characters. It's by Gen Urobuchi, who wrote a lot of fantastic manga/anime, such as Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, and Psycho-Pass.

To those who have seen the series and movie...

*** I've moved cross continent a couple times. My main advice is to accept that there's a financial cost to moving, and not try to transport anything that you don't absolutely need. Namely, try to move in one carload if you can. Anything more than that, and your moving costs are going to be more than just getting rid of things and re-buying when you get there.

Not exactly, but recently I've replaced my breakfast (previously milk+cereal) with milk+protein powder, which I'd think is a little comparable. Because it's just breakfast I don't get bored of the food, but I don't really /enjoy/ breakfast like I used to when I guzzled sugary cereal. YMMV, but I wouldn't suggest replacing more than a single meal, as you might run into a problem where you get frustrated and start "treating yourself" i.e., snacking on unhealthy stuff, undoing the work you'd put in.

Alternatively, if your rationale is ease-of-making, then look into getting a crockpot.

Keto chow I remember tasting good, but I had extraordinary gas and stomach instability from it. One of my prime reasons for liking Soylent is due to how even it makes my digestive system feel, so Keto Chow causing instability make it not worth using. I prefer to Keto Fuel, but not to any normal soylent/joylent.
