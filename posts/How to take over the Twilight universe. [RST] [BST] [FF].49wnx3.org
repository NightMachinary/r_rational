*** This is where Canon contradicts itself. Yes, it is stated that newborns are pretty mindless, but we can tell Bree Tanner wasn't or the other vampire she hung out with. According to the Second Short life, a lot of the vampires were fighting but how much of that was because their maker basically said sit here and do nothing all day. Victoria and Riley managed to organize an army of twenty in less than a year and kept a very hands off approach. This was while they were based in a city with all sorts of distraction.

***** I have read canon twilight (including the Bree Tanner side story) and can confirm that pretty much everything he said in that second comment was right. The newborn army gathered by Victoria was housed in a city (San Francisco IIRC) and, in very relative terms, didn't do that badly. There were an upswing in vicious murders (classic for newly born vampires that aren't as in control of themselves as they should be) in the area, which is how they were noticed in the first place, but still not enough to warrant immediate Volturi action. At least not for a year.

That being said, even your average vampire needs to feed, so you're still going to have issues with that, as the more concentrated your force is, the easier it is for the spike in kidnappings to be noticed. I say kidnappings because it should be very obvious that leaving the victim behind is an idiotic move, as you'd leave a bloodless husk. Something pretty noticeable and indicative of vampires.

****** So they didn't quite run around slaughtering people, but they caused a significant amount of death. That doesn't... invalidate the whole plan in theory, but it does change my calculus slightly.

Honestly this is the kind of thing I'd just wait for technology to fix. In an increasingly CCTV filled world, eventually a young vampire will show up on camera, and another, and another. It goes out on liveleak or youtube or torrents if those are compromised. Can't stop the signal, not forever. The masquerade crumbles and while the vampires are very strong, they are few. Humanity is many. I prefer my chances as one of a group of more sympathetic vampires helping the humans more than I like my chances in going undetected long enough to make an overwhelming alpha strike. As time passes and cyber prosthetics become an option the advantages of a Vampire over a human become fewer and lesser. Eventually all they have less is the magic. At some point they either stop eating people, or they die.

Messier, yes. I am simply not self-sacrificing enough to go for the other option, though. Perhaps a nuke to that city in Italy would be cleaner.

******* I just wish we had better numbers on how durable Twilight vampires actually were. Their skin's compared to stone a number of times, and the sparkle makes me conclude that the vampirization process changed their skin into some sort of crystal-like lattice. But I still don't know how durable they are. Are they bullet proof? Even if they weren't completely, they're clearly resistant to pain and seem to be fast enough that, even if you shot them once, you wouldn't be able to shoot them again. In addition, the Quilete wolves' claws and teeth have some magic that lets them break through the vampire's skin, so can we harness that? Can I extract the claws and teeth of a werewolf (I'm assuming it'll just grow back since they have healing factors) and tip bullets with them, making insta-vampire killing weapons?

Also, random ass side note, the only saving grace for humanity in twilight against the vampires spreading is how out of control newborns are. Hence they're unable to turn people since they just outright kill them instead. Plus the Volturi's self-interest leads to them policing the supernatural world for us.

** Can't believe I'm overthinking /Twilight/ stuff... but Luminosity and Radiance were pretty good so I don't feel too bad.

Issues I see:

1. Volturi have vamps with powers. Can't recall if they have as many in the original series as they do in Alicorn's stories, but at the very least they have a mind-reader, a shield-generator, an illusionist who can cause blinding pain, another that can cause sensory deprivation, and probably others. They might not have pre-cognition, but Alice does - and there's no telling if the Cullens would approve of your plan. Almost certainly not, since you're literally building up an army of new vampires to overthrow the old order.

2. Newborns are feral as hell, and much much stronger than older vamps. Hell, Jasper is like 160 years old and still has trouble controlling himself. It's quite possible that they would accidentally tear you apart as soon as they were turned (though the more preparations you make and the more successes you have, the lower the risk of this). There's also no guarantee they'd agree to your plan after turning - it can drive them insane. And the smell of humans may turn them frenzied for decades after - the smell of blood can do so even after a century (again, Jasper).

3. There's no guarantee that years from now the Volturi won't have made up some counter, or that the plan is still feasible. The problem with playing the long game is that technology is increasing so rapidly that parts of this may be obsolete by the time you're ready to start. You could try and use newborns and move up the time frame, but that risks them going crazy with bloodlust in a city. And the Volturi have dealt with newborn armies before.

I almost feel like the best way to wipe out the Volturi would be to study nuclear physics, learn to create a bomb, and wipe out the entire city with it. Hell, or find a way to steal or buy an old Soviet bomb. Horrific, inhumane, will throw the entire world into shock... but less risky than using an army of new vampires with flaming shotguns and combat training. Plus then there's no question of what to do with your army of vamps after overthrowing the vampire world order.

In all seriousness, nuclear materials are heavily controlled by non-Vampire governments for exactly this reason.

*** Unless the Volturi were involved with controlling nuclear warheads, I don't think it would be that hard for a few vampires to acquire one. Especially if you happen to have some sort of mind control power.

I also don't think flaming shotguns would even work. Vampires need to be dismembered before they're burnt, because their pieces can still move and can escape from the flames. They're really supposed to be quite hard to kill.

** Uhh how do you deal with the witches? Forget defeating the Volturi (who iirc have a shielder vamp in their retinue), how do you stay God Emperor if you are willing to turn people you consider to be desirable? There's no reason they can't end up with really OP ant-you powers. Also why do you expect that some of the soldiers wouldn't have anti-brain washing powers as well? Even if witches are relatively rare (in Luminosity they are, but in canon Twilight most vampires we see have some power), you still are talking about >200 total vampires (assuming that you consider >60 scientists etc. as desirables).

*** I forgot about the witches. If someone is found with powers and surrenders then I would offer them extra money, or power. I'm also hoping that they would stay loyal to their maker, aka me.

I'm going to do some basic math and see how often witches actually do pop up. Although I'd only be sampling from the list of known vampires in Twilight it should give me some sort of statistical basis on how many witches I can expert per vampire.

I'll be omitting Victoria's army from my calculations.

****** Well, burning you if they have slightest doubts about you /is/ opposing you. So by these standards you should expect your newborn vampires to try to kill you. If only because /not/ killing you is dangerous; you could get those doubts about any of them at any moment, and they will realise it. Plus then they can get a lot more money than you were giving them from selling the ranch and weapons.
