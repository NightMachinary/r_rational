** Here's a link to the first chapter: [[https://jdogmoney.wordpress.com/2015/03/28/chapter-one/]]

This chapter was late. I'm currently writing the next one as a bonus chapter to make up for it. I'll probably link to it in this thread when it's up, which will be soon.

** Quite the interesting story, I shall be following it. I am sorry but I do not have time at the moment to give an in-depth review but I will say that I am enjoying Charlie and his narration of the world around him.

** Nice. I admit I'm not sure what this part is about:

#+begin_quote
  A mix of frustration, anger, bewilderment, and several other emotions was flashing across Alyx's face faster than Charlie could keep up. Charlie began to chew the inside of his lip.

  Alyx fumed for a moment before taking a deep breath. She slowly asked “Are you being deliberately annoying?”

That might be intentional, if we don't yet know why Alex would react so, or it might be I missed something :P
