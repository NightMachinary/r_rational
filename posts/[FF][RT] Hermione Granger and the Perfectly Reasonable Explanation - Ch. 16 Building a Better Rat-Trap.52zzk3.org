** Awesome as ever.

About portraits (it's a detail, I know, but details is what reddit threads are for), Hermione thinks of them as "sentient if not sapient". Depending on the difference you make between the two words, of course, but it seems to me it is sapient that is 'basic' and sentient that is 'higher', not the other way around.

Also, why didn't Older Hermione try to stop Hermione from speaking with Quirrell's?

#+begin_quote
  "sentient if not sapient"
#+end_quote

It actually is that way. Sentient means "feeling", sapient means "reasoning". Here's a good brief discussion of it with source links - [[http://www.rebekkahniles.com/2012/03/word-box-sapience-vs-sentience.html]] An easy way to remember is that it's Homo Sapiens, not Homo Sentiens, and humanity is #1 at thinking (at least until 2029, if you lean that way).

Of course, the way portraits /behave/ in canon strongly suggests they /are/ sapient - they'd pass true Turing tests with flying colors (if you got modern ones, anyway) - but that's such an enormous ethical black hole we're forced to hand-wave it away and just say "but they're not" - everyone else certainly doesn't behave as if they have more ethical weight than (non-food) animals.

**** I see. Well I knew "sentient" meant "feeling" and "sapient" meant "reasoning", but I'd still argue it's in that way. You can make a reasonably well-reasoning computer, but never has a feeling one been made so far. So "sentience" still seems harder to reach than "sapience".

As for OH-non-intervention theories... the most obvious guess at this point is that she's already almost entirely "slipped". There is also the possibility that it was never an older Hermione, but an older whoever-else, who has been /pretending/ to be Hermione, but is actually not all that unhappy to help past!Voldemort's plans.

***** I think we must have different understandings of the state of MI and cognition research! Which projects are you referring to wrt. "well-reasoning", maybe I'm behind the curve on something?

****** I'm not saying we /can/, as of now, already make a computer that reasons as well as a human. But extrapolating from the current state of science, we can safely say (and it's not EY who'll disagree) that we /will/ be able to make a reasoning AI in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, giving your AI emotion is not something I believe we have clues as to how to do, so far.

******* Emulating (or simulating, depending on where you draw the line for "real") emotions in MI research goes back to the mid-late 80's, check out Google Scholar. Basic emotions can be mapped as fairly simple analog networks, but then you get into philosophical debates about whether the programs "really" "feel" them. I'm guessing that when you say "emotion" you're mostly talking about more complex sensation-action patterns that are harder to infer from behavior without complex outputs (natural language), or that require more complex inputs (recognizing the /implications/ of a complex situation in order to feed them into the emotional network and see how that should influence behavior, or future cognition). In that specific case, I suspect you're right that "advanced" cognition is probably a prerequisite for "advanced" emotion.

But sentience in general has a /very/ low bar - in ethical terms, as long as something can be said to "suffer", we tend to grant it certain limited rights (though more limited if we find it delicious), and pain/fear are among the easiest "feelings" to model. While in contrast, sapience has a very high bar - in terms of evolution, an enormous number of species have sentience, but extremely few (or one, again, depending on where you draw the line) have sapience.

When we're talking about portraits (and to a lesser extent, magical photographs), it raises the question of whether they (or the spells that produce them) are "designed" in a way that actually makes modern MI research a good metaphor, or whether magical shortcuts may be making things seem backwards? If a spell lets you give form to an "idea" that you feel you understand sufficiently ("I know it when I see it") but without needing to understand how it /works/, then what would otherwise be prerequisites may become entirely optional.

So perhaps it's possible to deliberately withhold sentience from something you've provided explicitly with sapience, but I think if you /do/ have the methods to produce the latter, you're very likely to be also able to produce the former, whether you choose to or not.

All that said, even if Portraits /were/ sapient, magical society has a deliberately regressive view of sapience in general - there are multiple races (not even species, since many of them can interbreed with humans) that have /obvious natural language/, and even demonstrably human-equivalent (or superior) intelligence and /still/ have restricted rights.

But at least in canon, portraits do not teach classes (even if they might seem better at it than Binns, who is the /worst/ canon case for sapience, ghost-wise) or even give guest lectures, they do not design new spells (even if they might need someone living to test them), they don't write new books, and these are things I'd expect to see if they were sapient. While they do exhibit anger, fear, self-preservation, loneliness/friendship, loyalty, superiority/disgust, most of which are sufficient for a label of sentience even taken individually, let alone collectively. That seems to say, at least in canon, that sapience is demonstrably not required for sentience, though it does not necessarily imply the converse, as we have no canon examples or counter-examples.

And now I've used up all my writing time for the day, but occasional deep-dives in relevant contexts are often helpful for later writing, so I still consider it time well-spent. :)

******** Quite an excellent piece you wrote there, and much more detailed an answer than I'd ever hoped for. Though I see your point, I do think "sentient" is used in HPMOR context as more than "can feel pain". Take Harry's "/SNAKES ARE SENTIENT?/" about Parseltongue.

********* I noticed this, and though I respect EY as a writer, I breezed right past it at the time on the presumption that he'd made the common SF mistake of confusing sentience and sapience.

Though that /would/ be odd, given his background. I suppose it's possible that he considers "sapience" too fuzzy of a term and prefers "intelligent" or "self-aware" for the same purposes, but that still wouldn't explain why he didn't use one of those in that context?

I did a quick search, and there was a thread where someone asked specifically what Harry/EY meant by "sentient", and EY never chimed in. But he did mention "sapience" once wrt. learning the word from [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137][Little Fuzzy]], which is the same place I learned it. He even equates it to "personhood", which if applied to the snakes thing would make Harry's /surprise/ actually make sense, where no widely-used definition of sentient does that I can see.

So, yeah, I've got nothing. But then, HGPRE is and has always been a Canon-fic, not an HPMOR-fic, so I'm ok with that. :)
