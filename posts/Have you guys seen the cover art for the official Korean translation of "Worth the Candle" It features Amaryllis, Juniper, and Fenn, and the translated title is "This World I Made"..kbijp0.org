**** It's authorized, yes. I get a check every quarter for my share of whatever it earns, but otherwise don't pay attention to it whatsoever, mostly because I don't speak Korean and it has virtually no impact on the original (aside from the fact that English-speaking fans seem to find its existence funny/curious). I consider it a pretty sweet deal, because it generates passive income for me at virtually no cost.

But I really hope they got AlexanderWale's permission for this. Because charging money to read each chapter when the original is posted for free? Not cool.

EDIT: Oh good, he gave permission for this. I thought it might have been plagiarized-translations, because I'm so used to scummy behavior of translation sites. Specifically Qidan.

*** Kind of weird to call out Qidan here, given they're a major driver of the move /away/ from the behaviour you're objecting to, translation without permission or compensation of the original author.

Not that the controversy around Qidan isn't at least somewhat justified, as they did screw over fan translators (at least some of which were probably legal at the time) but just that it doesn't really fit the argument you made.

***** I have seen some complaints about translator contracts (eg. translator relinquishes rights on content to Qidan, non-disparagement, etc.), but the complaints along those lines never held much water to me, as that all seems about what one would expect for contract work.

****** It's not just their extremely predatory contracts which strips any right over an author's work, it's also that they have no oversight when it comes to whether or not a work belongs to the person submitting it. You can plagiarize a story and submit it to Qidan as if it's yours, and Qidan will do absolutely nothing to enforce copy-right despite evidence to the contrary. [[https://whatsawhizzerwebnovels.com/why-do-people-hate-qidian-webnovel/][Source]]

It may be confusing since I'm saying author/translator as if they're the same. Part of the reason is because they treat the two essentially identically.

I'm just going to end it here, because looking up the details on what Qidan's actions is making me very angry and I'm done with feeling like that today.

Don't they now also have the option of a royalty share contract, where that isn't the case? I'm going by [[https://acts.webnovel.com/2018/62185143/index.html]], which lists both options.

********** True, my bad. I'll list other things Qidian has done then. Qidian has lied in press releases to manipulate the public, and hired fake accounts to sway public opinion.

They've bought out translation companies and forced new licenses on the translators while keeping details on the license under NDA. Qidian pays authors and translators pittances, as low as $5 per chapter.

Qidian has even used machine translation and still paywalled the garbage content at the same price, which is tremendously unfair to the authors.

It's pretty black and white, Qidian is unethical, predatory, anti-consumer, and anti-translator, and anti-author. The vast majority of Qidian profits go to the company owners, so the increased paywalling and prices can't even be justified as paying the author for their work.

Nobody is forced to work for Qidan, so this isn't exactly evil. If translators weren't willing to take Qidan's prices they'd work for competitors instead. Earnings depend on popularity.

** This really feels full circle... the Gamer, a Korean webtoon, was/is a major milestone in the development of the LitRPG genre and established a lot of the trope that WtC subverts, deconstructs, and reconstructs. I am pretty sure lots of RPG-mechanics settings (in which game mechanics are literally part of the world m) predate it but I think the Gamer is one of the first works in which the RPG mechanics was a unique ability of the main character.
