** Nice update. Haku's scene was promising. I suspect the plan is to assassinate the bridge builders and avoiding fighting Kakashi. I wonder if there will be a Haku and Naruto meeting before then?

*** Once a week - in theory. So if all goes well I should be able to update again this sunday. But, you know how it goes with real life...

I'm curious, actually: Does it matter much to people whether updates are regular and on time? Or is it just a case of 'more is always better, I'll take it when I can get it'?

**** I just binge read everything that you had written so far and enjoyed it. It's a little of both, I prefer for updates to be regular just so I'm not checking back all the time or worrying that I missed one but more is certainly better. Real life certainly gets in the way some times though and I doubt anyone will fault you for any inconsistency there. I'm liking the series and I'm curious to see where it goes from here. What made you decide to have Jiraya be involved with the story early on?

***** Hmm, Jiraiya was a pretty easy decision: The concept is that this is a rational rewrite of Naruto, and leaving Naruto an orphan was one of the dumbest things in the series both A) on the part of the Hokage and B) hugely irresponsible on the part of Jiraiya (or even Kakashi for that matter). Someone had to take care of him and Jiraiya was the obvious choice.

Besides, Jiraiya is awesome, and more of him is always better.

****** I definitely agree on the last count.
