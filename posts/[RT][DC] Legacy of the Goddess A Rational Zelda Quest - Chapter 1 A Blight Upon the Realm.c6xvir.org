[[https://chaossnek.com/Story?chapter=C1][Chapter 1: A Blight Upon the Realm]] ~5k words.

It begins! A little more action-y than I had planned. I hope that doesn't drive away potential readers. I'm still getting the hang of this whole writing thing, so bear with me while I work out the kinks.

SV thread can be found [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.55903/][here]]. If you want to follow the story, I recommend either participating in the quest directly or subscribing to updates on my website.

(I can assure you that the subscription feature has definitely been there the whole time and that I definitely didn't just add it.)

Hope you enjoy. Come drop by the thread and say hi!


** Not to try to tell you what to do, but wouldn't it make more sense to include the prologue chapters in your SV thread /before/ chapter 1 rather than have a very easy to miss link to them after it? Either way your story's been pretty great so I'm looking forward to following along!

*** [[/u/-vecht-]] : I very strongly second this. At the very least move the prologue links to the top of the first post.

*** Just register an account and select the subscription option. If you've already registered, it's under "Update Preferences" on the top right.

** I've never followed a quest before, but I like zelda and this seems well written so far, so I'll give it a shot.

** Tbb I was kinda disappointed to find out what sv means. I kinda need an R!Zelda in my life now that I'm aware of the idea but judging by the first 90 chapters of that Naruto one, sv leads to extremely bland characters and a story that is entirely lacking in things like foreshadowing and story structure, because neither the authors nor the storyboard committee know what direction it's going to go in or even who'll be around at the next committee meeting to cast their votes.

I'll be following with some interest for at least a few chapters so I hope it turns out it's a matter of skills and not an emergent property of the system.
