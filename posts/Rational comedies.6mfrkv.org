Reading ratfics, I notice they are often a bit on the dark side of storytelling, if not outright grimdark. Sometimes (read: almost always), however, I want to read stories that follow rational tropes, but are lighthearted in nature and generally aim to get a smile out of you (and no, occasional funny moment, like in MoL, doesn't qualify).

Can you make some suggestions? Thanks!

** Hm.

[[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11361802/1/What-if-SG-1-weren-t-stupid][/What if SG-1 weren't stupid?/]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11530632/1/Supernaturally-Rational][/Supernaturally Rational/]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11583263/1/Episodic-Parody-The-Flash][/Episodic Parody: The Flash/]] would probably count.

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/][/A Modern Myth/]] is fairly light-hearted, but I'm not sure if it's light-hearted enough.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/Harry Potter and the Natural 20/]], /Harry the Hufflpuff ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][{1}]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7330591/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-2][{2}]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10843543/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-3-Harry-s-Year-off][{3}]])/ and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][/Seventh Horcrux/]] are fun, but their rationality is dubious.

That's... all, off the top of my head.

*** Out of these, I have read HPN20 (it's so irrational it goes around and approaches rationality from the other end, it's a masterpiece XD) and Seventh Horcrux (amusing book, I rather liked it, but it wasn't awesome).

I'll be sure to check all the other, thanks!

*** Ok, I finished reading them. The best part? Tonight I was home alone, so I could laugh a loudly as possible.

Which leaves me with a problem though: I crave more, and there is nothing to quench this thirst with.

P.S. Did you get how LazyHarry got the Stone in the first fic? He has it for some reason when facing Quirrelmort in the final, but he didn't get the Mirror room.

Quirrel somehow managed to extract it on his own, if I recall correctly.

** It is not a rarfic, but if you have not yet done so, check out Catch-22 for a comedy about how non-rational the world and people actually are.

*** Black comedy coupled with venomous satire also doesn't count.

Edit: I mean, the book is good, and I have read it a few years ago. It's just not the kind of comedy I'm looking for here.

** A Black Comedy, by the same author as Seventh Horcrux. If you liked the latter, you'll like the former. Basically a buddy-cop story between Harry and Sirius, except they aren't cops, and they don't respect the law at all, and in fact make a mockery of self-respecting institutions such as the Wizengamot,

Don't let the title fool you, it's really got very little super serious stuff. There is a bit of seriousness, but it's pretty dedicated to being humorous throughout. Not quite a crack fic, but as close as you can get without being one. It's kinda like the silly portions of HPMOR except a whole story of them.

(also, it's the origin of the name David Monroe. or at least it's where Eliezer got the name from. Warning: if you haven't read HPMOR, reading this fic and learning about the character David Monroe could spoil the big reveal in HPMOR.)

It's not, totally different authors. Also: not exactly what I'd call rational. Their decision making process often borders on "what do I feel like doing right now?"

And yeah, it's only rational in the Pratchett sense. Meant to mention that.
