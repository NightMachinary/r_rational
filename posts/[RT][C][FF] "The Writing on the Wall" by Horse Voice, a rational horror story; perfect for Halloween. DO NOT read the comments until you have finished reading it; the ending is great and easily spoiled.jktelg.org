** Haha, I figured out what was going on as soon as they mentioned the spikes. Still a cool concept for a horror story!

Here's the [[https://wipp.info/][WIPP]] website that talks about the topic. It's a really cool (and creepy) read.

** One thing that bugs me about this.

The site references that it will be safe after 100,000 years. By which, I would have to guess that it means the material within would be safe to handle by that point.

You don't pick a number like "100,000" because it's an accurate representation of how much time it will take, but rather because 10^{5} is an easy number to express and communicate, and in the right approximate order of magnitude. At the same time, people will take that reassurance literally, so you don't want to guess low: the actual safe number is probably somewhere in the order of magnitude below that (10,000-100,000). Maybe a number higher within that order of magnitude, but certainly not accurate to within 5,000 years.

My point is that 71,000 years into a 100,000 year (at most, possibly significantly less) waiting period of exponential decay, you should be /almost there./ If 10% is still there after 50,000 years, then 1% will still be there after 100,000 years, and that's still far too much, so the decay rate must be much faster than that. Let's say they chose a period that would leave roughly 1 ppm of the original radioactive substance after 100,000 years: after 71,000 years, >99.99% of the dangerous material would already have to be gone.

Which is to say, if, after 71,000 years of radioactive decay, this stuff is still killing people who just spend a few hours in the hallways surrounding the storage chambers, there's no way that it would be safe to handle after 100,000 years.

*** A mitigating factor is that it's clearly not stored properly any more - previous expeditions have broken into the site and attempted to remove the material starting 26000 years in.

The nightmare scenario - IRL too - is that all the warnings attract attention and then convince someone to try using it as a weapon... better to bury the stuff deep next to a subduction zone IMO. (But that wouldn't help with cold war sentiment, so.)

**** Containment breach does not slow down the decay.

The obvious fix is the right one - just add more zeroes to the target number to make the story more realistic.

**** This is all true I feel, assuming that radioactive decay occurs the same way in a world of magic ponies as it does in our reality. It's the Author's choice for the sake of the story by the author, such that by the end of the story the symptoms are obvious and horrific. Maybe the Idea that it's 'nearly safe' (the characters admit it is not within their civilisations lifetime) adds something to the story?\\
Still, a lot of these assumptions seem reasonable. Realism could be better represented by increasing the exposure time of the afflicted characters, or showing that the radioactive material had been moved closer to the surface by previous expeditions, or as above, setting the story earlier into the decay.

Maybe at t = 0, the lethal dose was much less than few hours and the decay is fast enough that after 71,000 years, you're "almost there," but few hours is still enough to get a lethal dose.

(But I have no idea if it wouldn't have melted whatever it was stored in if it was that radioactive at the beginning.)

** The danger of spoilers is strong with this one so I urge anyone to please follow OPs advice and read the damn story.

That being said, this story taps into one of my favourite brands of existential dread, and even this specific concept which has ignited a great deal of creativity in me. Awesome of you to share, thank you.

** I would rather not interpret this as being about radioactive waste, even if that might be what the author says (?). The story would be far more compelling and horrific if it is literally some kind of spreadable magical fire, or maybe nanotech gone awry.

Containment breach on 71,000 year old radioactive waste just isn't that scary, especially if it is "safe" at 100,000 -- with exponential decay the danger is already almost completely gone in that case, proportionately, and if it's the kind of dump than humanity is making, at that point the main risk would be, like, heavy metal poisoning if it got in the water.

This shouldn't even be something that decays exponentially... unless there was somehow originally SO MUCH that it could destroy the entire world as a single point, so now there would only be enough to destroy something like 1/100th of the world, and the threshold of "safe" was that it only destroy 1/10,000th of the world. idk. But then, most of the world would still be shielded from the beginning by, well, the world.

Ultimately, I don't think it matters much what it is, so long as it's something scarier than radiation. Honestly, better it be something nameless. Something that actually breaks after 100,000 years. The story does a really good job of setting up this atmosphere of ancient horror, so saying it's radiation kind of spoils it. I think it is fine to take inspiration from humanity's radiation containment so long as that isn't actually what is contained here.

*** >! An ancient civilization might choose to surround the tunnel into their dump site with the most dangerous, longest-lasting stuff they have access to. If someone is stupid enough to ignore the fact that everyone who discovered the site previously sealed it up the way they found it and then copied the warnings into every language they know (implying that people who didn't know why the thing was built rapidly learned), they probably won't be stupid enough to ignore their people dying horribly before they even get to the actual dump. !<

So you weaponize the tunnel itself against invaders. I predict that the stone of the tunnel is made of some highly radioactive material specifically designed to last way, way longer than any of the actual waste in the site. They made the tunnel tens of miles long both to make it easy to truck material in and so when they closed the site and put up the kill aura panelling, it would have enough time to work on people even right up to the time the rest of it became safe. This becomes part of the warning: the immediate fulfillment of the curse at the entrance, which terrifies any interloper enough to do as the builders wanted them to do from the beginning.

Leave and never return. !<
