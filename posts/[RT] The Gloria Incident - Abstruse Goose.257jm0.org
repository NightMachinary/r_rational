** I really like this.

I don't have much education, but I have enough education to get an idea how much I don't know and how much I don't understand about the world. I don't really like to use those stoner sounding cliche words to describe the world, so let's try this: ~99,9% of the stuff I personally witness is normal e.g. it resides in the mental category of 'normal'. For that very reason I wouldn't call it "marvelous" or "bizarre". But for much of that stuff I don't understand very well how it works on a fundamental level. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Some of it might as well be magic for me, but still "normal". And this realization gives me an interesting feeling.

** I always prefer the brutal truth to a pleasant lie.

Nevertheless, I feel a sense of loss when I experience what this comic represents; the real world feels smaller, somehow, than the fantasy world the original idea provides.

It is in these moments that I most understand the pull of religion, of superstition, of irrational and comforting lies.

I wonder if anyone here feels as I do, and if there is a particular method you follow to help with that sense of loss. It tends to take me a while to recover that sense of wonder and beauty that the real world can, at other times, so easily provide.

**** I'd add [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/hp/feeling_rational/][/Feeling Rational/]] and note that things which help for me include acts of creation (anything from software to sculpture to a stranger's smile), gaining an understanding of something, spending time with people close to me, and going outside and deliberately /appreciating/ the world. It'll probably be different for anyone else, but the main thing is to give yourself permission to feel /and/ to deliberately influence what you're feeling. Remember: a stupid thing that works, isn't stupid.

*** Knowing the cause and reasons behind a pleasant experience doesn't diminish the pleasure, it only removes the imagined portion of that experience. If you are speeding down the road and feel a sense of acceleration, knowing what causes that feeling doesn't remove it from your feelings, but only removes a sense of wonder and any fantastical theories you may have about that feeling. There exist actual wonders of the world and if you want to experience them you have to actually make an effort.

It doesn't /have to/, but for many people it often does. There's an important distinction there between perception and reality; and it's normal to be out of control of your own emotions.
