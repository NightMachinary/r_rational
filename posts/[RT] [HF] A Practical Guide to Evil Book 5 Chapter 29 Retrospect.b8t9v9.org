** The chapter in which Cat finally realizes that her panicked jumping from one crisis to another looks a lot like an eldritch horror snowballing into a reckoning for everyone on the continent who ever hurt Callow or didn't stop those who did.

** I loved this chapter and this style of writing (which isn't surprising given the subreddit). Its rare to see a character explicitly modelling another characters thought process and rarer still to see it done well (both the modelling and the writing of it). Its strange that it is so, I feel like it implicitly undergirds a good majority of human interaction.

** This kind of chapter is what makes me have real respect for EE as an author. Instantly recontectualises the last few books, in a way that seems totally obvious in retrospect

*** Honestly, it's kind of amazing EE's facility with story tropes and how he seemlessly integrates them in a good story, balancing plotting, action and character development, at the same time.
