It is popular in fictions that when a disaster strikes (usually what can end the world like global disaster, zombie outbreak, alien invasion, AI berserk...), the government fail to do anything and the whole society collapses. However, I don't think the government is that useless. With their power, they can know some signs of a disaster happening beforehand and prepare some measures for it. What do you think the government have in hand when they know a disaster will strike?

I also want to ask a topic related to it, if the government decides to evacuate the citizen, how will they do it? I'm reffering to specific things like how they will distribute the rations, how they get the supply, where the medicines are taken from.


** Unfortunately for storytelling, a rational response to a disaster often makes it... not a disaster. Take a zombie outbreak, for example. The rational response was best depicted in [[https://xkcd.com/734/][this xkcd]], which doesn't even get to the point of a government needing to do something.

In any such disaster, there will be many more intervention points, at which the crisis could have been averted. In order for you to have a story in which a disaster threatens to end civilization, people need to have made bad decisions over and over and over again, until things have finally gone so wrong that the problem is big enough, or has been ignored for long enough, that it's too late to respond effectively. Basically, disaster stories always start with the government holding the idiot ball.

Given all that, if you'd like to read stories about governmental responses to disasters, there are plenty of real-life examples. Of course, the most rational responses are the ones where there was no actual disaster, because of preparations made ahead of time. Unfortunately, it's a little harder to find information on that sort of scenario, because it's less newsworthy when nothing bad happens.

*** The first thing I can think of is the opening of Evangelion (which is not, of course, a rational show by any measure, but anyways...). The military knows than an Angel is coming and are well prepared with armour, aircraft, and a nuke (? some kind of huge bomb at least). The reason these preparations don't trivialize the show is that they all turn out to be /insufficient/, as the Angel shakes off or regenerates from all the damage it takes from mundane weapons - to the surprise of the military.

We can take some inspiration from this scene in designing a disaster which is known ahead of time and prepared for. I think you only need one element to make a rational large-scale response to a disaster still have tension and stakes: information! If the preparation is made with certain incorrect information in mind - details about the disaster which are reasonably thought to be accurate turn out to be inaccurate, or the scale of the disaster turns out to be more focused or more broad than was reasonably expected - then an interesting story can be built out of both the discovery that the prepared resources aren't appropriate to solve the problem, and the reaction of the first responders needing to find a way to use said resources creatively to either solve the problem anyways or, if you want to be darker, just /mitigate/ the damage/loss of life.

So basically, plans made on incorrect or insufficient information plus competent and interesting characters figuring out where their information is wrong and then using available resources to do the best they can once they have better information. Which is... one of the main ways to make /anything/ go wrong in a rational story, isn't it?

****** Anime used to have a bit of a nuclear taboo (Japan being unique in having citizens whose families died in a nuclear attack).

Evangelion's N^{2} mines are one example. Others include Macross and its 'Reaction Weapons'; Gall Force and its SVE missiles and to a lesser extent Code Geass and its FLEIJA weapon. More recently, Zankyou no Terror (a show with terrorist protagonists threatening a nuclear attack on Tokyo) somehow managed to make it through the entire series without ever actually using the words 'nuke' or 'nuclear weapon', instead euphemistically referring only to 'stolen plutonium' and the like.

In Japan, only /villains/ use nukes. (See: Legend of the Galactic Heroes and its Westerland Massacre, or M'Quve's threat in Mobile Suit Gundam)

The latest generation of anime has more or less moved past it (see No Game No Life's shiritori game, for example), but its a noted writing quirk through to the early '10s.

A zombie outbreak story, only maybe the infection is already airborne and in the water and also has carriers in both animals, insects, and people; and the protagonists effectively are the government, so there are actual stakes. If they fail, then civilization as we know it falls.

Essentially, make the story about the government response to the apocalypse, and write some nice Competence Porn. Like how everybody is really good at their jobs and smart in The Martian, and yet it's still a gripping story.

Take a look at the handling of hurricanes in south eastern US.

This is an annual event -- these things happen ALL THE TIME. Yet these areas keep getting hit and the response is often dramatically insufficient, resulting in thousands of deaths and billions in property damage.

in terms of an outbreak, governments might step in once things get /really bad/ by closing airports or investing in vaccination research at the extreme, but mostly just put out advisory warnings and maybe do a bit of preventative sanitation or pest extermination controls.

I have a buddy who works in disaster simulation. He builds computer models of what might happen if terrorists poisoned the water supply, or shut down electricity in a metro area, or released a biohazard. It's not good. The incompetence of government response is mostly offset by the disorganization and incompetence of malicious agents. I mean, do you think the TSA is a rational and effective response to 9/11?

I'm totally willing to bite this bullet. Unlike most people in bad climactic environments in the world (where they're stuck with that environment because that's /their whole country/), Puerto Ricans are US citizens and can freely move and live anywhere else in the US---most of which /does not/ have natural disasters striking it every eight years. An entirely-rational Puerto Rican population (or, say, an entirely-rational population of New Orleans) would pack up and emigrate /en masse/ to any random safe part of the continental US.

If a population that was constantly being struck by natural disasters decided that it /wanted/ to migrate like that, I don't think that the government---whether through organizations like FEMA, or perhaps other departments---would be at-all against helping them to do so. For the government to reject the idea would be like an insurance company deciding not to pay for statins for a client with a heart condition! A prophylactic is /much/ cheaper than a rescue, and government agencies know that. People just don't want the help, usually.

Because these drills are multi-agency, if you want the real nitty-gritty details you should be able to get a lot of paperwork from FOIA requests and from agency-published afteraction reports.

Beyond that specific example, you'd want to refer to published plans and historical records for hurricane, fire, earthquake, flood, and terrorism-driven evacuations of cities, suburbs, and rural areas. Particular places to start would include the graphic novel edition of the 9/11 Report, the one-year retrospectives of Hurricane Harvey, any historical study of Hurricane Katrina, of the Fukishima nuclear disaster, of the Haitian earthquake, of any Pacific tsunami in the last 20 years, of the refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe, or of Puerto Rico after the 2017 hurricane season.

Sometimes this is accomplished by covering up the incident (or diminishing its extent), because a govt that doesn't let disasters happen in the first place is viewed as more competent than one where they do happen.

Nevermind that this impedes rescue and disaster relief, and when the truth inevitably gets out it's a much larger loss of face.

No, Trump cannot be impeached. It is literally impossible (not enough seats coming open) for the Democrats to get a 2/3 majority in the Senate, which means they cannot impeach him without assistance from a sizable number of Republicans. That is not going to happen; the Republicans have clearly demonstrated that they will stand with Trump even if he beats a puppy to death with the corpse of a nun. The one /POSSIBLE/ exception to this is if Mueller comes back with clear evidence that Trump committed treason, but I wouldn't count on it; the definition of treason is very narrow, so it's unlikely that Trump committed that precise crime. Even then, I'm not sure it would be enough. He's done such a good job of poisoning the well that most Republican-leaning people would just assume that news coverage of such a crime was fake news.

There is some hope on this front. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact][National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] is a movement among the states to say "From now on, we're going to give all our electors to whomever wins the popular vote". It doesn't go into effect until enough states have signed up that they control 270 electoral votes, but they're halfway there already. It would be a way to effectively eliminate the electoral college and stop letting the Republicans scuttle into office when the populace didn't want them. (No, that is not my bias. There have been 5 EC-only presidents, and all of them were Republicans aside from JQA, who was a Democratic Republican because the modern Republican party didn't exist yet.) If the Compact goes into effect, the Republicans will have a very hard time getting another President into office: "As of October 2017, Gallup polling found that 31% of Americans identified as Democrat, 24% identified as Republican, and 42% as Independent."

Also, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting_in_the_United_States][Maine and a handful of cities]] are currently using instant-runoff voting, so there's a chance we can move away from the FPTP. There's no Constitutional mandate for it, so all that's necessary is to convince people at the local level.

#+begin_quote
  How much long-term damage will Trump do to the credibility of the USA?
#+end_quote

All of it. He will almost certainly make it to the end of his term -- Mueller still needs to finish the investigation and then the Republicans can probably slow-walk the trial long enough to stall until 2020.

As to him getting re-elected...it's not just possible, I think it's actually likely unless something changes. His [[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/][approval ratings]] have been going up steadily this whole year and he's currently running in the >40% range -- shoot, the WSJ had him at 46% a couple weeks ago. (Ignore Rasmussen. They've been a significant outlier since Trump first announced his candidacy.)

Nearly everyone who is slightly conservative is probably going to vote for Trump if they get the chance, since:

- The stock market keeps going up. (Who cares that ~70% of Americans have no stake in the stock market and that it's looking like a bubble anyway?)
- Unemployment keeps going down. (Who cares that that's provably momentum from Obama, since Trump's policies have generally not helped?)
- He's "making NATO pay their fair share." (And also destroying our relations with our allies and giving power to Russia and China.)
- Most importantly: Trump's already put one conservative on the SCOTUS, and if Trump is in office for another 6 years then there's a decent chance that Ginsberg will retire and Trump will get to put another justice in. That would give the conservatives a 6-3 majority on the SCOTUS and reshape the country for a generation.

**** There are a couple kinds of pattern-match problems. One is 'sincere' where the generals write guides on how to fight the last war. This creates friction when the new war is different.

A more comedic problem comes when plans use fantastic names in a very non-literal way. The CDC 'Zombie Guide' wasn't really about Zombies. They're just using 'zombies' to introduce the general idea of disaster preparedness. Since the plan isn't actually intended to be about zombies (but about real-world threats) it omits stuff like 'motorcycle armor.'

I can see this coming up if the US wants to write plans about invading an allied or politically sensitive country.

You don't want to write "what if [Ally]'s religious minority grows in population, gets radicalized, and starts a low-grade insurgent warfare targeting major infrastructure projects?" because that document would be subject to FOIA, and is just not-impossible-enough that people would take real-world offense. At the same time, you want people thinking through real-world scenarios.

So, you'd do a find/replace, and put a fantasy gloss on the whole thing. Don't say "radicalized" we say "controlled by alien space bats." You don't say "internment camp" you say "space-bat decontamination facility." And then have a plan where people controlled by the alien-space-bats have exactly the combat capabilities, logistic and morale problems that would be faced by a partially-identifiable civilian insurgency in France.

This lets your staff think through a 'realistic' scenario, but means that you don't get hauled in front on congress to explain why you're invading an ally. And, the fantasy gloss -- insurgents have big space-bat hats, and not clothes identified with real-world culture -- means that whole operations would be less offensive to the participants.

The funny part comes when literal Space Bats invade. And then some Lt does the find, and gets reams of detailed counter-space-bat insurgency instructions, none of which are actually intended to be about Space Bats.

***** It lasts for 90 days at the maximum withdrawal capacity, meaning if you're going through the stockpile as fast as you can. I don't know how fast you'd go through rationing, but the stockpile is Ω(90 days). I'm not too familiar with the specifics, if they're even declassified, but I do know that there are plans in place to rebuild from everything up to a nuclear war (under the optimistic assumption there are even any people left alive). It might require adopting 1911 era weapons and giving up on vehicles for a while, but it's possible. The general idea, as I understand it, isn't to treat it as a military operation in the usual sense but to prevent the breakdown of social order at all costs while trying to rebuild the supply chains necessary to keep people alive.

From the perspective of what characters see, depending on how close you are to a military base I'd expect them to show up at most a few weeks after the event, institute martial law, and start handing out food rations.

** The place to start would be the [[https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/programs/emergency-services/operations-support/national-incident-management-system-nims][National Incident Management System]].

This is how the US government organizes teams for response to wildland fires, military action, and natural disasters.

It's an excellent system. The basis is to get people who have an understanding of what resources are needed and how to get them on site as soon as possible and then get them ordering resources as smoothly as possible. It puts a lot of weight on logistics and operations in order to make sure everyone gets fed and has a place to sleep. On top of that things like daily briefings and after action reports keep things improving.

If there were any major crisis in the US, you can guarantee that is the system that ground teams would be working from.

** Look at how the government plans for current disasters. What is publicly available of the disaster response to a nuclear war is a good place to start. Also look into first hand accounts from areas that have been hit with large hurricanes, that's how they would deal with rations and so on. The short version is martial law->food and water->temporary shelter->rebuilding, all of this until the last one being handled by the military. I believe people are given ration cards and rations are airlifted in if the roads are inaccessible, but don't quote me on that.

The plans for a nuclear war would probably be closer to what you're looking for, because they assume all other institutions have broken down. Hurricane and other real life examples of disaster response rely on having a large amount of industry and food to bring into the area, with the only limit being logistics.

There are a lot of smart people who are very good with logistics who have planned for major disasters, you would need to somehow render the military ineffective for this sort of collapse to work. In other words, the most believable thing that could cause a major collapse like this is a massive war, nothing else can really cripple every disaster relief option simultaneously. If you have a rational alien invasion or berserk AI you're screwed anyway, there won't be people around to relieve for very long.

** This question is quite general. Governments have a wide variety of contingency plans, from battling epidemics to safeguarding VIPs to responding with military intervention to civil unrest or disasters. Not all of these plans have been, or can be, fully vetted. Most are not known to us. And, of course, disasters can happen that the government is utterly unprepared for. I'd come up with a more concrete scenario and then research that one specifically.

*** If possible, I'd like to hear about zombie outbreak. It's a bit on fiction side but more tangible than an AI berserk or alien invasion .

** The Nightmare Stacks by charles stross is how UK would deal with an ELF invasion.

He for once did a lot of reasearch and portrayed in what I believe a pretty realistic way (in universe, which features lovecraftian monsters).

Main point of that book is that military have contigency plans for EVERYTHING. alien invasion included.
