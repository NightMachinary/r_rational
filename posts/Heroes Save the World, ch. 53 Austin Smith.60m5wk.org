** This is longer than the usual fare, though not as long as the previous chapter. Either way, we've come a long way from the first sequence, when chapters averaged 1,091 words.

I anticipate that this sequence will be 18-20 chapters long, rather than 13, and will carry us to the end of 2014.

Alternative title for this sequence: "Bask in the Sunlight." I prefer the title "Sunlight," as it gives the impression that this sequence, specifically, is the sunlight that the characters (and audience) are basking in, but "Bask in the Sunlight" may be clearer about how this is a calm before the storm. Let me know which one you prefer.

*** I very much like 'Sunlight', together with that quote from the count of montecristo.
