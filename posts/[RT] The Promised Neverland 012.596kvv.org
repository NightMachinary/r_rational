*** I agree. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/52gmxb/rt_the_promised_neverland_006/d7lfor3/?context=3][I called it weeks ago.]] It's a such a typical shounen move. I'm dissapointed, to be honest.

** If they were paranoid enough they would have checked if Ray was an spy a long time ago, especially because he believed them too easily .I don't think he is the spy , although they have reasons to suspect him, he has shown that he is capable of at least try to abandon the other kids and probably the trap was also for Ray, maybe Norman told him something different from what he told the other two so the trap was also for him ( or he didn't do that but is going to bluff and try to get a reaction from Ray .Probably Norman is suspicious of Ray because he thinks Ray is capable of betraying them if he sees their chances Of surviving very low .

** Evidence? Who needs that? Let's make up our own improbable theories and turn out to be perfectly right!

Also, while I'm beating dead horses, racist portrayal of black woman is racist. I swear she's getting uglier by the minute.

I didn't really see much of that happening this chapter? Unless you mean the Ray thing, in which case I'm assuming Norman is asking to gauge his reaction to get evidence (Norman should know Ray pretty well) or we'll get the evidence next chapter. It's supposed to be an interest keeping cliff hanger.

**** I think most likely Norman didn't tell Don or Gilda anything about the rope, or he told them something completely different than what he told Ray.

So the fact that one of the ropes went missing means that Ray likely did it.

***** I'm thinking Norman told Don and Gilda the rope locations but Don was told privately by Norman about a different location than what Ray heard it was going to be since Norman couldn't be sure it was Ray if Don and Ray were told the same thing. Or maybe it's another bluff unless the next chapter reveals some other line of reasoning.

Three tests for trying to find out who is the snitch, or maybe four in this chapter. Norman questioning Emma about whether she would take a known spy as they escape, he seemed somewhat surprised at first by her answer, either by her naivety or the valuing of the spy's life. I think it's consistent with her character and Norman remarks that as well after she explains herself.

*** Jump. They need cliffhangers. If you read Death Note, try it again, but pay attention to the chapter breaks. More than once an inexplicable conclusion gets well supported by the time next chapter rolls out.

*** The evidence is only three of them know the location of the ropes and Ray is the one who says it's better to save the few.
