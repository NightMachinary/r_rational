** Not mine. Not sure how many of us are following this, but in case you missed it; a hell of a cliffhanger, with shenanigans incoming.

Considering how well she's taking this, she must have something up her sleeve.

*** Well she does have some necromantic ability herself, and shes already practiced possessing herself.

**** I'm not so sure.

That necromantic ability is tied to her name, and she just burnt the last chunk of her power to cast the curse.

Not to mention she does seem like the person to happily sacrifice herself for something as big as keeping a Hashmallim from entering the world.

If she survives I expect it'll be because of a new name that she receives in that moment, some shenanigans with a name that's less beholden to causality, or some shenanigans with the rule of three that she's still got with the Heiress.

***** Squire being transitional like it is I wouldn't be surprised if a new name popped up. She's built a cult of personality strong enough to form a new name in the form of Adjutant already.

Death Knight? Grey Knight? She's obviously not going to be a hero but maybe something neutral-ish like Ranger?
