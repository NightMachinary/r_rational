  They were in some kind of odd contest, where you tried to act as though the other person's tribulations were small potatoes, because all tribulations were

**** Thank you. I'm in the midst of a life-threatening cold at the moment so it was hard to focus through the mucus. Appreciate the assist.

** The more is revealed about demons, the more they seem like aliens. The mountain which is actually a ship - with two wings. Their world which can be shaped by stories, like a sophisticated simulation.

This chapter did a good job of clearing up some of the details. It felt good to have a clear explanation of how the stories effect demons and it made sense Winnum Roke would stay behind as a sort of entertainer that would keep demons occupied. The details all tie up, as far as I'm concerned.

** What a(n unsardonically) touching reunion.

The pug is totally a demon impostor. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogWasTheMastermind][Probably also the mastermind.]]

#+begin_quote
  *Simole:* The All-Father? That's my father's dragon.

  *Nic:* No. I don't think he is.
#+end_quote

Aw, Nic, must you dismiss [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6i12us/the_good_student_chapter_twenty_hfrt/dj2rlh4/][my predictions]] so offhandedly? But very well, I already have a new one: the pug is All-Father! It fits perfectly.

In actuality, I'm not sure why Nic trusts Winnum Roke's "true" fairy tale book. The Librarian already confessed to having "collaborated" with Roke on it, she had centuries alone with it, she was probably the one who subverted Roke's original plan and left her stranded for a millennium, et cetera. Is he sure there's no well-placed disinformation?

**** Which means the story of the All-Father will somehow let Nic become the All-Father?
