** I've recommended it a few times before, but /The Time Traveler's Wife/ is one of my favorite romance novels, in part because it's a more literary approach to stable time loops than you normally see (while including all the fun stuff like the ontological paradox, predestination, fighting fate, etc.).

**** The Company novels by Kage Baker are pretty strange but interesting time-travel romances that I quite enjoyed. First book is In The Garden of Iden. The books don't stand alone all that well, but as a series they're pretty decent.

Kage Baker's best single work is Anvil of the World, and it is really excellent but not a romance in any way.

** Probably one of my favorite video games of all time is METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM][(trailer)]].

You can buy it for console (PS3/360) or PC. I played it on PC using a gamepad (which works better than a mouse/keyboard for this I think). It's available on Steam here: [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/235460/]]

Yes that is an all caps name, for an ALL CAPS GAME. Is REVENGEANCE a word? No, but sometimes... in a world seeped in REVENGE, can man Rise above VENGEANCE?

First off, watch the trailer: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM]]

Now that you're done shitting yourself with how awesome this game is, buy it. It's on Steam, and also available for Xbox 360 and PS3. Are you not already buying it? Not convinced by its greatness? Watch mission 1 then:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDog3MzydJE]]

REVENGEANCE is like 90% boss fights, sweet sicknasty cutscenes, and slashing things with swords. Every design decision in this game was made in pursuit of the goal of "BE AS AWESOME AS POSSIBLE" (and yes, that is in all caps, like the name of this game). For example, literally everything. That's right, the entire game is an example of itself! The pacing of the game is turned up to 11/10, 100% of the time, with occasional breaks to let you catch your breath. Every cutscene is sweet. Every fight is amazing. The boss fights are awesome and when the bosses enter their final form the music (which is btw super awesome) gets extra hardcore. Every moment of this game is a dopamine rush. It's kinda exhausting in a way, and after playing it, other games seem shallow and meaningless in comparison. Can you really play something as slow-paced as Skyrim after living the AWESOME that is REVENGEANCE?

There's lots of little things too besides just the score. Like, the way you move around is well-designed, and the game designers went out of their way to make things convenient. You have infinite sprinting, no stupid stamina bars. You can slash and hack as much as you want, and instead of mp your mechanic for doing sweet things is either meter (which you can build up and then expend for bullet time swordslashing) or enemy damage. Weak enemies are susceptible to awesome finishing moves. The actual cutting, stabbing, and quicktime actions are super fun. The music and look of the game pump you up. This is a game meant for people who want to, for a time, live life in ALL CAPS.

If you get this game for PC, btw, make sure to play it with your gamepad and not mouse/keyboard. It plays much better that way.

I showed this game to a mixed audience of gamers and non-gamers and everyone came away thinking it was awesome. Everyone took turns playing and had fun. A game that's 90% cutscenes, bossfights, and sweet sword-swinging action with over the top music, sound, and amazing graphics is hard to beat. Of 5 people in the room with me, two went and bought the game the next day.

I have only one negative thing to say about this game (having played through about a third of it): after you play this game, other games become but a pale shadow of the true gaming experience. Honestly, this game ruins you for other games. It's THAT GOOD. This game leaves them all behind. Shit, the OST alone blows away so many game OSTs it's unreal.

Here's one song from an early boss fight: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlSgnpLbro]]

Also most bosses have their own unique boss fight music and the lyrics reflect that boss's life or inner life because that's more awesome and this game thrives on awesomeness

If you don't want to buy this game after the trailer, the OST, and watching mission one, I feel sorry for you, to lead such a gray and sad life. That being said, maybe it's the right choice. For like, weeks, all other video games were ruined for me after playing this game. I literally didn't play The Witcher III because every moment I spent in that game I was like "wow, this game is slow, boring, and unexciting compared to REVENGEANCE" and it was true.

*** To add on to this, the game has the best cutting system in all the world, literary any thing that can be cut (props, people, some buildings) can be cut in the exact place you want in as many possible pieces you can see with your eye, and then you can cut those pieces until the game cant render them anymore and your CUT NUMBERS (game counts cuts and gives more points for bigger number) rise into the hundreds.

Its true what Blazing said, other games after MGR feel slow, tedious and overall weak. On the plus side the full game has several difficulty levels, an OK parry system you can master for no damage experience, as well as buttload of challenge arenas.

The PC version GOES EVEN BEYOND THAT and includes the DLC campaigns for the BRAZILIAN SAMURAI an CYBORG DOG, who can also cut shit into infinity.

For added bonus, comple a certain mission and unlock a mariachi poncho and sombrero combo to wear during gameplay.

The other downside I can think of is the enemy count. That is to say there isn't enough of them to cut up.

This is the funniest summary I've read in a long time.

From my own archive, the most rational romance fics are

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5623923/1/The-Paladin-Protocol][Paladin Protocol]] - /Big Bang Theory/ with less nerd-blackface

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][Cadmean Victory]] - the only /Harry Potter/ fic with both dark magic and a romance arc worth reading. Really, really well written too.

**** I just can't get into Cadmean Victory. It has all these annoying cliches, which crop up constantly:

- Studying for one summer is enough for Harry to not only catch up to Hermione, but effortlessly surpass her in most subjects.
- Harry is naturally capable of using some kind of powerful battle conjuration without any training. Salazar Slytherin couldn't use it lightly in his prime, but Harry is capable of casting it with zero training. He manages it one time under pressure, which completely exhausts him, but after that he has no trouble repeating the feat and not suffering significant exhaustion.
- There is a portrait of Salazar Slytherin in the chamber of secrets, and he immediately recognises Harry as his heir and commits to helping him. There is a handy time turner nearby and of course there is a bunch of manuals about secret powerful magic.
- Harry is the first wizard ever to think of summoning a swarm of butterflies to tank the killing curse for him.
- Somehow Harry is the only male in the student body, who is not affected by the Veela.

And that's just in the first six chapters out of a hundred. Seriously, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]] was easier to handle. At least there Harry creates his advantages by doing something fairly unorthodox, instead of suddenly just becoming naturally special and better than his peers after his third year, or stumbling upon secret chambers full of powerful advisors, artefacts and grimoires. I can handle a certain amount of cliches as long as there is /something/ new, but this Cadmean Victory is just piling them one by one.

If you're really pining for some Harry Potter with dark magic and romance, I'd suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]]. It's far from a masterpiece, but I didn't have to force myself to keep reading it at least. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] might be worth checking out as well, if you're looking for something longer than 150 kilowords.

**** As an important note: I have read one other HP fic with a fantastic romance arc (and I suppose some dark-ish style magic). In fact, It might be the most "rational" romance focused story I've ever read and I highly recommend it. It was months ago when I came across it, and I cant remember its name, but It's an OC focused fic following a muggleborn Ravenclaw girl and a Slytherin boy with Veela heritage.

Tons of "communication and compromise are vital to a relationship" stuff and realistic and legitimately tense relationship conflicts. Manages to explore the wizard/muggle culture clash, wizarding politics, and consent incredibly maturely. If anyone recognizes which fic I'm talking about, I'd love to be reminded which is was.

*** If i remember correctly the best part about people lie was the interactions between hinata sasuke and naruto. Which were done extremely well. Also similarly to time braid it took some liberties with the setting that made it far less predictable and far more interesting. Having said that as opposed to time braid it had significantly less of an idea what to do with said setting and was never truly completed.

But it does end on a nice note, so would still say that anyone that liked the 3 member dynamic should give this one a read.

** On the video game front, I'd like to link an old game: [[https://www.gog.com/game/master_of_magic][Master of Magic]] (The link goes to GOG where you can buy it. Alternatively, you can find a [[http://www.myabandonware.com/game/master-of-magic-21t#download][DOSBox version]] if you're on Mac.)

If you read the reviews you will see a steady stream of "Best fantasy 4X game ever" and similar.

Want to know more? Take Civilization and cross it with Magic: the Gathering. Five color-themed schools of magic, hundreds of spells, dozens of creatures, fourteen races with a dozen or more units each, two worlds (Arcanus and Myrror) to explore...there's more replay value than you will ever be able to use up. Among the strategies you could try:

- Slings and Arrows: Endless hordes of happy little hobbit slingers!
- Hero Hit Team: Heroes with artifacts that let them rain down fire and destruction!
- Black Hearts: Shadow Demons or Wraiths: cast them early, cast them often, kill everything that moves.

There's tons more.

CONS: The game was made in 1994 so the graphics and music are awful by modern standards. The AI also isn't as good as one would like.

Aside from those, this is an amazing game.

** [[https://omatranslations.com/table-of-contents-wmw/][Warlock of the Magus World]] is quite good if you want a story with a ruthless, morally ambiguous protagonist who's out for nothing but his own ends. It does have a few unexplained -at least at the point that I'm at- parts fundamental to the story, mostly related to the MC's reincarnation, and the fact he gets his AI chip in this next world. But it does a great job at having a sensible protagonist who doesn't go out of his way to create trouble for no reason, who takes into account whether a certain course of action will reveal his secrets, and a few other things. The main character is basically a younger Quirrelmort, although a little worse in the planning department and with the added bullshit of AI to cheat his way to the top. It's not for everyone, though, so if you've read until he's enrolled in the school and you're not enjoying it, then just drop it.

** /Kindred/ by Octavia Butler is a novel with a rational, level-headed protagonist, some unexplained magic stuff, thorough research and strong writing. It does have a bunch of graphic violence, including sexual violence and racially motivated hate crimes, so if you're looking for a book to cheer you up, this isn't it. 8/10.

** I just finished Angel Killer by Andrew Mayne and got some rational vibes off of. The main character is an ex-magician who become a fbi agent. The books comes highly recommended by me.
