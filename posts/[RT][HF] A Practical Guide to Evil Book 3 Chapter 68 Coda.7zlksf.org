** The end reminded me of the ending of [[#s%20Cat%20as%20Tailor%20did%20became%20a%20monster%20beyond%20human%20understanding][Worm. (Worm spoilers)]]

Cat is about to transition into another name, I dont think Black Queen nor Black Knight fits. She is a Queen, a General and of Winter. I cant imagine what will be her new name.

edit. I just realized, akua got the classic ending of the evil mage that binds demons. The demon/monster/Cat escapes and the mage is crushed effortlesly. Wow, congrats erraticerrata, the end of the fight was both unexpected and obvious in hindsight. What an ending should be.

This is interesting. Archer's interlude mentioned is as ‘an auction for which that cannot be bought', so Akua had to barter something in exchange. Given the form of the question, either an artifact (probably from Wolof) had found its way in the wrong hands, or the First Prince already knows about the superweapon, and so a crusade is inevitable.

** I've got mixed feelings about this chapter.

On one hand it makes a lot of sense if you consider the scale of the opposition Akua has been tangling with. Capturing Black who has been killing Heroes for the past four decades is a tall order. Moreover, Black is a renowned strategist so him having a plan to eliminate Diabolist (or take advantage of her weakness) makes sense. In fact, many people predicted that Black let himself get captured or was a decoy somehow. So inside the universe this all adds up.

On the other hand it felt thoroughly unsatisfying. Too much of what happened felt like Black's plan flawlessly coming to fruition. A couple of chapters back we had Cat musing about how defeating a villain is a trial - a crucible that reforges a person anew - and this all felt too easy.

Even sacrificing her humanity felt a bit like pushing a button and there- you're now a demi-god. A couple of paragraphs of how she's been sacrificing her people instead of herself... which isn't really true? I mean, in Book 2 she turned herself into an undead abomination and withstood the judgment of an angel. I don't understand how she thinks she hasn't earned or hasn't paid for her power. She's been at the front lines of virtually every battle and she became the Duchess of Moonless Nights by defeating the Duke through cleverness and strength. What more do you need to do to earn that power? At what point did others bleed for it instead of Cat?

Maybe I'm forgetting something but this dilemma comes out of nowhere. It feels like a tacked on reason to sacrifice her humanity rather than something she actually struggled with in the past.

In terms of creation's narrative Cat was the one directly engaging Akua and winning, Black was more like having a reinforcement help at the last minute. That said I agree things went too well for him, I expect there will be some sort of cost. Maybe the swap with assassin was more costly than it seemed.

I think its more about the outcome than the power? Like when she was talking with Akua it wasn't about what she had t sacrifice to gain her name or title but about what she was willing to do to help Callow. So far she's been able to have it both ways with getting all the benefits of villainy without losing the moral high ground in her own head at least. I think becoming the dark inhuman fae version of herself means acknowledging she can't do that.

** Well well well... looks like it's the ol' Assassin switcheroo! I'm getting major FATE vibes from Assassin, although its aspect seems to manifest differently than Hassan-i-Sabbah (one person who can take many forms rather than many people using the same name/role).

I'm not sure what this means for Cat, or what's going to happen when she transitions. I don't like Fae-Cat much so far, although her casually killing Ubua was quite satisfying. Random thoughts/questions:

- Why did Cat's limp come back? Or more accurately, what made it disappear before? It seems weird that a soul binding physically cured her limp in the first place...?

- Which Aspect did Cat keep? She mentions that two were now gone and one become overpowered. I'd assume that Take was what she kept considering what happened with Ubua's *Call*, but Fall seemed to be her Winter Aspect previously. How did Winter decide which to keep?

- I recall a post or comment from long ago that erraticerrata mentioned that Assassin had been in the story already, and I always assumed it was as a hardly mentioned background character like a lieutenant or server or something. Now I'm thinking he actually meant that some of the main characters have been Assassin in disguise. Any ideas of who? Besides Scribe, who seems the most likely contender?

- Do we think that Ubua's soul vessel/child is going to be related to a main character? Would provide more of a punch than just making it some random kid, no? Watch it be one of Sabah's children...

- I actually felt bad for Dumisai. I knew he would die, but he just seemed so likable. I mean, besides his support of his genocidally-minded daughter.

- Why did Black seem "warier" after Ubua confirmed she had a single conversation with the Wandering Bard? My guess is that he's worrying that she set up things to turn out this way, so he's still playing into her plot... could it be something else?

- It seems a little odd that Vivienne's true name is, well, Vivienne. I'd have expected something a bit... more? Like her last name too, at least? Maybe I'm just used to Dresden Files' take on true names.

- "Diabolist backed a way but /I touched her chest over her head,/ ever so slightly, and there was a quiet snap." I'm not really understanding what this means or what it pictured here. Ubua was backing away; did Cat suddenly teleport behind/above her? Did she fall down and Cat was standing over her? Did she trip ass-over-teakettle as Cat reached out?

The aspects of Take and Break were Squire's, but Fall never fit - it was purely Winter's, and it definitely goes beyond a mere aspect now. And her connection to the name of Squire is nearly severed. Fall is definitely the aspect left, such as it is.

** This didn't unfold like I expected; I thought for sure that Cat will break Bind by using Take on it. Cat have one aspect left; what was it?
