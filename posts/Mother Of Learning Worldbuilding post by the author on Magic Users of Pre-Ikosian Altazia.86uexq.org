  Some of the morlock groups were not willing to suffer this wholesale destruction of their culture and returned to the Dungeon, where they descended into the fathomless depths in search of something. They were never heard from again, and are surely dead now.
#+end_quote

Well that's not ominous at all.

** Two things struck me while thinking about this post:

- I've previously been under the impression the natives of Altazia were like the equivalents of native tribes in the Americas who'd been conquered by European settlers. But while some aspects of the two seems similar (e.g. the indication of a tribal social structures), the mentioning of priesthood (and remembering that there are Altazian (surface) natives besides the shifters, the Khusky) seems to indicate that Altazian and Ikosion societies weren't that different aside from the race of the constituent people, and probably the exact gods they chiefly worshipped.
- And that in turn made me realize that I kept thinking the BC ("Before Cataclysm") era of MoL universe is equivalent to earth's Before Christ era. Instead, the impression I'm getting here of the way priests are portrayed is that they're more similar to the Catholic church of the Middle Ages (specifically, universal access to divine healing and being the local power) than what I know of the polytheistic worship of Greek/Roman religions (where anyone can commune with a god anywhere and where, in stories, supernatural power just means it's a gift/curse of one god or another).

Just goes to show me for making assumptions, I guess. Pretty enlightening.

** /(...) allowing them to observe the process by which souls are created in developing children./

This does seem like the base for creating the mysterious power source, that we heard about repeatedly? The one that powers the orb, and Silverlake's heavy wards ...

** Great post. Loved the worldbuilding on the Witch society and the semi-matriarchal society that developed from that.

*** +I think this one is actually right? The full sentence is:+

#+begin_quote
  +[Witches] still exist on the margins of society, however, due to lingering prejudices among the populace and their own willingness to toe the line in regards to magical regulations.+
#+end_quote

+The "their own willingness" part is supposed to the witches, I think, so the meaning of that clause is "witches are willing to bend the laws [thus they are still not regarded highly]".+

+I think "their own willingness" doesn't refer to "the populace", though I see how the structure of the sentence causes obfuscation.+

EDIT: I had the wrong definition for "toe the line".

***** I...did not realize this.

I never looked up the idiom's formal definition, so I assumed that the verb "toe" meant "to push your toe against something" which turned "toeing the line" to "pushing the boundary" in my head.

I agree.

Toe the line means

#+begin_quote
  accept the authority, policies, or principles of a particular group, especially unwillingly.
#+end_quote

So "willing to bend the laws" means the same as "unwilling to toe the line".

#+begin_quote
  [Witches] still exist */on the margins of society/*, because they are unwilling to toe the line.

  [Witches] */still exist/*, because they are willing to toe the line.
#+end_quote

Both of these would make sense, but the second sentence would be inconsistent with the "lingering prejudices" point. They aren't still existing because of "lingering prejudices", but they are on the margins because of them.
