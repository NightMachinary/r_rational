Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** A lot of standard vampire mythology holds that they can't eat or drink (consequences ranging from disgust to pain to death). Well, of course, they can drink blood, naturally.

A lot of standard human anthropology holds that people like to take mind altering substances, alcohol being the most popular [citation needed] because it just requires leaving plants to rot and then being bananas enough to try and consume them anyway [citation needed].

So, how could vampires get drunk?

*** Responding to my own post with the obvious suggestions for people to riff on:

- Get the humans drink enough and their blood is an (extremely dilute) alcoholic beverage in itself ! (So in the rules of this system, you probably can't dilute human blood with ethanol and make a 6% beer for a vampire that way: say the upper limit of spiking blood with ethanol is the upper limit a human's blood contain without killing the human, in which case we're extremely charitably able to get human blood to a 1% alcohol volume which is pitiful)

- Magic potions. Yawn.

- Heroin, coke, etc - anything that doesn't require an oral route. Presumably something absorbed by snorting might still count as "eating"? And heroin doesn't necessarily affect vampires the same way?

- Turns out werewolf(say) blood gets vampires drunk - this is interesting, but why?

I've seen this used alongside the idea that vampires have truly /atrocious/ alcohol tolerance, so that 1% really hits them /hard/.

Another option; alcohol is more or less fruit (often grapes) that have gone a little bit /off/ in a very specific way. How do vampires react to blood that's been allowed to ferment a little? (/Can/ blood ferment? I presume it can because it's organic, at least if you can keep it from clotting first...)

Sugars are what ferments; blood doesn't really contain much sugar at all, the calories come from protein. So blood wouldn't ferment the same way that if you leave a hunk of cow flesh out for long enough, it will rot rather than ferment.

So no, unfortunately, I think blood can't really ferment.

Maybe they can metabolise it instantly - but they can /also/ turn that ability off temporarily, in the same way as humans, despite having to breathe, are able to hold their breath for a while. (This also means that vampires would have a limit as to /how/ drunk thy can get, because they can't get drunk enough to stop 'holding their metabolism').

Alternative: vampires can heal everything /except/ blood, which they have to replace. Drinking enough blood from drunk people leads to a drunk vampire, who will then /stay/ drunk until such time as he drinks some blood from enough sober people to thin out the alcohol a bit. (And regrowing an arm leads to a massively thirsty vampire because he's got to get an arm's worth of blood from /somewhere/).

It has implications for any scene involving vampires, really, because hormones have a lot to do with emotions. Vampires can presumably control themselves well, whatever emotions they might be feeling under the surface; but a vampire who recently ate from a vampire hunter will probably be feeling combatative and punchy for a while after. On the flip side - and importantly for vampire romances - a young woman in a low-cut nightie is not going to get the reaction she might be expecting from a vampire, unless he has a sip from some other guy who's had the relevant hormones floating around in his blood. (This might even be a reason why many vampires seek human mates and /don't/ want to turn their partners, because they enjoy having someone around who can provide the relevant hormones for them to partake of).

********* I'm more thinking, the hormonal thing is really going to heavily strengthen your attachments to the humans you feed on as individuals; if you feed from a man who is crazy about you, afterwards you have this wonderful glow of love that persists. If you feed from him exclusively, well, he'll die, but you'll always have a ~10% level of love from him just from the feeding thing, which spikes after feeding. It's... interesting. A manipulative human might make sure they are in adoring bliss mood before offering their neck to their vampire, just to make sure the effect is as potent.

That said, thinking about My Vampires, they must produce hormones if their brain is working normally, and I'm sure that oxytocin or whatever has a short half life in the body. So the hormonal effects are only going to be immediate, and probably not that strong.

(actually if we have the alcohol rule, probably whatever breaks down alcohol breaks down other hormones, so maybe not?)

That depends on what the human is feeling. If the vampire feeds exclusively from humans who feel scared, then he's hardly doing to feel attached to them - and if he feeds from humans who find the act of being fed on innately distasteful, then he's going to eventually face his mealtimes with disgust.

If, on the other hand, the human enjoys the process, well, then it will likely strengthen their bonds.

*********** Yeah, thinking about how the hormonal effects are likely to work, I think the vampires are either going to run on human hormones or run on vampire hormones. If they run on human hormones, then feeding gives them a nice, small blast of adreneline / oxytocin / whatever, which their physiology is able to attenuate the same way it attenuates the adreneline the vampires produce naturally.

Or, is the reason vampires are so dangerous because these fear hormones build up in their blood from feeding on humans, and the only way they can get rid of them is by depositing them back into the next human they feed from as a waste product?? Are vampires just dangerous because they're "scared", and feeding on scared humans means the affect doesn't attenuate? It's an interesting thought.

The other option is vampire hormones run on some sort of vampire-specific system, in which case the human hormones are irrelevant (unless they're grandafthered in, I guess?)

**** I'd say it all depends on the mythology.Are the vamps dead? If so, no liver function, no intoxication. Also, if the blood isn't pumping, kinda hard for intoxicants to hit the bloodstream and have an effect.

Is vampirism a curse/virus? If so, they're not really dead, per se, so all the standard human functions should work, such as liver processing toxins. Perhaps they just have an incredible tolerance simply because the regeneration provided by their curse causes the poisoning that is intoxication to be healed entirely too quickly for most people's delights.

Sigil Magic. Sigil magic is about using a metaphorical pictogram to describe an effect (on conceptual objects). The sigils can be drawn in or of anything, as the spell works it course it erodes itself, a metal wrought sigil will evaporate, a drawing in sand will become homogeneous again, ink on paper will evaporate along with a portion of the paper thinning it (the power of the spell relative to the material consume will determine it's life time or potency, a weak spell made of iron might last decades, a powerful spell made in sand might last less than an eye-blink). Unlike many other magics sigils don't count against universal enchantment limits of the caster - they do however consume a relatively large amount of raw materials for the effects they provide - so in theory they can create effects of unlimited power, to do so would require forging a sigil of such size in a single casting.

Examples:

- Translation Sigil: A sigil of two people talking allows people touching the sigil to understand each other when they talk.
- Firestarter Sigil: A sigil of a fire allows the user to start a fire by touching it to something flammable.
- Traps: Carvings in stone of people meeting brutal deaths in certain locations of a building are a common mechanism for security. Though as a practical matter this often involves walls and walls of slight variants of the same pictogram to catch edge cases and prevent a single variant from being burned out quickly.
- Magic Items: Most magic items are forged with sigils.
- Power Sources: While the cost (in both materials and labor) of using sigils as common power sources is untenable, many things do use sigil engines of one form or another as a power source.
- Other Magics: Refinements to sigil magic over the millennia have created other magics, weaker and more constrained yet with an easier representation of concepts like sequences, conditions, and so on.

**** The magic is created at casting time (e.g. the drawing/carving/smelting of a sigil) so existing pictures can't be used unless recreated.

Sigils are binary line drawings that are fully connected (no breaks that aren't connected somewhere else). In general one can represent a "person" or a "face" but the sigil usually only effects conceptual things it touches (but for a "building" that can be quite large).

Sculptures can be used, but only as 2d line drawings, not from a perspective, but a "what if I flattened this out" mathematical warp. 2d line drawing optical illusions would use whatever the caster envisioned (if they envisioned both then it could do both, but that would be master level work).

If I wanted to design an assassinate spell it would be through using something like "assassinate the leader of a country" image and attempt to bring it "into contact" with the nation in question, but that would be absurdly expensive in materials.

*** Questions:

- How directly does the caster have to draw their sigils? If tools can be used, nanosigils (using microscopes and so on) and batch production (using carbon copy paper or a printing press) might be possible. I feel like this would lead to sigil magic serving as an equivalent of electronics in terms of the typical devices and economics.
- Is it the size or the quantity of material that matters to the power of the sigil? For example, would a sigil painted on a balloon change in effectiveness as the balloon is inflated?
- Can partially-formed existing shapes be converted into sigils, or do sigils have to be constructed from scratch? If completion is possible, this system could end up resembling Vancian casting where the sigils are left incomplete, to be finished when they are required. Additionally, it could make much larger workings more feasible by adapting existing structures.
- Can the degradation of the material be used creatively? For example, if a city under siege has a circular wall that can be adapted into a sigil, could a sigil mage do so with the aim of breaking down the walls from the erosion rather than using the intended magical effect? Could you apply a sigil to an ingot of metal in such a way that the erosion adds or removes impurities? Could you slowly poison someone by using the evaporation of a sigil drawn in a heavy metal? Could a sigil mage with a sword cut a sigil into someone?
- How does it interact with other magic? If you magically enhance the durability of a sigil, will the magic last longer? If you magically enlarge a sigil, will the magic be stronger? Can you use magic to draw a sigil? What happens if you draw a sigil at a distance, or using magic as a medium?
- How does it interact with economics? D&D in particular has spell components with fixed prices such as 10,000 gold pieces worth of crushed diamonds, which begs the question of who defines the value of the diamonds. Assuming the sigils instead demand a particular quantity of material, the cost of sigils could change as that material gets used up or a new production process appears. Also, the relative costs of sigil mage labour and sigil materials will probably dictate where typical sigils fall on the spectrum between quick sketches in a sand trough and field-sized great works. If this balance changes over time, that could provide an excuse for ancient sigil-powered dungeons and superweapons that are beyond modern capabilities.

Specific ideas:

- Sigils could be constructed inside blocks of other materials, or made out of shape-memory alloy, for smuggling and concealment.
- Weak sigils could be used to make [[http://www.larryniven.net/stories/roentgen.shtml][hard-to-counterfeit currency]].

** So! I'm an aspiring writer and I'm trying to iron out the kinks of my fantasy setting. This is what I have for now:

​

Some time ago (1000 years? 10000?) the God-King of the world was usurped by the 5 Wyrm Lords, semi-divine dragons made for the express purpose of managing all the "boring god stuff". One of them, the Lord of Magic, died during the conflict but the rest survived more or less intact. The battle itself was so fucking devastating that around 70% of the world is a dead wasteland populated by mutant and corrupted beasts and plagued by wild magic storms (now that magic is un-administrated) and the surviving Wyrm Lords rule over what small inhabitable pockets of land there are.

​

Thing is? Not everything was destroyed during the battle, and there remain some old ruins in the wasteland, full of old and divine relics that the Wyrm Lords really want their claws on.

​

The protagonist will be part of an organization called the Re-Collectors, founded and maintained semi-directly by the local Wyrm Lord with the express purpose of going out there and giving him relics. As the wastelands are pretty much irradiated with corrupting dead-god magic, they are giving a sort of blessing or powerup by the Wyrm Lord so they don't die, which protects them from being mutated into aberrations, augment their physical attributes and gives them a minor, individual and semi-random power (think Aura and Semblances from RWBY)

​

What do you think? Anything doesn't make sense?

*** It isn't bad, though I think you need some more flavor text on just how the Wyrm Lords rule over people society, and how things are a wasteland. Are we talking dark souls medieval sort of societies, more modern stuff, etc. Cause you know if someone is called a Wyrm Lord, I probably would think they were kind of a bad guy.

**** Wyrm Lords are just semi-divine giant dragons. How they govern depends on the individual Wyrm, but the one that the MC works for is pretty hands-off, demanding some tribute and protecting the people from the very rare GIANT ABOMINATION but not micromanaging anything. More like a protector god than a king.

​

The tech level also depends, but the MC comes from a Venetian-inspired place, think the renaissance but slightly more advanced thanks to the relics that they've managed to research here and there. Plus, the Wyrm Lord of the place likes art.

​

As for the wasteland... Think and endless desert of red and black sands, littered with craters and fissures and where everything wants to kill you, including the air.

*** Have all the most valuable relics already been collected? If it's been X years since the Apocalypse, I would think that the Wyrms would make it a priority goal to collect all the S-tier items first and foremost. But that would make for a bit of a dull story, if all the best stuff was already retrieved and nothing the MC can find will match anything already possessed by the Wyrm Lords.

What do the Wyrm Lords get out of being rulers? What motivates them?

**** *Have all the most valuable relics already been collected?*

Some of them, but not all of them by a long shot. The empire of the Dead God was big as fuck and the best things were at the center, which now is... well, an irradiated crater full of giant abominations and deadly magic storms, according to the few scouts that survive enough to tell the tale.

​

*What do the Wyrm Lords get out of being rulers?*

So! Two things (the second one is a spoiler)

First: Wyrm Lords can't enter the wastes without attracting pretty much ALL the abominations and having to go against a zerg rush. Their magic seems to attract the monsters. (this also happens with those who have Blessings, but much more subtle and not so ALL THE MONSTERS AT THE SAME TIME!!!)

Second: The Wyrm's magic is... running out, and they need the relics to absorb the magi out of them and keep on having juice for a little bit longer. Not many people know this, tho.

And I already know what you'll ask: If they are running out, why wasting magi on giving blessings? The blessings are kind of like... Entity shards (from Worm), they give awesome powers but, at the same time, slowly absorb your lifeforce until you die and, when you do so, the Wyrm Lord can get a little bit more than they gave away on the first place. Not very efficient, but enough to get by if there are no relics found in some time.

*** I wouldn't explain all that to the reader from the front, or to the main characters. It makes the story more compelling if the protagonist doesn't really know why they are doing what they are doing, other than having been told to.

Also introduces lots of interesting power structures since if the wyrm lord doesn't want the whole story to be known, then there must be a good reason he doesn't. Which is usually because there's something out there he's afraid of.

** Maybe too late to post, but here goes.

I'm imagining a futuristic "hellene" society. In the distant past the roman empire never took root, and as a result the west stayed under Greek hegemony for much longer and its influence is significantly magnified even into the present(1900's or so, equivalent tech development of a cyberpunk 2077 or thereabouts). The main divergence would be that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus][Pyrrhus of Epirus]] wipes the floor with the Romans instead of eking out a few close victories (maybe pyhrric victory would come to mean an overwheliming victory?) and establishes a dynasty that rules over Sicily and most of Italy and some of the Balkans.

Think of how much of european civilization is built on or inspired by the romans, how much of an effect they had on every level of society. Now imagine that there is a greek replacement in terms of culture, but not in terms of size or scope, a more distributed pan-hellene meditarranean which survives the "barbarians" invasions better(better use of cavalry and so on), which does not succumb to Christianity(which never existed, together with Islam), and which views intellectual pursuits significantly more positively, and is thus able to advance technologically much more quickly.

Anyway, *the point of this post*: in a cyberpunk-ish dystopian future, a Hellene-descended government in europe has a similar problem as we do now with regard to the replacement rate, i.e. not having enough children. They institute a breeding program with the initial aim of making and raising children, but which gets distorted by utopian(or dystopian if you're lower class) ideals into making "perfect", idealized citizens.

The program has 4 lineages (sort of like a soft caste system) which aims to encompass the entirety of the elites in a society.

- Fates - The ruling lineage - civil, political and military leaders, strategists
- Furies - The enforcement/physical lineage - warriors, police, athletes
- Muses - The intellectual lineage - philosopher, scientists, artists
- Graces - The support lineage - engineers, doctors, psychologists, priests, etc.

Thoughts? Is there something that I'm missing? I also don't like that these 4 are orignially all women, is there any male groups that would fit in this theme? Is there any story that has a divergent hellene empire type of deal that I can use for inspiration? Any historical site or book or video that you'd recommend for some insight into ancient greek culture?

***** Based on skimming the wiki article, it probably would have become Greek at some point, because Rome took it in 146 BC, and it was destroyed in 698 CE by Umayyad (Muslim) forces to stop the Byzantine Empire from taking it. There probably would have been some other African/Middle Eastern group that would similarly want to control the area and would take it over. I'd think they'd be successful.

Plumbing would handled by the Graces also, but at a planning and logistical level. This is a technologically advanced society, remember. Most of the "grunt" work is already done by robots, and since to is a utopian effort, the project's aim is at a future where all of it will be done by robots and no one gets their hands dirty.

No, but look at the historical precedent for doctors and psychologists. They're not the people keeping the machinery of civilisation running - rather, they are highly educated people who happen to be capable of performing a service, so to speak. In a living world, a lot of professions would be in what would look like the wrong caste now for mainly historical reasons.

I'd imagine, for example, that nurses would be Graces while doctors were Muses; that makes sense to me, and somewhat enhances the Nursing/Doctoral divide. For similar reasons, I'd imagine that computer programmers would be in among the Muses, and not the Graces.

It sounds like the robots are taking the place of the underclass. Is this a world with working AI?

****** I'm seconding your opinion. Muses and graces seem to have contradictory roles within them. Scientists and Engineers should absolutely be in the same division, and priests would probably fit better under 'ruling' lineage, given that most of the job (as it exists in present day) is communal rather than theological.

*** You could try looking into modern Hellenistic polytheists for inspiration, see if there's anything that you can adapt and scale up.

The easy solution I can think of is to make something up or pull from somewhere else. Some other culturally significant forces had to have popped up in the last ~3000 years, draw from that. I think a monotheistic religion makes sense as a foil/contrast. Maybe Judaism has a larger influence?

Also, have they not figured out genetic modification, or the possibility of it as a method? It would be a lot more practical than breeding systems, and could also correct sex disparities. Though I wasn't aware countries other than Japan were currently having problems with replacement rate.

*** Having all four groups be named after women might make sense if the lineages are matrilinear: if your mother was a Fury, you're of that lineage.

I assume you've already looked at Plato's Republic, but if not that has a lot of material for what a Hellene-descended breeding program and utopia could look like.

You've mentioned how a Hellene civilisation would better resist the forces that caused the fall of Rome. How would other key historical events have changed, like the Columbian exchange or the Black Death?

Islam not having existed is also huge. does India still get conquered and Buddhism all but wiped out? without a buffer in the middle East, do we see a direct clash of Hellenistic empires and china? do people still drink coffee?
