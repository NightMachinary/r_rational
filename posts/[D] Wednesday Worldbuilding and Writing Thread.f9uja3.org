Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I'm working on a superhero story where the main plotline revolves around the two main characters, a novice hero and a novice villain, stumbling onto a government conspiracy that is making villains disappear and stealing their powers to give to people who want to be heroes.

No one suspects anything up until the story proper, but for some reason I'm having a hard time figuring out a pair of inciting incidents to get these characters suspicious of what is going on. I suppose it could be one incident that catches both of their attentions, but I still can't figure out what it would be.

The conspiracy has to kill these villains to harvest their powers, but they have been able to either make the trail go cold or provide answers that stop investigations (i.e. fake bodies). Furthermore, they do need to employ scientists to make the process work. I have a feeling that them making a mistake would work, but I can't think something that doesn't make the answer super obvious.

You could have the level of effort put into this be variable, which would provide a fingerhold for the characters. /Some/ villains you need to provide answers for, but others, low-level powers who live quietly unimportant criminal lives, those might be disappeared by the powers that be without the same level of care and attention. The inciting incident could be from one of those lower level targets, part of an expanded program after the success of the first wave -- and the protagonists are the only ones who actually care about the person in question, for their own reasons. (As ideas, novice villain was a friend or contact, novice hero used the victim as an informant, victim leaves a suicide note, but no body is found, and it's not immediately apparent that this is connected to other deaths and disappearances.)

*** The villain could have some additional part of their power they never use in public. If they had some kind of noncombat teleportation power, they could escape from holding before getting harvested, then go to a minor hero anonymously, deepthroat-style, to get the ball rolling on investigation.

As to what kind of power could let them teleport, let's say they have the ability to see their surroundings from all angles at all times. You can't sneak up on them, and they're really good in a melee, much like Skitter. However, they're careful to never let slip that the less they move, the wider and sharper their vision is, and if they stop moving entirely for about 5 seconds they can teleport to anywhere in about 100 meters, then do it again as teleportation doesn't count as moving to their power.

*** I mean all that's needed is a power transferer and a knife on the government team? Unless you're going for the government having the ability to give and take powers without the use of a super.

Though I gotta wonder what criteria the government uses to find a viable candidate to super. Also if any of their supers went rogue.

An incident you could use is the newbie villain (NV) is a side kick of a small time villain who found out the truth or that the NV was a friend of a villain who found out the truth.

The newbie hero (NH) could have gotten their power from the government power program, could have been planning to take down the minor villain and side kick when BAM the government comes bursting in and the (NH) listens into the confrontation.

As for secrecy: magic, mind control, memory wipes, pheromones, geas, lie detection, planes of existence/demiplanes that only those in charge can go and leave as they please, immoral staff/indifferent to the well being of villain, even an island out in the middle of nowhere, a small staff

Anyhow sounds dope.

*** villian wants to bust buddy out of prison, is caught by hero just as he find the file on where they shipped him. shows the hero the folder 'this looks wrong'.

that can even be your opening scene. or you can open with the hero stopping a different villian, setting up a checkovs gun for later as to the captured villians fate.

aside from that, you could have a whistleblower. the more people know about the conspiracy, the less secure it is over time.

** I've been drafting the story that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f6bw9n/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/fi3rlwq/][I was planning in last week's thread]]. I wouldn't recommend following it live, since I've already done heavy revisions of a published chapter, and intend to do more, but it's there if you want. Feedback is appreciated, and you can't rate it lower than Allister did, so give me your worst!

** Is there a good resource for lots of 'corrupted' (for lack of a better word) creatures? A couple of examples of the sort of thing I'm looking for:

- oversized wolf with metal fur
- mallard with a scorpion tail and fangs
- flock of magpies with scrambled plumage colours and misplaced eyes
- rooster that steadily secretes crude oil from its feathers
- miniature sheep (the size of a poodle) with wispy clouds instead of wool

As part of a setting I'm tweaking, I'm looking for novel creatures that are kinda reminiscent of the weirder breed of D&D creatures. The process that creates them is metaphorically 'weird magic grafts random ideas and attributes onto existing animals'. Most of them won't be able to reproduce/their children will be normal animals, but occasionally a mutation like this would lead to a new subspecies.

*** If you don't want to do a bunch of bespoke creatures, this might be one of those times when it makes sense to really quickly create a generator of some kind (I can give some code, but you'd have to make your own arrays), or if you're into the Next Big Thing, use something like GPT-2. [[https://talktotransformer.com/][Talk to Transformer]] gives the following when fed that list:

#+begin_quote

  - blanket birds which can turn invisible
  - cartoonish spiders that look like at least one or two hundred centipedes, including a whirligig/anti-asbestos bomber version
  - crazy-looking spiky-haired serpents (almost sure to cause a case of accidorma)
  - deadly hornets with large, shiny brains (the wasps are named after a hornet's head)
  - a dragon
#+end_quote

... which isn't the most helpful thing in the world.

Much /much/ better to do it bespoke though, maybe aided by a list of base animals, then doing either word association on their names or features, or culling from suggestions that a different random generator gives you. The superpower wiki has an exhaustive list of powers, and [[https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Random][this link]] will send you to a random page.

  Blanket birds which can turn invisible
#+end_quote

This one is great. It's a bird (go to a random bird on wikipedia), only its wings have fabric grafted onto them (I'm thinking baby blanket style, maybe trailing about 2 inches further than the normal wing would)

#+begin_quote
  cartoonish spiders that look like at least one or two hundred centipedes, including a whirligig/anti-asbestos bomber version
#+end_quote

You know how there's an ant that mimics spiders for some reason? This is a species of eusocial centipede that mimics a tarantula OR it's just a species of ant that mimics a tarantula en masse. Think of the Nesk from the animorphs-time-of-dinosaurs special.

#+begin_quote
  crazy-looking spiky-haired serpents (almost sure to cause a case of accidorma)
#+end_quote

Snakes with hair. Come on, I'm imagining one with a beehive and another with a mohawk. That's badass.

#+begin_quote
  deadly hornets with large, shiny brains (the wasps are named after a hornet's head)
#+end_quote

Human-level-intelligent hornets

#+begin_quote
  a dragon
#+end_quote

Yeah, okay, that one sucks.

Like seriously, you have a HUMAN BRAIN and you have HUMAN CREATIVITY. You can use this shit as inspiration just as well as someone's "list of cryptids" and "list of weird animals", and the WTF from a computer generating it gives you some extra special stuff.

--------------

I gave transformer another chance, too. Well, a bunch of chances until I got something roughly approximating a list. Here's an assortment of everything it gave me in several attempts. I have included the really bad stuff and riffed on it to demonstrate that creativity is possible.

#+begin_quote
  seagulls that sing around hot soup and rivers with carrion fish
#+end_quote

Seagulls with beautiful voices like nightengales

#+begin_quote
  several ugly cranes (in reality a 'cat in a hat')
#+end_quote

The cat in the hat being in quotation marks is interesting. The cat in the hat seemed simple enough but then made a huge mess. So, an ugly crane (bird) that makes a big mess.

#+begin_quote
  shaved seal -/Miscellaneous -
#+end_quote

A seal with human skin. Gross.

#+begin_quote
  threadbare pink turban by Reebok (US)
#+end_quote

.... yeah I don't know

#+begin_quote
  mini-shoe-dwarf - some small instructions included
#+end_quote

If you've got sword and sorcery, then a dwarf with verrrry small feet

#+begin_quote
  by VF
#+end_quote

yeah okay

#+begin_quote
  metallic pants
#+end_quote

yeah okay

#+begin_quote
  mini-yellow wheeled cart
#+end_quote

yeah okay

#+begin_quote
  white pet-looking and slimy gnome at the start of the game
#+end_quote

A slimy cat. Think of a slug, but a cat. Or, if sword and sorcery, a slug gnome.

#+begin_quote
  huge angry stick insect (give it a smile - it's a freaky one)
#+end_quote

Come on this is hilarious

#+begin_quote
  Rococo
#+end_quote

This is apparently a style of architecture. I have no clue.

That cat in the hat, when he lifted his hat, revealed a new cat (with it's own hat). So perhaps these several cranes are /really/ a Matroishka-doll like hivemind, in which they have a strict size ordering (geometrical sequence, I'm thinking) but share one mind between all of their bodies.

**** Good tip on the random generator, it'd take about 10 minutes to put something together in Python. That might be the easiest way to do it and it has the advantage of truly random combinations, not creatures that feel like what a person comes up with when they're trying to sound random.

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/animal]]

You should also be able to use the tag cloud on that page to look for more specific kinds.

Unfortunately, the tag system or searches on the site itself probably won't be /great/ for what you're trying to do, since both the quality and weirdness compared to normal wildlife vary like crazy.

Asking on the subreddit will probably get you better answers than anything the site's interface can do for you.
