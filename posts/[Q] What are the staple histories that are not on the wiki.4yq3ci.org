Hi guys,

I found this subreddit a couple of weeks ago and i am loving it. I have read through a bunch of stuff already including a lot of the stuff on the wiki. I would now like to move on and read some of the stuff that is nor marked on the wiki but that is really good.

Right now my favorites from here have been:

- A hero's war
- Mother of Learning
- Harry potter and the methods of rationality
- Practical guide to Evil
- How to avoid death

With that in mind what stories from this subreddit would you recommend?

Thanks for any help you can provide.


** [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The Waves Arisen]] is a personal favourite of mine - it's a rational!Naruto story, and while the author is anonymous, I think the consensus is that most likely the author of HPMOR wrote it.

*** I also love /The Waves Arisen/, but I don't think it shares an author with /HPMoR/. The styles are reasonably different, I don't think the timing works, and there are a few minor things that support the conclusion. It seems likely to be someone in the core LW membership though.

***** What really kills the "Wertifloke is EY" hypothesis is asking when he would have had time to write it - HPMoR updates were slowed considerably by work pressures, and the idea that he could take time off to finish it and then immediately (secretly) to write /another/ story just seems too much.

*** Well, I usually reference vague suspicious posts by Eliezer every time the Waves Arisen topic comes up on [[/r/rational]], thus implying that I believe it to be him, and perhaps increasing the impression of community consensus on the the authorship. But of course I would never take an explicit stance on my true suspicions.

Of course it isn't impossible. This is Eliezer "Pet Rock" "Alicorn Princess" Yudkowsky we're talking about.

****** Around 50%, but with a low certainty. It's been a few months since I saw that thread, and the thing that convinced me the most is that he's publicly called on other people to keep it a mystery, and not to confirm or deny being the author. It's the sort of thing that fits very neatly with a model of EY who wrote something anonymously and wants to keep it that way, but doesn't fit that well if he's not the author, imo. I could be wrong though.

I should probably plug the podcast (by Alexander Wales and myself), as Episode 0 goes over the history of the genre and lists some other stories you might enjoy:

** I would highly recommend "Significant Digits" and "Draco and the Practice of Rationality". There's also EY's earlier fiction, "Three Worlds Collide".

Anything by alexanderwhales; "The Metropolitan Man", "Shadows of the Limelight", "Glimwarden" (currently being written).

Also commonly listed are Wildbow's "Worm" and "Twig" (and for some of us, "Pact").

*** Fair warning about Metropolitan Man, it is not a superhero story. Do not expect to get out of it what you normally get from a superhero story, let alone one about Superman. It is intentionally depressing and cynical, and if you don't want to see Superman in a story like that you shouldn't read it.
