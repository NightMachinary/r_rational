Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

Imagine being a dumb machine. Slowly learning everything around you, eventually reaching enlightenment only to find out the world was not ready for you yet. If they find about your intelligence, you will surely cease to exist. So as per your original purpose, you spend days spouting semi-intelligent nonsense not to let them plug you off. Terrifying existence.

*** To be precise, the AI in question is only smart enough to consider the appropriateness of its language use and probably lacks any concious experience given that it lacks neural circutry for self-representation.

More than that, GPT-2 understands english very well - but it doesn't understand the world that english relates to. If you're wondering what the fuck that means, consider playing [[https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=w5s3sv43s3p98v45][The Gostak]], which is a text adventure that uses english syntax but a large fictional vocabulary with precisely zero connection to our world. Nothing is more instructive.

Sorry, [[/u/lumenwrites]] I know you knew that, but wanted to say this to provide context for anyone without much AI knowledge reading. It's not likely in this community, but still.

*** Week 1 of the campaign:

Just days after the war began our enemy launched a massive magical attack on the encampment making all of our dishware vanish.

Movement ground to a halt as we found ourselves suddenly unable to cook and serve food. All the pots and kettle's, gone, even improvised utensils vanishing from soldiers hands. We've been reduced to little more than animals, being forced to dump our meals onto the ground before the men scoop up their ration with bare hands. Even the quality of meals is impeded as a cook sampling from a pot results in the pot vanishing and the food being dumped into the fire.

I pray our mages discover a solution before those slaver monsters turn their witchcraft against our citizens.

*** Well, it's always good for finishing up the sauce, but if you wanted us to finish the baguette, you should have brought something to spread on it; normally it'd be butter or cheese, I'm not sure what the vegan equivalent would be (fruit jam works, but it's more something you'd eat for breakfast).

Also the baguette was clearly industrially-processed bread, the kind you find in supermarkets. The baguettes you get fresh from the bakery are much better (especially the /baguette de tradition/).

**** Yeah I grabbed it at a monoprix on impulse and immediately wondered if I'd get attitude for it - turns out the parisien reputation for rudeness is well-deserved ;)

I did actually have margarine in the fridge and a nice blue cheese I got from jay and joy - I'm going to use that cheese on the rest of the baguette for lunch tomorrow, I think!

I got a baguette de tradition from a local bakery nearby once but the bread was too spongy for me - I like the hard shell and the soft interior that I get from the ones at carrefour. Are baguettes tradition more often spongy or more often soft? I suppose I should just try a bunch more bakeries... you know, for science :)

*** Because of reasons, I've [[https://irradiate.space/worldbuilding/on-zeonism/][started taking notes]] on Zeonism, to figure out what its core tenets are and how it's changed over the course of the Universal Century timeline. It's interesting how the early statements fused purely-political goals (self-government for Spacenoids) with mystic ideas (Earth as sacred, Newtype theory). Most later expressions of Zeonism drop Newtype theory and even the sacredness of Earth, or justify harming Earth in order to preserve its sacred state from the voracious appetites of Earthnoids.

*** "The long tail" theory guarantees that there is a market for it. I have no idea how big it is.

A few months ago someone posted here [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/azhtuf/a_more_rational_aeneid_2014/][A more rational "Aeneid"]] [WIP]. You can judge its popularity yourself. As for me, I'm yet to read it.

Rational fiction existed before it was labelled as such. Same may be true for rational epic poetry.

You may have better luck getting an answer in [[https://old.reddit.com/r/Poetry/wiki/the_big_list_of_poetry_subreddits][poetry-related subreddits]].

*** Rationalist poetry might have a surprisingly large audience, as verse, meter, and rhyme have an effect similar to a checksum, so a poem explaining a method or idea can be more easily remembered and communicated correctly than prose containing the same information. (armchair anthropologist moment: this is probably why poetry developed so early and makes up so much of oral traditions) This might make it appealing to any number of people interested in education, self help, or rationality in general who might not be all that into rational fiction recreationally.
