******** Diabolist using claim to take control of Cat and having her kill Black (likely by stabbing him in the heart like he did to her in Book 1. She ends him how he began her. There's a certain poetic symmetry to it and if that act is not enough for a transition I don't know what the hell is.) would tie things up nicely.

Diabolist's statement of Cat kneeling at her feet is fulfilled, Black's succession plan is also fulfilled and Cat transitions. Likely gaining an aspect that allows her to break control and kill Diabolist.

Remember, all the Old School villains are invariably killed by their trusted lieutenant/caged monster because of mistreatment (and forcing said lieutenant to kill their father figure strikes me as one of the ur examples of mistreatment). That Story has Weight and it nicely closes all opened plot threads.

This is a likely explanation for why Black only told Cat to come and not bring Adjutant or Archer even though the added numbers would be a boost when assaulting Liesse.

Masego, Warlock and Juniper along with the other legions are handling the plebs. Black not taking Archer or Adjutant with seems like he's holding the idiot ball but the priors for that are way too low. I believe he's enacting his succession plan.

Now how will Cat subvert this, I wonder...

********* He definitely isn't holding the idiot ball, both he and cat addressed the implication directly. The only question will be how they (attempt to) subvert the narrative.:

“I will arrive momentarily,” he said. “Have your Named join with the Twelfth for the assault on the last bastion. You and I will proceed into the city.”

“I don't like the shape of that,” I admitted.

“It has been taken into consideration,” he replied.

********** Would also set up the conflict between the Black Queen and the Dread Empress quite nicely.

Two powerful monarchs that are sharing a Knight. I don't think Malicia or the other Calamities would take too kindly to Cat having Sovereign control over Black but the alternative is him being permanently dead so yeah, not really a lot of choice in the matter. I mean he's already described as corpse-like, I'm sure he won't mind being an undead abomination. If he gains the Name Death Knight in the process, well that's just dandy.

********** I'm going to go a step further. I think she'll necromance Akua after she kills her. The promise of grovelling at feet thing has to go somewhere.

In fact, if she does end up transitioning to a necromancy/Death Knight Name, I'm calling it that her power is resurrecting loyal wights that keep their Names. That is suitably badass power spike for the end of this book, perhaps even extreme enough to set up the real big bad for the series. I'm hoping the gnomes, they sound amazing.

If all of the hints about necromancy and dead king level rituals and so on have been red herrings and erratic has something else equally awesome but completely unexpected planned, I'll be very impressed.

*** Implication is that Archer is as well. I don't think Adjutant or Archer is transitional Names. However, given how the theme of student surpassing mentor is apparently being played out, Adjutant might just transition to Captain and if Black's succession plan is to succeed that will undoubtedly draw the ire of the Lady of the Lake and the Sovereign of the Red Skies.

Who knows? Maybe EE is planning on telling a Narrative where The Woe has to choose Cat over their mentors/parental figures ending with each of them having to kill their mentors and possibly claim their Names.

It would fit the theme nicely of the New replacing the Old. Captain's death proves that the Calamities' time are done.

Fore what follows a Calamity? Woe.

** I can't decide whether Cat and Black (particularly Black) are underestimating Ubua now and setting themselves up for Cat's transition to Black Knight/Black Queen or if Cat is going to subvert the shit out of Ubua's plan. From Ubua's mind we see that this is her big play, and other plays are secondary. For all Ubua claims she is a different sort of Villian, Cat and Black are right to point out that she hasn't broken the mold with anything she's done so far.

Additionally Cat has two so far unaccounted assets in the city WRT Robber and Thief. Maybe one of them were the ones who mapped the defensive wards forcing Ubua to trigger her Trump card early, but that still leaves one to throw a wrench in the works at the right time for Cat.
