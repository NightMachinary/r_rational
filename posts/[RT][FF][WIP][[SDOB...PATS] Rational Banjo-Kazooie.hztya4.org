** This story seems to depend on the reader having a familiarity with the source material, in that it doesn't take any time to establish the characters or the world.

Not having played any of these games, then, I'm going to give it a pass.

*** Indeed! I don't think any paragraph I could write would capture the way Spiral Mountain exists in a reader's mind. All fanfiction runs into not wanting to waste space delivering exposition the reader is assuredly familiar with and video games invite their audience to inhabit their worlds more concretely than any other medium. I'll leave it to be judged if I leaned too far with this - but thank you for not assuming it was unintentional. I appreciate the feedback.

**** Does anyone think it would help if I assembled an atlas of the geographical references, fill in at least the environmental detail or would that not affect the fundamental issue?

​

Accessibility of rational fic to people outside their direct fandoms is an interesting issue in looking at this stuff as a genre to be compared against each other. I'd have missed out on so much from this community had I not happened to be into Animorphs and Willy Wonka

** Interesting. I don't feel like Banjo or Bottles are quite capturing the "Rareware character" feel in their dialogue, but that might be because we don't have Kazooie in the story yet - it seems like an odd choice to have her not present at the start, but I assume you've got A Plan for the bear and bird meeting that necessitates moving their meeting after Tooty gets abducted.

I assume from your comments and Banjo's mentions of Wizpig that you're building a "Rareverse"-style setting in the vein of [[/u/gazemaize]] and their Dahlverse. Presumably that includes Diddy Kong Racing and Conker's Bad Fur Day. Possibly it also includes DK64 and the various Donkey Kong Country games? Time will tell, I suppose. (Depending on the level of "chuck it all in", it could also end up with characters from James Bond and Joanna Dark to the Battletoads, so I will wait and see to what level you're taking this.)

I find it surprising that neither Bottles nor Mumbo have brought up the existence of Jinjos yet during the discussions of magic - I thought that Bottles explained their existence to you when you first find one, but I could be mistaken.

I'm also looking forward to how Brentilda and Cheato affect the story - against a smarter Gruntilda, the information they provide is likely to be key.

*** Thank you, intensely, for your feedback. I know there's so many things I wish I took the time to write a comment on at brief length, and it was always good to see somebody drop by and say something close to what I wanted to interject. From the three upvotes here clearly you're speaking for more than just yourself, and I like to imagine more than a few other general readers - and future readers.

For any particular video game franchise you might wonder as to its implications on this fic, you're either going to find a straight answer or two decades of evolving scholarship by canonographers of the philosophically absurd.

And that goes for any particular element. There's a two hour podcast about Mr. Patch from Banjo-Tooie recorded because a listener fulfilled their challenge of recording six hours of commentary on their six hours commentary on the Yooka Laylee developer commentaries. They built a macro in the late Project Spark that generated random acorn people from Conker's Pocket Tales, which nobody remembers partially because it got pulled from the shelves when the series went M-rated.

I wrote to another commentator very politely expressing that my lack of description and exposition made it impenetrable to people who never played Banjo-Kazooie. The specific writing I certainly lean into and utilize stylistically, but also am doing that to cover for genuine weaknesses in those areas (your point on dialogue is another weakness). However, impenetrability?

There's those commentators, there's the you commentators, then there's the hypothetical someone who engaged with these games like those guys with the Donkey Kong Universe, the Rare version of a grown-up kid who daydreamed about their favourite Dahl books intermingling. Their minds are already exploding at the possible connections to where Kazooie is and wondering if my inventing this tribe's name as "Jublins" implies I'm favoring the Jinjo connection theory with Mumbo. Maybe very few of even they caught the reference to Donkey Kong Country 3 until I namechecked Razor Ridge; as Pacifica was a bonus world added to the extensive 2005 Gameboy Advance remake.

Already in writing these three chapters and engaging with these handful of comments I've structured a lot of where I want to go, and how better to approach my writing to best address the more negative criticism. Even the briefest thought is something that impacts me and tells me to rethink how I'm communicating and what people are anticipating. You should see the pages of notes I have on both Brentilda and Cheato.

**** Another thing: I went back and reread while listening to the Spiral Mountain theme and it worked a lot better for me. Not sure whether it's better on reread or due to the magic of Grant Kirkhope.

The 3 chapters up currently really feel like one - there's three different scenes, but they're all part of one narrative beat. The "Yes." at the end of chapter 1 falls especially flat - I think the conversation doesn't have the narrative momentum at that point.

That said, I now really hope this takes off because I love the "corkboard and string" sort of feeling of making connections between all the different parts and I'd love to see what intense [[/r/rational]] discussion of this fic looked like. I'm going to go read through that DKU site next.

My commenting style tends to be to read through and try and keep in mind what my impressions are as I go. I can't necessarily tell the author what was good or wasn't, but I can tell them what landed for me. Admittedly, I'm guilty of skim-reading a lot of the time and just enjoying the surface-level of stories - I've never really "got" or enjoyed stories where you have to reconstitute the actual story out of a mess of unreliable narration; it feels too much like being given a bowl of story mix and being told to bake it myself. If I've decided to spend time reading something, I'd really prefer not to also have to do homework. (This is to illustrate what sort of reader I am, and therefore hopefully put my comments in more context.)

Thank you for the continued feedback. I don't want to reply to everything as that might be too cluttered and I'm in the swing of writing more. But I wanted to say that for as much as I like weirdness, I actually quite agree about unreliable narration and too great an ambiguity in what's going on. Hopefully the next leg will assuage some concerns; but also there's a matter of my refining myself as a better author to find the line on these things.

Certainly I want to assure you I hate those kinds of endings, and you needn't worry about getting invested in something to find a soup of ideas and sentences at the end. Moreso than you found along the way, ahahahah. Thank you so much! Been thinking about every bit of what you said and how to tune my writing thinking from your kind of perspective

** I think it's good that you're writing and exploring spaces that are interesting to you.

I'm sorry, but while I can typically mentally edit around minor typographical errors without too much loss of immersion, there are twenty-one instances in the three published chapters where quotations end with the closing full stop outside the closing quotation marks, and I find it all but impossible not to stop and stare at them when I see them, losing all context and finding myself quickly lost. Bottles' name is spelled 'Bottled' in one place in the first chapter.

If I was a diehard Banjo-Kazooie fan, I might be inclined to read on to see what you've done with the universe, but as it stands, the typographical errors and lack of context prevent me from entering an enjoyable reading flow.

*** I like the full stop outside the quotations... but I should rather stick to the consensus style to not jar the reader. Kind of strange I could come to think of this kind of stuff as unimportant and writing as kind of this frivolous thing... perhaps I'll trade beta readings with a friend somewhere because I'm totally noseblind to these things. Thank you for giving such a thoughtful feedback! I'm touched, it wasn't even phrased negatively

[[https://www.capstoneediting.com.au/blog/how-to-use-quotation-marks-correctlyquotation-marks-with-other-punctuation][This is a perfectly legitimate style.]] In Australia, it depends on whether the punctuation is part of the quotation or not. It's also common among programmers because it's consistent with how punctuation works in programming languages.

**** Since you mentioned programming, I'll just say that the /most/ important thing stylistically is consistency: use tabs if you wish, use spaces if it makes you happy, but /please/ don't mix them. Or in this case, ending quotation styles.

(Also, as a programmer, I still much prefer keeping the punctuation inside the quote. It's part of the string, not an outside operator being called on it! ;p </opinions>)

***** That depends on whether the quoted material is a complete sentence or not. "In programming, you put the punctuation on both sides if it is.";

Things like /Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, "Pathetique."/ bother me. "Pathetique" is not a sentence, it's a title, and the period should not be quoted.

Years of reading and programming have primed me to have certain expectations. When those expectations are stretched or subverted, I can be delighted; when they stretch too far, I'm no longer able to feed it into my reading-hopper easily. It gets jammed.

I'm glad you guys hashed this stuff out in this direction. Rationalfic particularly has a high degree of people coming in from less narrative "writing" environments, and this kind of discussion of syntax is hugely interesting to me. One of my favourite poets is [[https://www.best-poems.net/e_e_cummings/index.html][e e cummings]] ; I'm certainly no e e cummings. But I think I'll navigate that line.
