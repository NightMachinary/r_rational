*** This is a very good theory.

Also, I think the leader of the military group is supposed to be The Comedian from Watchmen based on army guy + smiley face pin, but is he giving anyone else serious Randall Flagg vibes?

** Haha, as soon as that girl was given a bow and arrow of aim assist+1 I knew that it was only going to come up as grazing wounds. Way to unintentionally munchkin the rules there Hailey! I'm pretty sure cowboy hat guy is gonna be the real focus for the story, although having a cosmic horror Aslan instead would be sweet.

*** Like someone else mentioned the cowboy being the joker/comedian/loki has major potential to take over the narrative with themes of "look how bad people actually are" from all of the fractured groups and realities fighting.

Aslan can be a major threat though, I think he killed the first kid to avoid the five being able to send him back or something. He also has the potential to highjack the military with xenocide/rapture theme.

I don't really understand how the cowboy had the gifts for the kids though, this seems to imply he's a subordinate or at least connected in some way? Or it could just be the reality holes coordinating to kill the dragon/closer.
