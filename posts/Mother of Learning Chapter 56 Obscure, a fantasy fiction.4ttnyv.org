** An interesting revelation, it will be useful at the end, but for now, how much does it really help Zach and Zorian? They still have the same basic intractable problem of escaping the loop. I'm glad we got to see more Xvim, though, that guy is great. Also Zach spending a bunch of loops trying to date all the classmates, that's really amazing. Zorian would never be so inefficient. I guess for most of the time Zach wasn't really feeling like he had crosshairs on him but it still seems very... Zach.

  how much does it really help Zach and Zorian?
#+end_quote

A lot!

Remember, RR doesn't know Zorian's identity - but they now know his. If the marker remains on their souls when they leave (which it might, since the Guardian explained that there is already a mechanism to designate an old marker as non-functional), then Zorian might even be able to find him with the marker tracking ritual. Then Zach can beat him senseless, and/or Zorian can loot his mind of everything he knows about the loop and the invasion.

Ideally, Veyers wouldn't even suspect that they're coming for him in the real world. However, he hated Zach's guts to begin with, and we know he holds grudges, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if his first action in the real world is to ambush Zach.

They can also check out in the in-loop Veyers to determine his status. Did his Controller soul get swapped with his template, turning him into a regular loop denizen (probably)? Does he start each loop soulless? Or something else? Is it even, perhaps, possible for them to persuade the Guardian that he has menaced his template and should be switched back (admittedly a long shot)?

And this is clear proof that Zach's memories have been altered. Maybe that will persuade him to let Zorian into his mind. We know that RR was very much a novice of mind magic; what if Zorian can find traces of Zach's old memories? Like whatever loop instructions he was given, so they know how to use their Controller powers? And the reason the loop was started, and why it was started early?

So, holding the Key does not designate you as the Maker; they are distinct. And there are aspects of the loop (like erasing people) that can only be altered by direct intervention of the Maker.

The only confirmed powers of the Key are to mark Controllers and re-open the barred Gate, plus probably (from what the matriarch said) allowing non-Controllers to reach the control room.

  Zorian was tempted to bring Zach to Silverlake after this, just to show him the true meaning of annoying. At least Alanic and Xvim were each helpful in their own way in addition to being hard to deal with.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3eju9z/mother_of_learning_chapter_39_suspicious/ctjvwis][Called it!]]

I didn't catch it on my first read, but on my second read-through (which was about a couple days after my first), it seemed very suspicious that a fellow student who was a massive jerk was mentioned but then never showed up again.

Zorian's search for another time traveler (mostly among other students) specifically excluded him by accident, and he

#+begin_quote
  He was pleasantly surprised that one particular asshole wouldn't be joining them this year -- apparently Veyers Boranova lost his temper on his disciplinary hearing and got himself expelled from the academy. He wouldn't be missed. Honestly, that boy was a menace and it was a disgrace they hadn't expelled him sooner. Fortunately, it seemed there were some things that just couldn't be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova.
#+end_quote

Veyer's reaction during his disciplinary hearing reminded me a great deal of Zach's numerous spats with his asshole caretaker, and the third time-traveler obviously couldn't hiding in plain sight (Zach and Zorian experienced first hand that they would go crazy or detected doing that.)

Evidence:

1) The time traveler is almost certainly someone who would have been near Zach during the original summer solstice, when the spell was originally cast. This could be a fellow student, teacher, or diplomat at the party.

2) Zach and Zorian have demonstrated that it's nearly impossible to do the same thing over and over again. They certainly couldn't/wouldn't do so without showing their increasing skills.

3)If Red Robe was present at the school, he would have noticed Zorian becoming better, and eliminated him. So he can't be someone who is present during the story.

4) Zach starts most loops by kicking Tesen's ass. Zorian started hating Kirielle for her annoying actions at the beginning of the loop, before he got to know her better. This sounds awfully familiar to Veyers losing his temper, although this could have happened before the loop.

5) Veyers is a briefly mentioned character, at the very beginning of the story, who never appears again. The author doesn't put in unnecessary details very often--he was mentioned for a reason.

6) He's mentioned as decidedly unpleasant character, although early Zorian was sometimes an unreliable narrator.

7) He's a member of a noble house, which we have just learned in the last two chapters (actually further back), may have reason to hate Cyoria, which has shifted power from Nobles to first-generation mages.

I expected this reveal to happen when Zach and Zorian finally compared notes (as we've known Zach's memories have been messed with for quite a while), or more recently, when Boranova suddenly showed up to school (if he's a copy, and he left the loop, IIRC, that means he and his original soul switched places.)

Damien has always seemed like a red herring to me. He's too far away for Zach to reach him early, he's a blatantly obvious suspect, and Zorian was originally extremely biased against his family.

The way it's worded, we don't know exactly when the disciplinary hearing happened. I took it to mean the hearing happened during the last month...during the time loop.

#+begin_quote
  "I am Ilsa Zileti, from Cyoria's Royal Academy of Magical Arts. I'm here to discuss the results of your certification."Color drained from Zorian's face. They sent an actual mage to talk to him!? What did he do to warrant this!? Mother was going to skin him alive! "You aren't in trouble, Mister Kazinski," she said, smiling in amusement. *"The Academy has a habit of sending a representative to third year students to discuss various matters of interest. I confess I should have visited you sooner, but I have been a tad busy this year. You have my apologies."*
#+end_quote

Zorian was visited at the beginning of the time loop by a representative of the mage academy, who said they send representatives to discuss "various matters of interest." This easily could have happened to Veyers, with a result more similar to what Zorian apparently expected.

It's possibly it happened during the last school year, but that brings up the big problem of how he was able to join the loop with Zach early on. They've both been in the time loop for decades now. I suppose it could have happened when Zach initially tried to convince everyone of the time loops existence, but he would have to track down Boranova to wherever he lives.

It would be much easier if he was simply attended the school to start with, because he kept his temper during his hearing.

From this newest chapter. It's possible that Zorian is wrong about when he got expelled, but I think he is probably correct. It doesn't make sense for a decision like that to be made too close to the start of the school term.

Damn, this feels almost like too easy a reveal for RR. Though it still doesn't explain how he would have ended up with a marker that didn't expire and let him leave the loop. I guess I can bury any Daimen as RR theories I had, which is good, because it never made much sense for him to support the invasion. I could probably still suspect Daimen of activating the Sovereign's Gate by fiddling around with the Key(s).

This isn't so much a deep, intelligent tactical-genius chessmaster move as much as a basic counter-measure to allow himself more freedom.

Not exactly, no, but Zorian learned about it from Benisek on day two of the loop. Even if we assume that the hearing was on day one (and how could Veyers get himself into an academy disciplinary hearing before he's back at the academy? Causing trouble over the summer would be a police matter, not academy), that's probably not long enough for the formal process of expelling someone. It just doesn't fit at all. I'm pretty sure that the whole disciplinary process was months earlier.

Besides, RR has been looping for years/decades at this point, and he's shown himself to be abrasive and arrogant. He's really going to sit around for a school disciplinary hearing? No way.

Veyers Boronova was kicked out before school started.

Zach starts the loop, everything is normal for a while.

Simulated VB notices Zach's impossibly increased skill somehow.

Simulated VB runs a soul ritual on Zach to bring actual VB's soul into the time loop. And scrambles Zach's memory at that point.

This is hilarious, because people always assumed the looper could do whatever inside the loop without consequence. But simulated soul mages inside the loop as still effective!

As I recall though, you basically have to take a boat or airship to the continent Daimen is on. You /could/ teleport there, but that would require you to have seen the location you want to arrive at.

Since the trip over the ocean, plus the trip to the jungle Daimen is in would take longer than a month, you'd have to go part of the way in one loop, then teleport to you last know location, and continue in another loop.

Obviously, Bakora Gates, hiring someone else (who has already been to that continent) to teleport you there, or some sort of flight spell could you get there faster.

***** I don't think a normal teleport spell has the range to cross an ocean, but if there are islands along the way it might be doable. Plus, there's more exotic teleport and gate spells besides the normal one that probably have much greater range.

If there's an island teleport route possible, even if it wasn't practical for an individual to learn, I think that either governments or private enterprises would have developed it. After all, the quick transmission of information and small amounts of goods and people is a pretty valuable thing to have.

I'd say a perfected magic missile is either half-cost or slightly lower. Zach's aren't quite perfect, but they are very good, since he's probably cast the spell at least 50,000 times.

Zach can cast 232 in a row, I'd expect Zorian's eventual max to be around 64-70, which doesn't sound that impressive, but if you consider that he initially thought his max casts would be 32, is pretty good.

I'm still hoping Zorian can fuse his loop soul to his real soul to double his max mana capacity and strengthen his mind magic abilities. But I'm not sure it works that way, and he'd probably have to logic trick the Guardian of the Threshold to even attempt it. Nobody103 has said a few times that soul splices can cause insanity, but he's always talking about mixing different souls instead of two the same.

******* Back in chapter 46 when Zorian is thinking about his magic missile spell, both in regards to his capacity and execution, he mentions:

#+begin_quote
  None of the books he'd found actually outlined this method as a possible training regimen, instead suggesting endless repetition of the spell as a method, but Zorian felt his idea had merit. He had little to lose by trying it, since the officially suggested training method consisted of mindlessly practicing the normal version for years and even decades at the time. Yes, he was stuck in a time loop, but there had to be a better method than that.
#+end_quote

A perfect cast should be a peak efficiency cast, both from the context in that chapter, and if you go back to when Kyron is first explaining about magic missile and its variants: "The lightshow you usually see is magical leakage resulting from an imperfect spell boundary." I think a mage might get some further negligible bonuses from telekinetic shaping skill mastery, but for the most part those are already factored into the casting of the spell.

Zach has essentially been practicing "the officially suggested training method", and his shaping skills are pretty good, so I think he's probably near max efficiency when it comes to magic missiles. Even if Zach did a perfect invisible magic missile, I doubt his max casts would go over ~240.

She could she just be a normal school friend of Neolu's that transferred into their class once Zach interfered. Even in chapter 7 after 7 months in the loop Zorian didn't know who she was, so she shouldn't have been an usual classmate, but in chapter 6:

#+begin_quote
  Like he suspected, the two girls Zach hung out with during Zorian's original month were nothing special without the Noveda heir there to help them out and hang out with them (and asking people about them led to some pretty annoying rumors being spread around; honestly, can't a guy ask about a girl without everyone assuming he's got a romantic interest in her?)
#+end_quote

So apparently that girl was still around in Zorian's loops 2-7, but he never actually learned her name?

It's possible that we're underestimating just how little Zorian interacted with others due to his unchecked empathy and general assholeness at the beginning of the story, but that doesn't explain why Akoja wouldn't know the girl's name either.

I disagree. They can check the status of the in-loop Veyers, which may give them clues about what he persuaded the Guardian to do to let him out. They can also go after him immediately when they return to the real world; we know Zach can take him in a one-on-one fight, and even Zorian should be able to trounce him unless he gets a Mind Blank up.

Er...not to put too fine a point on it, but this sounds to me like a terrible idea. Even assuming that they could find a way to mark others reliably, which actually seems unlikely to me. Zorian was marked by an extremely dangerous lucky accident, and RR probably used something equally risky (because after all, if it hadn't worked, his soul would have been reset anyway). I think that placing some lesser markers on helpful individuals and eventually getting themselves out will be the most they can manage.

If there was any possibility of Veyers cooperating, then this might not be a totally crazy idea. But as it stands, I reckon he's just bad news, and shouldn't be touched with a ten-foot pole (although Controller!Veyers in the real world is a different story. Whack him around with a pole all you please, he'll doubtless be trying to kill you first).

I mean. Not really.

Remember, according to Ghost Snake, the Loop exits into the normal timeline basically 1 attosecond or similarly small timeframe after it begins. Even if Red Robe exited, he has literally 0 perceivable time to act before the loop ends for real and Zorian/Zach exit (assuming they find a way to do so).

They can exit at the same time, with a perfectly prepared plan of attack, which they have literal years to plan out contingencies for, and which Red Robe necessarily will be completely unprepared for, as he will assume that they ceased to exist.

At this point, Red Robe took the easy exit, but because that gambit didn't work, Zach/Zorian have a monumental advantage. The only winning move for Red Robe is if they fail to find the Key before the loop runs out of energy.

Ahem. This chapter hinted at something far more interesting than Red Robe revelation, and apparently everyone missed that.

The running theory was that Red Robe mindwiped Zach about the specifics of the time loop (its purpose, who created it, why Zach was choosen, how to control it) after copying Zach's Marker onto himself. And yet...

Zach remembers running around in panic, trying to convince everyone he knows that he is stuck in a crazy time loop. Supposedly this is where Boranova got him.

Except why would Zach run around, if he knows what the loop is about? Either he originally had other reasons for approaching Veyers Boranova, independent of asking his help with the invasion, or Red Robe was not the first who scrambled Zach's memory originally. Or did Veyers mindwiped Zach so thoroughly he completely forgot about his first restarts, and repeated them, so that what Zach remembers is his /second/ round of first restarts, and the rest of his problems with memory were caused by Quatach-Ichl's spell alone?

Or was there even anything /to/ scramble? If not, what created the loop, and why?

** Every mentioned Noble House in this story has some secret trick or magical specialization. It would make sense that there is a House that specializes in soul magic. It's just Zach's luck that when he took the loop as an opportunity to befriend his worst enemy, the enemy happens to be a scion of a soul magic Noble House.

Red Robe was helping the invaders; Veyers is from a Noble house, and has a political reason to destroy Cyoria.

Red Robe was an outsider to the invaders; pre-loop Veyers is almost certainly didn't know about them.

Red Robe hijacked the loop back when Zach was new to it; Veyers was his classmate, so Zach was likely to talk to him more-or-less early.

Red Robe must have had access to powerful soul magic in order to insert himself in the loop; Veyers is from a Noble house.

Red Robe seemed to have some sort of personal history with Zach; Veyers hated Zach.

In retrospective, it is obvious. Red Robe is a cruel influential adolescent male with a reason to help invaders despite not knowing about the invasion before, whom Zach knew from before the loop and had a reason to tell about it early. Pretty specific.

You misunderstood the causality break. If Zach was the original looper, he would have known he was in a loop and presumably known his abilities as the controller. He wouldn't need to talk to anyone. It's heavily implied that he was confused about the loop /after/ someone messed with his mind.

Of your 6 points, only the first 2 have any credibility and it's weak at that, for reasons Xtraordinaire pointed out.

The point is the hypothesis of VB being RR was never robust. Theories gravitate towards his candidacy mainly because his name was mentioned and he's never present during the story. Afaik, we don't even know his house's relationship with Cyoria and the government.

Even now, there's a lot of problems with the theory. Veyers was expelled before the loop started: how did he find out about Zach looping, especially when everyone in class hates him? Even assuming his family specializes in mind magic, how does an unruly adolescent extract and mindwipe Zach with such precision in a one month timeframe?

It seems more plausible that VB blamed Zach for his expulsion and wanted some revenge. Incidentally his revenge plan came to life on 1st month of school, thus on the 1st iteration of the loop when Zach was /not/ prepared to fend off the attack.

It is not about evidence being broad, it is about evidence being not available in the universe.

Allow me to illustrate: Silverlake.

We know Silverlake or her spider is going to be used later for some reason. We know that because the author has spent a valuable resource on Silverlake's exposition and has spent /a lot/ of that resource. If Silverlake was /not/ important the correct course of action (for the author) would have been to kill her off like every other soul mage on Kael's list or just make it so Zorian fails to find her.

But Zorian doesn't know that Silverlake will be useful. He can expect to bring her spider eggs only to find that her expertise is absolutely not helpful. There is no /reason/ that any particular avenue of research can't be a dead end.

The same with Boranova. We have been chekhoved, but Zorian wasn't. For him Boranova was a little inconsequential factoid among thousands of others. Thousands of such factoids were filtered out by the author /because/ they are not relevant. But Zorian is not the author he can not know.

No, he wasn't. That's the causality break. In the early loops Zach was not memory wiped and had better understanding of the purpose of the loop. Then he got mind wiped and /that's/ where his confusion begins. His memory wipe explains his lack of dedication because he doesn't know anything about his time limit and any purpose the Agents had to get him looping. He doesn't know that his dragon hunts are insanely wasteful, he doesn't know what should he do to exit and even that he can and so on.

It clearly had happened one way or another, *but* there was no watsonian evidence for that up until this chapter.

Oh. I thought you argued it was unfair for the readers? That the only evidence we had was a meta-evidence, the author's love for Chekhov's guns? But then I don't understand what you're arguing for.

That protagonists had no chance of discovering Red Robe on their own, if not for a lucky coincidence? No, they were going to look into Zach's memory sooner or latter either way.

That the only reason the readers could have been able to determine Red Robe's identity is because the author purposefully fed us random bits of relevant data? No, Red Robe's actions is his actions, the information about Noble Houses was specifically pointed out to be relevant to Red Robe in-universe, as were Zach's early actions. The rest is just logic and a bit of reasonable guesses.

Zorian /himself/ suspected and investigated their classmates, he just forgot about the expelled one. If anything, Veyers' expulsion is a... whatever the relevant analogue of Diabolus ex Machina is called, because if not for it, Zorian and the Cyoria Web would have caught Red Robe there and then.

#+begin_quote
  In the early loops Zach was not memory wiped and had better understanding of the purpose of the loop

No, he didn't, maybe. I actually made a post about it below.

In short, if Zach knew about the loop's purpose, he was even more unlikely to be screwed over by Veyeres, so he either never knew about it and was confused from the start, or was mindwiped by something /before/ Red Robe. But let's discuss that part [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ttnyv/mother_of_learning_chapter_56_obscure_a_fantasy/d5ku0fe][there]], instead of spreading this discussion thin.

******** You would be correct if this weren't a novel written by an author who loves to foreshadow. In a more realistic world, Red Robe would be some complete unknown and the likelihood that it is a fellow student from the very same class is unlikely. However, it is not that unlikely that a mage like RR passed through the halls of Cyoria's school at some point as a student.

In that respect, Boranova is a very likely suspect.

But if the author wants to hammer the rationalist point home, RR would have been a mage with a more tenuous link to Zach---after all, RR has to have learned of the loop. That assumes that RR entered the loop via Zach, however, and that may not be the case. From the very beginning, RR may have piggybacked into the loop with Zach somehow.

However, the memory wipe is pretty damning evidence now. Zach's memory of his classmates is not all that spotty, so why has one particular student been excised from his mind?
