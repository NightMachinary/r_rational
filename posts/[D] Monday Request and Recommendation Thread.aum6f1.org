Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** [[https://www.boywhofell.com/comic/ch00p00][The boy who fell]] is an enjoyable web comic about a kid called ren who gets draged down to hell and has to fight in a grand tordoment in order to return to the human world. The art is very good for a web comic as well, on par with most professional manga, and in the later chapters are even coloured. While it's not really rational there are some good puzzles and clever bits in there. It's also one of those stoys that treads the line between dark as fuck while still haveing a fun and upbeat tone.

[[https://project-apollo.net/mos/mos000.html][A miracle of science]] is another great webcomic. In the world of the future, where Science Related Memetic Disorder is a condition that turns people into mad scientists, the story follows benjamin prester who tracks down and deals with mad scientists and his new partner in the form of a body of the hive mind of mars. It's main problem is the art is a little janky but if you can look past that it is a great read.

[[https://mspfa.com/?s=132&p=1][Beginner guide to the end of the universe]] is the best MS paint Quest I have ever read, especialy at the beginning. I don't wan't to say too much as that would spoil it.

So I while ago I read [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/][Puella Magi Adfligo Systema]] a shity SV quest that starts of good and then very quickly just becomes boring. The main thing that stuck me was how, at times, the main character comes across as a delusional benevolent psychopath. This was the most interesting part of the story to me. Her way of negotiating with people she disagreed with was telling them that she is right and they are wrong and, due to how powerful she was, they would join her, which renforced her delusion. All of this was due to poor writeing but it got me thinking of [[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/][Taint]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-prison-of-glass-worm-cyoa.486424/][A Prison of Glass]] both of who feature likeable nut jobs as the protag. Do you have any recomandations for stoys with slightly insane but likeable main characters.

By the same mechanism most "alternate character interpretation" fanfictions do it: a bit of contrivance. The same happens in "Oh no, not again!" (Harry's 20-something mind travels back to his 11 y.o. body), "The Arithmancer" (Hermione is a genius of maths and thus spellcrafting, and effectively becomes the protagonist of the series) and "The Changeling" (Ginny Weasley is sorted in Slytherin). In all these cases you'd expect major divergences but the plot beats instead end up remaining more or less the same. It works better for comedic/parody stories IMHO because it's never about finding it all believable, in fact the contrivances themselves can be funny if lampshaded.

****** SPOILERS: So basically Harrymort hears the philosopher stone is in the mirror and goes down to get it. Quirrel is already there and tries to attack him but Harry instantly kills him and Harrymort obsesses over the fact he'll get in trouble. Dumbledore later tells Harrymort that it is fine that he killed Quirrel because he did it out of love to a confused Harry.

This bit is funnier cause when they meet again in the 4th book the resurrected Voldemort is pissed that Harry killed him while Harry says it isn't his fault since he didn't k ow Voldemort was possessing him at the time.

If you read five chapters in it really gets funny but I understand if the humor isn't your cup of tea.

**** It's never actually made super clear whether it's really Voldermort though? It may be that a bit of Voldie's personality and memories rubbed off Harry, but I think it's Hermione who suggests it might as well just be that Harry is his own person anyway, distinct enough from Voldemort to not count as a literal mind clone? More of a mind-merge than an overwriting.

  I read it more like some kind of personality disorder. Voldemort's consciousness got absorbed by Harry. I don't remember Harry doing anything evil, he just interprets his actions as such. That just looks like his inner monologue satisfies the mind subagent which is Voldemort, but all his intentions and actions are actually good hearted.<!

First when he killed Quirrel. He didn't know Quirrel was evil at the time, so that was really just cold blooded murder. Next was when he invaded the ministry with Hermoine who drank the luck potion, although it's strongly implied Hermoine's luck made Harry kill people so she could be convinced he's the evil one not her.

I loved it as well. You might also like another Tanya fanfic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12429349/1/The-Leader][The Leader]]. IMHO, A Young Woman's Political Record is more true to the original material and better written, but there's significantly more content in The Leader.

**** You know, I noticed that back when I first read The Boy Who Fell but I just though it was something wrong with my conection. I didn't have the fastest internet back then. Since both of us have the problem, and I still have it now, I guess it must be the websites fault. I am not supper tech savy so there is probably a better way of doing this than what I am about to say.

The best solution I have found is to cover your screen in some way so you can't see the page*, go the start of the next chapter, and then hit the 'previous' link over and over untill you get to the start of the current chapter to load all the pages for that chapter, then use the Go back button go back though the pages this time in the right order. This method is a pain in the ass, and dosen't work all the time, to the point that it's probably not even worth it depending on how much you hate the loading times.

*Not strictly necessary as if you click fast enough you can go the the previous page before the currant on loads but doing that is safer as it stops spoilers. The best way of covering the screen is makeing the window smaller.

** So yesterday I read *[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][The Simulacrum]]* on Royal Road, our protagonist Leonard wakes up with amnesia and then does his best to rationally figure out the slightly odd world he finds himself in.

Light spoiler description would be Leonard quickly learns he is the idiot friend of the protagonist in a harem romance comedy. The world closely follows narrative tropes from the genre and he uses his genre savviness to avoid awkward situations that typically arise out of these stories, and figure out whats going on and why he is there

Mild spoiler description Leonard begins to trip some romance flags and ends up inadvertently in his own harem romance comedy situation by accident

Heavy spoiler description Turns out he is actually in a supernatural shonen harem romance comedy, so add magic battling stuff too. Also Leonard has random superpowers too

Overall I recommend the story it has a /mostly/ rational MC that was interesting and funny enough to keep me engaged through all the current chapters.

*** One downside to The Simulacrum, post first interlude (about halfway right now): it eventually seems like the main character starts acting like a stereotypical dense romantic comedy protagonist. It's not handled particularly well by the author so far, but the main character does note that he's aware of people's feelings for him; I think what's going on is that he just doesn't want to deal with it. However, I would have preferred that he take his own advice and deal with the burgeoning situation with the mature approach that he normally advises other people take

Aside from that, it's definitely worth reading; it's like the best fanfic of a romcom that never existed.

*** Weird one, but have you read [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] by Wildbow?\\
The inciting incident is that Rose Thorburn, lawyer and inhabitant of Hillsglade House, dies. The residents of Jacob's Bell have been waiting for this for a long time, because they hope her heir will sell the house, allowing the town to expand and finally prosper.

Blake Thorburn never expected to be named heir, since Rose specifically stipulated that one of her granddaughters would inherit. However, when his cousin Molly, the first heir, is murdered, he is next in line.

He soon finds out his grandmother was not /just/ a lawyer, and her... other occupations has made her - and now him - a lot of very powerful enemies.\\
Turns out she was a Demonologist. And now scorcerers, Chronomancers, Enchanters, and Fae are out for his blood.

It's not... /too/ rational, but in a believable way. People sometimes behave according to certain stereotypes, because the universe literally rewards them for doing so.

** I'm looking for recommendations for (mostly) pop-sci books in Russian (translated or otherwise) for my grandpa, whose primary interests are in space and cosmonautics (a few more details [[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/etu2s/i_was_born_in_shchigry_ru_in_1932_i_worked_as_a/][here]]). Would also be happy to accept fiction or other non-fiction book recommendations -- probably sci-fi, preferably, but fantasy, romance, etc. also work, so long as they're good. Translated web-fiction would also work, but would be less preferred -- he doesn't care much for e.g. the sorts of themes liked by this sub, and webfic generally lacks the polish of professionally translated / edited works.

Specifically, this is all part of daily "homework" I assign him. On my daily walk into work, I'll call my grandparents up for a 10-20 minute chat, and to keep things fresh and interesting, I've stipulated my grandpa has to read each day a handful of pages from one of several books of my choosing. These tend to be translations of English books I read and enjoyed in highschool, since later reads are more specialized and niche, and he's very well read wrt the Russian "Greats" so anything I can offer there would be old hat. I think it's maybe been helpful in keeping keeping his mind sharper; hard to say... (he's in his 90s... I also make him solve mechanical block puzzles, assemble lego figurines (e.g. the recent Saturn V one), and so on, and otherwise he keeps fairly active with gardening, walking around a lot, etc.). Books that I've gotten for him so far include:

*The Martian (Марсианин)*

Stardust (Звездная пыль)

The Martian Chronicles (Марсианские Xроники)

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Автостопом по Галактике)

The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (Ресторан у конца Вселенной)

The rest of the HGttG, I think (Автостопом по Галактике. Опять в путь)

The Ancestor's Tale (Рассказ предка)

The Demon-Haunted World (Мир, полный демонов : Наука - как свеча во тьме)

*Contact (Контакт)*

A Briefer History of Time (Кратчайшая история времени)

The Selfish Gene (Эгоистичный ген)

XKCD's What If (А что, если?...)

Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Вы, конечно, шутите, мистер Фейнман!)

Surface Details (Несущественная деталь)

Dune (Дюна)

Red Mars (Красный Марс)

Blue Mars (Голубой Марс)

Green Mars (Зеленый Марс)

*Cosmos (Космос: Эволюция Вселенной, жизни и цивилизации)*

Pale Blue Dot 2E (Голубая точка. Космическое будущее человечества)

--------------

Bolded entries are ones he's especially enjoyed.

Also, a specific book request: I tried yesterday to find a translation of Mary Roach's "Packing for Mars", since I think it'd be right up his alley (I've not read it, though). I think the Russian translation is Обратная сторона космонавтики, for some reason. Can anyone find me a lead (I'm not super familiar with the Russian-speaking internet, and I know there are Russian-speaking posters here, in case some have inroads to possible options)? Either a (less-sketchy) place where I could buy it to ship to a US address, or a digital file (sorry if the latter request is not allowed, mods! Unfortunately, grandpa's vision is failing, and he's way too pigheaded to 1) wear any of the reading glasses I've bought him, 2) use any of the magnifying sheet's we've gotten him, 3) use any of the e-reader or tablet's we've gotten him that let you arbitrarily magnify text. So despite having purchased all of the above, I've now taken to just printing them out blown up 3-5x and bound in large 3 ring binders. For a physical book, I'd probably just order it to myself and then digitize it :S. Let me know if I should remove the sentence before the parenthetical pls).

Also, on a related note, he requests that I watch movies / television shows he's enjoyed in exchange. However, my wife's Russian is pretty poor (she's learning it well! but not yet fluent), and I don't have time to watch them without her, so we need versions with English subs/dubs. I'm generally decent at locating these, but can't seem to find a good copy of "The Adjutant of His Excellency" (Адъютант его превосходительства). There's a good Russian-only copy [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZODLHs6LNoE][up on Youtube]], but the auto-generated subs are pretty bad. Any help would be appreciated!

*** You could read "On the Orgin of Species" for pop-sci, the examples he uses are fun to talk about and some of the theories seem absurd now.

Sci-fi: The "Ian Cormac" series by Neal Asher might be of interest for sci-fi, it has the most interesting "progenitor" space race I've ever read and a solid universe with only two major setting weak points in my opinion.

I personally haven't read them but I've seen a lot of recommendations of "The Expanse" series here as a harder sci-fi series.

Question: Have you read any cold war veiled books with him? There's a lot of literature of that's much better done than Animal Farm but feature similar underlying themes of west vs east and capitalism vs communism. I'm not suggesting you do this, just wondering.

Your relationship with your grandfather seems awesome! The most important predictors of elderly quality of life are socialization and exercise. Mentally challenging tasks are great, and gardening is fantastic since it combines exercise and responsibility.

The only thing I would add is to make sure he's drinking enough water and encourage him to eat fruit, it sounds silly but water is a major nutrient of concern for elderly populations. High coffee consumption is correlated with good outcomes if he's a coffee drinker(hydrating, socializing, caffeine, and antioxidants are some theorys why). Fruit is a big one also, keeping nutrient and calorie intake up in the elderly is difficult since chewing and taste get worse with age. You might try some different fruits with him for fun, it's amazing how many different ones you can find at specialty/ethnic stores and older generations appreciate it even more.

I'll give them a thought, although I think a Pokemon Fanfic hardly seems appropriate for his interests... ;p it's been a while since I read the original, and I'm not sure how much he actually enjoys biology (he had to drop Ancestor's Tale a few hundred pages in, and iirc didn't care much for The Selfish Gene, and those are written explicitly for perhaps-not-quite-lowest-common-denominator popular audiences).

I have not read any Cold-War-themed books with him -- it's generally not a subject we talk too much about. I'll take it under consideration, too.

Yeah, he's very active for his age -- 5-10 years ago he was actively deteriorating -- turns out due to multiple fractures of his hip/femur. Some surgeries later and he's up and about again, walking miles each day like it's nothing (although with occasional dizzy spells / falls -- nothing too damaging yet, thankfully).

RE: other healthy habits -- I try to bug him to eat better (esp. a diverse array of high-fiber veggies), but living in another state I can't exert too much control over his diet, and while grandma cooks a decent variety of food for him she's not at all keen to argue with his personal dietary decisions either (which otherwise consist of bread, butter, and pigfat (salo)).

*** I can't help you with the literature stuff, but I might be able to help with the subtitles! I use [[https://www.opensubtitles.org/]] , but I'm not sure how much Russian content it has subbed on there. I don't know about windows but on Linux it's a VLC plug in so you just open VLC and click "download subtitles" and then it downloads the subtitle automagically, and often it's already synced (though you can sync it manually). Otherwise, have you considered a VPN and Russian netflix?

- Ollivander sells Harry the Elder Wand
- Harry is an unregistered cat Animagus
- 6th-year Tonks has the hots for Uncle Remus Lupin, /still/

** I've just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11015476/1/Event-Horizon-Book-1-Autumn-s-Frontier][Event Horizon Book 1: Autumn's Frontier]], part of a series of fanfictions that explore the idea of a lot of fantasy properties existing as different planets in a system that gets eventually explored by future humans. This one focuses on the Game of Thrones world (the others are Lord of the Rings, Warhammer 40K, and I think Avatar TLAB). It's nice and introduces some interesting deviations from canon as well as a light satire of colonialism, but the writing is occasionally a bit eyeroll inducing (specifically, the many 20th and 21st century pop culture references that you wouldn't expect to appear so much as they do), and unfortunately, the series as a whole is incomplete and seems abandoned.

This has awakened my interest though - are there any other good recommendations about *modern/sci-fi military forces and magic fantasy empires* interacting? Preferably complete, and preferably about interesting, balanced interactions, not just "tanks roflstomp everything". Either fanfiction or original works.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/]]

It focusses much more on character interactions and not so much on "tank stomp", and is fairly well written so far. The sci-fi forces operate under real constraints and limitations, have actual motivation and are fairly well fleshed out.

That said, they're not the nicest bunch around, which by GoT standards makes them real stand-up people.

** The Winningverse is a large collection(hundreds of thousands of words) of My Little Pony fanfiction that's all set in the same universe. There are 3 main authors who work closely together and write most of stories and their word is final on what's official canon, but there's also a lot of other authors who write stories in the universe as well. There's a wide variety of genres in it from semi-random comedy to slice of life to adventure, but it all maintains the same worldbuilding. I don't /particularly/ recommend it unless you're already a fan of My Little Pony fanfiction, I enjoy it but it's not super-amazing or anything.

Are there any similar expanded universes in other fandoms?

**** I think GeneraIKenoA is simply using it as an example of an [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse][Expanded Universe]] where an author or more is doing some serious world-building beyond what exists in the world of the series and there exists some lengthy stories from him to enjoy. A fair number of them tend to also be AUs.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/203805/the-triptych-continuum][The Triptych Continuum]] is one example in MLP:FiM which features a version of Equestria where all of the episodes of the first three seasons still occurred, but in a more realistic manner by often examining the /consequences/ of many of the episodes' events. One such example is Spike's greed growth results in him having to work to regain Ponyville's trust instead of everyone accepting him back immediately after he transformed back from being a berserk monstrous dragon.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TranscendenceAU][Transcendence AU]] takes place after most of Gravity Falls where a plot by Bill Cipher to merge the dream world with the real world fails, but in the process Dipper becomes a demon.

I did read some Hunger Games fanfiction by several authors that all formed a coherent universe (it was the first novel told from all the other Tributes' perspectives essentially), and though they were good and all I wouldn't say they'd be of interest to anyone who wasn't like me in 2012 and really wanted to devour all the Hunger Games related content she could.

And from the author's notes of the linked story:

#+begin_quote
  This story is intended to be a companion piece to the fanfics "A Fox's View" and "Love is a Battlefield" by Caisha702, as well as "Cripple" by be-nice-to-nerds, all of which can be found on this website. Many of the "missing moments" scenes (as well as the non-canon names outside of District 3) are borrowed from these stories (and associated one-shots) in order to generate continuity.

I think there are a few more fanfics in that "universe", which you can probably find by looking through authors' favourites sections.

I think [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/Glowfic][Glowfic]] and the Infinite Time Loop fics on Spacebattles would probably fit too.

Got into none of them, though. It's already hard enough to find good fanfic writers in the wild, let alone a team of them, and all co-written fics I've found have some big flaws.
