*** Now that you mention it... I always wondered what happened to Sokka's Sword after he dropped it... Was it ever found? What kind of crazy meteorite was that thing made out of anyway? Clearly someone needs to shoot some science at it.

***** Ah yes Meteoric Iron. Well known for being able to shear through thick sheets of lesser metals as though they aren't even there. Maybe Rational!Sokka has just been hiding some secret Monomolecular edge bending techneque all this time.

**** That's not pandering, darn it. Pandering would be wanting Professor Unalaq to build an evil science beam out of space rock that shoots giant evil purple science lasers. And then turning out to be a woman and lezzing out with Asami.

***** Someone should have a science staff or science wand or science crystal ball.

They're just like magic staves, but with science instead.

Actually, a science crystal ball could be something they made to study light diffraction, now that I think about it.
