** Korra is a brat like in canon, but other than that it has very rational characters. I particularly like how it deals with bending and the Avatar state. Written by our very own [[/u/writingathing]], though he thinks it's not rational when it clearly is.

** The author would like to submit that if this is rational/ist fiction, then anything is, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophasis][but apparently saying that makes seraphnb unhappy so]] [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=douchebag][I]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophasis][won't.]]

** After a couple posts recommending this, I've added to my FF reading list. Further, further down the rabbit hole I go...

** It's good story, but a bit disjointed and I fell it requiers a bit of guess work on the readers side when it comes to explaining a situation, like the part with hospital and Tenzin and Lin freaking out.

Fell free to explain a situation and add detail to characters behaviors more often. Would be nice if there were more to dialogues than people talking.

Also I think I read a similar fanfic like this before, the penguin hobo sounds familiar.

It's gone through several iterations, and this will definitely be the last.
