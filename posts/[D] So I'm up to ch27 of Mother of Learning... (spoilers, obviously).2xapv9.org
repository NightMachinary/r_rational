Is it just me or is this Time Braid?

Not so much with the Aranea and lack of underage sex, but seemingly everything else is Time Braid retextured with DnD.

The protagonist is an intellectual with small mana/chakra reserves but good control, who is reliving the same month repeatedly as a result of being anchored to a charming but dimwitted boy with massive mana/chakra reserves whose entire family is dead. The protagonist discovers at some point in the loops that they have a hidden innate power. They bring other people/spiders into the loops by storing backups of their memories inside their own soul to be given to the next iteration of the other person at the start of the next loop. After enjoying a period of dilligent study and the occasional bit of messing around they discover that an enemy is also looping and has the means to deal them harm in a way that will carry over into subsequent loops.


** If I remember right, Mother of Learning was inspired by Time Braid. Personally, I much prefer the direction Mother of Learning is going. Crack like Time Braid is fun only in small doses for me.

*** Most people don't consider Time Braid crackfic. Crossover, yes, but most crackfic is intentionally humorous and self-awarely riffing on canon themes and characterizations. That's not what Time Braid does, nor does it identify itself as such.

Just say you don't like Time Braid very much. That's not exactly a super-unpopular opinion (see OP's shots at it).

**** Well, now I have a better understanding of what crackfic is. Does that meant the weird Demonic and Angelic parts were from somewhere else? That's pretty much the part where the story lost me.

***** Ah, I see. Yeah, now your comment makes a little more sense. That's a crossover from [[#s][an anime]] (now spoilered.) I think the fic predated crossover tags on Fanfiction.net, but I'm not 100% sure of that. Also, marking* it as such would kind of make no sense for the first 80% of the story and ruin the surprise... Totally understand the confusion that would bring.

Anyway, didn't mean to be short with you or anything. Hope that helps you make sense of the madness.

** Imperfect comparison. Many of your things are slightly rephrased universal elements of stories, others are poor comparisons, some are clear retextures.

#+begin_quote
  The protagonist is an intellectual with small mana/chakra reserves but good control
#+end_quote

For the first chapter, yes, but after that her reserves grow pretty quickly. By the end of the first chapter she can walk on water for an hour and I don't believe her chakra limits come into play much.

#+begin_quote
  who is reliving the same month repeatedly
#+end_quote

That's a very common plot point, very popular too. Time Braid was not the first one that did it by any means.

#+begin_quote
  as a result of being anchored to a charming but dimwitted boy with massive mana/chakra reserves whose entire family is dead.
#+end_quote

Sort of. In MoL he's more tightly anchored, and if Zach dies he dies. Plus he's in the same timeline. While Sakura is anchored to Naruto that doesn't really come into play for most of the story. Zach is a very Naruto like character though.

#+begin_quote
  The protagonist discovers at some point in the loops that they have a hidden innate power.
#+end_quote

As with most magical stories. You have to be vague because it's a very different power and as such a very different type of story.

#+begin_quote
  They bring other people/spiders into the loops by storing backups of their memories inside their own soul to be given to the next iteration of the other person at the start of the next loop.
#+end_quote

Sort of. A spider brings people into the loop, people of her choosing, so the story plays out very differently to how it plays when the protagonist can bring people into the loop. He has far less control over what she does.

#+begin_quote
  After enjoying a period of dilligent study and the occasional bit of messing around they discover that an enemy is also looping and has the means to deal them harm in a way that will carry over into subsequent loops.
#+end_quote

After they do stuff they discover an enemy that can cause them permanent harm is an almost universal property of stories. Students, predictably, study and mess around. For dramatic tension to exist the ability to harm people permanently should normally exist.

In personality. He basically has Sasuke's backstory, though (last survivor of a clan of militants; rich but lonely; doted on by tutors; etc.)

Still, the magic was introduced, and there's no reason given (so far) that Zorian won't be able to learn it for himself at some point. Other than that maybe being a waste of time with the loop winding down.

**** I suppose, another difference between Zach and Zorian.

He may later learn how to do that mind magic, but since he can't yet do it it's not really a similarity between Time Braid and MoL.

I presume at some point he'll go plying other Aranea tribes for knowledge.

** I wouldnt say that Mother of Learning is exactly like Time Braid, rather that it appears to draw heavily from it as an inspiration. Its not the general plot points that make the story, its the details and writing style. In that aspect, Mother of Learning is quite different, yet also enjoyable.

** I've read both, and it certainly is very Time Braid-esque. Not enough to be non-enjoyable though. :)
