*** Ponies live on a death planet only barely restrained by magic and a g rating.

This author's written a lot of dark stories, which honestly vary in quality.

Personally, I think that it could've been given a relatively happy ending by saving some of the victims with a genetic reset. With an undamaged reference piece of genetic material, magic could undo the genetic level damage without needing to rely on anentropic bullshit.

*** Yeah. To make it even worse, the described symptoms couldn't happen if the inner containment was still working properly. So one of the earlier groups must have been deliberately trying to retrieve the contents, and when the effects became clear the work continued anyway.

Luckily [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/42409/1/the-writing-on-the-wall/the-writing-on-the-wall#comment/1078069][this recursive-fic comment]] fixes everything by explaining the story as an in-universe Daring Doo fanfic by Twilight.

** I don't see any connection to rationality, but it was, surprisingly a pretty good read.

The connection to the show is completely superficial, the story might as well have been about aliens, future humans, etc. Come to think of it, wasn't there a story like that involving aliens? I could be imagining things...

Science is a thing. Anyone with a scientific education figured out what was going on well before the characters had any idea.

** I've always wondered if the design would actually work. If cautious scientists are the ones to discover it, then maybe they would work in from the outside, understanding each level as they went. If so, they would back off and survive.

What if, instead, the people to discover it were a bunch of wildcat goldminers? Or some not-too-bright tomb raiders? I've always felt that there are more of this type of people than of the cautious type, and it seems more probable to me that they would /not/ take the time to investigate slowly, instead delving straight to the center to see "the goodies" or "the point of it all."

What do you all think?

*** I think the combination of curiosity and uncorrected anthropic bias - 'how dangerous can it be, we've always been fine before!' - would lead to it's unsealing very quickly.

IMO the best option would be to hide it as completely as possible, so that anyone capable of finding it will also understand the contents. After all, "This is not a place of honour, nothing is valuable here" sounds exactly like what you'd say to keep people away, whereas "Warning, nuclear waste dump" in an unassuming hidden mineshaft just makes me want to stay away.

Make it as uninteresting as possible, and hope for the best... or better, avoid creating such waste in the first place.

But only because you know what a nuclear waste dump is. The question is how to get that idea across to future civilizations that don't read out languages and may not even have an atomic theory.

EDIT: but yeah, I'm totally onboard with the "better to be hidden" because it would be opened otherwise.

**** The WIPP design team considered and specifically rejected obscuration:

#+begin_quote
  The site must be marked. Aside from a legal requirement, the site will be indelibly imprinted by the human activity associated with waste disposal. We must complete the process by explaining what has been done and why.
#+end_quote

Which I think is reasonable. Obscuration might work if you build it in the mountains and pay special attention to keeping the associated processing and packaging facilities underground or hidden. But in the desert, even slight evidence can last for a very long time. The Nazca Lines are [[http://epod.usra.edu/.a/6a0105371bb32c970b01901ec67911970b-pi][surprisingly tiny]] but have already lasted for 1500 years. Concealing something like [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant_2004.jpg/1920px-Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant_2004.jpg][the WIPP's aboveground facilities]] is basically impossible.

Also, take into account that the "tomb" in this fic is not very well designed and may have poisoned your intuition for the entire class of objects. It resembles other valuable archaeological finds in design direction and architectural symbolism, suggesting that the installation has something valuable to defend. Even worse, there's a clear "way forward", so the spikes and messages are defenses rather than warnings.

A well-designed marker is simply a forbidding field of spikes or a sixteen-square-kilometer slab of obsidian, with nowhere to go and no implied reward. If there is a way to go, it's toward a central monolith where the path clearly ends. Even if a civilization can muster the industrial might necessary to dig deep enough the lack of clear reward and path make it vastly more difficult to get the necessary billions of dollars of investment on board.
