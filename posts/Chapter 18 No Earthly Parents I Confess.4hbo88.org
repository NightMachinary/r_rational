** *Summary/Teaser*

Aaron Smith-Teller works in a kabbalistic sweatshop in Silicon Valley, where he and hundreds of other minimum-wage workers try to brute-force the Holy Names of God. All around him, vast forces have been moving their pieces into place for the final confrontation. An overworked archangel tries to debug the laws of physics. Henry Kissinger transforms the ancient conflict between Heaven and Hell into a US-Soviet proxy war. A Mexican hedge wizard with no actual magic wreaks havoc using the dark art of placebomancy. The Messiah reads a book by Peter Singer and starts wondering exactly what it would mean to do as much good as possible...

Aaron doesn't care about any of this. He and his not-quite-girlfriend Ana are engaged in something far more important -- griping about magical intellectual property law. But when a chance discovery brings them into conflict with mysterious international magic-intellectual-property watchdog UNSONG, they find themselves caught in a web of plots, crusades, and prophecies leading inexorably to the end of the world.

** So, Comet West is the Comet King, right? The first comment onsite appears to assume that the Comet King is Jalaketu West, but this strikes me as questionable given the overall timeline. Are we to believe that Sohu was conceived when her father was five years old?

*** Clearly the Comet King was born as a fully-fledged adult (or, more accurately, he grew up super-fast, as echoed in that one comment from that one doctor). Alternately, Sohu isn't his literal biological daughter.

*** Jala appears in the [[http://unsongbook.com/book-i-genesis/][prologue epigraph]] as someone who knew the haMephorash, and seems to be the same person as the Comet King, although it's a little ambiguous.

** Jesus was born of a virgin birth, and He was the Earthly form of His father, God.

Jalaketu West was born of a virgin birth, and he was named for his father (according to a comment on the chapter site).

Theory: just as Jesus was God in Earthly form, Jalaketu West is Comet West in Earthly form. They're both technically the Comet King.

**** To be fair, from his reference to "another," I'm assuming he saw Eaglejarl's latest Tinker thread where someone said this, and people agreed that it was a valid point.

I don't fully agree but it does seem like the community is being inconsistent here...

Edit: Oh, it's the same guy.

*** If you want something to exist, then the surest way to make it exist is to build it yourself. I'm cool with adding a PSA at the end of a summary or teaser, but if you can't be bothered to do it yourself, how can you expect other people to do it?

**** Because I'm not the one pimping these stories, and neither am I the author of these things? I'm just a prospective reader... I'm not going to read a story just to make up for something the author should be doing on their own.

I haven't the slightest clue why I should care about this story other than the fact it's posted as a link on a subreddit I enjoy for the most part.

***** To be fair... every single chapter has been posted on this subreddit, as they've been written. The majority of people reading it because of this subreddit are not reading ab initio, but have been following the story for some time, and are using these threads to discuss the ongoing work. Pretty much every single thread in this subreddit where people include "chapter X" in the title are used more for discussing the specific chapter than for introducing the work as a whole, and only extremely rarely do these 'chapter notification threads' include a description of the work as a whole.

***** I'd suggest that you focus on making these PSAs for stories that you already read, then.

(FWIW I added a teaser to Unsong, since it was easy to copypasta from TV Tropes)
