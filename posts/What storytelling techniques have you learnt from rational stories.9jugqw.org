Specifically, what have you learnt about what works and doesn't work in a story?


** This seems like a general question that probably calls for a brief response, and I'm going to give a very specific answer that takes the form of a not-so-brief response.

I've waited a long time for a story to make me feel the same way I felt the first time I read Mother of Learning. I've had few reading experiences that match the feeling of excitement and giddiness that I felt when plowing through those opening chapters, and I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what made the opening act of Mother of Learning so enchanting. I think a lot of it comes down to the fact that Zorian (and the reader along with him) gets to have his cake and eat it, too.

The cliche "You can't have your cake and eat it too," refers to the fact that when you /have/ cake in your possession, you can enjoy the anticipation of eating it, and if you /eat/ the cake, then you can enjoy the pleasure of consuming it, but these two are mutually exclusive: consuming the cake removes your ability to anticipate its future consumption.

In the context of a story, anticipation usually takes the form of, "The author has established a possibility space, where one of several possible things could happen. I wonder what awesome thing is going to happen!" (For example, "I wonder how the hero is going to defeat the villain!" or "I wonder if these two characters are going to fall in love!" or "I wonder what's on the other side of that door!") A lot of the fun of fiction comes from the author setting up a possibility space, and then giving the reader room to speculate about all the possibilities. But ultimately, our questions are answered: the character identifies a strategy for defeating the villain, chooses a love interest, or finds out what's on the other side of that door. And while we're kind of happy to see the hero defeat the villain, there's a part of us that misses the time when we were left to theorize about how the hero was going to pull it off. Ideally, we're satisfied enough with the outcome that we forgive the author for closing off all the other possibility space. (And pretty much any time that people complain about something being a "disappointment" or "wasted potential," it's because the author delivered an outcome that took away our ability to speculate without delivering something sufficiently satisfying.) But every time we reach an "outcome," we're leaving the possibility space behind. The moment Protag-kun chooses who to spend his Valentine's Day with, all other possible futures are closed off forever.

The usual solution to the problem of "can't have cake and eat it, too," is to have multiple cakes, so while you're eating the carrot cake at your local diner, you can also anticipate your future consumption of the chocolate cake that you have at home. A good story feels like being led on a non-stop cake-eating tour, where by the time you've finished the last bite of the chocolate cake the author has already filled you with anticipation for the coconut cream cake that is waiting only a block away, with the promise that the next cake will be even better than the last (and if they're consistently delivering on the promise, "you thought that cake was good, trust me, the next one will be even better," then the sense of anticipation will remain high throughout the process and you'll be drowning in a euphoric mess by the end). Still, the limitation exists that every time you eat a cake, you're sacrificing the joy of anticipation for the joy of tasting it. No matter how good the next cake is, once you've eaten that coconut cream cake, you don't get to anticipate it anymore.

Unless you have a time machine. Then you can go back to before you ate the coconut cream cake, and you never have to stop anticipating it, even after you've enjoyed eating it.

The beauty of a time loop story is that you get to deliver story outcomes while leaving the possibility space intact. Every time Zorian is presented with a choice (even if it's as seemingly humdrum as "which of my classmates am I going to spend time with today"), we're left to speculate about all the possibilities. And then Zorian makes a decision, but /we still get to speculate about all the other possibilities/ because he might come back to them later. It also doesn't hurt that all of the possibilities are interesting and fun in and of themselves.

That's a big part of what makes time loop stories interesting, but I think you can generalize it to other types of stories that don't involve time travel. Time loops are a way to move the story forward and having characters make decisions without closing off a possibility space, but I think you can do this with other types of decisions as well.

For example, one of the parts I found enchanting about Mother of Learning actually had little to do with the time loop itself and more the fact that Zorian has years to work on developing his skills. Every time Zorian goes to the library, the possibility space is wide open. What book is he going to read? What skill is he going to learn? The library is full of thousands of books, but he can only read one at a time. But when he chooses a book to pick up off the shelf and read it, he isn't actually closing the possibilty space: all of the other books remain on the shelf, waiting to be read. In Zorian's case, he gets to read lots of books and have "magical studies" as a possibility space that remains wide open for the entire duration of the story, but you could achieve this without a time loop just by telling a story that takes place over many years, where the protagonist repeatedly gets to come back to the question of, "which skill do I want to master today?"

I think this is actually a big part of the appeal of harem stories: choosing one romantic interest means "rejecting" all other potentially interested suitors, considerably narrowing the possibility space. So, in order to maintain the widest possibility space, the main character never chooses a single love interest. By remaining perpetually single, the protagonist maintains a status quo where /anything/ is possible and /no/ love interest is off the table. This works up until the point when the reader realizes that by committing to perpetual indecision, the author is actually telling a story where /nothing/ is really possible and nothing can really happen, because everything is done in service of the status quo, at which point readers may become frustrated and stop reading. A solution to this might be replacing an indecisive protagonist with one who is a serial monogamist: Even if Alice begins dating Bob, there's always a possibility that she might break up with him and start dating Charlie in the future. This provides all of the Alice-Charlie shippers in the audience with a reason to keep reading through the Alice-Bob arc, but more critically, it provides the people who were interested both by the AB and AC possibility the potential to see both of those spaces explored. And any time a Dave, Edward, or Frank enters the picture, our minds can run rampant with speculation about what Alice's future might hold with respect to those characters. (Incidentally, the whole "team Edward versus team Jacob" thing was entirely about a possibility space where both Edward and Jacob were viable romantic interests. In creating romantic ambiguity, Stephenie Meyer gave her readers room to speculate, and speculate they did. There's little doubt in my mind that this was a deliberate choice on her part.)

Not every possibility space is like this. When the possibility space is "what is our hero going to do about that sword that's swinging toward her face?" we might immediately get to the part where she raises his shield to deflect the blow before we even begin to consider the other possibilities. And in that case, we're usually perfectly happy to abandon that possibility space, because simply seeing our hero deflect the blow is probably going to be more interesting than reading paragraphs about all of the options available to her before she finally settles on raising her shield as the proper response. But sometimes the possibility space is, "What would I do if I were a kid attending wizard school?" That possibility space is a veritable playground. Be conscious of when you're creating a possibility space that people are going to enjoy spending time in. If you have the world's greatest playground, you want to let people play around in it for as long as possible. If the possibility space is broad enough, you can extend it for the entire duration of the story. (For example, if the possibility space is "I wonder what's going to happen at wizard school," and the entire story is set in wizard school, then you never have to leave the possibility space.)

To give a concrete example of how I have tried to implement this in my own writing, in the first chapter of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/re-dragonize-original-litrpg.46226/][Re:Dragonize]], the protagonist is faced with a choice, with several explicit options laid out for him, and he contemplates each possibility. I wanted to set up that choice as a fun possibility space: protag has three options, what are the implications of each option? He eventually arrives at a decision (and faces the consequences), but even though the opening explores one possible outcome, I wanted to make the question interesting enough that people would want to speculate about what the other outcomes could have been. I was curious as to whether readers would agree with me that this was an interesting possibility space to explore. Indeed, many early comments took the form of people asking, "What would have happened if he had chose Y or Z instead?" I was delighted when I read these comments, because it let me know that I had achieved exactly what I had intended.

*** An addendum that was too long to fit into the body of the above post due to reddit's character limit:

All of the above discussion (focused on how to continue dwelling in a fun possibility space) kind of skips past a more significant topic, which is how to create a fun possibility space in the first place. The main reason I've skipped past this is that an interesting possibility space is usually defined by the characters, setting, and plot that make it up, and advice like "write a story that has compelling characters, setting, and plot" falls squarely into the realm of advice that is so obvious as to be completely useless. But I think we can break it down a little bit more by looking at the symptoms of the most successful possibility spaces. You know that you have an interesting possibility space that fans enjoy spending time in when they go online to discuss the story and post theories about what will happen next. Arguably, the entire point of fanfiction is to play around in the possibility space that the author left unexplored, allowing fans to realize all of the adventures that could have taken place at Hogwarts, or all of the romances that could have sprung up between the characters of their favorite story.

Using "fan engagement" as a reasonable proxy for "how fun the possibility space is to explore," one thing becomes immediately obvious: almost all of it is speculative fiction. The top categories on FF.net are Harry Potter, Twilight, Percy Jackson, Lord of the Rings, and Hunger Games. Note that this isn't just a "popular books" category: lots of people read The Da Vinci Code and The Fault in Our Stars, but these books have proportionally less fanfiction. Dan Brown is more popular than Brandon Sanderson, but [[/r/brandonsanderson]] has 18,000 readers while [[/r/danbrown]] is in the triple digits. Based on this, it seems like stories that are focused on a /setting/ (most speculative fiction, particularly stories with rich worldbuilding like Harry Potter and Mistborn) get a lot of mileage out of their possibility space, whereas it's much less a focus for stories that are centered on plot (page-turners by Dan Brown and Clive Cussler). Plot-centered stories are more in the business of posing a question and then immediately answering it several pages later, rather than asking open-ended questions that the reader carries with them. When people read a Dirk Pitt novel, they care about Dirk Pitt for about as long as they're reading the book, and then promptly forget about him until they pick up the next book. But when it comes to Harry Potter, people don't just want to read about Hogwarts; they want to fantasize about it. They spend time dwelling on the work even when they're not actively reading it.

...Is the best explanation I've ever read of why any sufficiently continued romance story must become polyamory in the end, and anime Indecision Harems are not sustainable. Since modern authors have not widely realized this, most romance stories are at most one book. Conversely, Laurell Hamilton uses a mix of polyamory and serial monogamy to continue indefinitely without the harem becoming unmanageably large, or the possibility space closing down.

***** I think this is an issue that becomes most apparent when looking at anime that are adapted from visual novels.

In a visual novel, the player is given a choice of romantic interests, and the game is designed so that the player chooses a single love interest to (monogamously) pursue. After they've reached the end of the arc and successfully "romanced" a love interest, they restart the game and can make a different choice. The /protagonist/ gets to pledge eternal fidelity to a single person, but the /player/ is a serial monogamist who gets to romance everyone (assuming they choose to play the game more than once). (There have been several games that play with this meta-level contradiction between protagonist and player, most prominently Doki Doki Literature Club, which shares a lot of similarities with Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi.)

Trying to adapt this kind of visual novel into an anime is often how you end up with the "love polygon held in equilibrium by the protagonist's indecision," existing solely on romantic tension with no actual payoff.

There is another (rarer) way some anime handle this, which is the "omnibus format," pioneered by Amagami SS. The way that people typically play visual novels is to play the game multiple times, pursuing a different romantic interest each time. You can do this in the form of an anime: have a 4-episode arc where the protagonist chooses a single romantic interest to pursue. The arc ends with the two declaring their love for each other. And, with that "route" concluded, we hit the reset button and warp back to the beginning to tell a /different/ 4-episode arc where the protagonist chooses a /different/ romantic interest, the two fall in love and declare their love, before we wipe the slate clean /again/ with yet another romantic prospect. Repeat for the duration of your 24-episode broadcast. This follows a similar structure to a "time loop," except the whole "wipe the slate and start over again" isn't actually part of the fiction; it's part of the meta-structure of the show. A 24-episode broadcast gives you room for 6 discrete romance arcs, all of which begin from the same starting point but which are mutually exclusive and share no continuity.

Clannad sort of splits the difference; it remains romantically ambiguous for as long as possible before finally allowing protag-kun to pick a canonical heroine, but there are several OVAs titled "Another World" which explore alternate stories in which he ended up with one of the other girls.

** I think I've learned this more from fan fiction in general than rational fiction specifically, but it continues to apply to works recommended here. There are at least /five/ different skills that I might classify as "writing" when it comes to story quality. These seem completely distinct: success or failure in any one does not necessarily guarantees the same for any other.

1. Basic composition - Spelling, grammar, a consistent tone and style.
2. Engaging prose - Use of vocabulary, quality of description, efficiency with words, clarity of action.
3. Engaging characters - Dialogue, expression, consistency of personality, believable behavior.
4. Engaging plot - Timing of story beats, well-placed exposition, clever twists and resolutions.
5. Theme and Meaning - Does the story make me think? Is it worth reflection?

These are essentially in order. At the top of the list are qualities which, if they're missing, will make me drop a story fast. When a work has an excellent grasp of four and five with major flaws in the first three, people who recommend it have to ask that we "Don't give up on this one."

At the bottom are qualities which, if they're still missing many chapters in, leave me feeling empty and disappointed. Sometimes I'll start a story with excellent skill in the first three and immediately say, "How have I never heard of this author?" Usually it's because there's weakness in four and five.

In both cases, that seems to imply that /tolerance/ for fiction and /first-impressions/ of authors is based on narrow technical aspects, but /love/ for fiction and /loyalty/ to authors is based on the strength of their storytelling.

*** Aren't four and five purely subjective, especially plot? some people would be interested in the transformation of a high school teacher into a drug lord, while others would prefer reading about a farm boy toppling an empire. If the author is capable of the first three, any plot he chooses would be objectively well executed. If the characters are distinct, flashed out individuals who, in the hands of the author, could react realistically to any situation, it doesn't matter what situations they get into.

Themes and meaning also can't be judged objectively IMO. Simple stories could hold great meaning to some people and appear shallow to others. Attack on titan made me think a lot about the amazing difference between humans and other animals. Or about how lucky we are to be at the top of the food chain. Sure, these are not profound or ground breaking ideas. Nonetheless they touched me deeply on some level and made me think beyond what would be considered a basic story.

It seems to me like the first three are the must have building blocks of every good storyteller, while four and five are the style or flavor that can't really be criticized objectively. Any guilty pleasure would be a story that fails spectacularly at the first three, but the reader still reads because four and five match exactly his tastes.

On a side note - I have noticed that dialogue is the most efficient tool when looking for good stories hidden between all the the mediocre ones. Especially when searching for fanfiction or webnovels. You could be a great writer (nailing down the first and the second) and a terrible storyteller- failing at the third point. Dialogue is the fastest way to spot the difference.

To begin with, what you've described are not strictly examples of plot; you're describing premises that also imply a certain milieu, which goes beyond the realm of plot. "Two people fall in love after some interference from a competing love interest" is a standard romance story that could be told about people in a medieval setting, a Victorian setting, a contemporary setting, or a futuristic sci-fi setting. The minute you describe a story by saying "She's an investment banker from Scarsdale and he's a blue-collar worker who dropped out of high school, how will they ever get together?" you're now describing a story not just in terms of its romantic /plot/, but in terms of its /setting/. The same is true about stories about people being corrupted by the allure of power: the fact that Walter White is a high school teacher tells you more about the setting of the story than the type of plot he's experiencing.

Incidentally, I'd argue that when it comes to things like subjective taste, setting tends to have a stronger pull plot. Plot-wise, Rogue One arguably has more in common with Ocean's Eleven than it does with Return of the Jedi, but when people think about Rogue One, they think more about the setting and lore (the force, storm troopers, AT-ATs) and less about what type of plot it is (a motley crew of people with different roles conspire in an elaborate scheme to steal a macguffin). Most people think about Rogue One as a science fantasy story before they think about it as a heist movie (to the extent that they even think of it as a heist movie at all).

In the realm of plot, subjective tastes are certainly part of it; there are some people who want a romance story with a "happily ever after" end, and some people who want a plot that is full of dark twists and shocking revelations. The things that make some readers giddy with excitement will cause others to put the book down. However, that hardly means that plot is "strictly subjective." Even if my subjective preference is for stories about farm boys who overthrow an evil empire (as opposed to stories whose plot focuses on two people falling in love), surely we can agree that there are some stories that execute this plot-type well, and stories that do it poorly. All of the Indiana Jones have the same basic plot structure, but there's pretty uniform agreement that some of them are good and some are bad. You could make an argument that this is still a subjective judgment, as I'm sure you could find /someone/ who enjoyed Crystal Skull more than Raiders of the Lost Ark, but at a certain point I think you're sort of descending into a semantic argument where points about subjectivity cease to be useful in a world where "technically, /everything/ is subjective." Yes, tastes are subjective, but when I say I like heist movies, everyone knows what I mean, and when I say I like /good/ heist movies, a lot of people tend to have pretty similar ideas of what that means, and will probably be more likely to recommend Heat than, say, Hurricane Heist.

When people say, "This is a good plot," their claim is usually less, "This is story's plot type is my favorite," and more, "This plot is a really well-executed version of what it's trying to be." (When people say, "I love Goodfellas," I assume their statement is probably closer to "I think this movie was a well-done gangster movie," than "I like gangster movies, and this was one of those.") When people say something has a "good plot," they're talking about things like how good the author is at calibrating expectations, so that when the surprise revelation comes, the audience smacks their forehead and says, "Of course! Now it all makes sense!" rather than, "Wait, huh? That totally came out of nowhere." They're talking about things like pacing, where instead of having 150 pages of exposition where nothing happens, followed by 150 pages of action, the author is instead able to have a plot that is constantly moving forward even as it slowly doles out the information that the reader will need in order for the ending to work.

***** I guess I confused plot with premise, point taken!

Though to me it still seems like the arguments you made about the differences between a good and a bad plot- mainly pacing and expectations, are harder to judge objectively than things like characterization or prose or basic grammar and spelling. As I see it, if the prose is great, and the characters feel like real people (have distinct voices, react to situations realistically, consistent, engaging, etcetera) it wouldn't inherently be bad to have 150 pages of exposition follows by 150 pages of action (personally, I would actually prefer that). Can you define a few clear parameters that can objectively be associated with a good plot? pacing and calibrating expectation are too broad and subjective IMO.

I think this is another case of "disagreement" that's really just a different understanding of terms and definitions. If I had to guess, it sounds like you're coming at this from an angle like, "I love exposition! My favorite part of a show is the part where the characters are just talking to each other, instead of doing things like punching bad guys in the face!" If that's the case, you should be aware that you're talking just about dialog, and not all dialog is exposition. You can have witty banter without exposition, and in fact if the banter consists 100% of exposition it often becomes a lot more exhausting and a lot less "witty."

You say that you like stories where characters "react to situations realistically." Think about how you realistically react to situations: is every sentence that leaves your mouth expository? When you stub your toe, do you say, "Ouch! This hurts worse than the time at the beach when I stepped on a bee!" Or do you just say "Ouch"?

You can have /some/ of those moments. When we see Indiana Jones discover the snake in his hap and say, "I hate snakes!" it's a comedic moment. But if you do this /all the time/, it starts to get exhausting.

If you're coming at this from the angle of, "Well, I like learning things about the characters, so therefore I like exposition," I'd argue that exposition is one of the /weakest/ ways for us to learn about the characters, and the most interesting scenes that teach us about characters are those that consist of action. If a character says, "You know, Joe really has a hair-trigger temper, he's always going off and getting mad about the most trivial things," that's exposition. But you could just have Joe storm into the room and say, "Who the HELL thought it was a good idea to orient the paper towel dispenser horizontally?" That conveys the fact that Joe has a hair-trigger temper who tends to get irrationally upset about minor things, without having to have a character come out and explain that fact to us. (This is often phrased as "show, don't tell.")

To further explore what it would actually mean for a story to be 50% exposition, let's take the first Avengers movie as a case study:

The first half of the Avengers is "Avengers assemble," and the second half is "Avengers save the day." First, the Avengers assemble and work out their disagreements and learn to work together as a team. They learn about their incompatibilities and personality quirks and their limitations as characters. Then, once they've all learned to work together as a team, they go to confront the final battle. I presume that's the sort of thing you're gesturing at when you say you'd like a story that was "150 pages of exposition followed by 150 pages of action."

But let's consider what The Avengers would /actually/ look like if it literally followed a structure where it was all exposition for the first half, and all of the action happened in the second half: for the first half of the film, we learn about the backstory of each of the characters. Perhaps this takes the form of Maria Hill walking up to Nick Fury and saying, "Hey, this Captain America guy, what's his deal? What are his powers and why do you want to recruit him?" Follow that with Nick Fury talking about Captain America for 10 minutes. Repeat for each member of the cast. Then, 60 minutes into the film, Fury's diatribe on Asgardian politics is abruptly interrupted when Loki attacks and steals the macguffin! Oh no! Now we have 60 minutes to call the Avengers to assemble, have them learn to cooperate, sort out all of their differences, and finally go into the battle to defeat Loki and save New York City.

Of course, that's not how it happens at all. Loki doesn't attack at the 50% mark; he shows up during the opening scene. And pretty much everything that happens from that point forward is a reaction to what Loki did at the beginning. When Black Widow interrupts her interrogation to take a phone call from Nick Fury inviting her to help assemble the Avengers, that's moving the plot forward. When Cap and Tony have an argument over the best way to handle the situation, that's moving the plot forward (and developing their relationship). When Thor says, "Loki is an Asgardian and my plan is to take him back to Asgard where he will face justice and these goals that I've just described are are different from Iron Man's goals and that's why Tony and I don't get along very well and now we're going to fight," that's an example of exposition, but we don't mind that it's exposition because this information is delivered to us between one-liners written by Joss Whedon and within a few seconds we get to the part where we get to watch Thor and Iron Man fight. And then, when the fight ends and Thor reluctantly agrees to join the Avengers, we feel like we've gotten one step closer to our goal. These scenes provide exposition /and/ move the plot forward.

Note that in pretty much every case, the exposition is a necessary evil. The interesting part of the scene between Thor and Iron Man isn't the part where Thor says, "Hello, Iron Man, let me tell you a bit about my motivations and how it is that my goals conflict with yours," it's the part where the two of them fight. It's why exposition is so often squeezed in between moments of fun and action. Exposition is a /necessary evil./ You have to take your medicine, but it's seldom enjoyable in and of itself. Some storytellers will try to add especially entertaining bits to serve as a bit of sugar to help the medicine go down, which might be why you seem to have this Pavlovian response that says "Actually, I love exposition!" If you like jokes and banter that are used to deliver, it probably just means that you like jokes and banter enough for them to make the exposition palatable.

If it actually /is/ the case that you'd like to read a 150-page lore-dump prologue before getting to the part of the story where things actually start to happen, then perhaps I'm misguided in trying to persuade you that "even though you claim you want a story that starts with 150 pages of exposition, you don't actually think that and your claim arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of what is meant by exposition." However, realize that even if that is the case for you, you are an extreme outlier. If you are indeed that extreme outlier who prefers reading lore bibles to what most people typically envision when they hear the word "story," might I refer you to the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP Foundation]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia][another foundation that maintains a Wiki full of articles for you to learn about the detailed lore of a deep and complex world]]?

  Can you define a few clear parameters that can objectively be associated with a good plot?
#+end_quote

As a writer who spends a lot of time talking with other writers about writing, when we talk about what makes "good writing," most of what we do is descriptive, not prescriptive. We don't really say, "here are the rules for what makes a good story, and we're going to judge the story based on how many of the rules it followed and how well it matches up against our criteria for what makes a good story." That would be prescriptive. (Taking a "prescriptive" approach to storytelling can often result in stories that are formulaic or follow "rules" that aren't really rules at all. For example, in The Phantom Menace, we find out that Anakin has no father; he was the product of a virgin birth. Why? Because George Lucas was a student of Joseph Campbell, and Campbell observed that "virgin birth" is a heroic archetype, and George Lucas tried to use this as a prescriptive guide to what makes a "heroic" character, and so Anakain is the product of a virgin birth for no real apparent reason.)

The descriptive approach consists of looking out into the world of media, and identifying that some stories are "good," and other stories are "bad," and analyzing them and trying to reverse engineer the techniques that the creators of good stories used so we can steal those techniques and use them for ourselves. For example, we might look at stories and observe that most stories have something called a "protagonist," a principal character who often serves as the hero of the story. There's no "universal law of storytelling" that says a story must have a protagonist in order to be good, but the vast majority of stories that I enjoy have a protagonist, so I've adopted as a general principal that pretty much any story I tell is going to feature a protagonist.

Taking this fundamentally descriptive approach, when we say "This makes a good story / this makes a bad story," what we really mean is, "Look, these are characteristics that are common to stories that are generally regarded as good, and these are the characteristics common to stories that are generally regarded as bad, so maybe try to use the techniques that seem to work for producing good stories and avoid the techniques that commonly lead to bad stories." All of that is predicated on the idea that there are "good" stories and "bad" stories, "good" plots that we'd like to imitate and "bad" plots whose foibles we want to avoid replicating. But all of this is predicated on the idea that there exist "good" plots and "bad" plots, and if you're still attached to the idea that, "Well, can we /really/ say that some plots are bad and some are good? I mean, it's all subjective, right? Who's to say that the plot of A New Hope is really better than the plot of The Phantom Menace?" then I'm not sure what I can tell you that would be productive.

******* Your perspective makes more sense as a writer who tries to emulate success but I am not sure if that's how we should judge works of fiction. I assume that by identifying "good" stories you meant searching for stuff that is popular and well liked in the niche you are writing, otherwise your logic is circular.

Fairy tail is terrible, still insanely popular and well liked. I don't think anyone should try to study it unless they only care about popularity and making money. The same can be said for 90% of paranormal romance.

I do think there are some parameter that are essential for a good story writing regardless of what the masses want. Grammar or spelling mistakes, unless intentional (as in Flowers of Algernon), are bad. Writing characters without distinct voices, is bad. Unless you are literally writing about emotionless robots. 6th grade level prose, intended for adult audience, is bad.

150 pages of exposition by your definition? I agree that most people probably won't like this. But if it makes sense for the characters to have these long conversations and info dump in the context of the story (basically the author doesn't break the 'realistic characters' rule) then I just don't think anyone can judge it as bad, just not for them.

Can you really say Fairy Tail is terrible? Specifically I noticed that many anime of this genre are good at building anticipation and paying off (of course there are exceptions), something which I've found to greatly improve my enjoyment of a work.

Of course there are many many things that could improve it, but perhaps there are things to learn from it?

********** I agree that using power of friendship is not a good thing to copy. For the sake of argument though, there's no reason why the power of friendship is irrational: In-universe, it is clearly a powerful force and we see it being treated exactly like that. Is it brokenly OP? Absolutely. Is it irrational? Not really. On the other hand, Fairy Tail is irrational is many other details, which makes it plenty irrational in the end.

**** Plot is, in my formulation, how a writer manages and reveals unknowns. Doing so at the right speed that avoids feeling rushed or dull, and doing so in a way that makes every surprise feel shocking but ultimately the obvious and inevitable result of everything established before. This is as much a skill as any of the others, and one which some otherwise excellent writers lack.

The last feature is point of finesse, but one for which I've seen two-line jokes outstrip entire series of novels. Any story carries an implicit and often unspoken promise: "I am telling you this for a reason." Sometimes that's just "because I thought it was cool," and that's fine I guess, but the ones that really stick with me tend to also have some deeper point. Yes, I agree that point is something discovered between the author and the audience rather than wholly invented by either, but it is also something which I find reliably in the works of some authors and entirely absent in the works of others.

I've also seen it honed and improved.

Also, your point about dialogue is why I placed it right in the middle. It is definitely further along the scale towards love and loyalty than grammar and word choice.

***** How a story reveals unknowns is also subjective. If Zorian had learned everything there is to know about the time loop and the invasion on the first loop, by a huge info dump from Zach, and the rest of the story focused more on character interactions and slice of life scenes It would be a different story, attracting a different audience. but would it be 'worse'? I am not sure if objectively good stories should necessarily have big reveals or plot twists.

** For me it had been a difference that has become more concrete in my own mind after reading a lot of rational fiction.

The idea that you have to provide the same tools that are available to the protagonist to your audience. This, to me, is one of the tenets of rational fiction, and it can also be a very powerful tool for creating tension in stories that are not necessarily rational but are just trying to be either unique or "good".

Weirdly, or maybe appropriately, it is very much like a good mystery novel or show. And by becoming more aware of this; I've also found myself seeing flaws in other stories where I didn't before.

I think an example (at least to me) is the Sherlock show on BBC. It does a very poor job of being rational, and, for me, good because it fails to equip its audience with the same tools as the protagonist.

Sherlock, especially in later seasons, tends to "figure out" plots and plans by theoretically real applications of his senses and science, but those applications and those abilities are not previously revealed to the audience nor is the evidence that is being collected by those abilities.

Therefore no one who is watching Sherlock can "solve" the mystery before the show reveals it.

Properly setting up and allowing the reader to experience those tools and is something I've been trying to do in my own stories so that 1. they can feel more rational (although I don't know if I would categorize my stories as rational fiction) and 2. so that increases in skill and power are grounded in whatever reality that the world I'm telling the story is in.

** Little late on this, but I think that from rational fiction in specific, I've learned that people have a /much/ higher toleration for exposition than most give them credit for. I know MoL isn't for everyone, but even then, even if you only inserted a quarter of the exposition MoL is belting out constantly, you'd still have a story with four times as much exposition as the average. I think the difference between MoL and other stories isn't that it's desensitized us to it, it's that the author has mastered the quality of delivering information in an entertaining and /plain/ way. Having read it, I feel like the hate against exposition dumps in stories is a little unfounded. At the very least, it could serve as a moderator for constant, non-stop action.
