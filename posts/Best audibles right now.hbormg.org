Current like unsouled series, and the reborn apocalypse series. I just need a fantasy story with rational characters. Litrpg fiction is filled with wish fulfillment harem trash.


** If you like Unsouled, you might also like:

- *Street Cultivation* by Sarah Lin, which is an urban fantasy cultivation novel. Think Cradle meets Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat.
- *Mage Errant* by John Bierce. Magical academy, ala Mother of Learning. Short and fast paced like Cradle.
- My own books. *Arcane Ascension* is a JRPGsih magical school and dungeon crawling series with lots of magic system detail. *War of Broken Mirrors* is darker, more political and traditional fantasy. *Weapons & Wielders* is lighthearted JRPGish adventuring with more comedy than the other options. *How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps* is more of a LitRPG and parody.

*** Heard good things about arcane ascension but couldnt bring myself to read it when you randomly made the main charactergay. No point in doing that other to be different but it alienates straight people like me so nty. I also dont read stories with girl main characters also.

**** There's nothing random about it. Not everyone is straight. Corin happens to asexual (but not aromantic) - people like that exist, and representation is important.

You don't read female protagonists. You apparently won't read male/male relationships, either. Can't you imagine that there are other people out there that might want someone that they can relate to?

Just to be clear, I'm not trying to encourage you to read my books - just trying to make it clear that non-straight people exist, and it's okay to have them in books, too.

No, that's a false dichotomy. I determined that writing Corin as asexual was a natural fit for his character, which improved the overall story of the whole - and not just for asexual readers.

I do not market my book specifically to asexual readers. I write what I feel makes a good story and diverse representation is a part of that.

****** That doesn't answer the question at all...

Going from your answer, the question could be : do you insist on protagonists wanting to play with hotwheels rather than barbie dolls ?

Can't you read a story where the protagonist is female ?\\
Do the protagonist have to share your other values, or tastes in esthetics or food ?

"This character likes pears, that's a no go for me. Nope."

** If you want something on audible, I would recommend Vlad Taltos. I found it in a Rec thread on here. Vlad is a Homo Sapiens in a world where the thoroughly alien Dragaerans are dominant. While the Dragaerans refer to themselves as human, earth Humans are second class citizens, lower than the dusty peasant class.

Vlad grew up hard, raised by a father he despised as a collaborator, hotheaded and fallible in the way that people with rough upbringings often are.

With that said, Vlad and all the characters around him are intelligent, capable of intricate planning and interpersonal relationships.

The action is fast and furious, the dialogue is pithy and sharp, and the Worldbuilding is deep and wide.

The audiobook itself is very entertaining and well-spoken. There are a lot of books, released out of chronological order. I follow the release order but you may not prefer to.
