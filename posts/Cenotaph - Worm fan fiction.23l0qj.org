** Having read through the Calling Card portion, this seems like a retread of /Worm/ in pretty much every sense except she happens to be a Ward now. Maybe because I wasn't enthralled with /Worm/ to begin with, but that's not enough for me to want to keep reading. Is there something more that /Cenotaph/ brings to the table?

*** She doesn't actually end up as a Ward. The author's endnote suggests that the original purpose of writing was to show that she very easily could have ended up a Ward. Then, after the first chapter, he turned it around to show that even if it looks like she was going to become a Ward things could change again. The underlying idea was to show that small events can have disproportionate effects on life outcomes, I guess.

*** Not really. It's been 3 days since the last post on [[/r/rational]], and that means it's time for me to find some new content.

Eliezer recommended cenotaph in the april author notes.

*** I liked it because it felt like reading Worm again for the first time. If you weren't a big fan of the original then no, there's not much here for you.

**** If you liked that feeling, you might want to go check out the spacebattles forums for creative writing, worm fanfics are probably the most popular thing to do there right now, and there's some excellent takes on various powers/circumstances/etc.

*** Oh, you were the person that wrote those huge blocks of text on [[/r/parahumans]] I thought they were kinda interesting, but I had the impression that you still liked Worm in a way?

***** Can you elaborate why? Is it about the way it makes you feel? (I'm just curious, not judging you for feeling this way.)

****** While /Worm/ has plenty of good moments and positive qualities, and while I'm glad I read it and spent a long time analyzing it from a writing perspective, it was also often exhausting, boring, and unpleasant. I have no desire to read /Pact/ either for that reason.

******* I'm going to try pact after more gets finished, but I think the downside of worm was that ninety percent of it was pure fighting, over and over and over. It felt exhausting.

Maybe some people liked that, but to me it lacked the down time and build up to make the fighting exciting when it actually happened.

******** I actually liked that, reading it in a marathon. I guess /I/ was feeling emotionally run-down enough to connect with what Taylor was going through. Sometimes life doesn't give you breaks.

********* True, but most of the time life is boring. So it wouldn't make a great story to make things too realistic.

To me it started to feel all the same, with no exploration of the world, hardly any improvement on powers or strategy, and very little going on except for disaster after disaster. Which lost some of the appeal of such a unique world, when it could have been about fist fighting or a war with guns.

*** [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/notes/pseuds/notes][Here's]] the aooo author page. He named himself "notes" which made the whole thing confusing.

I know as much as you do.
