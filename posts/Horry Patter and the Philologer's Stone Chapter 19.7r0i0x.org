**** Romb reverted to his essence of Ronness when eating, his distinguishing feature as a character. It's entirely appropriate.

****** ...without noticing. Classic fanon Ron (maybe canon too if we're willing to entertain Cursed Child as counting).

** There's since interesting changes around balsport, and how it never seems to have the same name twice.

*** I read it as being the difference between the muggle and magic-born ways of saying it. Hermione says ballsport, but one of the magic-born kids says balsport and sbort?

**** I just wish that (like 'Alvin' for 'Albus'), actual names had been used, even when changed. Why Horry rather than e.g Larry or Barry? Why Romb rather than e.g. Don?

*** She's maybe Lavender. She /might/ be a Pansy who got sorted differently. She could theoretically be Horry's mom engaged in time travel shenanigans. She's /probably/ an OC.
