Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Renacim are an immortal species that rebirth upon death rather than facing oblivion or the hells.

When a renacim dies, their soul is instantly transferred to the nearest fetal entity with a Knutsenlov development score of less than three. The physical changes occur in roughly three to five days, bringing the fetal entity in line with renacim physiology without regard to the host species. At the same time, physiological changes happen within the host species (or egg, development sac, et cetera) to prevent rejection and facilitate birth. Aside from those changes, nothing innately prevents stillbirth, miscarriage, abortion, or other-than-successful birth of the renacim, in which case they'll simply reincarnate into another fetal entity, repeating the process.

After birth, the renacim develop at roughly human rates, with an appearance that falls within the normal range of "baseline" human, though always consistent with their past experiences, and always with bright pink skin and hair.

The renacim can recall things that happened in their past lives, and learned skills have some degree of transference. Typically, the degree of recall is highest when renacim are at the same age as a past life, meaning that a renacim who has reached the physical age of 26 would remember all past times they'd been 26 quite clearly, all past times they'd been 25 or 27 less clearly, and so on, dropping off more steeping as they moved away from their "life age". Renacim have the highest benefit from skill transference when they repeat what they've done in their past life at the same life age, meaning that a renacim who spends twenty lifetimes doing martial arts in their twenties will have a strong natural aptitude at that age.

The renacim population is (roughly) static; attempts at reproduction will fail or produce more of the paired species, while a renacim's death naturally results in reincarnation. Further, renacim souls are highly resistant to alteration by outside forces, making them hardy (or immune) against most forms of "soul death" and/or mutilation.

--------------

Culturally, renacim can be divided into two camps. The first camp are renacim-raised, usually as a form of cooperative adoption, typically with shared values between parents and children (both of whom take on both roles for each other over time). Because renacim cannot breed with each other, there is usually a small population of some other species within their clans to provide birthing stock. These camps tend to be small and stable, capable of sustaining themselves indefinitely until some outside force comes along to disrupt them.

The second camp of renacim are raised in a foreign culture, usually adopting a fair number of their values. After two or three generations, reinforcement takes effect, and can help a renacim to become entrenched in a particular lifestyle, especially as certain skillsets and ways of thinking become easier and easier, lowering barriers to entry.

The legal status of renacim varies widely by country, especially considering the question of whether they're the "same person" for the purposes of inheritance/ownership, whether they're legal liable for the pregnancy of their host, et cetera. In modern (Third Empire) era attempts have been made to standardize the legal frameworks on the issue, but the renacim are few enough in number that the effort is seen as not quite worth it.

*** This further reinforces my sense that there would be major cultural traditions and institutions to make sure that nobody dies alone. With hell as a certainty for everyone else, soul removal within the necessary window would be essential. Renacim also would probably prefer to leave as little as possible to chance in that regard.

Suicide, then, especially euthenasia would be widespread among mortal races and absolutely commonplace among the renacim. Similarly all mortal races, renacim included, would be significantly more risk averse when it comes to the threat of a lonely death since they are all aware of the contents of the afterlife.

If anything, despite their immortality, the renacim might be /more/ powerfully afraid of death since the specific inconveniences of resurrection would be something they've already experienced... rather than the still relatively abstract infinite fear, pain, and torture witnessed through infernoscopes.

**** Yeah, there are some things that I think are really interesting to think about are:

1. Travel by ship comes with both extra hazard pay and cultural connotations, since a capsized ship in a bad storm will send everyone aboard to the hells. Same goes for almost any drowning death, since bodies tend to be recovered long after the fact.
2. Fast disaster response and body recovery has a higher priority.
3. People would make some efforts to invent auto-extractors that can be employed when you're in a position where you think you're likely to die alone. Give the requirements for soul extraction, it seems like a technically daunting challenge to make a device you could self-administer.

And one of the other interesting things is that the default position as shown in /Worth the Candle/ is not /necessarily/ where hexal society would end up on the issue of immortal souls that go to the hells unless there's some intervention. It would be perfectly possible for consensus to come down on the other side, especially if people aren't confronted by the reality of the hells on a regular basis, or if there's some plausible deniability about people going to the hells, or some possibility of rescue, et cetera. There was a time, in-universe, when the "only hells theory" was just a theory, so we're at sort of an end-state of conversation and discourse where it's generally accepted as correct that oblivion is better than torment.

(I've talked with a number of people on this subreddit that would favor any amount of eternal torture over non-existence.)

***** I can also imagine a knightly order that takes specific care to train themselves in unarmed combat - masters of the art, and chivalrous to the point of being utterly self-sacrificing - who then commit mass suicide in a deliberate attempt to establish a beachhead in one of the lesser Hells, looking to eventually expand that beachhead into a full-fledged society. (Of course, they'd leave an ally with an infernoscope to watch the mission and learn from their experiences, if they were sensible).

Since there would presumably have been some mention of them by now had they succeeded, I can only presume that either they failed, or no such society of knights has yet made the attempt.

We know that non-anima are extremely dangerous, because they have thousands of years of accumulated skills to draw from, which means a demon is a serious threat even if it's controlling a frail underweight girl.

I think the knights would get torn apart instantly if they tried, especially since the demons likely would have weapons, and they would not.

****** Depends on which legal framework you're talking about. In this specific world, there are lots of legal systems, and while there have been efforts to bring them all in line with each other, sometimes that's really difficult, or there are vestiges of the old ones, or simple cultural/social disagreement on the nature of justice.

Generally speaking though, yes, sending someone to eternal torture rather than oblivion is heavily punished, sometimes as a separate crime, sometimes as an elevation of the existing crime, depending on the justice system in question.

And yes, it would be hard to get direct evidence of /every/ specific person who's wound up in the hells or hasn't, and finding somebody there who "shouldn't" be for religious or cultural reasons would be only loose evidence if there were also traditions that established how someone might have fallen short of requirements.

You are assuming this would be common knowledge. It probably wouldn't be. Unless god tells them they'd have no way of knowing this. That's author exposition for us, we shouldn't assume his characters would have access to this information just because we do.

All the renacim would know is that if they die they come back to life, and that it's very inconvenient.

For all we know normal people could just assume they are renacim that lose their memories or some other normal human belief system about death.

They probably would believe renacim are blessed / cursed with retaining their memories because of some past good / bad deed or whatever.

**** It sort of depends on the circumstances, the society/culture in question. Sure, a couple who's been trying for years with no luck that finally gets pregnant might be really put out by their baby being renacim, but if it was an accident, then probably not so much, especially depending on the specifics of compensation.

The Renacim League is a cooperative of renacim responsible for the messier legal and monetary aspects of renacim births. If a renacim dies, they're supposed to be notified, and if a renacim is born, they're the ones that show up to make sure that the baby is either surrendered to someone who wants to look after it, or given a proper home with compensation to the parents, depending on the specifics of the situation, the wishes of the parents, the wishes of the renacim (if known), and the legal framework they're operating under. That said, the League hasn't always existed.

Generally speaking, most people /don't/ think about the renacim, since they're a very, very small population that /can't/ grow very large, and there are two hundred some species that all have their own histories and biases as well. Their rebirth process is unfortunate, but there's nothing that they can do about it, not that that stops prejudice. There's also some envy mixed in, since the renacim get an infinite number of lives.

**** Yeah, it's made up. Fetal growth charts obviously don't work when you have 200+ species with their own gestational periods, methods of reproduction, physiology, et cetera, but individually tailored metrics are hugely onerous if you want to have them available for every single species, especially since Aerb is pre-computer.

So you get scientists and doctors who come along and try to normalize across species as much as possible. "Knutsenlov score less than three" means different things in different species and serves to give a reference point that anyone can look up on the relevant charts. That way all you need is a single number that gets compared with a single chart, and that's kind-of, sort-of good enough for eyeballing a lot of different things.

Also, does magic not work in hell, or are the infernals just strong enough that it doesn't matter? Can they use magic too? Or do they just hold the home field advantage?

** I posted last week about a rational /The Babysitter's Club/ and yesterday one of my friends bought me a "graphic novel" remake of /Kristy's Great Idea/ (the first novel in the series).

I don't believe in signs and synchronicity, but damnit, that's a sign.

I'm going to assume that the demographic of this sub did not read this beloved '80s-'90s series aimed at ~10-12 year old girls.

Basically, it's a pretty shallow romp with teenage girls going through typical teenage girl things: high school, boyfriends, fashion, and of course, babysitting children. It's pretty educational in later books as there's a Deaf child they babysit, a child with autism, topics like death and divorce, etc. It was my first exposure to a lot of these issues.

Characters:

Kristy: Ambitious, tomboy

Mary-Anne: Quiet, organised

Claudia: Fashionable, quirky

Stacey: Fashionable, maths geek, From New York (if you read the series you would know this is detail is about as important as the fact she has type 1 diabetes, so i.e. very)

So, if I'm going to write it - how do I do it?

- Fix-fic: go through the BSC series and write "what if" they did everything "rationally", like that one Stargate fic I really liked

- Rationalist SI: Make Mary-Anne into a rationalist. Everyone else stays the same. See what happens, like HPMOR.

- Modern retelling: Same characters (but make them more logical) and broad story, but make it set in 2018, so the teen girls all have mobile phones and have to deal with problems like a 9-year-old charge googling "boobs" and a 6 year old learning horrific swear words from playing Fortnite. Kind of like Animorphs: The Reckoning

- Modern retelling, aged up: Kristy is an entrepreneur who comes up with "Uber for Babysitters". The other "Babysitters" are not babysitters, but characters in the company (e.g. Stacey's a computer programmer; Claudia is a UX designer; Mary-Anne is, uh, I guess the secretary?)

I'm leaning towards one of the modern retellings, but I'm wondering how I can make it Rational rather than just BSC fanfiction.

*** Even though none of the principal characters are rationalists, I'd argue that Babysitter's Club as a whole is /rationalist/ fiction. There are painfully conventional moral lessons along the way (at the conclusion of most of the books, even), but much of what the stories teach their target audience is to avoid conventional argumentative fallacies, to question their assumptions, and to think and plan more effectively.

If you wanted a rationalist protagonist, just swap the ages of Janine and Claudia. She's practically HJPEV already. That said, I like The Babysitters Startup idea and have always enjoyed watching adult versions of kids' series characters come to terms with the dilemmas of real life.

I wouldn't agree with that: I read the Kristy's Great Idea graphic novel and that was pretty rational, but it wasn't rational/ist/, I don't think, as it doesn't really teach critical thinking skills. Not that it's something I feel especially qualified to teach (but then again who does?). The moral lessons, while conventional, are stuff like "maybe don't be racist?", and "maybe be nice to your mother's new boyfriend?". Maybe they're appropriate for 9 and 10 year olds - they probably are.

It's been, well, 20 years since I've read the books, but I remember a lot of the "adults are useless" tropes, which are pretty bad, and I seem to think they got into surprisingly heavy stuff, and I bet you there are a lot of HILARIOUS MISUNDERSTANDINGS?

I didn't finish HPMOR but I don't get Janine = HJPEV. Janine develops a lot through the series (in my childhood I would guess I read about 80% of the first 100 books?), but it'd make a pretty cool AU (though I don't buy 12 year old Janine being interested in babysitting, unless she wants to be an EA or something and "earn to give"). Janine was, I think, about 20 years old and a bit of a pedant, but the book where she got a boyfriend (a super hot theoretical physicist = my dream boy when i was 10) was really memorable.

I think it'd be fun but I also don't think I'd be able to write it that well as a rational story, which'd be important to me for the project, unless I make them all a different rationalist/nerd archetype "inspired by" their BSC archetype. Also, I'd have to think up a whole plot.

Rationalist/nerd achetypes = "neckbeard in the basement", "overthinks and over analyses everything", "EA who is a little obsessed with earning to give", "bonobo rationalist", "the suspiciously normal one", "the obsessive QS person", "something something biohacker"

Stacy would be the biohacker, she'd have an insulin pump that she wrote a bunch of code for, and a bunch of implants like an RFID and magnets in her fingers

Mary-Anne would be the "obsessive QS person" because she's so organised

Claudia would be the "suspiciously normal one" or possibly the "bonobo rationalist"

Kristy would probably be the EA who is a little obsessed with earning to give: I can see it now, she goes on 10,000 hours, does the quiz, realises she should be a startup founder, and phones up her friends and says "hey, remember when we had that babysitters club? I'm going to make an uber for babysitters".

***** I reread a heap of the early ones when I was volunteering at a local library in college and was surprised by how much I enjoyed them. I think there's an argument to be had whether one can have a rationalist work with no rationalist characters, especially when everybody has to stay essentially the same from book to book.

I agree it's a high bar to clear and that there's some doubt whether it's really accomplished.

The series' goals (in the beginning, anyway, later things get formulaic and cash-grabby) were about living well and most of the solutions really are more critical thinking, planning, and preparation than they are traditional virtues like kindness, generosity, and patience.

Bear in mind, characters /do not consistently do the things they need to do/ and, worse, /do not learn/. They fail for the same reasons over and over again, but when they succeed they do so because they're thinking creatively and cooperatively rather than because they happen to have innate talents, or because they're inherently nice and good.

This... also changes as the books evolve and become more generic as the characters Flanderize and the authors run out of ideas.

I agree that an adult version might be too distinct from the original characters to do them justice and I really may have idealized Jeanine. Maybe just deconstruct or rationalize a few of the worst of the original stories? They're each short enough that they could fit into a few chapters apiece of the conventional web fiction scale, and I (at least) would find it fun to watch the characters develop instead of falling into their familiar ruts.

But I do love the idea of reading the wiki articles for each book in the series and re-writing them in a chapter or two, with the lessons carrying over.

*** I'm not sure which of those is best, although it looks to me like you roughly ordered them in increasing difficulty to write.

For the first three at least, there's the opportunity to have the sitters explain better ways of thinking to their charges, and inadvertently give a lesson to the reader. There's also the opportunity for a reversal, where they can see their charges "behaving like a little kid" (i.e., irrationally) before the sitters realize they make similar mistakes themselves.

For example, put one of the sitters in a dilemma-> have her charge while babysitting face a simpler or more ridiculous dilemma-> the charge fails to think of alternatives-> the sitter helps her charge come up with alternatives-> [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/erGipespbbzdG5zYb/the-third-alternative][the sitter realizes she should think of alternatives in her own situation.]]
