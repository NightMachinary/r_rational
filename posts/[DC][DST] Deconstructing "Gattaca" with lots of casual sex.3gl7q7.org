  The upper classes will somehow abolish casual sex so thoroughly that enhanced alleles can't spread out of narrow, advantaged social classes into the broad population in the ordinary way.
#+end_quote

Am I misremembering Gattaca? I thought the advantage was less about having "special" alleles, and more in being able to select a whole matching basket of alleles, excluding all the dodgy ones that would otherwise appear with a frequency dictated by chance. Children born of random promiscuity wouldn't be able to inherit all of the parents' advantages without going through the selective screening test-tube process.

Although I suppose eventually you'd have an elite class who were all homozygous for a converging set of "preferred" alleles, and their offspring would be certain to receive at least one copy.

Sex between a genetic musical genius and a genetic basketball player could result in a genetic loser; it's almost certain not to result in an incredible basketball playing musical prodigy. This is even more true of the general spread of such genes; each may not even be positive if not combined in a specific fashion.

******* So recap:

In Gattaca there's *no designer alleles*. instead, they ensure the /best possible combination/ of alleles for a given egg and sperm partner.

While this does presumably screen out purely deleterious mutations, the bulk of the advantage presumably come from 1) enforcing heterozygosity at key regions and 2) keeping at the peak of âˆ© shaped fitness curve for a bazillion tiny polygenic parameters (trivial examples: selecting against "too tall" /and/ "too short").

In theory, /most/ of this fine-tuned advantage would be lost within only a single generation of uncontrolled breeding. So, two designer parents /will/ have a perfectly normal baby if they don't artificially design it (and that is, in fact, the plot, right? Two designer parents have one designer baby and one regular?)

I don't know if it would actually work out exactly this way, but this is the way the show posits that it works (and it's not outrageous for a reasonably informed person to speculate that it /could/ work that way).

****** The target market for genetic enhancement are parents who believe that genetic engineering can produce a better baby than random chance. (Actually, the initial target market is the population of wealthy infertile couples, but let's assume we've moved beyond that.) So your target market is already against randomly made babies, even those that comes from "good stock", because /science can do better/.

There are a lot of ways to do DRM. I don't think a "strict lockout" makes the most sense from a business perspective, especially because the time to maturity is /at least/ twenty years, probably quite a bit more (in comparison to corn, which has one harvest a year). So there's not actually that much sense in strict protection unless you think that the state of the art isn't going to advance much given an entire human generation.

Personally, I would implement "soft" DRM. We offer a contraceptive enhancement so that no one gets stuck with a "random" baby on accident, and if you want to reverse that feature, we can do that. You're worried about the company going insolvent and not being around to reverse the process? Not a problem; we've got a separate company prepaid through the contraceptive enhancement fee, which is already funded for the next sixty years, so even if /this/ company goes insolvent (which it won't), your children won't be left without the option to have children of their own. All they'll need to do is come in for a free genetic consult to let them know the risks associated with their genome, the troubles inherent in "random" babies, and the pricing options in case they change their minds and want to have an engineered baby after all (with a discount for legacies!). If you really want to roll the dice, we can't stop you, at least not until our lobbyists get some laws passed.

Edit: And hey, that genetic consult is for the benefit of your future child. Obviously my company makes its children backwards compatible with baseline "random" children, but we're not the only company in the game, and we're talking about compatibility with technologies that have yet to be invented. If your child is thirty-five years old trying to procreate with a twenty-five year old, we're talking about two technologies ten years apart, potentially from different companies. We can be confident in the modifications that we're making, but we can't be confident in the modifications that /other/ people will be making using technologies we can't predict under laws that might change. Contraception and a consult is just basic /safety/.

(And of course, you move the goal posts from there.)

** while methods like extra artificial chromosomes and germline cell modding would indeed be inheritable, there are various ways where enhancement and treatment could be achieved without it being inheritable. Such as tissue-specific virus vectors who would only target where needed, or chimerization via implantation of modified stem cells (muscle, denser bone, better neurons, etc). these both offer a company the control over its intellectual property and parents are free to reproduce naturally without the worry that their sight enhancement on their eyes result in a baby who has photoreceptors instead of skin nerves. Non inheritable methods are also attractive to parents who want their kids to have the /latest/ in gene fashion and not only inherit their crummy Ãœbermensch V.1.2 that was in vogue when they were born! of course tech tends to trickle down and if governments today pay for vaccines I don't see why they wouldn't pay at least for some gene therapy in the future.
