** I don't think I've ever had my opinion on a character flipped around so rapidly. I definitely disliked Mama and thought she was selfish and evil. Now...I'm a lot more sympathetic. She's definitely selfish and pragmatic, but I can no longer call her evil. There's nothing evil about doing your best to survive in a situation you know you can't escape from. Especially in the way she did it. Despite how two faced she felt after we learnt the truth about the plantation, she honestly did love her kids. And she did her best to give them the best possible life she could within the system she found herself trapped in. That's what a real parent does.

****** I don't think so. Mama perceived herself as being trapped in the system the aliens created. She didn't believe there was a way out for her or her charges. So she did her best to give them as good a life as she could. She obviously still did what she felt she had to do, such as breaking Emma's leg, but this chapter really drove home that she was just as much of a victim of the aliens as the kids. She just didn't happen to be eaten. Yet.

******* It just irks me that the author tried to "redeem" her with a combo of "Just following orders" and "product of the system".

I mean, yes, of course it's understandable that she tried to keep herself alive. But when you compare the number of kids she sent to their deaths, it's painfully clear any real redemption is still out of her reach

******** I guess it comes down to your sense of morality at that point. Mama has an implant that lets them track her and monitor her vitals. I presume it also lets them remotely kill her (can't stress enough that this is a presumption) Her scope is very, very limited. She can't have any kids escape, lest she die. And if she dies, well...they get a new Mama and nothing changes, except that the new Mama may not actually love her kids and may treat them worse.

Those kids she "sent to their deaths" would've died anyway. If you pick up a gun and shoot someone across the street, you committed murder. That random passerby could've lived decades more. If you shoot someone dying of cancer and in tremendous pain, you've eased their suffering. So killing someone isn't unilaterally good or evil.

Mama didn't want to send any of those kids off; she had to. And, in the end, when faced with a choice to be spiteful (something any truly evil person would do), she chose to do the right thing and hide the evidence. That shows she cares. Just because she wasn't willing to heroically sacrifice herself by refusing to send kids to their deaths (which would, as I said, accomplish nothing) doesn't make her evil. In the same way that Ray wanting to permanently leave behind the younger kids doesn't make HIM evil.

** Aaaand we're out. That sure took a while, but I'll be damned if it wasn't worth it.

So, Ray is Isabella's son. That's interesting, perhaps even natural in retrospect. Though, I'm not sure it matters much, considering how little either of them seemed to care.

The insight into Isabella's past was interesting, too. It sort of confirms Mamas are picked from potential escapees. And in the end, she gave them a slight push along the way? That's reasonable, I suppose, if this really meant the end of her career anyway. Though, she had better dispose of those ropes entirely, or she might be found out as having aided and abetted the escape, however marginally.

As for the children... They deserved a couple of pages of enjoying their newfound freedom, that's for sure. It's just a shame that, between that and Isabella's backstory, there wasn't room for anything about what the world is actually like. That question has hung in the air for a long time now.

**** I'm not so sure. If anything, suddenly having to switch Mamas would spoil the remaining goods in the plantation. Seeing as she's had an exemplary record so far, I would expect they keep her around as a lowly subordinate, without any of the wide-reaching privileges and exemptions she's had until now. I also find it likely they'll assign her another "Krone", except this time Isabella is the subordinate.

I kind of thought all of that was, if not definitely true, at least highly probable. I mean she had a number tattoo (as opposed to the human scientists) so she definitely couldn't be assumed to have much choice in the matter.

******* I wasn't exactly certain she jumped for joy to help the alien overlords but I also didn't perceive her as being as unwilling as this last chapter made her out to be. I also thought her love for the kids was a simple facade and not genuine at all, but I see that that's not exactly the case here. So that gave her some major points in my eyes. But I understand that, for others, this may not be the same.
