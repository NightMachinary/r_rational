** It would take infinite energy to lift the clown's infinite handkerchief chain though... Unless it's from some sorta pocket dimension. Then you'd be better off just using it for kindling. Construct a high-speed extraction mechanism, feed tons of cotton to a gasifier, make clean syngas, use it for Fischer-Tropsch fuel/chemical production.

*** The clown ain't infinitely heavy, so apparently it is in a pocket d right?

*** Perhaps, because it is specified that a clown must be up there, "infinite" is not a quality of the handkerchief chain itself, but a quality of any handkerchief which is pulled out of something by a clown.

Until the clown begins to pull out the handkerchief chain it is finite, and so it requires only a finite amount of energy to lift.

** I feel like I'm missing something... You wouldn't need an airtight tower, or the weights, (you'd only need one, or if you have to keep putting new weights on, then you lose energy getting the weights up there anyway,) and unless there's a, (literal,) bottomless pit underneath then the infinite handkerchief serves no purpose at all... So much WTF...

*** You gain more energy from the lead weight pulling down the hankercheif than you lose from bringing the weights up.

The trick is that the infinite hankerchief essentially creates matter from the clown's pocket, giving you PE due to gravity.

Infinite hankercheifs just means you repeat the process with another weight.

**** ... Which would require infinite weights to continue the cycle, with the 'infinite handkerchief' doing no work at all... The /pulley/ system effectively replicates the 'infinite handkerchief' by looping around the wheel, so that it can be pulled down by the weights without ever running out. The clown and handkerchief serve no purpose whatsoever in the system...

***** You re-raise the weights after they've fallen. The extra energy comes from the potential energy of the handkerchiefs, which fall with the lead weight and provide some power to the generator as well.

** If you don't have an infinite pit, you could lower the clown with the handkerchief extended, and raise him with it contracted.
