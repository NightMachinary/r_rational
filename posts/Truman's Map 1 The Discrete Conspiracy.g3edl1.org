I just started a rationalist fic based on The Truman Show.

"Truman Burbank doesn't know he lives in a TV show. Can his father's secret book set him free?"

Let me know what you think

*** Thank you, that's helpful. I hate to violate expectations in unwelcome ways, so I'll reflect on how to avoid that

** After the first chapter, my emotional state is 'neutral but curious'. So far, there hasn't been anything that made me wince (a good sign), and it also hasn't yet started on the 'meat' of the story (the learning and application), rather than the part before and looking-back-on-the-part-before after. That's the main part I predict I would either enjoy and commit to reading more or not enjoy and be less inclined to keep reading.

*** Ditto. Really, /really/ hoping this turns out to be a thing.
