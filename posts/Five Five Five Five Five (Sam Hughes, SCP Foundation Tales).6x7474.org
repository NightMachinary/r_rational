**** That's weird. There should be a paragraph of warnings about entering a containment chamber and then a keypad where you have to guess a 5 digit password to 'enter'. This will then open a file to read about SCP-3125 as if you are Marion Wheeler.

** My thoughts as I read:

#+begin_quote
  Marion Wheeler lives deep in coniferous forest
#+end_quote

Wait, what? She met an unpleasant fate! I saw it happen! What's going on here?

#+begin_quote
  "There is a monster which [SPOILERS]," the man says.
#+end_quote

Wait, is /that/ what happened? I suppose that could save her from the fate we last saw for her. Still seems a little "deus ex machina"-ish, though.

#+begin_quote
  "Adam," he says. "Adam Wheeler."
#+end_quote

Wasn't that the name we heard back in Case Colourless Green?\\
*checks*\\
It is. Huh. Then... wait. But she lost him! Then she forgot about him!

I'm thoroughly confused. We have two people who, by all rights, should not be here. What's next, Kim shows up?

#+begin_quote
  Adam is getting nervy, and won't let go of his eye
#+end_quote

*Oh no.*

#+begin_quote
  [the ending]
#+end_quote

Well, that explains a few things.

*** I think that story is both a prequel (who Marion was before she decided to erase her memories of Adam because of SCP-3125) to the Case Color Green arc, and an epilogue of sorts (which you can read by typing 5555 to read the SCP-3125 final entry).

** These stories, and the contents of this thread, should be considered a Class-8 Cognitohazard. All moderation staff with the ability to do so should delete all mention of these stories, and any reference to writings from Sam Hughes that are not explicitly listed as "Safe" or "Neutralized". Memories of warnings, and any anomalous mentions of Sam Hughes decay rapidly, so time is of the essence.

*** Not as such. I think you could sign up to watch changes to the Antimemetics Hub page, though I'm not sure where the notifications would go, and you probably need an account on the SCP wiki for this.

An alternative solution is to subscribe to [[/r/qntm][r/qntm]]. Links to new stories would usually be submitted here, and it doesn't get much traffic these days, which should limit the amount of noise/false positives.

The laziest solution is to do nothing, as I or someone else is likely to submit any new stories in this series to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in short order once they're released anyway.
