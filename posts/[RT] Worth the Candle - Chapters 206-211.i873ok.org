** A pity he lost soul magic before going gold. I would've thought there would be some kind of mitigation tactics one could use with soul and spirit vs Gold Entity. I wonder if you could scaph essentialism super-high and track down the Gold Entity like he did with the DM, then Star-mage on in and get him to stop messing with you.

But even with the Call it does seem like a huge power up. That level of speed and power is going to be incredibly useful, even if he doesn't have the perceptions to use it. Maybe hunt for entads that improve reaction-time?

Also, how did he get into Sable so quickly? Isn't it 10 seconds in, 0 out or am I missing something?

That's what I was wondering. Maybe seven-eyed / sweet talking the layman, somehow? Or she really did try to crush him for ten seconds?

*** He was wearing it, so he had been touching it for the previous ten seconds. I'm pretty sure this feature has been mentioned / used by the characters before.

** Call of the gold will be much more annoying to live with than I thought it would. I wonder how long he will hold out - I guess through the next arc but not the one after.
