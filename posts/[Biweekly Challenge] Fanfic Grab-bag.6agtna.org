[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/67zt5y/biweekly_challenge_monster_mash][Last time,]] the prompt was "Monster Mash", and our winner was [[/u/DRMacIver]], with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/67zt5y/biweekly_challenge_monster_mash/dgzt9bu/][their story]], "Startup Life". Go read it now!

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
This time we're going to be doing something a little bit different. There are only two rules: it must be fanfic, and it must be of something recent (within the last year or two). The more popular, the better, since more people will be able to read it with the original in mind. Ongoing series still count as recent, even if they started decades ago (and I won't patrol that line too hard). We'll call it *Fanfic Grab-bag*. If you want hard mode, write fan fic of the last thing you watched or read, whatever it is.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, May 24th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge is *Low Budget*. Prose fiction doesn't actually have budgets, so pretend that you're writing a short story that's intended to work as a pitch for either a short film or indie movie on a shoestring budget. You don't have money for much in the way of special effects, CGI, etc., you can't have that many locations or expensive props, and you're probably not going to be able to spend that much on costuming. If you want to write a screenplay rather than prose fiction, this would be the perfect challenge for it.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 5/24.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. See the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6av06f/challenge_companion_fantasy_grabbag/][companion thread]] for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat.

  a dramatized story of the 1878 Salem witchcraft trials
#+end_quote

The Salem witch trials were in 1692/1693 ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_trials]]). Unless the narrator is supposed to be getting it wrong.

**** Huh. I apparently got them confused with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witchcraft_trial_(1878)]]. It's plausible the narrator got the date wrong too, but I fixed it to avoid propagating misinformation.

(Totally off topic: that might be a fun variant of the "kabbalah in hell" rule -- all the kabbalah you do in hell has one subtle flaw.)

Aside - I hadn't actually /planned/ to write a prologue, but it basically wrote itself. Turns out the story might actually flow better this way. Whaddaya know.

The first part of the prologue to what I hope will be a much larger narrative, but reasonably self-contained.
