** I've seen more and more discussion of Ted Chiang's work in the wake of Arrival, which does a pretty good job of adapting his short story /Story of Your Life/.

[[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/01/19/when-they-came-from-another-world/][Here's another piece]] (paywalled) on Arrival and Chiang's stories by James Gleick, focusing on the [[#s][key plot point in Arrival]] elements. Gleick has just released a brilliant new book on the history of the concept in fiction and science.

** I've been a fan of Villenevue for a while but haven't been able to watch arrival where I am, so I decided to check out Ted Chiang, and glad I did... though I guess it might make the movie a little less fresh, his other stories are more than enough compensation. Especially division by zero, great job of interweaving emotional content and an exciting mathematical notion. Glad to see him get mainstream exposure.
