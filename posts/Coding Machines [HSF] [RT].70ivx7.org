** Excellent. /Doctor Strangelove/, for the computer apocalypse. Frightening to contemplate, and far too plausible for comfort. The only solace is that Wikipedia tells us that [[#s][]] has never been found in the wild, but then, how would you know?

*** I'm disappointed that they didn't jump into checking the processors, there are overlaps on "undocumented" instructions between intell and amd that sound like cia bullshit, maybe just maybe they should have checked if any of the code runs differently on emulators to the real hardware that is not a known bug or intentional gap in documentation

*** I personally would have suspected [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoptimization][this thing]], and I'm sure you could come up with more, but I'm not sure how I would fit it into the short story format.

*** I don't think that they discounted genetic algorithms. In fact, a genetic algorithm could very well be it's machine creator.

*** I thought that was one of the more probable causes of the virus. Genetic algorithm with too general fitness function.

*** It is possible to probabilistically circumvent at KTH, by layering interpreters.

Write a C compiler in Haskell, a Haskell compiler in LISP, a LISP interpreter in Python, and a Python interpreter in C. Compile the Python interpreter with the dirty C compiler, run the LISP in the Python interpreter, run the Haskell compiler in the LISP interpreter, and compile the C compiler with that.

The resulting C compiler is most likely clean, since the initial C compiler otherwise has to contain a pattern match for inspecting through Python, LISP, and Haskell. This takes a lot of code, which takes up a lot of space, which makes the initial dirty C compiler very big --- a clear warning sign.

Small compilers contain simple KTH's, so layer your interpreters to get clean binaries.

***** *Exercise 1.1.1.1a:* Implement Ken Thompson Hack C compiler which uses only static code analysis. Design it to detect whenever it is used to compile a Python interpreter, and insert into the Python interpreter a backdoor which detects when the Python interpreter in question is used to run a C compiler, and then insert a KTH of these same specifications into that C compiler. (200 points)

Alternately, prove that this is generally impossible due to Rice's theorem. (10 points)

--------------

My point is: I can write my Python interpreter in obfuscated C, and your compiler hack will be dead in the water. Quining is sort of the opposite of KTH'ing through layered interpreters.
