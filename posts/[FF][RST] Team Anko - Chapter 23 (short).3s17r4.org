** You mention that Kurama presents the trolley problem inverted from its usual. It seems that this is perhaps an approach to make Naruto consider the virtues of non-action as a choice. Interestingly, it also had a dichotomy of Sound vs. Konoha, one vs many, likable vs unlikable.

Personally, Naruto needs to invest in a more thorough ethical framework rather than attempting to do everything - as you've pointed out, this simply defers conflict and responsibility.

On a side note, I really have been enjoying your characterization of the the Snake Sannin as a rational 'villain', it makes him a fascinating character and adversary.

Thank you. I've said before, and I still feel, that he's the most fun character in the story to write and I suspect to read. It's a bit problematic, because the heroes really should be the most fun, but he's just so engaging...I get to be unabashedly evil when I write him, and that's the sweet sugar of the soul.

** Firstly, I would like to thank you for writing this novel and your continued dedication to it.

Secondly, the fox clearly had a lot more information than he should have been able to gather given the restraints that the seal supposedly placed on him.

Thirdly, you seem to consider the implied release of an eldritch horror sealed away by the ancients to be a good note. I approve.

****** From chapter 13:

#+begin_quote
  The Bijuu considered the question. "You could open a window," he said. "If I make a real effort, or if you're drawing on my chakra, I can see through your senses. The rest of the time there's nothing except the room." He waved a paw around to indicate the bare stone that surrounded them. "It's boring."

******** Nope. Naruto was still treated like crap, though. And no, people weren't dumb enough to think he was the Fox, just because (a) some of them were terrified that the Fox would come tearing out of him at any moment and (b) because he reminded them so much of the day their lives and loved ones were torn away from them.

  Naruto raised a ramp on the track in front of the trolley, quickly sculpting it to make a catchment that would bring the trolley to harmless stop.
#+end_quote

to a harmless stop.

Well, seems Kurama manipulated Naruto so he would break the cage restraints. Perhaps it was his goal, perhaps a happy accident. Looking forward to finding out which.

Would trolley even exist with the Naruto world's tech, though?

** Ok ok OK /OK/.

I get it.

I ask for a chapter, just a anything to get me by, and you give us this... mountain of a cliffhanger. It's like giving a thirsty man some sour sherbets, then when he asks for something to quench the thirst, you offer a dollop of Ghost Chili.

Of course, you're now only your merry way to disappear for the next month with that NanowriMo thing, and I have to sit here burning through my imagination as I try to work out all the possible consequences of having a Kurama on the loose.
