Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Update from my depression post last week:

Meds get! I've gotten an antidepressant that will probably take a long time to kick in, but that I know works on me because I've used it before, and a sedative which is also an antidepressant and an antianxiety drug. That one is already helping me get the sleep I need to become more functional, and I think (?, these things are weird) I can feel it when the antianxiety function wears off each day, so that one is definitely helping in other ways as well.

To people who are reading Mortality, the Worm/Death Note fic I started several weeks ago and then didn't update on last weekend, I hope to be able to get posting again either this week or next week. Depression makes it a little difficult to summon the will to string words together.

Not a whole lot to report on this week.  I've actually been reading a book called [[https://www.manning.com/books/bdd-in-action][BDD in Action]] which I think will be helpful not only for this project, but for what I do at work, so this has sort of taken over my coding time until I digest it.

--------------

I found an [[http://imgur.com/a/omrvd][album of in-between pokemon evolutions]], which ultimately came from [[http://inprogresspokemon.tumblr.com/][this tumblr]].  This concept is something that the project will utilize, so it was quite nice to see so many transitions actually work visually.  

--------------

Oh, and I also came across [[http://pikafan2000.deviantart.com/art/National-Pokedex-Version-Delta-391835188][this DeviantArt post]] which is a project to come up with 32x32 and 96x96 pixel art versions of all existing pokemon.  The 32x32 set is very much the sort of thing I'm looking to use in-game, so I think I'll reach out to them when the time is right and see if they'd be okay with me using their assets.

** I finally got around to seeing the English dub of [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa][Your Name]] this week and I completely understand why this movie is the highest grossing anime film of all time and is currently the highest rated on MyAnimeList. From a technical perspective, the movie is basically flawless. The animation, acting, writing, direction, editing, cinematography, and the music are all fantastic. It's definitely not rational, there's a plot hole or two and the appeal lies in the emotional journey it takes you on, but that's fine.

The plot is just the right balance of familiar and unique to garner mass appeal without feeling dumbed down, the characters are simple but easy to relate to and care about, and the comedy is surprisingly funny. The third act goes on a bit too long and the stakes of the climax aren't directly related to the romance arc, which is the crux of the story, but even those feel like intentional choices rather than problems. It's not a particularly groundbreaking film and there were some scenes I thought could've been better, but it's a perfectly solid product that does exactly what it sets out to do and does it extremely well.

So I'm having a minor crisis over the fact that I don't like the story and can't explain why. It's an impeccably well-told story with the most interesting take I've ever seen on a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip][Freak Friday Flip]], a trope I normally find extremely boring and predictable, but for some reason I left the theater feeling hollow and unsatisfied. I liked everything about this film, except for the core of the emotional investment that everything is built around and I don't know why. For some reason, I just didn't like the romance.

I can accept not liking popular or even good movies, but I've always had a justification for it. I understand why I found The Girl Who Leapt Through Time boring, Wolf Children disappointing, The Wind Rises emotionally hollow, and Spirited Away just...weird. For Your Name though, I can nitpick some plot points that I didn't like but I can't figure out why those would've ruined the experience for me when I enjoyed the rest of the movie. I can see why some would think it's a masterpiece and others would think it's overrated, but I don't know why I find it frustrating instead of fulfilling.

#+end_quote

I mean, that's a pretty good reason to find it frustrating rather than fulfilling, to me.

I just watched it today (your comment was the motivation to finally stop putting it off) and I agree that it's a very solid movie, but it's not quite all it's hyped up to be, and the romance is the major reason.

I liked the protagonists, but I didn't feel their relationship the way I do in many other romances, because so little of their relationship is actually shown on screen. It wasn't quite hollow, but it was... "distant."

Which is still better than most similar situations. There are tons of movies where the male and female protagonist end up in love and I'm just left thinking "...Why? You've known them for like, 3 hours, and sure, you went through some scary situations together, but you had maybe one conversation in total and demonstrated 0 romantic affinity or chemistry."

That's not quite the case here, but it's still in the same realm of criticism. They interacted a lot, but it was off-screen and through notes and each other's lives, which meant that while intellectually I could grasp what the relationship meant to them, emotionally it wasn't as fulfilling as it was supposed to be. I loved the scene where they get to finally meet, and a few more like it would probably have sold me on theirs being a star-crossed love.

I just checked the run time and was surprised to see it was 2 hours. It felt shorter, and I think another 30-45 minutes of focus on developing their relationship would have moved the movie from a solid B to an A for me, and justify the immense praise it's gotten.

I'm still glad I watched it though, and agree that it was a very refreshing twist on the Body Swap story. Maybe I'll check out the novel some day and see if I enjoy it more.

**** SPOILER WARNING FOR A MOVIE YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK OUT

I very much agree with you, though I'm a lot less certain about why. The director himself has said he thinks his creation is overrated since he was forced to cut content from the movie, which was presumably why some plot threads like Mitsuha's family weren't followed up on and we just cut away from her father finding out about Taki. There's apparently some supplemental material that explains things like the father's motivation and how it relates to his wife's death.

The couple only having one real conversation in the whole film did bother me, but I can't say for sure that's why I didn't like the romance. I was much more irritated at them losing their memories of each other. I assume it was meant to be gut-wrenching so you'd be happy when they got back together anyway, especially for those who watched Five Centimeters Per Second by the same director, but the fact that I didn't feel that satisfaction indicates something kept me from getting invested in the arc in the first place.

[[http://quillette.com/2017/04/20/crucible-application-process/][This interesting article accuses certain academics of actively /discouraging/ rationality...]]

#+begin_quote
  In my applications essays and mock interviews, I expressed my opinion that learning to think about altruism more rationally and less emotionally would help change the attitude of apathy and neglect with which developed nations regard those in the developing world.

  This opinion was summarily dismissed by my applications advisors. Many of them were skeptical of the notion that reason and rationality could be valid thinking tools at all. Their model of human psychology, it seemed, was one of a blank slate on which culture was free to paint any picture it desired. There was no room in this model for individuals to respond to rational argument and empirical evidence in ways that would compel them to dissent from the edicts of their culture.

  I was repeatedly told, for instance, how quixotic it was to expect that I could convince even a single person of the importance of extreme poverty through reason and evidence. Worse yet, I was scolded for ‘presuming' that there was any rational basis for preferring to work on extreme poverty over other issues.[...]

  It took some time for my advisors to finally convince me to stop talking about reason, rationality, and evidence in my personal statements and interviews. The last straw came when *one of my scholarship advisors told me that my views on reason and emotion were, in fact, sexist. Because 'rationality' was associated with masculinity and emotion with femininity, she explained, my preference for rationality over emotion was indicative of my unconscious bias against women.*

I personally find shrinking the window to be much quicker than editing the code. Also, doing it manually is necessary because looking at how the line wrapping ends up is important.

For example, look at [[http://i.imgur.com/s4RJvKk.png][my most recent screenshot]]. If I had made it any narrower, the last line would have been wrapped to two uneven lines rather than just one line, and the list of forward-links at the top would have been wrapped to four uneven lines rather than three perfectly-even ones. (Really, I probably should have made it a little wider, to avoid the ugly two-line wrapping of the OP's sentence.)

  This interesting article accuses certain academics of actively discouraging rationality...
#+end_quote

I think the author was running into the broader and less political issue of the favored format/content for personal statements being a personal narrative with strong emotional content and broad potential in outreach. This problem applies to college applications, graduate program applications, and scholarship/fellowship applications. The fact that the author was applying to elite liberal institutions probably biased the target personal narrative to something more political and social justice oriented but the overall issue of favoring emotional personal narratives is a constant across the political spectrum.

My recommendation, for this issue, from my own limited experience, is to apply to lots of places and make the personal statement true to yourself even if it is slightly off target of the ideal personal narrative. This will get it turned down by most places, but it makes your application stand out more, and the few places that appreciate it will be more likely to be the places where you will fit the best. Getting into my graduate program, I think my personal statement had a good role in convincing the professor who is now my mentor that I would be a good fit for his lab, and the ways in which it was unconventional or too broad in goals or not emotionally driven enough were also the ways that made it good for convincing that particular professor. On the other hand, applying for the NSF GRFP, one of the particular categories that the response indicated I should have done better at was tying my personal statement into outreach and mentoring. So with that in mind, maybe the generic idealized emotional personal narrative is good when dealing with a larger faceless committee, while a more unique personal statement is good when it is individuals reading it... anyone have any other thoughts?

**** I think if your goal is to be accepted into a program or for a fellowship or w/e, you should be as explicit as possible in addressing the desires of your reviewers, spinning your story to whatever extent you're comfortable with while not saying anything untrue. If your broader impacts are specifically supposed to address science engagement among underrepresented minorities, look for appropriate connections or expand your current outreach plan. Like, skimming the article, I'd hazard to say that the author is somewhat lacking in imagination if they can't answer:

#+begin_quote
  A number of them followed up by asking if I had witnessed anyone living in extreme poverty. No, I hadn't.
#+end_quote

Of course they have, insofar as they're aware of their existence. They can witness things digitally, textually, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Had I or anyone I know ever contracted malaria or a neglected tropical disease? No.
#+end_quote

I can give them this one, but if you flex the meaning of /know/ to /vaguely acquainted with/, I'm pretty sure AMF and other places send me stories of victims of neglected disease on the reg, and I've also read books which describe their experiences. To some extent I "know" then, if not on an intimate, face-to-face basis.

#+begin_quote
  Did I feel I had a responsibility to the developing world as a beneficiary of colonialism? Not particularly.
#+end_quote

This one's pretty trivial -- as a recipient of "developed world privilege" in part due to colonialism, the author is more inclined to help those less fortunate. The plane's going down but they already have their oxygen mask on and can help their neighbor.

#+begin_quote
  How did my privilege and my identity as a White Westerner contribute to my decision to focus on extreme poverty? It didn't.
#+end_quote

Again, white westerners are are traditionally rich. If the author were a rural developing world-er, I imagine they'd not nearly be as focused on extreme poverty outside of their local community.

#+begin_quote
  But the thing I don't understand is why do you care?
#+end_quote

i.e. what formative experiences led you to develop the compassion you (claim to) express now? Even if you're not sure, identify something plausible! Did your parents instill in you a deep commitment to helping those in need? Presumably they didn't hurt -- if you were raised by Ayn Rand and Genghis Khan I doubt you'd care so much about the developing world, beyond how you could exploit it. Hell, they even mention Catholic school and its commitment to impartial, universal caring! Talk about that! (I went to a Jesuit HS myself, and they wasted little time in encouraging our interaction with poor people, so presumably the author could discuss having met them before).

I think programs /do/ very much care about kindness, compassion, etc. in their applicants, but they're hypervigilant about easy-to-fake signals. Building a narrative for why you care lends credence to the claim that you do, legitimately or not. Contrast saying you care about all peoples everywhere with something like [[https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/opinion/check-this-box-if-youre-a-good-person.html][this]] (and nevermind the magnitude of effect, it's hard enough to establish its existence in the space of a thousand words). So too is it with claiming to be bananas about /reason/ or /rationality/ -- any old schmuck can say that, so as a signal its vacuous and unreliable. Instead, you need to demonstrate what exceptional accomplishments you've made that require exceptional rational reasoning abilities. Merely weak evidence won't do! Everybody has it! (this isn't too bad in the OP link -- I think there the author just encountered some super political reviewers)

(I'm also not sure I buy the paragraphs on the unimportance of evidence -- my impressions of e.g. academia and the health sector, etc. is that everybody's crazy about "evidence-based" whatevers these days)

(And I reckon I don't agree with the author metaethically, either, which probably colors my reading a fair bit)

(and people in my impression are motivated by emotions [citation needed], at least to some extent, so if the author can't describe any emotional connection they feel to the recipients of their goodwill I'd suggest they're something of an outlier)

*** The difference between the two actions is who it is supposed to shame. Both are intentional wastes of water, but with different intents. The removal of the water towel custom was not because it was being wasteful of water, but because it was designed to be disrespectful of beggars. Note that the custom wasn't just removed, but was replaced. The replacement custom was to give water freely to the beggars, rather than giving them the discarded hand-washing water.

The Duke's toast, on the other hand, has a different meaning. Here the Duke is surrounded by potential enemies. Every one of them had previously worked for the Harkonnens, and could be a spy for them. On Arrakis, where water is life, the Duke is making a statement about the strength of his position. By pouring water out onto the floor, the Duke is stating that he has strength to spare. [[#s][By forcing everybody else to pour out water as well,]]

This is the key difference being made between the Atreides and the Harkonnens. Both are aristocrats, and both have the obedience of the common people. However, the Harkonnens do so by befriending the powerful and demeaning the common people, but the Atreides do so by respecting the common people even if it isolates them from the powerful.
