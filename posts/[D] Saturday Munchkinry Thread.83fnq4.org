Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

** You can form a standing portal between any two doorframes on Earth that are of roughly equivalent size. Doing so requires you to first mark one, then mark the other, which will connect them after roughly two minutes. Attempting to answer some of the inevitable questions:

- Breaking the doorframes, moving the doors too far relative to the Earth, attempting to drill into the portal from the side of the doorframe, etc. will break the connection, irregularly cutting anything that was between the doors.
- The portal goes both ways, and from both sides of each doorframe, with orientation decided when the second portal is chosen.
- Momentum is conserved, but nothing can travel through the doorframe at speed greater than 100kph. Anything moving faster that attempts the transition will be instantly slowed down (though only at the boundary, meaning that a car moving at 200kph and hitting the portal would essentially crash into itself, I think).
- There is no limit to the number of portals you can create. There is also no limit to the number of marks you can make on doorframes awaiting a link (you can dismiss these marks at will, and cannot link two marked doors without first unmarking one).
- You cannot link the doorframes if something is in the way (e.g. a door).

*** The obvious one is generation of negentropy. Link two doorframes, one of which is above the other like this:

(Portal)

(Air Gap)

(Portal)

Put a water wheel in the middle. Then place a liquid of your choice inside - free power.

One thing I'm curious about - is light slowed down? That probably has a few uses, but I think that means that you'll probably die if you go through (electrical signals in the brain).

You could use the portals as shields, making an armour out of tiny doorframes. Any projectile that goes in a portal just comes out the other side. It scales up as well.

Possibly as a defence against certain natural disasters. Example: One portal above an active volcano, another where you don't mind there being ash and lava. Depends on how liberal doorframes are when it comes to shape. On the side of buildings to defend against debris from high winds, along the shores of high flood risk areas - you just need a spot where you don't mind a hazardous dump.

Disposal of hazardous materials can be done by lowering portals on top of them, and waiting for the centre of gravity to pass through the other side.

That's all I have for now, but I'm sure there are other uses.

True, but when using solar/wind power, you don't convert any /extra/ energy to heat. So in terms of the amount of heat that is added to the planet you either have:

#+begin_example
  energy released by power plants + amount of sunlight hitting the earth

***** The amount of energy added to the earth by the sun is (by definition) equivalent to the power output of a type I Kardashev civilization. According to wikipedia we are currently five-ish orders of magnitude away from that, so even if we add enough portal power plants to replace our current power plants a hundred times over we'd only increase the amount of energy on the planet by 0.1%.

Once we're at a point where this becomes an issue we can probably just move our power generation off-planet.

KE = 1/2 * m * V^{2} = 3/2 * k * T

1/3 * m * V^{2} = k * T

(1/3 * m * V^{2} ) / k = T

We can completely destroy energy even without the 100kph speed restriction: just connect a door on top of the building with a door on the ground floor, and send stuff through it. That stuff loses gravitational potential energy, and we can repeatedly carry it up to the top of the building (investing kinetic energy) and send it through again.

- In fact, if the 'home' end is close to a plug, I can have my phone in my pocket while it's charging.

- If I am feeling larcenous, I can surreptitiously mark a bangle or a ring (preferably a bangle) at a high-end jewellery shop - picking one that's out of sight of any cameras, of course. I can then, at my leisure, remove a substantial fraction of their inventory.

- Small teleport-doors will also help me take people by surprise with gas-based attacks.

- By making a 'door' in the neck of a small pouch (which connects to a large pouch of similar neck-size) I effectively have a bag of holding.

If I enter a door in America and step out of a door in Australia, how badly does the difference in the speed at which the land is moving make me stumble?

Given the 100kph speed limit, what happens to a laser beam fired through a portal?

#+end_quote

Disclaimer: I haven't thought about this for more than a minute, but what my physics knowledge would suggest is the following:

- The car's mechanical state is described by a partial equation (as is usual for these sorts of problems). We have an initial condition (velocity = 200 km/h).

- As the car impacts the portal, the problem's boundary condition changes (velocity = 100 km/h at the boundary). AFAIK, this change impacts the entire car -- basically, the deformation travels at the speed of sound (which, in cars, is about 6 km/s^{1} ). The effects are similar in some regards to what happens if we drive a car into a wall -- it crumples up, which we can observe even outside the portal.

- What's really fun though is what happens when the car is running at more than 6 km/s (= 21600 km/h). Now the deformation is slower than the car itself. It does not propagate quickly enough, and as a result, we do not see any sign of the impact outside the portal. To our eyes, the car passes through unharmed, though on the other side, it comes out in what I would imagine to be an absurdly deformed state (basically, the difference between a solid and a liquid is academic at those deformation speeds). This will probably also be pretty loud, as the car passes through its own sound barrier. However, the sound will only be heard on the other side of the portal, if at all -- maybe the velocity restriction suppresses the sound.

I wonder where all of that momentum and kinetic energy ends up...

*** One information-efficient use of /sending/ is to arrange a meeting via /clairvoyance/ (also a 3rd-level cleric spell): as long as you can get to within 1 mile of the other party, in a location that's familiar to them (e.g. hired rooms in an inn) then you can use 1 /sending/ on your part and 1 /clairvoyance/ on their part to transfer 10 minute's worth of information.

Otherwise, a simple method of compression would be to assign pre-arranged concepts to different words, picking randomly out of a dictionary - e.g. APPLE might be arranged to mean "Your group is discovered."

Keeping your code-book for translating such signals secret isn't of as paramount importance as it usually would be, since there aren't any (standary) ways to intercept a /sending/; however, the reproduction costs might be prohibitive depending on how expensive your DM thinks books should be.

First you have to explain to your GM how your character has any idea that an industrial revolution is even possible, let alone knows how to bring it about, given the knowledge and experience they are starting with.

Well okay, it is different in that it doesn't use power, but video phones don't really use all that much power either. Instead, let's talk video quality. Normal video phones have like, a few million pixels in terms of resolution, and a limited amount of brightness. Magic mirrors in the literature don't, as far as I know. So one possible way to use this magic mirror would be to place one end as near the sun (or some other blindingly bright light source) as possible, and the other directly over a solar panel. It would be a reliable (clean?) power source as long as the mirror isn't destroyed.

Personhood detector. Get someone to try pouring the vial. If it doesn't pour, it isn't a person! This item is awesome! Or it would be, if we lived in a world with shapeshifting hostile non-persons.

Motion detector. Define "person is pouring it out". What if the person wears gloves? What if the person is using a tool (like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_extender][reach extender]]) to grab the vial when pouring it? If sufficient amounts of indirection are allowed, you may be able to use the vial as a motion detector.

Bomb. What if you stopper the vial but keep "pouring"? What if you put the vial in an airtight container and poured it? Would it just keep on pouring out water, compressing the air in the container further and further, until the entire set-up explodes?

Bag of Holding. Can you put things back in the vial's hammerspace?

Light-weight water container. I'm assuming it is light, because someone would notice if the vial weighed as much as 100 liters of water (~100kgs). This would be somewhat useful for astronauts, since it takes exponentially less fuel to launch a small vial into space than several liters of water.

If the tree were expected to produce $X worth of income each year, then a reasonable price would be around $X*10, to provide a 10% return on investment each year.

[[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]]'s suggestion was to exploit asymmetric knowledge about the tree. Suppose you know that it can produce X income each year, and that 10/X is a reasonable price. If you can convince somebody that it will produce Y income each year, they would believe that 10/Y is a reasonable price. So long as Y>X, you have effectively scammed them.

The problem with applying this in the real world is that nobody will believe that the emeralds came from the tree. Their expected profit Y is then much lower than your expected profit X, and so you will have a net loss by selling the tree.

But since sunlight's energy density decreases with the square of distance what with it being proportional to the surface area of a sphere, you rapidly get very huge amounts of energy. Rather than work it out myself it looks like [[http://www.egr.unlv.edu/%7Eeebag/Sunlight%20and%20its%20Properties.pdf][at the surface]] energy density is 5.961E7 W/m^{2} , which for 20cm x 20cm mirror would give 4E6ish W, which apparently is about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(power][mechanical power output of a diesel locomotive]]). So I guess not a huge amount lol but I bet you could still use it to crawl out from under the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation (assuming the magic mirror is unbreakable/unmeltable/has perfect "reflectance").

Of course as you mention the sun's far from the [[https://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/1-billion-suns-world-s-brightest-laser-sparks-new-behavior-in-light/][brightest object accessible to us]] and positioning the mirror in some stable orbit would be tricky, so really what you have here is a wireless energy transmitter with far more throughput than a locomotive.

  If it doesn't pour, it isn't a person! This item is awesome! Or it would be, if we lived in a world with shapeshifting hostile non-persons.

You could use it to test nonhuman animals for personhood under a "thresholded" personhood framework, assuming person != human (which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person][often it does not]]).

  This would be somewhat useful for astronauts, since it takes exponentially less fuel to launch a small vial into space than several liters of water.

It could also be used for fusion or as a reaction mass (assuming it's not easier just to scoop of interstellar hydrogen or something).

*** All of that's pretty useless, except for, marginally the emerald tree. It'll inevitably fall apart at some point, and you'll get to a point where all of the buds are too damaged to make new apples. Try grafting another apple to it? Try fucking with hormones and chemicals to trick leaf and bud nodes to form branches, since those are the only parts of it that can actually be considered really alive. The rest of the tree is basically a wooden statue. After looking for gem prices, assuming that the gems are the best emeralds anyone's ever seen, you can get probably 10-50 thousand for each gem, 10 per Apple, so it's not worth it to sell it. Become a millionaire and then sell the tree to science.

*** Mirror - basically a 100% reliable communication link, could be very useful for wartime communication (especially as the message can't be intercepted) or for space missions

Tree - Auction it so I don't have to worry about caring for the tree or selling the emeralds optimally while getting most of the effective value now

Vial - Send to ISS, they can store the water produced as emergency supplies if recycling fails.

*** Does a full vial weigh 100kg?

Can you refill it by, say, dunking it underwater?

How about if you dunk it upside down?

Does it continue pouring out after you prop it upside down and let go?

If the answers are no, yes, yes, and yes in that order, you can get perpetual motion from it in 100kg bursts.

1. drain barrel into upside-down vial (placed intentionally upside down by a person)
2. lift barrel+vial (via counterweight)
3. drain vial into barrel
4. use weight + height of barrel to do work, including lifting the counterweight.

With enough altitude, this can produce significant energy, though yeah it's probably less useful than more conventional generators.

Come to think of it, you could also use a similar mechanism to fill a water tower and "smooth out" the power generation.

**** Unfortunately, it's no (weighs ~100g), no (you can put the ~100ml the vial holds into the vial, but it doesn't enter hammerspace, which i guess is a one-way valve), N/A, and no. :(

But I like your style!

I deliberately tried to create three magic items that while clearly magic and cool/interesting aren't "let's stop the plot of this story and exploit these items", so with the vial I was going for the great "create water" spell, but in practise it's not much more useful for power generation than a solar panel.

The emerald apple tree is interesting but ultimately useless except as a source of money (and relatively slowly: it's a small plant), and the magic mirror is just a videophone (... that could also be used as a solar panel, as per another reply, which is pretty neat!)

***** Aw...

You can electrolyse the 1L of water into 620L of O2 (at STP). That's enough for one person to breathe for a day, with a little left over. I assume that it's easier to filter piss than it is to generate O2 in space, so that might be more useful than using it as a water supply. This will take an average of 150W of DC power generation to keep up. Not /too/ bad, but you still have to scrub CO2. Presumably you would just vent the hydrogen into space.

****** Great, I've been reading /The Maretian/ (a The Martian/My Little Pony crossover that is as fun as it sounds) and now all I can think about is how useful that water would have been in /The Martian/ (in The Maretian, one of the few gimmes is they have unlimited water due to a magic supply from the pony world).

*** Define body. Does it teleport small objects hidden in my mouth? How about dental fillings? The contents of my stomach / guts?

Is my mind cloned? Are the copies mentally linked in any way? Do both copies retain the teleportation ability? Is there any obvious effect on the originating body?

What happens to material at the destination site? Is what happens different for air/water/solid stone/other people? Does the originating copy know whether the process completed sucessfully?

Is the process instantaneous? Does it work for "moving" targets? How fast can I end up going? What's the maximum range? Space is only ~60 miles away, can I teleport into orbit? What's the cooldown, if there is one?

There are a great many things which may be exploitable but WAY more detail is required.

**** - The teleportation copies anything inside your body, including anything inside your mouth, digestive system and lungs
- The copying done to a quantum level - from your perspective there is a version that teleported and one that didn't. Both have the ability
- You can teleport anywhere in the 10km sphere from sea level. Velocity is conserved relative to the earth's surface. Anything in the target area is destroyed (e.g. if you teleport into a mountain you will be encased in stone)

***** Cool, so I can just turn the entire world into more of me with exponential growth and telefragging all opposition...

Or I can make infinite copies of rare materials by holding some in my mouth.

Or I can end world hunger in spectacularly morbid fashion. Tastes just like pork, just don't eat the nervous system and careful with the liver...

Or I can replace energetic natural disasters with ecological disasters by mass-teleporting into tornados, volcanos, hurricanes (probably a bad idea), or tidal waves (probably a bad idea), replacing the high velocity / high temperature material with static, low temperature flesh.
