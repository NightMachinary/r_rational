** What does this have to do with rational fiction? How does this submission fit the subreddit rules?

**** Do you typically post to a subreddit without looking at the sidebar to see what it's about and what its rules are?

** You can find the appeals forum here: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/appeals.70/]]

Before making an appeal, please read the stickied thread: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/must-read-appeals-forum-rules-and-useage.322206/]]

Make sure you're familiar with the forum rules here: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-rules-of-spacebattles-important-info-and-announcements-archive-read-this.309653/]]

Lastly, consider moving to Sufficient Velocity, a forum that shares the same userbase and was formed in response to poor moderation practices on SB. Appeals on Sufficient Velocity that are denied can be appealed again to an elected body, the community council, and the moderation there is generally more active and engaged with the users.

*** My mate tried that. He can't appeal the ban. Is there a fanfic section of Sufficient Velocity?

**** SV hosts fanfic etc in the same way as SB. In terms of content the forums are very very similar. The fanfiction board: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/user-fiction.2/]]

Edit: make sure to read the SV rules too. If you have a question about whether a post is ok you can contact mods beforehand and they're always glad to help
