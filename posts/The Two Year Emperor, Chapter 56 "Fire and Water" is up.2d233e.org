** Jake's in a pickle now! Well, he's essentially been in a constant state of pickling since the start of the story, but now especially.

Afi's presence is highly disturbing. He's far too clever to try something that already failed once. The only different thing that I can see is Loki's presence.

Is Loki going to chair the negotiations between Afi and Jake? That would be hilarious.

***** I think the "appeal" for Herrun is not just in being let in on the secret, but that the one performing the sacrifice loses the knowledge and can never regain it, thus it becomes secret from them - each sacrifice makes the devotee aware that there's knowledge that's simply, completely beyond them, thus making them more inclined to want to be in the good graces of the goddess of secrets and knowledge so that the things they don't know might be less likely to bite them in the ass. After making the sacrifice, EVERYTHING you don't know might have been a hugely important secret you gave up to Herrun.

Jake's sacrifice of knowledge the Loki is playing both sides of the war leaves him hugely vulnerable to the repercussions of Loki's machinations. Albrecht previously chided Jake for failing to account for unknown unknowns, but now he knows he sacrificed some hugely important knowledge to Herrun. He doesn't know what it is, but Herrun does, and he KNOWS Herrun does, so he's probably gonna want to be her best friend in a way that's even more personal than the "Get a new God-Level Playing Piece on the Board on Our Side" motivation that led them to the idea of resurrecting Herrun.

I would think that if Herrun would be nonplussed about the Ice Assassin sacrifices for any reason it would be that since the Ice Assassins are temporary existences, and when they dissipate Afi is still wandering around knowing everything they knew, there's no one with the sense of knowledge/secret based vulnerability that she could exploit or would make them germane to worshiping her.

In your example, if the clones had been ritually pseudo-lobotomized but still knew how/why they had been - that is, that worshiping Herrun to keep them safe was their best chance, then I imagine she would find such a sacrifice acceptable, to whatever degree she prefers legions of mentally deficient devotees to one mentally deficient one.

I'd hypothesize that in general, Herrun prefers secrets/knowledge that leave the devotee vulnerable but no less capable, so that dead Ice Assassins sacrificing useful combat knowledge and capabilities are not too close to the top of her list, but likely are neither millions of Grofhamrites with no class levels.

And, while I've got your attention, congrats on writing the best Superman story I've ever read!

ooo, that gives me a thinky-thing!

When you polymorph something, it gains knowledge of the form, right? PAO up a dragon and it knows how to breathe fire, for example.

Do PAO'd people have knowledge of how to speak Common? I'm p-ret-ty certain that Common is close enough to being a racial feature of humans, no?

What if you Perma-PAO up a bunch of people, and then have them sacrifice their knowledge of how to speak common? Could get a whole horde of /very/ vulnerable people that way. The only thing they'd have to communicate with/through would be the Goddess herself. That'd make them /excellent/ worshippers. Especially since with (presumably) empty-ish minds, they could be shaped to anything she wants!

Hell, even if they /can't/ speak, you could use Tongues and some manner of not-quite-mind-control to convince the PAO-people to give up their knowledge of how hands and legs work, or something. Or you could PAO up some baby dragons and control them into giving up how their breath weapons work.

That'd prolly be a pretty evil solution, but hey.

****** Ice Assassins are not temporary. Until they kill their target, they are just as permanent and as real as any other creature. Since Afi is both their target and their creator, he was able to order them to "Never harm or kill me, and always act in my best interest" and they are forced to obey. As such, the Ice Assassins can never complete their mission and so they are completely permanent.

They are separate beings from Afi and, as such, their sacrifices are just as valid as his would be.

Start with one person, let's say Albert. Benjamin, Bart, Bobby, and Betty all grapple him. Then, Cory, Catheryn, and Curtis grapple Benjamin; Carrie, Carland, and Catelyn grapple Bart; Caden, Cecelia, and Caesar grapple Bobby; and Caligula, Cain, and Cal grapple Betty. This can continue on with people like Derek, Ernie, Francis, and Gertrude adding more and more layers to the grapple.

This allows infinite people in one square, if you continue with that pattern. Better, each person can move the /entire group/ 1/2 their movement per round, so it might be able to supplement the commoner railgun as well.

Bound is a very flexible and undefined-by-D&D word. If you tie someone's hands together, they are "bound" but still able to move freely. So, tie everyone's hands and you can stack the entire population into one square.

I did actually look at the grapple rules, but wasn't certain if it worked or not, because of the line "If you can't move into your target's space, you can't maintain the grapple and must immediately let go of the target." I THINK your trick works, but I wasn't completely certain.

** I don't quite get why the altars are being moved. Is this to move the ritual away from Afi? Relocate it to another plane? And why can't the altars just be put on a floating disk without the need for bearers, or teleported?

Also, how many ice assassins does Afi have?! Is there a limit? Or can he just make an army of them and crush all of his enemies? This latest voice seems like it ought to be yet another ice assassin, as I doubt Afi would risk himself. But how does he plan to deal with the anti magic field? He has Loki with him, but I doubt Loki is allowed to help him as that would favor a side. Perhaps Loki is there to run negotiations between them? I can't really see any other plausible explanation, given that Loki must remain neutral.

It is possible to make multiple Ice Assassins of the same creature. The spell does not have an inherent limit on number of duplicates. Also, Afi is thousands of years old.

Who said Loki had to stay neutral? His /alignment/ is Neutral, but that doesn't mean he can't take sides, it just means he doesn't give a damn about Law, Chaos, Good, or Evil.

The Grǫfhamrites were sacrificing one at a time because it made a good balance between how effective they were and how much they were giving up. They didn't know that anyone was interfering, so one per person seemed reasonable.

Shit.. I'm going to have to familiarize myself with the rules a lot more to keep up.

Also, if the ice assassins each sacrifice the same thing, that would just seem /wrong/. e.g.:\\
Afi makes a million Ice Assassins.\\
Each one sacrifices knowledge of the same spell(say, magic missile)\\
Repeat for nine more spells, then dispel the Assassins.\\
Afi doesn't lose knowledge of the spells, because his assassins did the sacrificing.\\
Herrun now has ten million sacrifices to her name and is OP.

Doesn't the power Herrun gets from a sacrifice equal less if nothing is truly lost or you use it for your gain?(e.g.: Afi: "/My phylactery is hidden at x,y,z./ Now no one can find it, muahaha.")

I was considering different stories and the amount of enjoyment I got from them and realized that I ranked your story up in the top tier with the likes of HPMoR, Worm, and a few that probably aren't as well known. Here's what contributed to that, in no particular order after the first bit:

The obvious two, mechanics of the English language, and a good story.

Although it's not finished, you update like clockwork, once a week. This allows for time to consider the latest chapter and its implications without forgetting what has happened since last time.

Being able to discuss what's happened in the latest chapter is awesome, other people often have insights into things I wouldn't consider. +Bonus points for the author being part of the community in which we discuss the story.

Your story is now approaching mid-length on my personal scale of how long I like stories(500k~ish words is where I start to consider them 'long'), and is suitable for rereading, providing expected future enjoyment.

All-in-all, this is an excellent work, thank you!

"Doesn't the power Herrun gets from a sacrifice equal less if nothing is truly lost or you use it for your gain?(e.g.: Afi: "My phylactery is hidden at x,y,z. Now no one can find it, muahaha.")"

Yes. That might actually be harmful to the ritual. Although, if Afi were to sacrifice that it wouldn't render his phylactery unfindable /by someone else/ -- only by him. And if the phylactery were moved then he could find it at its new location. If he actually /planned/ to do that when he made the sacrifice then it would fall into the "you're cheating and this sacrifice does not help" category, but if he had legitimately never had the idea to do that then it would still count as a sacrifice.

--------------

"...then dispel the Assassins."

There's no reason to dispel the assassins. Even if you've ripped all useless knowledge from them and left them as mindless husks, they are still physical duplicates of you and make great decoys. Also, [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/frostburn--68/ice-assassin--1279/][Ice Assassin]] is not actually dispellable -- it has a duration of Instantaneous, meaning that it creates a creature and then is done. The creature is just as real as anything else.

In point of fact, the spell does not specify what happens to an IA after it kills its target. I ruled that it goes away, but that's my interpretation -- effectively a house rule.

Uhmm... that looks as a low cost sacrifice. It appears to me that the "size" of the sacrifice is proportional to the loss you are incurring due to the sacrifice, this is, the benefit of an Ice Assasin sacrificing everything they know is proportional to the cost of losing most of an Ice Assasin.
