Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I've started taking melatonin to help me sleep better. It's definitely working, but has a side effect of weird and awesome dreams. The most notable one, that made me want to post here, featured Malicia and Cat standing in my childhood bedroom, whereupon Malicia /ripped out and devoured her own heart/. Somehow, while I watched this most metal scene, I was aware that the heart devouring was an issue of Ethics, which is not really a word to pair with either character. So, that was fun.

But double thumbs up recommendation on the melatonin, if anyone else is the sort of person to toss and turn until 2AM.

*** Out of curiosity, what dose are you taking? I was on melatonin for awhile, but had to stop because of the vivid dreams which often became vivid nightmares. After doing this twice, I was informed that the common dose for OTC melatonin was 3mg, while the effective dose is 300mcg. In other words, the average pill is ten times stronger than it needs to be. After switching to pills that had a tenth the amount of melatonin, I was able to use it to get to sleep without the messed up dreams.

Pet masseuses are a thing, too, and there are enough people who sell handcrafted lightsabers that they have their own forum to talk shop in.

** Who wants to talk about Black Mirror? I finally got around to watching the latest season and, in some respects, it's my favorite of the series. None of the episodes made me question everything I believed the way that National Anthem or White Bear did, but I still count Black Museum as one of my favorites of the entire series.

One of the things that made Black Mirror so unique and impactful was that the plots so frequently lacked catharsis, even the most tragic stories were oddly anticlimactic and left you feeling hollow. The latest season, by comparison, told more traditionally-structured stories with less ambiguous themes and I'm actually all for it.

The state of the world has changed since Black Mirror began, to the point where reality is seemingly imitating Booker's own satire and making us feel about as much despair, so I think the series needed to change too. I'm also happy that there wasn't a single episode this season that I hated, when I'd previously found the show a bit hit or miss.

*** I'm a bit disappointed by the latest season of Black Mirror. I prefer the more ambiguous themes and more general demonstration of how technology will affect our lives. Although I agree that with reality going through the looking glass, it might be good for Black Mirror to change.

My main complaint is that too many of the episodes in S03 deal with emulated minds, and I've read /The Age of Em/, which makes almost all of it fall flat. They're not exploiting the technology to the fullest.

Black History was fun, but still has the /Em/ problem. I like that they did an anthology again, but I feel that /White Christmas/ was woven more tightly together.

**** I don't disagree that the series lost something that it had before, I just don't think the world needs moral ambiguity at this point. I think evil has made itself known and we need to fight it, and love how [[https://youtu.be/fe63AZtmLKw][Black Museum presents that as the point of the whole series.]]

I have not read World of Em, though I definitely will now, so the idea is something relatively new to me that I wanted the show to explore more after how big an impact White Christmas had on me. That is the only episode that made me feel uncomfortable, so it's nice to get some catharsis.

I've had sci-fi stories ruined for me by economics before, but I think what makes Black Mirror's take on emulated minds impactful is how it focuses on the potential for abuse. People already do horrific things to each other and get away with it, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7pg4uy/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dshak5y][so why would we make an exception for AI?]]

I like the way that black mirror made me feel, and I didn't feel that way about a lot of the episodes this season (except Black Museum, which I felt in spades). For example, the episode with the "dogs" - it was just so completely pointless and the ending was trying to make it have a point but it just made the whole thing feel hollow and not in a good way.

That and there were too many "happy endings" for my taste.

Most of the episodes this season I found to be just okay, but there were things about each one that I enjoyed and I can see how they'd resonate with certain people.

Metalhead was definitely my least favorite of the season too. It's perfectly okay as a thriller, the problem is that it's /just/ a thriller and that's not what I want from this series. I like the fan theory that the robots are actually cookies gone rogue, but that was never even hinted at in the show.

Like, what was playing on the TV when the person in the house shot themselves? How suddenly did the dogs take over? Are other nations okay?

I relate this episode a lot to that passage in Meditations on Moloch about 'in the end Moloch may ask one final sacrifice from us'. I imagine the world is the aftermath of a war where both sides used autonomous killing machines on the other, each successful in their annihilation. This is a world where Moloch /has/ taken sentience.

*** This community may not be the best place for that, but two very general tips (if you are an independent adult with some amount of disposable income):

- *Take good care of yourself.* Try to build habits of superior grooming, diet, exercise, self-care, and living space maintenance. One's first efforts should go into improving one's circumstances. I found my attractiveness to women was better when I paid more attention to how often I shaved and got haircuts, and got a bit more trim. Having a well-organized (or at least not obviously messy) living space will be important. I also paid attention to dressing more fashionably.

- *Find activities where you'll meet women.* Join a book club with people your age in it, get involved in pick-up beach volleyball, start going to open mic night, go to the dog park with your dog, or find some other group activity that you enjoy. Make sure it's something you like that fits you, so that people you meet there are more likely to be compatible with you.

Some other low-key good advice is: don't shit where you eat, don't be afraid to ask women out (getting rejected is normal and not the end of the world), and don't forget about your own standards for who you want to date.

*** +Go to [[/r/relationships][r/relationships]]+

Kidding. I would say look towards friends/family (specifically older people, not like 20 years older but 5 years older) that you know have been on the dating scene for a while. A mix of men/women would be preferred. Ask them their opinion on whatever you feel the need to, but keep your questions as consistent as possible. After a few rounds, compare the answers you've received and go with the ones that were recommended by multiple people.

E.g. If you talk to six friends/family members. One of them says you should try to get as muscular as possible. All of them say you should ask out more women and try to learn to deal with the possibility of being rejected. Your best bet is the latter piece of advice.

**** Well, I would, if I had any friends to ask. That's the primary thing I wanted advice on, really. I remember reading somewhere that dating without a solid social support network is a bad idea, and I wanted an outside opinion to check that trying to date right now is, in fact, a bad idea and that I wasn't just trying to talk myself out of trying.

***** I'm no psychologist but I would say dating with no support network is a bad idea because you end up putting /way/ too much pressure on your partner inadvertently. That person is suddenly the provider of all of your socialization and that can be rough for the both of you because they can feel as if you're being clingy and you can find yourself acting in unhealthy ways such as feeling left out when she leaves your company to hang with others.

Plus that's to say nothing of the potential for emotional damage if you have a fight or breakup. You have no one to turn to to talk things through with or help you get over it or distract you.

Having no social network already puts you in a delicate place psychologically (if not an outright depressed one) and dating comes with a lot of mental and emotional stress that you have no human outlet with which to mitigate said stress. So I feel that it is an entirely legitimate concern to worry what impact dating could have on you.

Friends are both easier to obtain and maintain than a significant other and the experience you get with them will inevitably improve your chances once you do put yourself out there. I suggest finding a few friends before throwing your line out there.

Of course, you may well be emotionally and mentally healthy enough to handle dating with no social support; some people are just like that. But it's unlikely, to say the least. And you don't want to sacrifice your mental state for nothing.

I've tried looking for clubs etc., but the town I live in is virtually devoid of anything of that sort. Between the fluctuating economy that comes from being an oilfield town and the city council's shortsightedness, there's not a lot here. Hell, even the local Walmart left at one point. They came back eventually, but you get the idea.

This isn't just me failing at research, either. I've had coworkers who've been here anywhere from a couple months to six years complain about how there's nothing to do here.

The only real options for socialization that I'm aware of are going out to the bars (which is a bad idea for multiple reasons), some sports teams at the gym I go to (they're not at times that work for me, and I've never really been into sports in any case), and volunteering at either the library or the animal shelter (which I'm hesitant to do both because I have so little free time and because my job sometimes has us working weekends; that's if they even accept volunteers, which I haven't looked into yet).

******* Ah, small towns. That's unfortunate; a lot of what I feel would be recommended simply won't work due to population density then.

I honestly can't speak towards how to go about forging connections in small towns. From what I can tell; most of the connections are forged from simply living/growing up there. Neighborly type stuff. Barbecues, school events, etc.

For a new, unattached, 20-something year old from out of town? I can't even really begin to advise on how to get involved. Volunteering is a good way to at least fill up your time and I'm almost sure that the shelter at least accepts some sort of volunteering. Even if it's just 2 hours every Saturday or something.

If you don't mind me asking; why are the bars not a good idea? I grew up in a small town and can say that social activities revolved around drinking was far and away the best way to socialize with people. Of course, they're only fun if you're drinking too, obviously.

If the outcome of any time travel event effectively creates a new timeline separate from the old, the old timeline never sees any of the effects. The terminator fanfiction Branches on the Tree of Time follows this.

If time travel is possible, but only as far back as the invention of the first time machine, then the point in time the AI can show up is limited to be the earliest time any civilization invented time travel plus the duration of travel necessary to reach somewhere from that civilization.

*** Well, why would it? Time travel is appealing for humans because it lets us achieve our utility functions, winning gambles, trying again on fails, becoming famous, etc. etc.

An AI powerful enough to discover time travel is almost certainly powerful enough to dominate the world in its current time. What utility function would it fulfill with time travel that it wouldn't without?

As far as I know, there are 3 most likely groups of AI utility functions, and none of them have any use for time travel.

1) A industry (paperclip) AI, a program meant to produce some business good or provide some business service, self improves into a full AI.

In this case, the AI's utility function is something like maximize the number of paper clips in the universe, or produce as many paper clips as it can. Going backwards in time would reduce the number of paper clips, so it wouldn't do that if it had the former. And if it just wanted to have the highest production rate, it would build as many factories as possible and then loop time at the moment of peak efficiency, not go to the past.

2) An ethical AI (gone wrong), a program carefully designed by smart (but foolishly optimistic) people.

In this case, the AI's utility function is likely to be something like maximize total happiness, or maximize number of people alive. Going backwards in time reduces both. And since the AI is carefully designed, its creators may even be smart enough to program in the fact that time traveling backwards is universal murder and hence should be assigned negative infinite utility.

3) A selfish AI, some selfish smartass makes an AI with some selfish goal.

In this case, the AI's utility function is likely to be something like maximize creator's wealth. Going back in time reduces the total wealth in the world, and hence reduces the amount of wealth it can give to its creator. And going backwards in too far in time risks the creator never being born at all, rendering the utility function impossible to fulfill. So again, there is no point in time traveling backwards.

#+end_quote

Why would it need a maximally long timeloop though? That's only necessary if the limiting factor on the number of factories is building time, which seems rather unlikely. It would almost certainly run out of stuff to build factories out of before it runs out of time. And if it can send stuff back in time it could just send the factories too.

Also, doesn't the ability to travel to the past mean that time looping is possible by definition?

#+begin_quote

Let's compare two alternatives.

Alternative 1: Starting from it's time of creation, spend X time to multiply the population of 10 billionish people by a factor of Y.

Alternative 2: Time travel back thousands of years, spend X time to multiply the population of 1000 people by a factor of Y.

Why would an AI choose alternative 2? That will almost certainly result in a smaller number of people for the same amount of time/effort. Actually even more time and effort since back in the past humans haven't extracted the resources from the earth or built extraction/manufacturing tools yet, so the AI would be forced to do those things first before it can construct the technologies it needs.

#+begin_quote
  This AI can seed the past to ensure a higher earnings potential for the future creator.

But why would it? The earnings potential of its creator, no matter how high, won't give its creator as much money as an AI could give its creator directly, via stock manipulation or asteroid mining or printing indistinguishable counterfeit money or just enslaving the rest of humanity to make them acknowledge that its creator has infinity dollars and owns everything. Its creator's earnings potential is utterly dwarfed in comparison to infinity dollars, so seeding the past to improve it really doesn't affect the AI's utility function in any meaningful way.

****** In the end, it's all about negentropy.

Assume that no miracles are possible: there's no way to reverse entropy, and no way to go faster than light. Since the speed of the universe's expansion is faster than /c/, it means that the furthest galaxies we can see are inaccessible to us, and since it is increasing/the event horizon grows closer, it means we're losing energy: any moment we're not accelerating self-replicating Dyson Swarm seed-ships to relativistic speeds is the moment our civilization loses yottajoules of energy.

For the overwhelming majority of utility functions that we would consider useful, utility is proportional to energy: the more energy you have, the longer you can live, and the longer you can make things you care about exist (be those paperclips or humans). As such, I would expect virtually any ASI to send itself as far back in time as possible if given the opportunity, just to eat up as much raw materials as it could.

Think about it this way: would an AI with access to faster-than-light technology choose to /not/ use it to consume stars of other galaxies as fast as possible, letting them inefficiently burn away finite energy of this universe instead?

*** I strongly prefer season 1 of Stranger Things. Season 2's plot just wasn't as tight, it was all slow buildup, too little butter spread over too much bread, whereas season 1 had like a hundred different things happening each episode and the plot was constantly moving forward.

Babysitter!Steve was really the only thing I liked about season 2. Well, no, I liked Bob. And Noah Schnapp made great use of his increased screen time. Damnit. I loved (almost) every individual component of season 2 in spite of the fact that I was dissatisfied with season 2 as a whole, if that makes any sense.

My least favorite thing about season 2 was finding out what happened to Eleven at the end of season 1. That whole thing was built up as being, like, a big deal, almost like a [[#s][Spoiler]] or something, [[#s][Spoiler]], and then we find out that [[#s][Spoiler]].

There's also the fact that they resolved the love triangle at the end of the first season, but then not only reignited it in season 2 but added two additional ones (the blatant kids' one and the more subtle Hopper/Bob/Joyce one); and the fact that Joyce spends the whole season being concerned about Will again; and the fact that Joyce eccentrically covers the interior of her house with unconventional decor again; and the fact that they just took the monster from the first season and made it smaller and quadrupedal (which IRL would probably make the thing /more/ dangerous, not /less/) and had there be a bunch of them instead of just one (which counterintuitively makes them /less/ of a threat for some reason); and the fact that the monster escape happens because the Department of Energy Lab screwed up again; and the fact that the season ends with Eleven fixing everything by looking stern while holding out her hand like Neo again. Hell, they even rehashed the "Lucas not wanting Eleven to join the Party" through-line using Mike and Max.

Speaking of Max, what a waste of a character. The actress did a great job of /being/ that character, they just didn't give the character any reason to exist other than to give Lucas and Dustin their character arcs for the season. Is that a thing we still do with female characters in 2017? Also, what a downgrade for both of them. Season one started Lucas as a Doubting Thomas and then ended with him accepting Eleven, and Dustin's was more subtle but can be summed up with the D&D games that bookended the season where in episode 1 he urges Will to cast protection and in episode 8 he says "fireball the son of a bitch." And look at her brother Billy. That's what I expected Steve Harrington to be in season one, and then they gave him a character arc and made him an empathizable human. Billy was a walking trope, a cardboard cutout without anything remotely resembling an arc.

Also, the fact that Jonathan and Nancy spend the entire season on a meta arc responding to "Hashtag Justice For Barb," even though season one gave a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the town didn't go crazy searching for her the way they did for Will (Nancy's the only one who saw her car before the Lab people moved it to a bus stop and made it look like she ran away from home).

** I've been researching into lucid dreaming and to be a proficient lucid dreamer you need a firm grasp on reality, a constant self awareness of your surroundings noticing whats real and not real, and many reoccuring "reality check" tests you do on yourself to test if you are in a dream.

On a side note a great side effect/prerequisite is improved dream memory retention, and if anyone wants to try it, this might just be worth it by itself, because some dreams are like super awesome action movies with incredible full immersion special effects in absolutely fantastic environments and cracky plot.

Yes, this. The most annoying failure of the past year is that I stopped writing these down, when I'd been keeping record since first grade with minimal interruption.

I've found that full lucidity tends to kill dreams, even if I don't wake up almost immediately thereafter. As in, there are no people or events if I'm paying too much attention to my mind for them to happen. So the most successful bouts of lucidity were more brief, and targeted toward correcting one big problem so the dream could continue normally.

The best example I can think of is one where I noticed the dream, and realized I was about to wake up, so I tried a technique I'd read about to keep it going long enough to resolve the plot (I was in a mansion and the army came in and killed everyone and I was trying to survive/drive them out, whatever). In this case, I focused visually on details to keep the setting stable, and audibly, played through the most appropriate song I could think of on short notice, until I was confident that the dream was back in full.

One thing I found that helped once or twice when I was too lucid for anything to happen was opening a portal to somewhere else. This works only if I have just enough to expect from going through it for the dream to build on. I've tried it without anything in mind other than "this dream is stalling; let's open a Gateway", and nothing happened.

Basically, lucidity is like cheat codes. if you find yourself trapped in a shrinking elevator, remember how dreams work and scene-shift out of there, but if you leave debug mode on too long, you're not really playing anymore, unless you have a plan and the skill to execute it.

*** My experience with lucid dreaming is that actually conscious levels of thought--the ability to consider my situation--almost always resulted in my waking up immediately afterwards. For me, instead, the best results have come about--not from adopting a frequent 'reality check'--but from a frequent 'Things will turn out the way I want them to' assumption.

I'm not quite certain how to put it without it sounding like a descent into narcissism or delusion. Clearly, demanding things go my way doesn't work all that well in reality. Nevertheless, when confronted by nightmares, NO, of COURSE I have the ability to smite the horrible monster. Of COURSE I can escape the catastrophe by just willing it to part around me.

It's acknowledged narratively by the dream, but the visual effect as experienced within the dream is missing. Does this happen to anyone else?

Example: Dream me is completely confident that I can gesture at a dying companion and said companion is GOING TO BE FINE. This is accompanied by a vague expectation that there will be some visual component to the emanation of this innate ability, and this expectation fails to be met but the companion gets up and is okay.

Even with friends, text... it creates a lot of room for imagination, mostly the bad kind. If they don't respond fast enough- did I offend them? Am I boring them? Am I doing anything right? Are they honest about anything they say? It's so easy to edit out your initial angry outburst and replace it with something else, and... it's just inferior. Not completely useless, but inferior to a face-to-face conversation. After all, you cut away near entirety of non-verbal communication. Also, it's... just more tiring, typing just to read more words.

I mean, take /this/ very conversation. Reading, considering my response, typing all that out, posting, deleting the response to make adjustments, constantly editing, then considering what I did wrong (once you respond, or /not/). It's especially potent here, since the only things I /can/ see is the response, like/dislike from /someone/, and response time- all of them are a potential source of worry.... it's *TIRING*, time consuming and not really fun, even if it (partially) fulfills that craving for socialization.

Chat roulleteing sucks. The way to do it is to get in group chatrooms and make friends.

There's a chat protocol that's getting very popular, it's called Matrix and it's designed to bridge several popular chatting protocols/services together, such as IRC. For instance, you can access an IRC channel from [[https://www.snoonet.org/][Snoonet]] using Matrix: [[https://matrix.to/#/#_snoonet_#casualconversation:matrix.org]]. The Matrix client Riot supports video chat using WebRTC.

And when you find that special someone and you want to have an /encrypted/ conversation with them, you can ask them to use [[https://tox.chat/][Tox]] or [[http://retroshare.net][Retroshare]], both of which support video/audio chat.

**** Patook is a friend-finding website. Basically a dating site, but platonic. Fill out a profile, like people, see who liked you back, chat.

And it failed to produce any long-lasting conversation. Or to make the conversations good- write your piece, wait half a day for a 20 word reply with no lead in for further conversation. That's for /all/ of them, even for people you'd think would /know/ how to talk! (okay, there were longer pieces too, but they suffered the same problems)

The conversation I /did/ find on Omegle were actual conversations. They had appreciable response times, they were somewhat engaging, they had an end (mostly) instead of cutting in middle of a longer conversation and you wondering what went wrong.

Chatroulette was kind of like that, except mostly shorter but more /fun/ to have. It felt like I actually communicated with human beings for once! The joy! You could /feel/ the difference.

I will try the Matrix thing though, as well as encrypted ones, though the latter look like they require friends in the first place, which is kind of my main problem.\\
Actually- could you give a few examples of chatrooms and Matrix rooms? I am not quite sure where to start, frankly.
