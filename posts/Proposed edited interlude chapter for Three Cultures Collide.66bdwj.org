The recent re-opening of the discussion around EY's "Three Cultures Collide" and the ongoing controversy around the legalized rape bit inspired me to take a shot at revising the chapter in question, substituting another social ethical question that serves the same purpose of distancing their culture from the reader's, while being more apropos to the topic of the story.

I did this because I and others had cited this passage as a reason not to share an otherwise fascinating short story with several friends. While meddling in another Author's work is not something I typically condone, I felt making it sharable was more valuable than not.

Suggestions and edits are welcome. I have tried to stay as close as possible to the original content and structure while replacing the 2-3 controversial paragraphs. (the change portion begins with "demur")

Original credit to Elizier Yudkowsky, of course.

--------------

...

"No," said the Confessor, like an absolute order handed down from outside the universe. "You are the world that we wanted to create. Though I can't say we. That is just a distortion of memory, a romantic gloss on history fading into mist. I wasn't one of the dreamers, back then. I was just wrapped up in my private blanket of hurt. But if my pain meant anything, Akon, it is as part of the long price of a better world than that one. If you look back at ancient Earth, and are horrified - then that means it was all for something, don't you see? You are the beautiful and shining children, and this is your world, and you are the ones who must decide what to do with it now."

Akon started to speak, to demur --

The Confessor held up a hand. "I mean it, my lord Akon. It is not polite idealism. We ancients can't steer. Do you know there was a time when Abortion was legal? The killing of unborn children was seen as a human right, when it was convenient to do so.”

Akon looked startled. “Kill them? But why? Was there some sort of economic pressure or resource shortage demanding population control?”

The confessor shook his head sadly. “Incubation technology was poor at the time, and expensive. Most children were still born “naturally” then, carried by the mother to full term. To forbid abortion was to deny the mother agency over her own body, to violate the sanctity of her very person. To make matters worse, there was no screening for genetic disease or DNA repair, and many children were conceived and born with terrible diseases and deformities that made death a mercy, in the eyes of society. And for those children that were born healthy, but poor, there was scant social or economic support. They were doomed to a cycle of poverty and deprivation. It was only once we advanced sufficiently to ensure all were born healthy and given the best care and support society could provide that the ethical dilemma was resolved.”

Akon frowned, and looked thoughtful. “The babyeaters are long past that point, though. They could have modified themselves to eliminate the necessity for a violent selection process. Had just a few offspring, selected for them technologically prior to birth. But their culture didn't allow it. Their entire value system was built on this tradition.”

The Confessor nodded. “And that is why we cannot be allowed to steer. We are too rigid, too set in the old ways of thinking. What I'm trying to tell you - and this is not public knowledge - is that we nearly tried to overthrow your government."

"What?" said Akon. "The Confessors?"

"No, us. The ones who remembered the ancient world. Back then we still had our hands on a large share of the capital and tremendous influence in the grant committees. When our children began criminalizing Abortions, many of those that thought of themselves as progressive in their own times thought that the Future had gone wrong."

Akon's mouth hung open. "You were that callous to the lives of children?"

The Confessor shook his head. "There aren't any words," the Confessor said, "there aren't any words at all, by which I ever could explain to you. No, it wasn't callousness. It was a memory of disaster, the oppression of religious cults, the Jihads and Crusades of the 21st century, doing what they thought were the right things for all the wrong reasons. But now you know, don't you? You know, after speaking to me, that I can't ever be allowed to make decisions for humankind."

Akon hesitated. It was odd... he did know, on some gut level. And he couldn't have explained on any verbal level why. Just - that hint of wrongness.

"So now you know," the Confessor repeated. "And because we do remember so much disaster - and because it is a profession that benefits from being five hundred years old - many of us became Confessors. Being the voice of pessimism comes easily to us, and few indeed are those among the human kind who must rationally be nudged upward... We advise, but do not lead. Debate, but do not decide. We're going along for your ride, and trying not to be too shocked so that we can be almost as delighted as you. You might find yourself in a similar situation in five hundred years... if humanity survives this week."

"Ah, yes," Akon said dryly. "The aliens. The current problem of discourse."

"Yes. Have you had any thoughts on the subject?"

"Only that I really do wish that humanity had been alone in the universe." Akon's hand suddenly formed a fist and smashed hard against the bed. "Fuck it! I know how the Superhappies felt when they discovered that we and the Babyeaters hadn't 'repaired ourselves'. You understand what this implies about what the rest of the universe looks like, statistically speaking? Even if it's just a sample of two? I'm sure that somewhere out there are likable neighbors. Just as somewhere out there, if we go far enough through the infinite universe, there's a person who's an exact duplicate of me down to the atomic level. But every other species we ever actually meet is probably going to be -"

... I guess, but one of the strengths of Yudkowsky's example is that literally everyone agrees that rape should be illegal forever. There's an ongoing abortion debate, so picking it actually serves to distance their culture less from half the audience. If the idea of a society where abortion is illegal seems that alien and far-off to you, you should talk to some more people outside your bubble my friend.

*** Yeah, not to mention the original point of the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/][Politics is the Mind Killer]] post was merely to suggest not using political examples in your writing because humans do particularly badly at reasoning in politically charged contexts due to in part how extra super tribalistic it is. The original post even recommends for example discussing something from the time of Louis XVI over something from today if you can so help it (and especially if it doesn't damage the core point of whatever you're saying), and making the values drift example a contemporarily politically divisive topic is essentially falling into the same pitfall, and choosing something basically universally reviled (e.g. rape) is the Louis XVI option.

Considering that Three Worlds Collide was in part an illustrative fic to help communicate the concepts of [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Alien_values][alien values]] and some stuff about [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/][fun theory]] I think making the example politically charged would make things only worse than it is. Already you can find people insinuating that EY is actually sympathetic to rape or didn't do enough to suggest that rape is actually bad or disendorse it enough as an writer and this is surely a topic heinous enough that you would think that people would recognize the position as Clearly Not The Author's Actual Opinion, Duh. If it was something currently politically charged god only knows the kind of assumptions and reading into intentions that readers would inevitably have done, and accordingly would have dismissed the story as partisan or whatever in mindkilled stupor.

**** this I agree is true. the political nature of the topic and how I've treated will be polarizing -- it actually should offend both camps, as both "progressives" and "religious cults" are called out as wrong.

EY didn't do a great job of distancing himself from those critiques, unfortunately. He talked a lot about how many people want to engage in rape from either side, and a lot of his responses were somewhat baffling.

I have no opinion on what would or would not have happened had he written it differently. This conversation came up in a recent thread that indicated there were quite a few people that had decided not to share the fit that otherwise might have. that is a measurable failing of the original work that could be rectified.

of course, the problematic passage could just be cut, instead of replaced.

***** Should this offend both camps?

Progressive don't defend a "human right" to kill infants. Instead, they're defending a woman's right to stop being pregnant.

It happens that abortion is the only practical way to do that. But when you write:

You're implying that the society has solved those technical limitations. And women in this society can still exercise full autonomy over their bodies.

I don't see how the future society is creating situations that we, as modern readers, should consider repugnant.

...agreed, but just like abortion, there are wildly varying views on what should constitute "rape" in the legal sense and what the context should be. For example, is it just the non-consensual sex act itself? Is it that, applied to a woman you don't own? Is it a crime against the institution of law itself, or against her owner? What is its severity? It's not universally agreed-upon by any means, and varies wildly between different cultures and population groups.

** You have three issues, one good point, and I have one suggestion -

- You present the entire chapter, instead of just the altered bit plus context. Can you edit your post down to that? It will be much, MUCH more accessible.

- You remove the section where Akon attempts to explain his culture's reasoning behind the thing. The confessor never tries to explain to Akon the old view; it's only Akon who tries to explain their view.

The third thing is complicated. Let's look at the original:

#+begin_quote
  "...Do you know there was a time when nonconsensual sex was illegal?"

  "I can't imagine how boring your sex lives must have been up until then - flirting with a woman, teasing her, leading her on, knowing the whole time that you were perfectly safe because she couldn't take matters into her own hands if you went a little too far"
#+end_quote

"> ...When our children legalized rape, we thought that the Future had gone wrong."

First thing to notice is the use of a clear but unusual term, and the use of two separate terms (nonconsensual and rape). When you read "nonconsensual sex", you go, "huh - I think I recognize what that's saying, but something's different. Why?". You use the same term for the old attitude as the new attitude, implying the attitudes about them are the same. 'Abortion' is also a very conversational term, "nonconsensual sex" sounds more like legalese than "rape", implying a degree of specificity to the phrase not present in the conversational term. "Fetal termination" might make a good "future" term.

Next thing to notice is that /what/ the future legalized isn't clear. It's implied, and vaguely at that. What does it mean to take matters into her own hands? What does it mean to go a little too far? What does it mean to be safe?

It sounds like the issue could be that one person is leading the other person on, but it's not clear. There's one other line to pay attention to at this point:

#+begin_quote
  "someone seriously believes that sex is overvalued relative to orange juice".
#+end_quote

This is interesting. This means sex is traded on the commodity market. This means sex is commodified; to me, this implies that in this culture, I can owe someone sex, and they can trade that debt to someone else - without my approval. I can owe someone sex whom I don't want to have sex with - a very reasonable thing to call "legalized nonconsensual sex".

But there's still a lot of vagueness in Akon's statement. Is the issue that leading someone on is akin to negotiating a deal in bad faith - something imaginably abhorrent in a culture built on markets? The normal dating process can be seen as an implied contract of stuff and experiences for sex* - "leading on" is then breaking that implied contract. It's easy to then imagine that "take matters into hand" translates to legal / economic recourse, which result in a commodity of sex with you that you didn't agree to.

- If you experience dating as this in the modern world, seek help, you can be doing it less wrong.

Alternatively, the issue could have remained the same as it is today: One party takes it too far. This is a simpler interpretation of people's actions, but it makes the "take matters into hand" much less clear, and it's never explained - and honestly, I don't have any real idea here.

--------------

So those are your issues. That said, I think you picked a good replacement topic. Nonconsensual sex becomes something different if sex isn't as big a deal; abortion becomes something different if birth and child rearing isn't a big deal - there's that mention Akon has of the "children's world". If people don't raise their own kids and pregnancy/birth is super duper safe, what does it matter if you get pregnant? Or maybe it's common for people to conceive, and then gestate using technology - artificial wombs and all that.

My suggestion is to play with market-style relationships between the parents (particularly mother) and child. Maybe the child owes the mother something for gestation; maybe the parents owe the child something for creation. Either way, you can replace rape with slavery, and nonconsensual sex with.... forced pregnancy?

As a last note, I'd say that this story's strength is the questions it raises, not the answers it gives. Try to do the same: Raise many, many questions with any replacement you propose.

** I think an interesting replacement topic for rape is /the right to raise your children/. It makes total sense to the modern human that that should be a right- indeed, it's outrageous that some politician would even consider banning it. But in a more post-scarcity-like society, culture may dictate that giving newly created sentient minds favors that are dependent on the status of their biological gene-donors makes zero sense, and the human tendency to favor our own young more than others' is only an irrational animalistic instinct, so much so that banning favoritism like that helps children fairly partake of the free benefits society gives them when they're too young to be functional.

I would expect the push for this legislation would come less from a sense of fairness or punishing entitlements, though, as from socialization of care for the disadvantaged. that's much easier to sell, but still sounds quite awful to our ears.

** I like this idea since...well, rape. On top of the difficulty of getting people in the mindset to consider even a hypothetical alternative view on sexual consent, it also lacks proper explanation of the meta-context. It's the one part of the story that took me out of it and I had to look up what the author was trying to do.

That said, I don't think abortion is the best replacement specifically because I don't feel revulsion at the idea that my side of the debate lost, especially given the absence of the same negative consequence that are present today. Without those consequences, I could accept a fetus being defined as a human being.

or, if there is another revulsion that would make the reader distance from the characters, but not so much to pull them out of the story.

Edit:

I actually wanted to note one other thing. While this approach doesn't create revulsion at the future society, it can produce latent guilt at our current society, which I think for this purpose is just as good. It's the same thing the characters experience as they judge and then are judged in turn.

**** That's a fair point, though I think some of the impact is lost if the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance][Deliberate Values Dissonance]] isn't horrifying. As awkward as the rape example is, it does help the reader understand how aliens could find us horrifying for things we consider normal.

The Babyeaters offend our self-righteous morality, then the Superhappies show up and we offend them for completely different reasons and there's aspects of the human society that offend the reader. I still think the story is brilliantly written.

In terms of TWC... EY could have gone for something that would show how altered these humans are while not hitting all the controversy buttons that rape does (seriously, many people already pattern match the rationalist community to the neoreactionaries and thus by extension potentially the red pill/MRA community, so avoiding anything that might be misconstrued as rape apologist should be a priority). I think just indicating that extreme recreational violence (like a soccer match where breaking each other's legs is an acceptable strategy) is acceptable thanks to their medical technology and their altered psychology would be enough to achieve the same narrative goal.
