Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** If you were reincarnated/inserted into the Naruto universe (or some closely related fanon substitute) sans plot armor or narrativium (or, indeed, the overarching canon conflict), but were motivated to become a standard ninja who'd go on standard missions, what sorts of skills and abilities would you focus on developing? What strategies would you follow to maximize your odds of survival? Let's assume civilian life is barred to you -- you're going on a diverse sample of missions in 3-person groups, damnit! Assume also that you lack any special bloodline talents and are otherwise middle of the road on all ninja-related performance metrics. This tops your potential at /maybe/ high-Chunin level, after a decade or two of diligent practice and study. You're welcome to munchkin to your heart's content, but grant fellow ninja some basic level of real-world competence, along with the implied ruthlessness of a military organization that employs child soldiers. If your plan is to steal rare techniques from dangerous people, expect to very quickly die.

--------------

My own thoughts:

I think a strategy I haven't seen used much in Naruto is a combination of short, small-scale, high-fidelity genjutsu and techniques that focus on speed. Even basic ninja can be seen to move hundreds of miles per hour over short [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Flicker_Technique][distances]], we well as throw projectiles at comparable speeds with pinpoint accuracy. I'd try to couple these -- if I can deceive my foe for the second it takes them to realize and dispel the illusion, as well as throw a kunai some distance in that second, I could defeat most foes at my skill level without ever having to create a minutes long virtual world or giant fire dragon or whatever. If I had the attention to spare, I'd also try to work on techniques to hide my chakra signature, the better to lay in wait for such an ambush. I'd also work on my "running away" skills -- I think most ninja are by default paranoid, and so informing them of enemy interest is hardly revealing. Fleeing after a failed encounter (leaving behind only nondescript kunai) should let me live to make future attempts instead of engaging directly on a more even playing field. Obviously this wouldn't work on exceptional sensory ninja, or the ones with knife-proof skin, or whatever, but most of my enemies would also be common fodder, and sniping them from a distance seems by far the least risky and most reliable way to resolve encounters. On the off-chance that we have to engage directly, tiny illusions cast trivially could also mean the difference between a successfully blocked strike and one that hits true.

IMHO it's not that /hard/ to reach Jounin. The hard part is /living/ to reach Jounin. Count the number of ninja in the setting who are over 30. If you can survive long enough, you will inevitably learn enough to be Jounin-level dangerous (and will inevitably mature enough, compared to the average teenaged grunt, to be tossed into officer finishing school and lead a team.)

See also: actual armies in war-time. If the war goes on long enough, every enlisted /will/ eventually gain enough experience to have a good chance of getting a field commission, just on the basis of the war effort always needing more officers (because the existing ones keep dying) and the influx of academy-fresh ensigns just not being enough to satisfy that demand. You just need to not get shot.

--------------

A hypothesis that I've never seen about /Naruto/: ninjutsu are like math skills. You don't actually have to practice them when young to be good at them when you're older. In fact, it's counterproductive; you're trying to use a muscle that hasn't grown in yet (for math skills, that's "the formal operational stage of cognitive development.")

What if the key to being a great ninja, is just biding your time as a civilian who happens to have chakra, and only starting to learn Ninjutsu as an adult once your body (and so reflexes, chakra channels, etc.) and mind (and so cleverness) are higher?

In other words, what if "child soldiers" aren't any kind of /optimum/ for learning ninjutsu (only an optimum for war-time return on training investment, given clans producing R-selective amounts of children)? What if ninjutsu were much better taught at a university level?

*** The most important thing would be learning some kind of clone technique, that lets you send your clones on missions while you never ever leave your home, whether that's a safe place in your hidden village or a hideout in the middle of nowhere that no one knows about.

Failing that, I would go for sensory and stealth skills. Sense your enemies and hide from them, while telling your heavy hitting allies where the enemies are so they can deal with them. The best way to survive is to avoid combat entirely, and your ability to sense enemies is plenty valuable enough that you will be sent on recon missions.

â€‹

P.S. Am I not allowed to use my modern world knowledge that I reincarnated with? There are lots of technologies you could easily do with simple ninja techniques, even if we don't count guns and cannons. For example, if you have a fire skill, you can create hot air balloons and heat the air in the balloon with your fire skills. This will allow you to fly high above your enemies in relative safety. Not total safety since there are other flying ninja like Deidara, but those will be rare elites that you won't be likely to run into.

And if you have a lightning skill, well then, its time to have fun with electrolysis. Create large amounts of hydrogen from electrolyzing water, and you can use the hydrogen to create a massive explosion. Create large amounts of chlorine gas from electrolyzing water, and you now have a large amount of poison gas you can send at your enemies using wind skills.

*** Well it's hard to know how difficult it is to learn techniques because we don't really see any avarage people learn anything. Excepting Lee but I don't think I would ever be able to put in as much effort as he did.

If my life is on the line I think I could put in enough to git gud though. So focus on training my body is a way that should make me strong enough to life my life takeing safe d and c rank mission.

Doing all the chakra control stuff as early as possible is a must.

I think abuseing the [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Replacement_Technique][Body_Replacement_Technique]] to teleport by haveing friendlys attack me to trigger it is a neet hack.

I know the theory behind the rasengan but it wouldn't be super useful for me since I wouldn't have the chakra for it. Maybe I could trade it for something but that would be risky.

Some how useing a sumoning scroll to summon my self so if I take to much damage in a fight I will be unsommoned and telipoted back to where I first cast it.

Abuseing the crap out of storage seals is the best bet. Putting them on my shoes and taking out platforms to jump on on mid air. Storeing jars of air born posion that I have made myself imune to/ have the antidote, to pull out in combat. Putting seals on my fist and taking out massive weights as I punch. Or if the objects original momentum is conserved store pre fired projectiles in there.

This right here is what makes munchkining difficult. If we assume that they are competent, it also means that there are no flaws in the system obvious enough for a chunnin level ninja to exploit otherwise it would be in common usage.

Most notably it means that although genjutsu seems like a system comically ripe for exploit it wouldn't actually be given that we don't see normal ninjas popping up 1/10th of a second genjutsu and just instakilling their enemies in that timeframe before they can do anything about it.

*** To start, put a lot of effort into illusions and medical techniques, and try to learn the 8 gates since it synergises really well with medical (you can punch above your weight, and heal the damage inflicted by the technique afterwards).

You'd generally want to focus on stealth and remaining undetected, so you could ambush your enemies to steal their eyeballs (mileage may vary).

Basically I think there's a lot of knowledge a fan of the series could exploit that doesn't require them to be insanely skilled and lucky - just moderately so.

So with that said I would prioritize short term targets or targets that you are relatively certain that you have access to later.

Poker players or other partial competitions that have a well defined time interval with multiple cases of eye contact would be good targets. Learning someone's password by looking them into their eyes before a meeting could work. Most people at work are probably safe targets.

*** Goal: Power.

Go into politics, using your spy to get a grasp on your biggest threats and opportunities. Become the person who already knows the party leader's biggest problem and has a solution or who is always capitalizing on opposition weakness they didn't think had leaked. Blackmail is incredibly useful for you since you can hint at what you know and they will never find the source, and you can know if they are looking for one too. The power actually gets more useful the higher you climb as you get regular access to more important people, and less people can threaten you. Also as you get higher up the chain people are getting more and more information and reminders for your spy to observe.

Eventually once you get high enough you can start using it on other countries leader's during summits and other meetings. High level leader's are being fed intel all the time and have post-public strategy meetings, so you will get huge amounts of information even over short time spans. You can use that information to subtly guide your intelligence agencies towards areas other countries are focusing on for example.

Money: Get any job at a high end hotel, a doorman ideally (daily, face to face, video alibi), spy people in town for buisness meetings. Use your insider info for stock trading or flat out steal an account and transfer the money to a "financial privacy" country like Panama. Your power makes it impossible for them to pin it to you, since most investigation depends on how they got the info, with a little prep.

Bonus round: This allows the spy to "5 degrees of separation" hop back to report to you, and allows the spy to hop deeper and deeper into organizations without your involvement. President>FBI Director>specific Investigator for example

Can you place a spy on someone, then keep trying to create new spies until it works, letting you know when your target has died? Because that's an interesting ability in itself: the ability to tell whether a certain person has died, regardless of distance or secrecy, without any need for communications that could be intercepted or jammed.

Place a spy on an enemy, and you know for certain whether he is dead and no amount of faking his own death will save him from you.

Place a spy on an actual spy of your agency, and he can kill himself on a mission to instantly and completely secretly send a message to you, based on time of death.

Your equipment is medieval by our standards, a mixture of stone and iron weapons and primarily hide-based armor. In your train are a number of siege weapons, and many of your command are proficient with shortbows.

You command the armies of The Necromancer and are driven by his will to assault Lake-town, Dale, and Erebor. It is assumed that you will be able to complete this march in under a month, from Dol Guldur to the Long Lake. You have been marching up the River Running, pillaging, looting, and burning as you go, in an effort to provide supplies and arms for your armies.

In this march, you have been harassed by a hundred-rider company from Isengard. The riders ride wargs (somewhere between an overgrown hyena and a pursuit predator) and have functional muzzle-loading cartridge rifles. The technology for such weapons is not known outside of Isengard, and this campaign is the first time such weapons have been deployed in the field.

Your harassers are green soldiers straight from school (though you do not know that fact); your armies are seasoned warriors.

*** Send out detachments in a star pattern around the army during the night and have them hide. Next time they harass the main body of your force, you have forces behind them. This should let you force a fight, rather than just being shot at from range. I mean, most of them will probably still get away, but now they cant harrass you without first checking the land over with a fine comb, so a lot less time spent shooting at you.

Next night, archers hiding in covered trenches a couple hundred yards out from the camp - idea being to be in range to shoot back. Infantry ranged is more accurate than mounted range, and they will run out of men and wargs far sooner than you will run out of archers.

Both of these rely on doing night marches, since otherwise you are just letting them pin you in place, which would be extremely bad for an army that large, but if they start harrassing you at night, that is still a win, because, well, cavalry running around in the dark is going to have casualties even if you do /nothing/ to them, and in any case, just having detachments of troops with night vision roam around will again let you force fights at ranges closer than they want.

*** Is this based on the fanfic "Saruman of Many Devices"?

My first thought is, even if I don't know what a gun is, after being shot a few times it will be obvious that it is some kind of bow, and it won't be hard to see that there are deformed metal lumps in the injuries of wounded soldiers.

So adopt standard anti-bow tactics. First is stealth. Enemies won't shoot what they don't see, so look for tunnels, caves, forests, etc that you can hide in. Travel through them towards your destination, while sending out your stealthiest elites to act as ambush teams, skulking around in the shadows, waiting for the enemy riders to go past and then hit them in the back while their guard is down.

Second is shields. Shields stop arrows, they may stop guns too. After trying wooden shields it may become obvious that they don't work. But luckily for you, you are the commander of 20000 meat shields. Stick the useless ones on the outer perimeter, carry around their dead bodies as literal meat shields if they get killed. Orcs live in filth and gore all the time without getting sick anyway, so the possible health issues from carrying around dead bodies doesn't seem to be a major concern. Also orcs are much stronger than humans so carrying around a bunch of dead bodies all day won't be too much of a drain on their strength either.

**** Naruto is fundamentally a shonen setting written on a weekly basis under intense deadline pressure, where everything happens to drive the plot forward as the author desires - but with little overarching plot that was established before the story started, and instead relying on making up backstories and figuring it all out on a 'fuck it we'll do it live!" plan. The causality for almost all setting elements goes "plot requirement for this week -> required setting elements" rather than "setting elements established -> plot element that would logically arise". The setting and background make very little sense; the background numbers/demographics/math were thought out with less than, say, JK Rowling's attention to detail.

Consider the great snake escape. What the fuck is that, you might ask? Well, this comic [[https://imgur.com/vM4Uw1i][puts it into words better than I can]].

** El Goonish Shive just finished a non-canon side story about a magical artifact (a set of scales) that can "rebalance" two people's physical attributes - e.g., making one taller and the other shorter, or making people bigger or smaller in... certain places. The bit with the artifact starts [[http://egscomics.com/egsnp/nanasecraft-36][here]].

The immortal who created this artifact created it mainly to have wild shapeshifting parties, but she's very worried that someone could use it for "evil stuff." How well-founded is this fear? What sort of shenanigans, evil or otherwise, can you get up to with the ability to reshape one body part at the expense of another?

Note: In El Goonish Shive, transformation magic is /extremely/ safe and can't directly hurt people - you can't crush someone by making them too tall for the room they're in, for example.
