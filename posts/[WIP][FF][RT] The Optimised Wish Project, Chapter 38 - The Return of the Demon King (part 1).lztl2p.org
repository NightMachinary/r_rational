** I suspect that Piccolo's unyielding rage is metaphysically significant. After all, Piccolo is the castoff, "evil" parts of Kami. Anger was probably one of the big things Kami got rid off, which would make it very central to Piccolo's behavior and identity. It's entirely possible that he can't ever stop being angry, especially since Kami would have kept the more positive behaviors and emotions.

If this is true, it would imply interesting things about Kami. Namely, that he might be incapable of experiencing anger in the same way that Piccolo might be perpetually angry. On paper this might sound good, but I can't imagine removing such a foundational emotion would be an entirely positive thing. It might be why he's seemingly okay with sitting up in the Lookout and just watching as the Instruments bring Piccolo back.

This is a shit ton of speculation though, so we'll have to see how it holds up as we learn more about Piccolo and Kami (whenever he shows up).

He had enough time to mutter "Dragon, make me strong enough to". So he could use this time to say something shorter, for example, "Dragon, go away", or "Dragon, kill him"... that way he could suceed, altough it depends on how eager dragon is to grant wish of random person

*** "Dragon, kill Piccolo" wouldn't work. The dragon canonically can't destroy beings more powerful than him - or most Dragon Ball arcs would be tremendously short. And Piccolo IS more powerful in terms of sheer strength - well, besides being technically half of his creator.

EDIT: Sorry, realised you meant Blue/Flute. That could actually have worked, I guess. In canon the dragon has never been used to kill, though. Perhaps an umbrella "no kill wishes" rule would make a bit more sense.

Also, was the being who's attention Shenron didn't want to get Beerus or Chronoa? I'd guess the former because "worlds crumbling to dust, like stars exploding, like the universe itself unravelling into nothing" seems like the former but could plausibly be the latter.

***** Piccolo right now is stronger than Kami because he's still young; in addition, he spent more time fighting and thus effectively training. But it doesn't make a difference; Shenlong couldn't destroy either, since they're basically his creator.

About the second thing, I won't say, but the hints are there. Consider also this isn't the first time you read that exact description.

** Does this little time trickery could mean that dragon in fact cloned the container from its state 300 years ago and the real container with real piccolo is still at athe bottom of the ocean?

I think not, because it's clearly stated that he accelerated the time, but I don;t know if [[/u/SimoneNonvelodico][u/SimoneNonvelodico]] considered going a slightly different option with it.

*** No, he did just what he says. It's barely skirting the rules because while the time acceleration /is/ an effect that was set in the past from the future, the inside of the container was effectively isolated from the rest of the world until it's opened, /after/ the wish is expressed. Which means in fact the dragon did not send information from the future to the past, and did not create any real time paradox (besides the information that he himself gathered about the wish having been granted). About the gods' ban on time travel, I'm taking inspiration from the various things said to this effect in Dragon Ball Super's Goku Black/Zamasu arc.

***** In canon, Piccolo /does/ age inside the container. When he comes out he's as old as Kami. He only becomes young later, by wishing for it to the dragon. I suppose you could consider it a bit of a stretch that Piano already suspected that (in a way you'd think it more natural that the time imprisoned would /not/ count towards aging...), but fundamentally this was necessary to bring back a young Piccolo at the peak of his power. Otherwise, since they used the Dragon Balls, we'd be stuck with old geezer Piccolo.

******* Yup. It's kind of silly how Piccolo asks to be returned to his youth, but not for /eternal/ youth, and then immediately destroys the dragon before he can leave. The destruction means the dragon can't be used against him in any way in the future, which makes sense, but now he's stuck with dying in a few hundred years anyway (Namekians seemingly have very long lifespans after all). But yes, that's the gist of it. Also, in canon it's Pilaf and his gang, not people from the Red Ribbon, who bring him back. They basically just found his container by accident and hoped that by sucking up to him they would get a slice of his conquests. It doesn't end well for them either (though it's overall more cartoonish and they get out of it with their own lives - just having been unceremoniously ditched as soon as they stopped being useful).

If he didn't also wish for Kami to be young again it wouldn't even extend his lifespan at all, would it? Maybe he was planning on recreating the dragon eventually (if he was able to do that without Kami).

Not that that makes it make a ton more sense, it would still have been better to simply wish for immortality, but all the wishes in Dragonball are very unoptimized. They should start a project or something to improve on that.

Yeah, I suppose this might be yet another occurrence of "Toriyama just winging it". During the Piccolo arc itself there seems to be no suggestion that anyone - him included - knows about Kami. It only becomes relevant later when his son comes back for revenge.

Again, hindsight is 20/20, but we're told later in Z that generally Namekians are either magic types (healers and dragon summoners) or warrior types, but never both. You could make a case that these roles were split in Kami and Piccolo. Also, in GT, the black star Dragon Balls were supposedly created by Kami+Piccolo before their split, and they are kinda screw-y since they blow up the planet one year after the wish is made. But then again, it's GT. The less one thinks about it, the more brain cells one retains.

- Tien and Chiaotzu swear revenge and maybe joins forces with our heroes, it seems like a good start of their redemption arc
- Bulma gets in contact with HQ and gets the bad news
- Yamcha reports back to HQ
- Flute (Blue) is the biggest unknown here, but the only reasonable explanation is that he is following Yamcha now. Or maybe he will try to use his little force on Piccolo and fail miserably
- Goku is getting retrieved and healed
- - And Piccolo will be... Piccolo
