** This is a short that was originally written for a Patreon goal, but came out a little bit off what I was aiming for (which was a little more slice-of-life than this is). Here it is though, for your reading pleasure, it was nice to take a break and just do something mundane.

** One of the things I enjoy most about the fantasy genre is its ability to show us the human condition without the restricting context of a 'real' human world.

You don't need big explosions or rampaging dragons to write good fantasy. You just need to desire a different viewpoint on a universal problem-- a viewpoint that isn't quite possible in our world, but which can be written to life in this one.

Callie just feels like a person. And the fact that she's an orc, or that her culture was stripped from her by the archetypal Chosen King, or that she doesn't fit into human beauty standards don't make her feel less like someone who could exist in our world. They're just more examples of the value of a fantasy viewpoint's applicability to real issues.

*** Honestly to me Callie feels very much like someone who could fit in our world. There are plenty of real-world people whose ancestral cultures were stripped away from them, and who have the pressure of majority cultures to fit into, in terms of dress, beauty standards, career aspirations, you name it.

**** Exactly-- real issues, looked at from a technically unreal point of view. You're intended to draw dozens of parallels between Callie's situation and that of many minorities on Earth, but the lens of fantasy provides a sort of... insulation, maybe?

***** It is definitely easier to think about Callie's point of view, and easier to get inside her head, than it is to think about the aboriginal Australian POV.

*** To be fair, Alexander Wales characters are probably four sigmas more likely to "think about stuff" than the baseline real or fictional human.

*** For me there's too many negative emotions in this text that I'd describe it as cozy, especially compared to my expectations about slice of life (usually light reading, not about how dating people with hair is contributing to the oppression of bald people)

** This is a great little slice-of-life short. I found Callie and Jestin's respective revelations to be especially interesting, and they went a long way towards making the characters feel like real people. Callie's experience reminded me of [[https://youtu.be/hmKix-75dsg][this Vi Hart video]], in which Vi Hart explains that throughout her teenage years, she thought everyone had the same beliefs and opinions as she did, and if they claimed otherwise, they were doing it for attention, political correctness, or some other ulterior motive.

** I find it, not difficult but just draining, annoying?, to read these types of characters. A lack of confidence justified or not seems to grate on me. I guess I feel empathetic for how horrible it must be to be incapable of crossing a room without thinking about what other people think about it. And feeling her feelings is not exactly a fun thing though I think that doesn't mean it's something people shouldn't feel.

When she's alone it was worse because as she said when she's alone she literally just whines about how bad everything is which isn't fun to read I assume for anyone?

Also that guys comments about intellect seem like author stand in to me but perhaps I'm projecting though I don't identify too much. Maybe the author is actually the main character, certainly she reflects some parts but I don't think overall.

*** I agree with that it's draining to read about such characters but for me it depends on my mood. If I'm in a similar dip in life then it's unbearable but otherwise its overall nice to read about them.

Especially when it's only a single chapter instead of a book, adding the fact that there were no hugely embarrassing or cringe moments in this and that it's neatly written makes this a highly enjoyable experience for me.
