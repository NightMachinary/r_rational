Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I made [[https://i.imgur.com/NUw68i4.jpg][a CYOA]] for [[/r/makeyourchoice][r/makeyourchoice]] this past week and would be interested in hearing both which of the options people here would choose, and how they would apply those powers to accomplish their goals (whatever those might be).

You can see previous discussion of the CYOA [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5qwwi5/][here]], though I updated it to clarify a few things in light of feedback and responses received, so the image above is not quite the same as in that thread. Same caveats from over there apply here, too: I'm not a physicist, so apologies for any factual or conceptual inaccuracies! Special thanks to all the artists whose images I stole off google images. Please forgive any compression artifacts; when I exported from PS everything looked clear but IMGUR compressed it pretty dramatically.

edit: Applications which read the text literally to great effect are strongly encouraged, but would also appreciate suggestions for how to improve my specification of the powers such that their intent/spirit is properly observed.

*** Just gonna knock the obvious stuff out.

Serendipity is only limited by maximum /force/, not maximum /precision/. Hi, any nanofactory I can visualize appearing from raw materials within 10 meters of me. Nice to meet you. Transmutation can do the same thing at major.

Time travel doesn't have a 'no recursion' clause, and so there's /probably/ a way to make at least the major version more or less infinitely powerful. 2kb one time isn't that much, but you have infinite lifetimes to figure out how to cram shit into it efficiently, in a form you've been proven by rigorous research to be able to unpack.

Basically, your choice is between minor serendipity (to which major is an irrelevant upgrade) with minor time travel on the one hand, and major time travel on the other. It really comes down to how much you value 16000 bits worth of the most useful possible information versus a more used-as-intended, short-term oracle and nanotech. But I could only write the latter story in anything resembling a satisfying way, so I know what I'd pick.

**** Breaking a single bond between carbon atoms takes [[http://www.picotwist.com/index.php?content=smb&option=odg][1.6x10^{-9} N]]. The diameter of a carbon atom is 0.3 nm, giving the bond a surface area of about 1 x10^{-19} m^{2} , meaning you need 20,000,000 kPa to break a carbon bond. The limit on telekenetic force is 10 kPa, or two million times too weak. No nanofactory for you.

I didn't go too much into depth on how exactly it would work, but I don't think you could do this within the limits of the definition I provided. For one, atomic bonds typically require far greater pressures (not /forces/ for this power) than the ones TS is capable of -- see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magntude_(pressure][here]]. It's why no major reactions occur when I rest my hand on the table (AFAIK -- I'm sure /some/ occur). For another, the MC approach to how the power works ensures that any precise series of nudges is highly improbable if a lot of them are needed. I threw out a rough order of magnitude number ("untold trillions"), of which there might only be a small handful of viable combinations of minute-long-series of nudges (lets say you can have some uniform random number between 1-1E5 (roughly?) series of nudges over that minute, of any exponentially distributed area up to the maximum, in any uniformly distributed position within your sphere of influence, across any uniformly distributed duration within the minute -- all with some appropriate scaling for the less minor form. I'd have clarified this in text but didn't have enough space).

And I forgot to specify, but let's also say that the drawing happens at the start of each minute, rather than continuously. Hell, I'm not even sure /any/ series would be guaranteed to actually help you, since the overwhelming majority would primarily include stuff like a gentle breeze wafting up your nostrils and 4 ft. in from of you or whatever, so let's say the null set is automatically included (you /could/ easily use it to win the Randi prize, but at the cost of attracting a ton of attention, depending on if that tradeoff is consistent with your values). I chose trillions since it seemed like a nice amount, but I guess you could tune as appropriate for it to be consistent with my description of the power. I'd say the real draw here is the precise quantification of your preferences (and action in accord with that quantification), but you can't access it directly.

Additionally, if you can conceptualize energetically/thermodynamically viable nanotechnology, and can hold its image in your mind all at once, you'd better be working in the appropriate field!

There is a cool down, though, equivalent to however long "you" send information back. So you only have the equivalent of one lifetime, and that's with perfectly aligned backwards transmission (barring other time-travel shenanigans involving traveling really fast or living near really big things, maybe). And the information is just whatever you decide to send back (using whatever encoding scheme you like/precommit to) -- usefulness isn't guaranteed (and it's a bit risky if "you" send something really far back). Hell, at that, "you" can only really send info as far back as you would be able to decrypt it! If "you" try to send the "optimal" 2kb message back 50 years (having decided on your encryption/compression 50 years prior), then you have that message and 50 years to wait before being able to use your power again.

(edit: I also didn't say TS was using /MCMC/, which would certain sample from some nice neighborhood far more efficiently)

***** For time travel, the other part of the problem. How do you get the information?

Say you resolve to send information back to one minute after you got the power in a week, and you do that a million times. What does it look like then? As you'd be getting back 2MB worth of data in 2B blocks, how do you get that information? It'd be 2GB of info with Less Minor, and if you just see a million different data sequences of ones and zeroes for examples there's no way you'd be able to handle that. A lot of people would struggle with handling just one depending on how quick they come at you.

****** I think the exact mechanism isn't too important -- they could appear as floating numbers in your mind, or you could use a 0/1 ouija board where the sequence shows up with non-informative timing, or you could have a magical .txt document on your computer that glows with arcane power and pulls new sequences where appropriate, or w/e. For the less minor form, you'd probably want something like that last one in the interests of convenience (the time-in-the-future part would pop into your mind as a confident sureness, though).

For the second part, I'd say you'd receive the message one minute after getting the power, and then you wouldn't receive anything else for a week, as per the specified cooldown. I'm not really sure I understand how you'd resolve to do it a million times, though. Also implicit in this is a sort of strong determinism (but still sensitivity to initial conditions -- so the future that would play out would be distinct from the simulated one that sent back information, since that one never received any information) with that "lazy evaluation" line.

So I think it would be something like:

1. Receive the power.
2. Simulation starts.
3. Simulate until information is sent back.
4. Allow reality to proceed until the point at which the reception of simulation was specified (identical to the simulated version, given determinism and magic purple power).
5. At that point, receive information.
6. Start a new simulation, repeating 2-5, but not allowing any new transmission until the point in 3 is reached.
7. Hmm, and check to see if in any subsequent simulations are sent back further than the point in 5, and if so, 2-7 occur in a "higher level" simulation.

Now, how this can all occur without generating "sentience" I'll leave to our hyperintelligent purple "benefactor" (I included that in case people would be uncomfortable with allowing the creation and destruction of simulated universes).

*** Dimensional distortion and pinhole portals seem to be the most useful combination. Example uses:

- *Teleportation:* Make a portal from A to B, with portal A nearby on a hard and flat surface (and place B near your destination on a hard and flat surface). Step next to portal A, warp the space you're standing in, and the space where you'll step out of to become very tiny. You're now small enough to step through the portal and expand on the other side.

- *Fusion reactor:* Connect a portal between the core of the sun and the inside of your power plant. Plasma which is compressed to a density of 150 times that of water rushes out of the 1 mm portal under a force of 26.5 petapascals, emerging at an initial temperature of 15 million degrees, though it will cool as it expands. Run a power plant, or just place it at the center of a large rocket nozzle to have your very own [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchship][torchship]]. Need less power, e.g. for a jetpack? Connect your portal to somewhere higher up in the sun, like its convective zone.

- *Fire juggling:* Suppose you want to blow something up but don't want to wait for a portal to connect to the sun. You are in arbitrary control of the frame of reference for the portals (and it was not specified as an /inertial/ frame of reference - if it were, the portals would immediately fall down a gravity well), which means you can make them move. You can move your sun portal from the sun's core to space in a little under a second, so you can rapidly switch from small flame to terrifying explosion. Similarly, you can move your portal on Earth's side to any point on the planet in less than 1/100th of a second.

- *Underwater breathing:* Just know where you can reliably find an oxygen tank, somewhere in the world. Connect a portal from the inside of that tank to the area right in front of your face.

- *Starshot:* You can complete the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starshot#Breakthrough_Starshot][Breakthrough Starshot]] project from your own backyard. Build or buy the probes you want to use, and launch them by creating a small portal near Earth which is moving away from Earth at 99% of the speed of light. Shrink the probes down, put them in a vacuum chamber with a funnel leading to the portal, and tip them into the funnel when ready.

- *Time travel:* Create portal A and B. Move portal B's frame of reference at 99% of the speed of light relative to Earth for a few minutes and then bring it back to Earth. Portal B is now a few minutes behind portal A. Use the teleportation trick to step through portal A and go a few minutes into the past, or portal B and go a few minutes into the future.

Not quite God-level powers there, but certainly god-level powers.

Point of order the portals have a volume of 0 (as mentioned in the dimensional distortion entry, they are flat circles) so they should have a mass of 0. Even in an inertial reference frame they wouldn't be affected by gravity. I Am Not A Physicist, but I think that kills your time travel exploit as well. On the upside if you /can/ move your portals this means you don't need to fight inertia.

Also for the underwater breathing exploit, you don't really need the oxygen tank, just "10 stories above the surface of the Atlantic Ocean at least 100 meters away from any clouds" to "the roof of your mouth"

It's not a problem. As it was specified, you select the reference frame for the portals, and again, it did not specify an inertial reference frame. The power as specified is the easy case, since you control exactly where the portals are and can move them around as you please.

But let's try the hard case, where we have to do this in an inertial reference frame where the portal's location is fixed relative to an object's mass, and the portal rotates as the object rotates. If you make a portal in your bathtub and fix it to Earth's reference frame, the portal will stay in your bathtub. This approach may seem harder to abuse, but it's actually pretty easy.

Set the portal's location relative to a pencil, but place it at a distance of 95,000 km (about 1/3rd of a light second) from the pencil. If you rotate the pencil at 1 revolution per second, the portal will move at 99.5% of the speed of light. You would then don a space suit, step through your portal and end up however many minutes or hours in the past. You would then make a new portal to return to Earth.

That may not do you any good, actually. To be able to breathe when deep underwater, you need pressurized air. Your chest cavity has to be able to expand against the water pressure, and that's surprisingly difficult if you're breathing low-pressure air. This is why [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorkeling][snorkels]] are not typically made any longer than 16 inches.

*** Focusing on one of the ones that wasn't looked at too much.

What counts as a computing system? Particularly when we get into biological systems, because Less Minor Computational Duplication has some even bigger potential there. Notably, brains, but it applies elsewhere. While you prevent brains that occurred due to evolution, well we've got the most powerful computer in the world by a huge amount, so how much is needed before you can call a living creature designed and developed by humans? Genetic engineering is a thing after all, so a creature that has been designed to be better, and then grown artificially, could count as designed and developed by humans. Not even discarding the less strict ways of genetic engineering that takes the form of just breeding programs, happens all the time with plants and animals, over many generations humans work towards creating the best possible animal/plant. Most domesticated animals could potentially count as designed.

There's also inheritance, once you've got your designed creature, if it breeds with another designed creature, does the offspring count as a designed creature? What if you breed it with a "natural" creature it is compatible with, does the offspring count as designed in that case? In both cases it still clearly uses the work designed and developed by humanity to produce a result.

The other big part of the question is can you control what kind of computing system it emulates? Not all computing systems in the world, even being super strict with things designed and artificially constructed specifically for "computing" we've got multiple incompatible types of computers including the common binary electronic ones, mechanical computers, and quantum computers. If you can choose what kind of computer it emulates in architecture it gives you some extra options. Being able to take all the conventional computing power and just seamlessly convert it over to a quantum computer would do wonders there as they're much better for some kinds of problems than conventional computers.

**** Thanks for your response! I did [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5qwwi5/prodigious_puny_purple_powers_oc_first_time/dd489fd/][struggle a bit]] with figuring out a good way to delimit which computers qualify for the power, especially given self-imposed space limitations. I /did/ explicitly say cranial fleshbags were excluded, and was hoping the previous phrase "only computers designed and developed within the last millenium onwards" might be interpreted in light of that. I would say that modern genetic engineering -- especially through breeding -- is just a /modification/ of pre-existing "design", and not novel in itself (can clarify for V3 though!). BUT I didn't want to /necessarily/ exclude stuff like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_computer][this]], so I included the caveat. I guess if someone either printed out neurons in specified locations themselves, or designed from the ground-up some self-replicating bacterium (with artificial gene synthesis or w/e) that would link up into some super-organism, that would be totally legit.

I also tried not to exclude /evolved/ systems, since chip design could easily make use of e.g. evolutionary algorithms.

I'd say no, given my interpretation of develop/design. And if we're constructing artificial organisms that can viably reproduce with existing ones, I'd suspect we have far more awesome computer available anyway.

I'd say the standard mechanisms for I/O are there, but done in such a way as to work seamlessly with (any computer terminal, your own thoughts, etc.). Maybe they power creates a really intuitive GUI for you to use or something. So if the strongest computer around were something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchant_calculator][this]], you could enter in a series of button presses either through some written script, or by pressing buttons on a GUI, or by reading -- and thinking -- a particular sequence, or w/e.

I'm not really sure how feasible it would be to convert from one sort of computer to another (much as I'm no physicist, IANA hardware engineer), or how one might even go "summing" across all existing computers. Maybe for the less minor form it can take the general form of the most powerful computer, but with a lot of extra "oomph"? IDK.

I'd be curious to hear what applications you think there might be to a "human brain"-like computer, though. Any programs you ran would need to be massively parallelizable, right?

Also, the "are brains computers or no?" thing might be irrelevant within some relatively small number of decades, depending on how optimistic your timeline for superhuman AI is. And that's when this power would really kick off IMO.

*** Wow I feel kind of stupid because there's a really obvious way to send arbitrarily large amounts of information using *Byte Sized Time Travel*. Like I spent all that time figuring out how to encode information into the time the info was sent from in my previous answer, but failed to see the obvious exploit. /Even though I was already committed to sending the information back post singularity./\\
There's no limit on how far back you can send, the only limit is the cooldown. So in the future simply send the info back, then just keep sending it back because in this simulated future you're /at/ the time the info is being sent from so there's no cooldown.

It says the entities in the simulation aren't conscious, though I'm not sure how that's supposed to work, what with P-zombies being nonsensical and whatnot. Anyway even if that simulated me never gets any messages, they won't exactly be beaten up about it because they are still living in a post singularity utopia, so i'm sure I would be fine with expending a minimal amount of effort in order to help some alternate version of me.\\
Also remember there's no cooldown from the perspectives of simulated me, sure it may create many iteration of simulation loop, but they still send the info from the designated time as expected, not experiencing those other iterations.

But for another thing, why do you think the post-singularity world is an utopia? You just let whatever AGI first appears in the simulation do its Simurgh's Song in the real world, assuming it doesn't care about the simulation continuing.

Well I expect that I would maximize the chances of superintelligence being friendly and developed in my lifetime using my world domination scheme using pinhole portal that I mentioned in my original answer, so my odds are still better than they would otherwise be.\\
However even if it wasn't friendly I would realistically only accept info that was info on GAI generally so my researchers could create it themselves once they were extremely confident, and not just run any code I got back. So any unfriendly AI wouldn't bother sending info back because I'm not actually going to instantiate it, though it may still send the info back hoping for the off chance we make a dumb mistake.\\
Plus the powers grant you a supernatural foresight for catastrophic events, but i'm not exactly counting on that, since I can't know what kind of bizarre methods GAI could use to gain insight about the purple gods.

See i'm not sure how what you said works, I see no reason you can't get a message from a million years in the future, then simply commit to send another message back to a second in your (current) future right after the cooldown wears out in a million years plus a fraction of a second. However my idea is to simply precommit to doing that plan but set the target for the same point in time so it's /as though/ you did that strategy, or I could actually stagger things by a second or whatever, it makes little difference.\\
Point is since there's no limit on how far back you can send info, and the cooldown always expires in finite time (whereas the pinhole portal lets you get infinite energy so the future singularity could last indefinitely). So it seems like a mathematical proof that at the very least my plan's theoretically possible. But since the cooldown doesn't ballon exponentially I hardly need arbitrarily large time anyway.

It could read your brain and not kill people for a year after it comes out. Assuming that it can send back arbitrary amounts of information through your scheme, if you read the info it sends back, it has already won - see the AI box experiment.

Even if it couldn't convince you outright, surely there is some info AGI experts wouldn't figure out is nefarious - see the underhanded C contest. That's probably not the part where this fails, though - with any luck, AGI experts do not accept text sent from an arbitrary future AGI. They might run screaming in little circles that suddenly the Simurgh is real and has already sung. Perhaps it could convince you of this fact and to not contact them.

Did you reconsider after the last paragraph, just a little? The AGI could find something pretty close to the optimal version of that paragraph, to any end.

Ah now I see what you mean. The problem I have with your interpretation is that it clearly implies a limit to how far you can send the info back.\\
So if I were to alter your diagram (I can't because using a laptop trackpad is shit for that sort of thing) the grey lines would all trace back to the same place, because there's no limit to how far back the info can be sent.

See I don't imagine if it escapes it would bother reading my mind unless it had superhuman cognition. Hell even if it did read my mind, the priors on this sort of thing are so low that it would probably just assume I was insane. I probably should have stated more explicitly that the sheer implausibility of the situation serves as a great deal of the defence against a rational agent like this.\\
However I wouldn't count on that, because clearly the purple gods represent our models of reality being flawed on a deep level so I don't know what kind of knowledge the GAI might be able to glean about such things. As for the AI box experiment, I don't find that nearly as convincing knowing that even EY couldn't win when he did two more trials. I still think an /actual/ SAI could win within that format but I'm less sure when it comes to the safeguards I would use in this scenario.\\
First off while I consider just straight up brain hacking a possibility, I don't think it's likely within the limitations I have imposed.

I would only allow extremely stubborn people who have shown an ability to pass the AI box experiment (I would arrange for them to take it before I hired them without them even knowing I was going to be using it as a test) consistently against my best "AI" and are otherwise qualified. They would look at it in pieces to ensure it seems to just be factual information about AI design and ethics. However first it would be looked at by extremely simple computers (in faraday cages and destroyed after the fact, despite them already having been cleared to not be hackable via this sort of input [I would have very large competitions to make sure at the very least no human could hack it just via the text input]) these would automatically destroy the message if it contained too much emotional language and didn't fit the strict style/structural requirements I would impose on myself in the future. The computers would then automatically translate it into a message just similar enough to the original to be understood in content, but hopefully different enough to diffuse some potential brain hacking danger. The original message would never be seen by any humans obviously, that's the whole point of these memetic precautions.\\
Then I would have some very good loyal codebreakers (who also definitely don't have the resources to bootstrap an AI and passed the same qualifications as my earlier people) look at the resulting info, in increasingly larger pieces in order to tease out any hidden dangers.\\
Then I would have loyal AI people actually look at it and figure out what it means in order to start my own AI project. Plus I would also make the stuff about AI goal alignment public and award massive prizes for finding flaws (of course if any flaws /were/ found then I'm scrapping the whole thing and changing my precommitments to start everything over since I have to assume everything is compromised)

Also keep in mind I would have a pseudo-world domination, as in nobody knows i'm involved, but I have convinced the world that pinhole portals is operated by some alien intelligence who causes mass destruction if world governments don't comply with his orders. However I would also use this ability to provide the world with free power, though the logistics would be difficult though worth it, (just read my answer for how that whole plan works).\\
Suffice to say I can force world governments to do whatever I want but can't risk anything that too obviously benefits myself.

Ok finally keep in mind I would already have developed the original AI (in the simulation) with the whole world's resources and intelligence behind the problem. So i'm getting the message back from basically the best possible future for FAI, so if that reality is compromised, then we probably had no chance in the first place (it would also imply that in real life we are ~100% f**ked). Though I'd like to think my safeguards with the message would still decrease risk by another few percent (which given the stakes is massive).

See I still don't think me being the cause of the portals seems a very likely option, even if it only requires minimal effort to test via nanotech brain scanning I just think the priors would still be so utterly low it wouldn't consider it. After all it would need to calculate expected utility from that, since unlike a human it doesn't do things without good reason, and I just don't see that being plausible. It seems far more likely that the existence of the portals causes it to think it's in some sort of simulation, but thinking a human in the simulation is responsible just seems unlikely. Still i'm not exactly counting on that thus all the other precautions.\\
As for people finding out I am responsible for the portals: having already read that article I don't think it seems likely I would leave enough evidence to trace back to me. Remember I'm not doing anything that directly benefits me others could trace back. I'm not sure how a portal that pulses morse code messages and destroys massive areas of value, if governments don't do what it tells them could be traced back to me, of course I would make sure I didn't avoid targets that might be slightly disadvantageous to me to hit (for instance no withdrawing investments from a country before I attack it in retaliation for it not following my orders).

Yes I have to assume that's the case, but nonetheless I have to try anyway, after all what's the alternative?. Of course even the scheme I thought of would probably not be what I would ultimately go with, since I would be able to draw upon the best geniuses in the world at this sort of thing in order to find the optimal human conceivable solution. Still I think the solution would probably contain all the elements I had already elaborated on, such as passing the info through a crude computer first that changes as much as possible while still letting it keep enough meaning to be useful, and tossing out any message that isn't exclusively a dry description of facts.\\
Still I have a fair degree of confidence that this would vet out most hostile superintelligences, since I don't think GAI is just magic and I think it would need more interaction with people to control them than these precautions would allow. Plus I wouldn't be sending back enough info for someone to get a source code from, I would purposely limit myself to maybe a megabyte of extremely compressed info. After all looking at the size of my ebooks that would be sufficient to contain all the info I need (with extreme compression).

Anyway given the coercive power of the portals I would probably just make sure I developed ems first. That way I could just copy myself and then solve the presumably easier problem of maintaining values as you increase intelligence. After all it seems a terrible idea to risk any moral structure that might diverge from my own, especially since I don't think human morality converges and that socially liberal values are not somehow at the core of human moral instincts. I have this terrible fear that at the core of human ethics is horrifyingly authoritarian tribalism and that liberal values are not what a FAI would see as optimal for "human flourishing", hell even the vast majority of liberals seem to be fine with bans on extremely harmful drugs and other laws meant to take away people's right's "for their own good".

It might be that you genuinely are the first to discover it for some special reason (not too great a stretch to go from one of a few billion to one of a hundred billion). It might be that historically a handful have discovered it, and it was observed and recorded, but those recordings were dismissed as false by later scholars as legerdemain. It might be that the few who discovered it kept it secret themselves, either for fear of their own safety (from the local religious or governing body), or out of greed (e.g. they could more effectively manipulate people in secret). It might be there's some filter at play -- exposure to magical particles gives you super cancer and you're actually about to die. It might be that other forms of /magic/ have been discovered in the past, but that knowledge /was/ widely disseminated and is now in popular use (e.g. electricity magic by the likes of Maxwell, Faraday, and others, disease magic by the wizards Jenner and Pasteur, etc.).

Anyway, assuming the masquerade is real and has powers not far beyond the levels of a world government (and not, say, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a2ooz/rt_the_randi_prize_short/][James Randi]]), I'd probably want to take extensive, incontrovertible documentation as to my ability to perform magic (preferably with an eye toward anonymity), encrypt it really well (maybe not /too/ well), spread those documents far and wide, preferably to millions (with subtle uses of magic, I might be able to get really, really popular), and then have some simultaneous global release of the decryption key.

Yeah this is a problem with the OP's backstory I am seeing now. I would say at minimum the Masquerade needs at least one of several capabilities to explain the secrecy:

- Near immortality: Older powerful members conventionally leverage wealth and resources to maintain the masquerade. Extremely wealthy non-magical people might get let in, in exchange for their wealth and influence and helping maintain the masquerade.

- Mind Manipulation: The members use memory erasure or manipulation to maintain the masquerade. The advantage of being able to manipulate the non-magicals explains why they both keep secret to maintain their power and how the solve issues with the masquerade that memory erasure doesn't.

- Precognition: To prevent leaks of the masquerade before they happen.

- Some inherent power to their secrecy. Like if magic gets weaker the more power that use or if the magic gets stronger the rarer it is used. Any magic user that learns this rule will be at least partly motivated to restrict its spread.

********* Just to clarify really quickly, I didn't mean that the encrypted packages would be files titled secretEncryptedMagicInformation.txt or whatever and think there would be plenty of ways to get info out sneakily. For example, I just converted the text of Terry Pratchett's book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maskerade][/Maskerade/]] into binary, which I used to construct the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_image][binary image]] seen [[https://i.imgur.com/BbjhRoM.png][here]]. I then took a square from a poster from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masquerade_(2012_film)][2012 Korean film /Masquerade/]] (seen [[https://i.imgur.com/IqAry1T.jpg][here]]) and overlaid the former with 5% opacity on top of the latter to produce [[https://i.imgur.com/SXIIxl9.jpg][this image]]. It would be pretty trivial, I think, to return the first image from the second and third (I exported as PNG, a lossless format), and should be just as trivial to use 1% opacity or less (I went with 5% for the change to be noticeable to the naked eye, but not otherwise distinctive -- it just looks a bit grainier). And then returning the original binary string and converting it back into English from /that/ image is a task for the first couple months of an intro to programming class (as in I recall doing something similar to learn image I/O basics).

Of course, the text of the Pratchett book was not at all encrypted, but it easily could be made to be. And then it would /really/ just look like extra noise.

So, with your popularity, you could have a few hundred thousand people around the world download a bunch of images, some of which are duplicates of each other with occasionally very subtle graininess (hiding the actual info in one image and the cypher in another, say). Then, announce in some public, widely accessible place that you've hidden a secret binary message in your images, and that you can find the key in those two images of a lock you posted a week ago (one is pretty grainy, you say with a wink ;]). That info is short and easy to disseminate, and you'll already have a bajillion copies of your demasqueradement floating around. Hell, offer a decent cash prize to really motivate people. You can do this with the "scavenger hunt cover story" to get people primed first, or just go straight for disseminating secret magic knowledge.

And I spent all of 10 minutes thinking about how to do this and then doing it -- I'm sure someone with actual training in cryptography, information security, etc. would be able to come up with something much more sophisticated.

  An obvious conclusion is that an unknown and powerful entity prevents the knowledge from spreading.

  You do not know who or what runs the Masquerade, what purposes it pursues, by what means it is maintained.

  You want to make magic publically known, even if that will cost you your life: it could be that useful to humanity.

  What is the best possible course of actions?
#+end_quote

The best possible course of action? Find out why the masquerade has been maintained for so long and at such great probable cost and inconvenience.

Before you go disseminating this knowledge it might be a very good idea to rule out such possible explanations as:

Certain higher dimensional entities can sense the use of magic, and find that sensation intensely irritating. Having more than about ten thousand magic users living at any one time is enough to give Yog-Sothoth a headache (hypersphereache?), a circumstance which will shortly after result in the extinction of all life on Earth. See Case Nightmare Green, Nightmare Pink, and Nightmare Chartreuse for more information. See summery file "We're All Going To Die Horribly" for a discussion of the most promising ideas on how to fight or hide from Yog-Sothoth. See companion file "And It's All Your Fault, You Monster," for a discussion of the most positive possible outcomes of making magic public. See file "Burial Arrangements After Researcher Suicide Epidemic" for contact information and current locations of the research team that worked on these reports.

*** The other alternative to the Masquerade is that some hidden variable, like say the background level of magic available or the accessibility of the astral plane, and that this variable has changed very recently by a significant amount. You can confirm or rule out this possibility just by waiting a year or two and seeing if anything changes with your magic or other people come out with magic.

How easily can magic be awakened/activated in a person? Viral YouTube video hitting just the right audience to rapidly spread could catch the Masquerade off guard. Alternatively, disguise yourself as a fake Occultist, (IRL, people already believe magic) but give enough hints of real knowledge that your online followers have a decent chance of discovering magic themselves.

Things to check before you go full out spreading magic: how likely is it that magic can allow precognition? How easy is it for magic users to detect other magic users? I think these two questions heavily alter the strategy you want to try.

Pretending to be a false positive, /just/ false enough to pass scrutiny? Interesting idea, and one I hadn't thought of myself.

Somewhat similar to [[/u/captainNematode][u/captainNematode]]'s 'encrypted packages scavenger hunt', with the cult's leader releasing the 'package' and then letting the followers figure out the 'key' for themselves, except the Masquerade's knowledge of magic would play against them here: they wouldn't be able to tell if an uninformed person is capable of figuring out magic from your teachings, since they themselves know it and all necessary insights already. And I think that tactic might be esoteric enough for the Masquerade to not have a preplanned countermeasure against. Neat.

Well, I would add the caveat that if there is magic in your world you should think about how real life Occult teachings interact with it historically. Like for example, in Nasuverse/Type-Moon (the setting of Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Grand Order) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus][Paracelsus]] (a real life alchemist) run into trouble with the Magus assocation. I think [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky][Helena Blavatsky]] also ran into issues with them. My head-canon is that the techniques to open magic circuits stayed secret, so the most that anyone could reverse engineer out of their writings would be really weak formalcraft rituals. Anyway, you need to decide whether real life occultist don't exist in your setting, or if they are totally wrong to the point of being ignored by the masquerade, or if the have some traces of technique but were still somehow allowed to release knowledge into the public (maybe the most key secrets were removed or obfuscated). Or maybe they were powerful magic users who struggled to release bits of knowledge here and there even as the Masquerade ran a disinformation campaign against them to discredit them as frauds and charlatans.

*** Since the masquerade hasn't yet been broken, it follows that other people's attempts to disseminate magic have been suppressed. Anything /you/ can think up is something that one of those other people would have thought up, and therefore would be suppressed too. There's nothing you can do that works.

Most questions of this sort assume you have some special ability or are in some special position, and ask what you can do based on that. This question /sounds/ like it's putting you in a special position, but since the point of comparison is "other people who have found out that magic exists", it really isn't.

** Ashkatic Records Access: You have limited access to the lifelogs the computational substrate of the universe keeps on humanity.

Specifically, you can experience as super vivid dreams the first hand experiences of everyone who's life record is out of copyright, as per the berne convention.

You need the following things: To uniquely identify the person you wish to "stream" and the timestamps of the chunks of time you want to experience. You cannot fast forward, nor can you experience a longer period of time in one setting than you normally sleep. Replay does not interfere with rest - you wake up like from normal sleep, but you also cannot control the experience while it's happening - if you pick someone that got burned alive on the time chosen, you will have a really bad night. You don't get the internal monologue of the people you ride, but you do get a full sensory feed.

I could at least look for any lost spanish treasure galleons that are still undiscovered, since we know the basic time period when they went missing. Of course I might end up having to experience drowning, which wouldn't be fun.

Obviously I could recover many historical documents and solve historical mysteries, but then I'd have to explain how I did it. I'd also go back and see what religious figures actually said, and if it is anywhere close to what they are attributed as saying.

I could solve murders / crimes but that would not be a fun experience...

*** Confirm lucid dreaming does not work. Be careful not to make public that you exist, for someone might want you dead. Perhaps acquire anonymity and open an internet service, this could be worth a lot of money, more than I would guess you could gain from finding treasures. Sleep seconds at a time to search important times. Make sure you don't die, for your existence allows future AGIs to resurrect everyone who ever died depending on how identity works. Maybe also depending on your interface to the power: Can you say "the last person to die before 1950", "the second last person to die before 1950", etc.? Can you say "the nth last person to die before 1950" where n is defined using uncomputable functions, solving ludicrously beyond the halting problem?

** You have a one shot conceptual veto. It's effects are absolute in the scope that it's used. If you use it to overrule a local town from passing a law requiring dogs to wear leashes in the park, that town will never pass a law requiring dogs to wear a leash in the park. If you stop the US congress from outlawing gay marriage, gay marriage will never be illegal in the United States, etc.

**** If I am interpreting it correctly, I think the "supernatural" effect only applies to peoples' perceptions and acceptance of it as law. Everyone will agree that this is a law and the law enforcement will enforce it, but people are still capable of breaking it as a crime. The supernatural force isn't going to come in and prevent or punish people who break it.

And anything difficult to measure such as "more harm than good" would be open to interpretation. If it's not a crime to negotiate in ill faith whenever the greater good is at stake, there would have to be some sort of committee or standards for measuring this when prosecuting violators of this law.

It could work, it would probably be better a world without this law but it's not a cut and dry solution to all the words problems.

** Meta question... what is the optimal level of Munchkinability? When is it most fun to munchkin? For example, I find when it is too easy to find a path to reality warping/omnipotence in a CYOA it is boring. When the powers are all super strictly limited though, it also makes things boring. When there are missions/drawbacks that make the path to omnipotence risky in an interesting way I find this funner. Or when you have to be really clever about exploiting and combining quirks of different powers to get a good combination that requires a bunch of conditions to take advantage of.

*** I think it's similar to humor, in that it's a feeling which is difficult to describe exactly, but unexpected and clever things are relevant. "An anonymous donor deposits one thousand dollars into your bank account every week, what do you do with this money?" is about as interesting a munchkinry as "A man hits another man on the head with a baseball bat" is as a joke.

It's the unexpected and nonobvious exploitations that are interesting and entertaining both for you to think of, and for other people to read about. Also, ones you haven't seen before. Using teleportation to earn money by shipping goods to far places quickly isn't interesting because we've already heard of it and/or thought of it, as it's one of the exploits that comes to mind immediately. But it could be more interesting if there are specific ideas like illegal goods, espionage, or emergency care (could you set up a 911 emergency base where you teleport people to the hospital and save lives? Would the millitary pay to rescue wounded soldiers by teleporting them?) For that matter, would the millitary pay you to teleport bombs to target locations?

More specific details that people haven't necessarily thought of before are more interesting, and it's also interesting when people who have specific knowledge about, say, the economics of these actions and how much value they could provide based on the actual mechanics of the power. You can learn something interesting about the real world in the context of a thought experiment.
