So the s8e3 The Long Night features a classic zombie attack vs fortress storyline. While the episode was cinematic and intense, we can all agree that the military strategy against the zombies was dismal at best. As such, given the parameters and resources as stated in the show, how would you as a leader in the war room, propose a better strategy to increase the odds of humans winning?

A secondarily question, as the night king of zombies, how will you utilize your resources rationally to win this battle and end humanity once and for all?

Your resources: 1. Approximately 2-4 weeks planning/ building / weapons creating. 2. several wagons of obsidian 3. 2 fire breathing dragons that can be controlled by two dragon riders. At least one of the dragon riders is fireproof. Dragons need to be “ridden” or within hearing distance in order for psychic link between rider and dragon to work and dragon to do complex tasks. 4. several thousand Calvary Dothraki warriors 5. several thousand fearless phalanx trained foot soldiers 6. a couple hundred untrained able bodied men 7. 1 standard medieval castle 8. knowledge that a single cut with obsidian or Valyrian steel is enough to break the magic of the zombie and kill it permanently. Zombies can not swim and can be stopped by setting entire body on fire. Otherwise they are extremely good at taking blunt force damage and will not stop unless whole body is destroyed. 9. have questionable knowledge that if the night king is killed then all zombies will die but definite knowledge if a white walker is killed all zombies made by white walker will die. 10. two fire mages that can set things on fire given enough time for spells to be cast. 11. one wizard that can warg into any animal and can see all of the past and the present. 12. questionable knowledge that the night king is weirdly obsessed with the three eyed raven and may or may not seek him out to kill personally. 13. and of course, one super Assassin with the special power to change her face and hide anywhere. 14. trebuchets, catapults, and archers 15. a small group of pirates that are known for their knack in sailing and archery ( the ironborn) 16. about 5-6 master swordsmen ( Brienne, Jaime , pod etc. )

Zombie resources: 1) several hundred thousand fearless undying mindless shock troops, up to and including undead animals and giants that have been stockpiled over a century. 2) the ability to raise the dead and turn them into part of your army. 3) one zombie fire breathing dragon. 4) approximately a dozen sentient, capable warriors with slightly superhuman strength, reflexes and speed. ( white walkers) 5) ability to bring a mild to medium snow storm 6) night King has ability to know where the humans greatest intelligence asset (bran) is at all times.

Edit: sorry for any spoilers. Have flaired it now. Added resources


** My perspective is that the entire battle was a mistake on the part of the Night King. The defenders have extremely limited resources and essentially non-existent supply potential. It seems like setting up a siege in which the Undead characteristics of the Zombies could be most effectively leveraged against the living need for resources and lack of internal discipline would be the most efficient way to dispose of the inhabitants of Winterfell. This approach also has an advantage in that it cannot be countered by the ridiculous intelligence asset that is Bran. Knowing that the Night King has sent out his forces to kill every living thing within close march of Winterfell in order to make it impossible for the defenders to resupply doesn't provide any solution to the lack of food and the inevitable disintegration of unity that will occur once everyone starts starving to death.

There is also the fact that the Night King should not have been anywhere near the battlefield. His control radius is undefined but logic dictates that it must be absolutely massive if it is not totally unlimited. If the Night King had simply waited out the battle in a defended location far from any concentration of enemy forces than this would have been an easy victory. Arya is incredibly skilled but her infiltration ability revolves around her ability to take on the form of the people that she killed. There really isn't any way for her to get in a position where she can kill the Night King as long as he avoids the chaos of battle and takes the reasonable precaution of having a guard of White Walkers.

*** This is a solid, logical strategy that does not account for Dany and her dragons, whom could have, with enough time, incinerated any massed undead enforcing a siege. Incineration is a complete loss of resources for the Night King, and could have theoretically caused any engagement without a counter present to become a net loss by its nature. The only potential counters the Night King had for dragon fire, barring any mistakes on Dany's part (like landing her god damn dragon in the middle of an active melee), were the Night King himself and his converted dragon (which was not especially effective in practice.)

So, at some point, the Night King did have to force a battle, and participate in it as a counter to Dany's dragons. And after Dany's dragons were down, the Night King would have essentially won, so why would he wait to claim his prize? It's not like he knows Arya is a magic goddamn ninja assassin.

- Note that although the Night King's Wights may have had some spear chucking dragon-counter potential, this was not demonstrated in the series to my knowledge. Closest we got was spear-caddy-Wight.

- The side-strategy you've proposed of 'Spread Out and Kill Everything' is a solid, and would likely be the most destructive possible strategy, but it would seem the Night King put a higher value on killing Bran than spreading undeath. So that was a no go. I'd also argue that this strategy would leave the Night King's assets vulnerable to roaming (human) warbands and Bran's omniscience. The 'Command from Afar' strategy you've proposed would have the same weakness.

Attacking puts pressure on her to do many things at once, address the most pressing strategic objectives, and possibly strain her dragon to the point of exhaustion. And even if she survives, if she can't prevent the zombies from killing everyone else (say, Sansa, Tyrion, and most importantly Bran) that's not much good for her.

*** I'm not really sure if the Night King is capable of doing anything more complex than a direct attack. His backstory is unclear, but he seems to have been created by the children of the forest to kill humanity. Effectively he's a magic version of an unfriendly AI, but without the ability to grow his intelligence, just to grow his army.

As far as I remember he hasn't done anything strategically clever in the series that hints he has a full human mind going on. The smartest trick he ever pulled out was to kill the dragon with the ice spear. I think he is better understood as a force of nature kind of villain, whatever intelligence he has is secondary to his overriding need to destroy humanity.

Also, For untold centuries his strategy of massive wight army has been successful, so he has had no reason to innovate even if thats possible.

** The whole episode was a clusterfuck where everything was so... ugh. edit: I should add spoiler warning, I guess?

I am going to approach this a bit differently because your premise is not without a flaw. [If I, as a Night King, have /literally/ infinite zombies, then the answer is simple: assault the fortress with infinite zombies, until everyone succumbs to sleep deprivation. Okay, the zombies aren't /really/ infinite. Well, then siege the castle until everyone starves, gg easy]

So the problem, I think, is that the writers tried too hard to paint a bleak picture and screwed the pacing. To give you a perspective, it takes about seventeen minutes from the Dothraki charge to lighting up the trench /[okay, as a side note about that. I remember just a week ago someone said that the Dothraki charge would be the stupidest thing possible, because duh, zombies have no morale. And OF COURSE, this is exactly what happens. WHYYY. Ahem, moving on.]/ So they fight in the open for almost twenty minutes. And the castle walls are breached in... three minutes. Three.

Just. What.

But that's not the worst part. After the walls have been breached, /they survive for another 35 minutes/. HOW.

So the better half of the episode is basically nonsensical running around the castle, and important characters don't die left and right. I could /almost/ hear the Benny Hill theme during the library scene. It seemed so offkey.

Instead of this, the damn castle walls should've not been breached until the last 7-10 minutes. This would be a rough outline:

1:00-10:00: buildup as it was. Melissandre does her thing. Dothraki are in reserve.

10:00-20:00 first clash, as it was sans the charge. Edd lives (for now)

20:00-30:00 retreat&trench shenanigans, Edd dies.

30:00-35:00 zombies try the walls and are methodically slaughtered. Not a single soldier dies, morale is high

35:00-40:00 white walkers act as some bullshit artillery to crush walls with magic. Dothraki charge (from the flank), both units are wiped out

40:00-50:00 more zombie slaughter, this time with casualties because walls are damaged, undead giants bla bla bla. Mormont girl does not get a kill and dies (seriously, stupidity must be punished). Let the man with the best beard do the giantslaying. Berric dies. Aerial battle starts (it looked very good, when they went above the clouds, should've used that imagery some more)

50:00-60:00 Castle defense starts to crumble. Aerial battle intensifies.

60:00-70:00 NK (crash)lands, raises the dead, chaos ensues. Crypt shenanigans.

70:00-75:00 Grove scene, Theon dies defending, not charging like an idiot.

75:00-the end. NK dies, outro continues as it was.

** Defense: Flee. There's no hope to stop them, lay as many traps as possible to kill as much as you can. Dragons ignite everything flammable, force the undead to slow down or burn. Fast retreat, as much food as able to carry. If you trade lives, you lose. Get to the Vale, the Twins, any place with massive geographic defenses besides 16 foot high walls. Harrenhall, if it's possibly repaired. There's no way their leader will show up until everyone is dead besides Bran.

The dead will chase, make them suffer. Slow them in any manner possible. Elderly, children, they're lost. The North is lost.

Once a proper base is secured: prepare to burn it and flee as soon as a breach occurs. The Vale doesn't have this luxury, but should be best to defend. Your best bet is to spread the enemy army and guerrilla fight it. Every victory is a retreat, since your location is always known at that point. Find the White Walkers and Arya those bastards.

And for God's sake, armor the Dragons against ice spears.

Undead army: Night King stays comfortable at home, the range is apparently able to hit King's Landing. Spread the force thin. For every town or lightly defended castle: surge and kill. For every well fortified location: what's one more year. Surround and wait. Maintain visual on the two dragons, and keep the White Walkers in groups that can't be hit. Send the recently deceased further south, as traps for refugees or those whom are kind. Find graveyards. Ten wights snuck in King's Landing is over 800,000 more wights, after losses.

If they perform guerrilla tactics, circle them. Shoulder to shoulder, tear down trees. White Walkers where fighting occurs. The only survivors are babies and pregnant women, to increase White Walker ranks.

Even dragons eat. Nothing lives. Salt the earth if desired.

You would lose the northern armies, (which admittedly was not a lot) as they wouldn't abandon their families, but you would have the unsullied and Dothraki who could have retreated south with the bought time and found some proper walls. A battle would be forced by the night king pretty fast though.

I mean, there's a difference between "effective military strategy" and "ruthless plan to maximise the odds of victory no matter the cost". Usually you want to win /for the sake of something/; if you sacrifice huge chunks of that something, there comes a point where victory becomes meaningless. The objective is to save human lives, not to kill the Night King because we don't like his face, and sacrifices be damned. Have you read/watched The Promised Neverland? There's an interesting dilemma they face that's very similar to this one.

** It all depends on how many zombies the night king has. Or more importantly, how many you think he has. There just really isn't a good strategy for dealing with potentially infinite numbers of zombies. Or even just a few hundred thousand.

The only really viable one is neutralizing the opposing dragon and hiding behind walls while your dragons burn as many as possible. If you ever get into a situation where your soldiers are fighting zombies hand to hand, you've lost. It's just simply not possible for a single soldier to kill zombies in the 1000-1 ratio that would be required short of having something like the Wall.

It might be possible to mine the entire field. If you could wait till a huge chunk of zombies are all on the field in front of the castle and set the entire thing on fire at once, you might be able to kill enough of them to make a difference.

There's also the problem that I don't think all those troops and horses will fit in the castle at once. I think they were forced to marshall in the field since otherwise they would have just been packed like cattle in the courtyard and been unable to fight if the walls were breached.

** Considering /last/ season was a list of how-not-to-do-ancient combat (Off the top of my head mounted troops cornering spearmen on a hill and winning, giants running up and kicking things instead of tossing spears or cabers, etc), it should be no surprise the combat in this one wasn't very rational either.

But nevermind that, I want to be a rational villain. So, pretending I'm an undying necromancer fey with massive amounts of resources listed above, what would be my strategy? Note: I use the term White Walker for the fey creatures of the Night King, not the Zombies.

1. *Dragon*. I have a dragon. An undead, blue-flame-breathing dragon that doesn't need food or sleep. Unlike the real dragons, which need meat or the ability to forage for it, mine doesn't really care about any of those things, and can just circle the place from the air for an indefinite period.

   It will be my Chariot. I shall ride upon its back, ready to infuse it with necromantic energy should it be wounded, and use it to provide me a bird's eye view of the battlefield so that I can direct my troops. In addition, I will be carrying at least four archers, strapped and/or hanging from its legs, who will snipe targets below me when in range. The Dragon will never fly into bow range of the enemy troops, but my archers can shoot just fine. Depending on carrying capacity, it may also be carrying a tree branch or two as a giant caber, one end dipped in water then frozen to serve as a bomb to deal with enemy siege engines and/or massed troops (after the siege is gone). More will be prepared on the ground for if I need to reload. Incidentally, as I am in the air, I don't have to worry about magic ninja assassins. Any flying foes that aren't dragons (warg'ed birds and the like) can be dealt with by the Chariot with its own abilities, or shot at by the archers if they can.

   Should the enemy choose to send an enemy dragon, I will start with the high 'ground' and note its approach. As it struggles to gain altitude, I can choose to either gain more myself until the foe is too tired to fight, or I can choose to cause mine to bank at which point I will throw one of at least three of my prepared dragon-killing ice spears I am carrying. You know, the same kind I used to kill /this/ dragon while it was alive. If that is not an option, and the opponent is somehow faster, I will have my Chariot dive toward it while breathing blue flame. As the dragons must actually breathe the fire, the ascending dragon will have issues as its breathing will be labored while trying to gain altitude. I will not allow mine to stay in a fight, but it will dive beside the foe (giving me another chance at an ice spear) and use its now-superior velocity to head toward one of three pre-prepared landing areas where /White Walkers/ will be ready with more ice lances as a trap for when the foe follows.

2. *Giants*. Unlike the stupid warm meatbags who used these things to walk up to shield walls and kick them, my Giants will be my primary form of assault and team support to my armies. My rank-and-file will strip the land of trees, then they will be crafted into mighty bows, arrows, and spears for my massive minions. Now I have walking siege engines. Each will also have a caber crafted for the purposes of throwing at massed infantry or rolling at any cavalry stupid enough to sally forth and attack them. Yes, the front lines may jump it, but the rest wont, especially if its bounding across the ground. Archer Giants will prioritize enemy dragons, if they appear, followed by enemy archers whose weapons can reach the giant, then enemy cavalry, before anything else. Archery Giants will also carry a backpack wherein an Archer Zombie is placed to serve as a 'tail gunner' in case something sneaks up on the Giant itself.

The two biggest Giants, however, will have a different use. Some of those trees will go to make a mighty mantlet, a portable wall of tree trunks all strapped and nailed together to be carried by said giant on its back. As it is not alive, it has no pride to insult, and so it will slowly walk backwards from my army toward the enemy, serving as a piece of mobile cover from which a lieutenant White Walker and its zombie minions will assault the foe. These attacks will be coordinated, with the siege giants attacking any enemy ranged weapon wielders when they show up to attack the walking walls. Once they reach the walls of the castle, the Walking Walls will pull loose the straps that attach the wall to their back and push up against it with their hands until it falls over onto the castle wall, forming a 'ramp' for use by the assault force. At this point they will run as quickly as possible back to my armies to grab another such wall or for later deployment as necessary. Good luck to the defenders if they try to push the ramp off, as it weighs far more than what most humans can manage, especially while fighting for their lives.

1. *Animals*. While the forests were being clear-cut for 2, the White Walkers were being sent to kill every single living creature they could get their hands on. The smaller, the better. Those mice and badgers hiding in their dens from the cold? Dead. Insects, spiders, slumbering serpents, rats, whatever. I don't care. Everything dies. This serves two purposes... the first is that it denies the enemy Warg any useful intelligence. The second is that it creates terror troops.\\

All animals encountered will be slain and brought back to be processed into Zombies. They will then be 'fed' to the primary assault Zombies (the ones that storm the walls), filling up their stomachs and esophagi to the brim. The Assault Zombies will, of course, be ordered not to chew. Whenever the Assault Zombies are slain by dragonglass, the tiny zombie animals will be released immediately to spread chaos into the enemy ranks. It is much harder to hit a swarm of insects and/or rats than it is to hit a single zombie. If the Assault Zombies are killed normally, the animals will dig and claw their way out, possibly resulting in there being a time delay for them to do so during which the enemy has moved on and the tiny, much more dangerous Zombies, can attack everywhere else. If it's possible to give them 'programmed commands', all the tiny creatures will go toward the food stores if they can sense them (rats should be able to do this just fine), then go into 'stalking' mode for any living that are around.

Any big animals or ones with better movement methods will be saved for their potential combat role. Bears join the siege, birds used to distract or assault enemy archers and/or go after living birds and carry them back, etc, etc. If there are enough of them, they can simply be sent as a disposable wave once the Mantlets have been converted into ramps.

1. *White Walkers*. My sapient fey lieutenants will serve to enforce my will and ensure that the battle goes as close as its can to the existing plan. White Walkers will have a buddy and always travel in groups of two or three. Depending on total number, there will be at least two groups for offense, and three groups for defense. The defense groups are also where my 'dragon landing zones' and aerial ammo stockpiles are located. All White Walkers will carry at least two dragon-piercing ice lances and a hunting horn at all times. Dragons and plucky heroes are their main targets. If they face a foe they can't handle or one of the group is slain, they are to blow the horn and attempt to escape. I will reinforce from Chariot's back.

2. *Snow storm magic*. This exists for two purposes. At first, it is held in reserve for the off chance that the enemy decides to use *both* dragons at once against my Chariot. Again, as they are mortal and mine is not, they will quickly succumb to the elements while I play keep away. If their controller is wise, they will retreat and the battle continues. If not, then as soon as its obvious that they are unable to put up much of a fight, they will get attacked, downed, and converted into minions.

Assuming the foe spends a long time and doesn't use both dragons, then this will be the second stage of the siege if the first fails. The snow will be continued for absolutely as long as possible, while the second wave of undead slowly low-crawl beneath it until the entire area around the castle moat is a Zombie Minefield. An obvious, though smaller force than before will be sent to attack the castle (or fake a parlay), and when the enemy rides or otherwise comes out, the ground will rise up. If they don't take the bait, a conventional attack is started and once the enemy is committed, the entire area rises up and attacks from all directions at once while the aerial bombardment begins.

--------------

Using this strategy, there's really very few options for the defenders other than retreat. There are just too many options for the Undead, when used properly, that the living can't counter. Yes, magical insta-kill weaponry is nice, but it doesn't matter too much when you are having trees dropped on you from above while being shot with sharpened telephone poles by enemy giants or swarmed by zombies that explode into /even worse zombies/ when slain, not to mention the whole issue of trying to purge the food stores once the animal zombies get in. The living can really only use a hit-and-run strategy that employs the dragons as cover to stop things from getting out of hand, but even they need to eat and rest.

Ideally in an armored, fireproof, crash-proof hollow disguised to look like heavy plate. Any opposing force which manages to get a good look at your dragon will assume that you are not personally riding it, and continue to deploy anti-you measures on the battlefield.

Bonus if you can get your White Walkers and any zombies to resemble like you in any way, even if it's just dressing up, making it further unclear where you may actually be.

There may be some advantage to be gained, too, if your dragon 'bombs' the castle with some of your vermin-filled zombies. Or they can be flung from catapults. Up to you if you want to have the outer zombies wrapped in a ball of... I don't know, inflated and sealed water skins?... to cushion the landing and make the bigger zombie able to survive the landing and thus inflict assorted kills/damage afterwards, or at the very least attract the attention of the defenders and pull them away from the walls etc. Might not work if the fire mages or some other fire source can get to your zombies before they explode, though. (Less of an issue on the battlefield proper.)

**** The Chariot has limited carrying capacity. I choose to use that for offense, rather than bothering with unnecessary defense. It is out of bowshot, and trebuchets and the like can't be aimed 'up', so there's no real need to bother with armor.

In addition, I am on /top/ of it and all the enemy will see is the bottom. They will likely infer I am up there, but I've already got this covered. If the Chariot has been up-armored or obviously enhanced, it's even more of a clue where I am.

I don't care about body doubles. My goal is to lure out the only weapons that can feasibly defeat me--the enemy Dragons. Everything else is secondary. I can lose my entire Zombie army and it be worth it if I can take the enemy's dragons away and convert them. The White Walkers are using the buddy system, so any visits from ninja assassin girls will result in one being iced before said girl gets shanked by the other or its coterie of minions.

Aerial bombing with infested Assault Zombies is a /marvellous/ idea, though, thanks! Don't even have to worry about it too much as most of the physical damage done to a living creature from falling is meaningless. Just have to ensure that they spread-eagle on the way down to increase drag and prevent snapping of the 'long bones' (those in the arms and legs) so that the limbs are still useful after impact.

*EDIT*: After consideration, it's possible the enemy might Warg might try some shenanigans with birds (like having crows carry pieces of obsidian to scratch at Chariot). Ergo, half of all birds (and all bats) I have my minions kill will travel around Chariot providing air cover. The bats will serve as perfect short-range target acquisition for anything really small that somehow made it up there without being seen. May even send a couple with each White Walker once the presence of a stealth assassin is confirmed.

*** Total domination. I like it. The only flaw is that your non sapient zombies can't be ordered to do anything complicated like crafting or archery and etc. they really only have one mode and that's run and kill vs vs standing still. So you would have to have your walkers doing those things and you only have a little over a dozen of them. And if you want your dragon to be doing complicated things as you mentioned, you have to be personally spend the brain energy to order it constantly.

**** Thank you.

I've seen the Zombies use weapons in the show before, so it's not that hard to pass out axes and have them chop trees. I've seen them drag bodies in the show before, so it's not hard to command them to drag the trees. Attacking the ends to make spears and such seems relatively not-difficult, the weapons made for Giants can be crude so long as they are functional. I suppose the 'intelligent' crafting will have to be left to the White Walkers... *or*... I can 'convince' captured warm bodies to do it for me. I'd need a way to grow more troops over time in case things go bad anyway, shouldn't be too hard to find some quislings who value their life over their honor or somesuch. After the fight is over, they can be put on the equivalent of a 'reservation' to produce goods (and, over time, more potential troops/craftsmen). I'm an Undead monstrosity, after all, so I don't really value them as people.

I will be riding my Chariot. No reason I can't spend brain energy commanding it when its the lynchpin of my plan and will be doing most of the work--and, you know, I will be on top of it using it for cover and visibility.

** I love defensive strategy, and I'll take a crack at this one. Going to make some assumptions in mine, steal some ideas and insert some of my own. Note that the below are /assumptions/, not assertions. Changes to them will change the scenario dramatically.

1. *Defenders can't run*. Maybe they can't outrun the horde or maybe they aren't willing to abandon the North; either way, the scenario is defending Winterfell, not the surrounding countryside.
2. *Attackers can't siege*. Maybe the dragons and Bran's omniscience are too much of a threat for a protracted war. Maybe Bran gets more powerful over time. Either way, the Night King wants to win this fight /now./
3. *Animals have limits*. Zombie animals are somehow more difficult to control or create than zombie humans, to the point where it's not worth it to animate rats etc. If this is not true, then I think the humans just lose, period (but see Bonus below, for speculation).
4. *Obsidian has limits.* It takes more than a sliver of dragonglass to outright deanimate a zombie. Not /much/ more; any kind of moderate to severe wound, but not a mere scratch. This matches more closely what we see in the show. Zombie giants and dragons take proportionally more killing. (Although this /would/ explain where all the undead giants and mammoths went...they got pecked by ravens with little obsidan beak covers! Or nicked by an obsidian arrow!).\\

I use these assumptions because they make the battle more of a true siege fight and less of a contest in exploiting loopholes. They needn't be true, but they do balance things nicely. Now to the fun stuff.

*/Preparations/*

*Obsidian:* I have a limited amount of obsidian, so I will minimize the amount that gets used as projectiles until I've armed all my troops with it. In a fight like this, arrows get one shot, spears get lots of stabbing. In rough order of priority: my walls get a ring of obsidian spikes in downward-facing strips at the top; any undead deanimated by them will fall to the ground below. Infantry get spears and /pikes/, as long and durable as we can make them. Cavalry get obsidian-tipped spears and, if possible, their mounts get obsidian horseshoes. They also get knives to stab undead who grab their horses. Some heavy infantry like the Unsullied also get short swords, making them a cross between a phalanx and a legion. Wooden shields get small obsidian spikes in strategic places, as does armor if possible. Some shields also get a row of obsidian on the bottom, for bashing down on crawling, not-quite-incapacitated undead. Some may also get obsidian shards at the front or bottom of their boots for similar purposes. Obsidian crampons, yay! After all this is handled, any extra shards get made into arrowheads. If I can manage a few ballista bolts, so much the better for giant-sniping or dragon-shooting, though I don't think I have ballistas or the knowledge of how to make them. I'm tempted to implant obsidian flakes in my troops, but medieval medical knowledge renders this unlikely to work out well for me.

*Traps and Defenses:* Unless the all-seeing magic dude tells me it's a bad idea for magic reasons, I abandon the Godswood and wall it off from the castle. It's too isolated to properly defend, and the trees give cover for undead attacks unless I'm willing to set them on fire. I dig /several/ fire trenches, with the first one being just close enough to the wall that any ramp-made-of-corpses will fall in the trench before it gets all the way up my wall. Anything flammable and expendable, including furniture, gets commandeered for use as flaming barricade or catapult ammo. Catapults go on the walls or towers, obviously, and never stop firing. With as many undead as the enemy have, I'm actually worried about getting buried in corpses; anything that helps me with that gets top priority after protecting the walls. Mostly it just involves /lots and lots of fire./ Anything flammable enough to be made into a fire arrow becomes one.

*Troop Dispositions:* Cavalry harass and pick off small groups outside the walls. Light infantry with long spears guard the walls. Heavy infantry defend chokepoints where they can phalanx up and hide behind large shields and a wall of obsidian spearpoints. /There are no non-combatants./ (I'm looking at you, crypt-hiders). Any human being who can physically hold a stick tipped with obsidian and poke things with it will do so, because if they don't they will die anyway. Most get at least one spear and at least one dagger. Anyone so old, young, or sick that they cannot move around well enough to fight can hide in a central part of the castle, and even some of /them/ get a knife. A small guard of regular troops can keep an eye on them in case isolated undead get through. This guard is composed mostly of people I can't afford to lose if we /win/ the fight.

I exhume and burn all corpses in the crypt, because I'm not an idiot.

*/Fighting/*

First, a few days out, I harass the dead. Bran helps identify key targets for dragonfire; we do our best to steer clear of wights throwing spears, but we use our dragons to firebomb them whenever possible. We stage a preliminary defense at the aptly-named Last River, the only major river between the Wall and Winterfell.

TaltosDreamer pointed out a lovely use for my cavalry. Guided by Bran and accompanied by my dragons, the Dothraki and any other horsemen or mobile troops I can spare will head to the river. They clear some of the snow away and pack it into makeshift walls, we set up some siege equipment. A few trebuchets and a skeleton (heh) defense, supported by cavalry. When the dead try to cross the frozen river, I dragon them to melt the ice. The Dothraki make passes along the south side of the river, killing any who emerge from the water until the undead manage to cross in large numbers. Maybe the wights re-freeze the river with Magic Ice Powers. If any get within bowshot, though, cavalry archers will send a few volleys of obsidian-tipped arrows at them. When things get too dangerous, we dragonfire the few makeshift catapults and retreat (I have the good ones at Winterfell).

Once at Winterfell: Gates remain closed and as blocked as physically possible once I know the attack is imminent. Cavalry avoid the main siege except to come in as reinforcements; I do not expect them to do well in a protracted fight. Dragons attack /large/ groups, thinning the undead numbers, but most importantly they fly /together/, never losing sight of each other. Fireballs should be visible even in a blizzard. If the frost wyrm shows up, they attack it together, maybe with obsidian claw-tips. Their riders have obsidian-tipped spears to throw.

I put troops on the walls first, inside the castle second. Irregulars guard chokepoints within the castle and runners tell them when and where to retreat, if necessary. I have few archers, because regular arrows do next to nothing against the undead and obsidian ones are hard to come by. But I still have /bows/, and anyone who can use one will be ready to pick one up and shoot at any giants or white walkers that come within range. Fire arrows target giants first, blobs of undead second, corpse-piles third. I light fire-trenches when the assaults on the walls get too thick and I need to slow down undead reinforcements. Hopefully the deanimated burn as well as the animated, and I can burn away much of the piled bodies that will otherwise threaten to bury the defenders. Even if they're not as flammable, dragonfire will do nicely to prevent corpse-ramping, that stuff burns anything.

If the undead take the walls, they probably win, but just in case I'll have a few reserves in the castle proper, ready to use chokepoints to hold off as many undead as possible.

*Bonus*: suppose assumption #3 is false. If the Night King can animate microscopic things as well, just blow some undead parasites into the castle. Dragonglass that, bitches. If he can only animate animals, then I suppose a hundred billion tunneling zombie bugs will do. Who needs a dragon? Either way, humans are doomed. Even with fire and dragons, they just don't have a defense against massive swarms attacking from everywhere. There might not be a ton of bugs in the cold North, but there's enough; and birds and rats cause similar problems, as RynnisOne pointed out.

*** The best part about smart strategy is that it makes it much more cinematically intense when all your carefully laid out plans get overrun one at a time just to the sheer number of zombies. We can still have Arya specifically tasked to assasinate walkers and the night king since it is a known weak spot that if a walker dies, all the zombies it controls die. Hound and Beric can still tragically die getting Arya to the night king and when the castle is breached and all hope is lost and several beloved main characters have died, Arya still gets her hero moment without it seeming like a deux ex machina.

** OK so this is what I would do:

- Break the obsidian into hundreds of thousands of shards and load them onto catapults. Catapult them en masse into the zombie lines. Since even the slightest cut will utterly destroy a zombie, the shards can all be pretty small fragments - it may not be good at penetrating armor, but most of the zombies weren't wearing any face armor anyway.
- Craft a thousand or so repeating crossbows (they're really not that hard to make). This would allow even the untrained to shoot obsidian-tipped bolts at the rate of 6-10 per minute, to take on zombies once they get close.
- Have obsidian shards jutting out from the battlements at close, regular intervals all around the castle walls, such that any zombie trying to climb over them will get cut by one (just like if you were to try climbing over razor wire). Since obsidian disintegrates the zombies, the obsidian will remain in place to cut the next zombie that tries to climb over.
- Arm the melee troops with long chains made out of obsidian shards. Since a single cut from obsidian disintegrates a zombie, swinging such an obsidian chain would allow one to disintegrate dozens of zombies with a single sweep. Have phalanxes of melee troops armed with these weapons and the zombies will all be disintegrated before they can close to melee range.
- Encircle the castle with fields of swords and other scrap metal all within a meter of each other. When the zombies have fully surrounded the castle, use Melisandre's contagious set-metal-on-fire spell to cause all this metal to catch flame, burning any zombies caught in the field.
- Also - keep the gates shut the whole time. Better yet, place a boulder right behind the gates (and have it be half under the ground so it can't be moved at all) so the gates can't be opened no matter how much force gets thrown at it.
- Wrap a whole cache of obsidian shards in a cloth bundle, then stuff it in one of the dragons' mouth. Have that dragon search for the night king then spit out the bag of obsidian shards and at the night king, and blast it with fire. As the cloth burns to scrap and disintegrates while in free-fall, all the obsidian will rain down on the night king as an unavoidable shower of death.

** I thought we had Trebuchet and archers too?

I would have setup an initial battle at a river, long before my castle, with my most mobile troops (calvary) setup to transport my archers and act as defense. Any frozen parts of the river will be unfrozen with one dragon using dragonfire when the ice walkers try to cross, then a few volleys over the river to burn off more zombies.

Meanwhile, the other living dragon will deal with the ice dragon. I would have Bran Warg the other living dragon with the sole intention of luring the ice dragon into a whole company of dragonglass archers/spearmen/fire wizard.

As soon as the ice dragon is down, full retreat guarded with unopposed dragonfire.

At Winterfell, I would have set a group of archers to assassinate white walkers with flaming arrows. My Trebuchets would be on my walls tasked with filling chokepoints with fire.

Bran will be identifying White Walkers and keeping me up to date on my Calvary. Any time he discovers a White Walker, a few volleys from my archers should fix that problem. The fewer intelligent zombies, the better.

Meanwhile my dragons are lighting things on fire unopposed. Never staying still and focusing on areas away from the Night King. The forest would be loaded with any spare cooking oil in key locations to make sure my dragonfire is extra destructive.

I have weeks to prepare, and I need a lot of firewood for zombie burning...I would harvest with an eye towards building criss-crossing roads for some units of the calvary. Their job would be to sweep in groups back and forth after the main army passes to cut into enemy reserves. The endless zombie horde is mostly mindless and the Night King is going to have his smart zombies at the castle to organize the battle. The dragonglass armed calvary should do excellent until their horses get tired. I would likely make the loops extend far enough out the calvary can walk their horses with less worry of being mobbed before charging back in. The outer edges of the loops would have exits back to the far side of the castle for when the enemy figures out a counter to my plan.

The rest of my Calvary would have been drilling so they know the open ground around the castle very well. When a signal goes up, they sweep in to crush the zombies against the castle walls from behind, then they pull out as quickly as possible. This way I can pick a wall and focus charges on that wall if any side is getting over-run.

I would put Arya in charge of a crack assassination unit specifically tasked with finding and killing the Night King. This unit would contain one of my fire wizards.

My phalanx will be spread across the walls to ensure no zombies breach those walls.

Giants are a problem, but a unit of my best javalin throwers would be tasked with spreading around the walls. Their orders will be to take down any giants as quickly as possible.

My enemy doesnt have any seige equipment (unless my dragons and Bran failed to kill the Ice Dragon) So breaches will likely come from giants or massive zombie numbers tearing into my gates. I will have some large wagons built with a wooden wall on one side, reinforced with stone blocks. If any breaches occur in my walls or gates, the will be used to fill the breach and/or reinforce my gates if not needed elsewhere.

My remaining fire wizard will stick with me and be used as part of my reserves where needed.

** A few points:

- don't fucking charge them. They're zombies, they won't get demoralised. Use the Dothraki /the day before/ for scouting and hit and run tactics if possible. Have them run like hell if the zombie dragon shows up.

- KEEP THOSE TREBUCHETS INSIDE THE WALLS. SERIOUSLY.

- more defences! They're zombies, they're stupid. Put trenches, fences, anything you can conceive of between them and your walls. Make them trudge through a lot of unfavourable terrain while you rain fire on them from the top of your walls.

- in general, really... just don't fight an open field battle. Why would you do that? Or if you do, don't put your forces in front of the walls, keep them on the side so you can then squeeze the dead /between/ your infantry and the walls and butcher them.

- Bran is the best scout of the history of ever. Use him in combination with the Dothraki, strike at /any/ weak point, any isolated group of undead.

- the dragons were used pretty alright, just large sweeps to incinerate undead is pretty much what I can think they'd do best. Well, you could also load them with saddlebags full of obsidian shards and do some carpet-bombing I guess.

** Here's stuff I came up with on the fly and I literally have no experience whatsoever. I mean humans are still going to lose but it won't be an absolute shocker that they survived long enough until the night king dies.

1) maybe start with the catapults. Go nuts with the catapults. Have catapults up on the walls for max range. Don't cease fire. Why did they cease fire ?!?!

2) have bran use warg skills to accurately track movements of zombie army and night king. Have him tell humans where to attack and where Arya to go.

3) Arya has the “transform into anyone” superpower teased way too much for her to not at least try to pretend to be a wight or a white walker to get to the night king. ( with perhaps a bran warged raven showing her the way ) making her eventual success at least semi plausible.

4) unsullied need to make phalanxes! You can't have them teased to be super amazing at making phalanxes and then have them be really shit at making phalanxes! Larger shields! Sturdier formation! Move as a block. Back troops take over as front shields as the front troops get slaughtered. Back troops with shields up in testudo formation. Obsidian studded shields and spears! Zombies only have the strength of one man and a single obsidian scratch kills a zombie. Yes they would eventually be over run but at least it wouldn't be insta kill.

5) put your troops behind the trench. Make multiple trenches. Make it like really really easy to set on fire. Why rely on unreliable fire mages if you have literally anything else?

6) if we have fire mages anyway, any luck we can get them to set fire to some pre determined locations really far away in some nice fire traps that we can get bran to see when the optimal amount of zombies have crossed over.

7) this is extra retcon, but Tyrion would look less like a dumbass and actually have his character be smart and useful if he got several tanks of wildfyre from Cersei as a show of faith that she's going to “legit help with the zombies I promise” before her eventual betrayal. That way that stupid suicide mission from last season would at least have something good out of it. Wildfire would have been hella useful for a blackwater pt two hello Tyrion but whatever.

8) since were having dragons fight the other dragon, obsidian mouth guard? If that's too crazy then maybe one of those obsidian spiked collars that you put on sheep dogs to protect them against wolves.

** I didn't watch game of thrones.

I /assume/ you don't mean literally infinite shock troops. You should actually only get as many zombies as there are corpses, and we can generously assume you've been stockpiling corpses for a few decades, maybe even a century.

I'm also assuming the white walkers can psychically micromanage the zombies to do semi-complex tasks. If they can't do that they're totally doomed, humans stomp, gg. If you insist on ending humanity you should maybe consider the long game and pretend to ally with the humans for a while because right now, this ain't happening unless you totally wipe out the knowledge about the obsidian thing.

My strategy as the zombies fighting the canonical humans would be to 0) guard or destroy obsidian mining locations at all costs 1) farm animals for their corpses to increase the number of zombies, focusing on /small/ animals, not giant fire breathing dragons that can be one hit KO'd by an obsidian needle 2) hide the 12 white walkers in well defended locations where humanity will hopefully never find them 3) continue the snow storm to make agriculture impossible 4) destroy any wild edible plants and animals that survive the climate change 5) kill any humans that are spotted outside of their shelters and strongholds 6) try to bomb any shelters and strongholds from underground.

The ocean food sources should be destroyed as much as possible. Ideally we would do this using Zombie Fish but we can't swim, so that's out. Maybe it can be made cold during just the wrong times, or fertilizer or poisons can be poured in.

My strategy as the humans fighting the canonical zombies would be to 1) make sure you have humans stationed on nice island surrounded by water, with a nice volcano which will stay hot during a snowstorm where you can mine /proper/ amounts of obsidian. If you don't have more obsidian than you know what to do with, you should probably get on a boat as fast as possible because you are toast. 2) Everybody needs to have obsidian-tipped everything. Crush the obsidian into a fine powder and scatter it everywhere. The zombies shouldn't even be able to walk on the ground. 3) the warg needs to find out where the white walkers and knight king is 4) manufacture explosives and have the warg posses a bird and drop them on the locations of the white walkers and knight king, send assassins, etc 5) make sure to give that ridiculous zombie dragon an obsidian tipped mosquito bite /just in case/ they manage to figure out a use for it.

Not infinite, but still a ridiculous amounts, from the looks of it. Certainly enough to vastly outnumber the defenders, multiple times over. At one point they literally toss themselves on a fire trench to smother it with their bodies, and the ones behind them march on. They're just that expendable.

  make sure you have humans stationed on nice island surrounded by water, with a nice volcano which will stay hot during a snowstorm where you can mine proper amounts of obsidian. If you don't have more obsidian than you know what to do with, you should probably get on a boat as fast as possible because you are toast.

It's unclear if there are any volcanoes at all in Westeros. Never seen one. The obsidian is called "dragonglass", probably because it can made by glassifying sand and rock by, huh, dragons. Luckily, they DO have dragons, two of them. So it'd be curious to see if they /can/ produce dragonglass by breathing on rock, or if that's just a fancy name for a naturally occurring mineral.

By your description the ideal place to mount a defence would be Dragonstone. Nice fortress on an island with high cliffs, basically impregnable, has a deposit of obsidian in its underground. The problem is, it's so far South, if the dead have arrived that far you've basically already lost some 50% of your whole country to them. I can see that not being a sacrifice they're willing to make. But there probably still were better locations than Winterfell, especially considering that supposedly the Night King is interested in killing Bran, so you can draw him into a fight on the terrain of your choice.

**** If the /dragons/ can make dragonglass, we are /never/ using those two bad boys in combat, we cannot endanger them. We're going to coax them to breath on rocks as much as possible. (I assume it's magic and you can't engineer whatever they're doing, then)

***** Dunno, would make sense if you could then deliver the dragonglass very efficiently (read: frag bombs). I don't think a shot of trebuchet would suffice, and if not, then dragons are still your only way to destroy significant numbers of undead in a short time.

I mean, why? Flamethrowers are 1st century tech.

There are only /two/ dragons, and a dragon can be killed with a single well placed harpoon. Simultaneously more, and less fragile than the zombie dragon depending on whether dragon-glass is involved, but still. Large animals don't stand a chance against any sort of technology.

If the enemy manages to maneuver you into a spot where you have no chance but to use the dragon for direct combat, that's intentional and it means they're about to put you in checkmate. You should let the castle fall before you let the obsidian producing dragon die. The moment you've lost dragonglass production, humanity goes from "probably gonna win" to "probably doomed".

That would be wyldfire. It exists in the GoT world, but it's rare and dangerous and only some alchemists in King's Landing have prepared meaningful amounts of it. Right now, it's completely out of reach for the resources and knowledge of Winterfell, so for all practical purposes, they have no access to anything like flamethrowers (flammable oil too is not among the resources at their disposal).

******** I don't know enough to definitively say, but I think the world has inconsistent tech levels then, if they have steel but can't manage flamethrowers.

The north /knows/ the undead are coming right? They should have stocked up on fire based weapons. The entire battlefield should probably be doused in oil and kindling, and there should be an entire mote with a sheen of oil on top around the fort, in preparation.

********* IRL, Greek Fire existed, but it was a closely guarded secret of one country. If the undead had attacked 600 AD Britain, they wouldn't have had flamethrowers.

And the situation is... complicated. This is a continent that has been in a state of civil war and disarray for years now. There is no unified government behind this - in fact, the currently reigning queen (who has the wyldfire supply) is also plotting to backstab the northerners, hoping that the dead will weaken them so she can inflict the final blow. Shortsightedness in the face of an existential threat is a major theme of the show.

** I haven't seen this strat yet, but there are some long posts so sorry if I'm stealing someone's idea.

As NK, ignore winterfell and just sweep all the way south, murdering literally everyone else in westeros. Leave behind a couple walkers and thousand wights or so to dig in in a big perimeter around winter fell, literally buried like landmines. They carry on a guerilla style effort to keep winterfell from being effectively provisioned, but stay hidden and spread enough to not be good dragon targets. They just distract and delay while the conquest of all the people without obsidian a and magic finishes.

As living, uh... Pretty much gotta kill the head off that pyramid scheme. Anything and everything towards killing NK. Maybe rapid retreat south with full scorched earth (killing or assimilating everything alive) like someone else suggested with the main body of troops. Figure out if you can effectively stealth from white walkers. Conscript all faceless men? Idk. It's grim if NK does the smart thing and buries himself under miles of sea ice, even if Bran is actually omniscient.

** Sorry for shameless plug :)

I wrote a small (non-rational) fanfiction about GoT focused on horse battles a few years ago. It was written for a prompt "hussars in westeros" :)

I'm not a native speaker, if anybody have any criticism I'd be grateful.

** I found [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA5mJRFaI8c][this video]] in my suggestions on YouTube. Can't really judge how effective the suggested strategy would be, I'm skeptical how much damage arrow fire would do against the undead at least.
