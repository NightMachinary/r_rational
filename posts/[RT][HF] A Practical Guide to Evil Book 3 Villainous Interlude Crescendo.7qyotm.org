Also, I'm very glad that Ubua pulled her trump card out the moment the battle started. Spares us the trouble of having to wait 4 weeks before getting to the meat of the matter like the battles in the rest of Book 3.

Opening a single portal is one thing. Being able to open a Hell Gate ANYWHERE in Creation, a Gate that leads to forces that you control that for all intents and purposes could be considered infinite in number AND ARE DEMONS?

I think Malicia misjudged herself. There's absolutely NO WAY ANY NATION THAT CALLS THEMSELVES GOOD CAN LET THIS STAND. Or any Evil aligned nation either. An enemy that can move their entire army right smack dab in the middle of your city is TOO MUCH of a threat to your interests to keep alive.

Arcadia already fused. They are mirrors of Creation. This even right here will force Procer to work with Praes to end the threat of Diabolist.

Diabolist just picked a fight with the ENTIRE Calernia. The balls on this chick..

But she fucked up. She made the one move that will force any two enemies to work together: she gave them a common enemy. Just like Triumphant...

... She has returned.

How could she trust Malicia to NOT use the weapon n years after the truce when the Principate is at its weakest? The entire Principate would in effect be living a sword dangling over their necks because they'll always be wondering when a portal to one the hells is going to open underneath them when they're on the toilet.

The only way Cordelia could conceivably agree to a truce is if the weapon is destroyed. But how could Malica trust that Cordelia won't simply call a Crusade the moment she destroys the portal?

No, far easier to have Warlock and Masego reverse engineer the array and use it to wipe Procer off the map.

****** Precisely. That's exactly why they would Crusade. Because the Crusaders have no chance in hell of beating the Diabolist. Therefore they will. White has shown he's savvy enough to exploit such tropes.

Balance and symmetry are core themes to this story.

You have the Gods Above and the Gods Below, The Winter Fae and the Summer Fae, Heroes and Villains. The Gods Below have propped up Diabolist and gave her a power that's damn OP. If it falls in the hands of Malicia that would strengthen Evil greatly and throw the whole balancing theme out of wack. Who's to say the Gods Above won't answer that terror by elevating some religious priest in Procer with a Named like the Evangelist for example, that is capable of opening breaches into whatever domain the Angels live in?

They've already done something similar with White, giving him Recall that allows him to gain the skills and reflexes of every single hero Name before him to offset Black's experience and skill.

Procer has a good chance of succeeding (relatively speaking) if they Crusade.

Cat will probably end up kneeling in front of Akua but if Diabolist thinks that's the ending of her story she's got another thing coming for her. Pride comes before the fall and I don't think I've ever seen her so smug.

Will *Take* work on Akua's gate binding? Despite the complexity, it seems likely considering it was used to steal a resurrection from an angel.

It's interesting that Akua assumes the lesser devils disappearing into dust is Warlock's doing and doesn't even consider Hierophant, who imo is the one who actually did it. He had a lot of time to study the walls after all.

With all the talk of making Cat kneel, I think Black's iconic phrase - "We do not kneel" - will become extremely relevant. Perhaps when (and if) Cat becomes Black Knight, she will recall his words and break whatever hold Akua will have on her.

** Reposting my belated rant from the chapter's comment section:

You know, Akua has called Black Knight a patriot in this charter, and this, combined with another passage from her speech here has reminded me of another mistake nobody mentions, and the reason I never could understand the concept of patriotism.

#+begin_quote
  “Twenty years ago, we were more powerful than the people of Callow,” she continued. “Twenty years ago we were better than them, for beyond all the lies and stories that is the bare truth of Creation: the powerful own the world.”
#+end_quote

What kind of "we" are you talking about here? It's not "I and all of you", because twenty years ago you were nothing but your mother's scheme, the one she denied your father the support to his claim to the Name of Warlock for. But it's not "we, the peoples of Praes" either! Even if we ignore the fact that you didn't contribute anything to that victory, the peoples of the Praes are on the other side of those walls. You and your army represent the Praesi nobility, the small part of those peoples, the very same part that the people besieging your fortress had to subjugate first in a far more brutal civil war. Your mother probably didn't assist the Conquest in any way other than the average amount of taxes she owed to the Tower anyway, and maybe sponsoring a few promising officers to become her spies in the Legions.

This kind of demagoguery puzzles me. How can people think that slapping a "we" on other people's accomplishments somehow makes them stronger? It's a faulty way of thinking even in a universe that literally runs on this kind of magical thinking!

**** But this is also reflected in her way of thought, and in her monologue to Fasili back then. The reason I'm posting this now is that while she always was quick to connect the achievements of the Empire and her own in her thoughts, this is the most open way she could have stated that yes, she does actually believe that. And everyone, both in story and in comment section, somehow treats it as though that the strengths of the Empire are actually her personal strengths too, and she was only mistaken in not being genre savvy enough.

Knowledge of tropes helps when we're in the story, with individual characters and the masses becoming the background, and she just put her success in her hands of a few key individuals and mages instead of, you know, actually adopting the structures that allowed the Empire to conquer Callow. True, that would go against her character, but admitting that other people exist shouldn't!

**** The "iron sharpens iron" principle as applied by the Wastelanders is bullshit for one more reason: success isn't measured in some singular, easily quantifiable parameter, and so the competition that has the place at the top as its prize isn't anywhere near as important as the nobles make it out to be. The only thing that the overabundance of schemers fosters is prowess at taking the prize from other such schemers, not prowess at keeping it, as evidenced by average Emperors turnover rate.

I wonder, just how common is the gambit of openly letting a villain "touch the greatness" for a few seconds and immediately stabbing them? As long as the one doing the stabbing doesn't actually need the thing the villain is after, anyway.
