** What a weird and confusing sociology.

I want to hug Arthur a lot. Metaphorically. By which I mean leave them alone to do the stuff they enjoy. Possibly talk about exciting tech topics.

It's kind of weird that the best this future can do about "this person does not want to play social games" is "force them to play social games anyways."

It kind of has a Rapture of the Nerds ambience of "just because this is /future/ doesn't mean it's /better/".

Note that the future in question is heterogeneous. It's not the best that the future can do, it's the best that this particular highly resource constrained tiny corner of the future that is optimised for social unity does.

(But yes, the future in question is very explicitly non-utopian. It's better in some ways, worse in others, and just different in yet more)

This is probably the best you can expect for a sublight starship, or a low tech space colony, or any other environment where continuous obsessive resource management and infrastructure repair is required for basic survival.

You're not going to get the libertarian-in-space future that a lot of American SF authors write about for a long time, if at all. A military authoritarianism is much more likely.

***** 100% agreed. The trade fleet (or at least this part of it - I don't know how uniform they are in this regard) are a little better than that - they're not so much military authoritarianism as small scale communism with a fairly rigidly enforced consensus - but they're very far from a libertarian free for all.

This story is loosely inspired by Vernor Vinge's Qeng Ho, but one of the things I realised fairly early on in writing it is that I didn't really believe in his social model for them at all (Vinge is solidly in the libertarians in space camp), so I ended up with something very different.

**** I mean yeah but I feel that "optimized for social unity" is maybe not achieved by forcing the social awkward person into a mold, and it's just /strange/ to me that if they have planetary interaction and game theory mapped out every step and every scenario down to the tenths of percents, they can fail so transparently at integrating a nerd.

Maybe it's a case of the Cobbler's Children? Lots of planning for the show on the big stage but nobody running things behind the curtain.

Well, they're not really failing. By the metrics they care about, Arthur is an adequately integrated member of society. These are not the same metrics /Arthur/ cares about, but that's not that important from a social planning point of view.

Arthur also has a sort of thresholding problem where they /can/ integrate, but don't enjoy it. If they were substantially less socially anxious they'd be fine. If they were substantially more socially anxious and unable to integrate as a result then they'd be dropped off on a convenient planet with an apology and a large trust fund. Arthur has that option if they want to take it, but on balance prefers to stay on ship and deal with the unpleasant aspects of that.

I guess I presumed their social model would actually reflect /people/. Though it fits with the "accumulated ad-hoc cruft" aesthetic. Would set up a nice dual story arc if at the end he starts standing up for his (a)social interests.

******* Yeah, their priorities roughly go:

1. Long term survival of humanity
2. Long term survival of the trade fleet
3. Long term survival of this particular lineage of the trade fleet
4. Long term survival of this ship.
5. Individual happiness of the crew members

All of these priorities are important, but items higher up the list have a much heavier weighting, and even on the happiness metric the way they aggregate and model such things means that the way they treat Arthur is mostly a net win: They believe that a well integrated crew is sufficiently better for most people that the cost to the people who struggle with that is worth it.

Obviously this sucks for Arthur (and would suck for me too), but from a coldly utilitarian point of view and for their particular problem domain they're not obviously wrong.

******** Ehh.

I think they're falling into the issue where they overemphasize model consistency and simplicity in the face of a messy ground truth. This works nice with physical systems where noise happens a lot and you chase a weak but /consistent/ signal, but with people if you bludgeon them to conform with the model they'll just generate an interface for you and you'll lose accuracy on your metrics exactly as much as you get conformance, because you're no longer measuring the person at all due to the feedback cycle where the person is now /modelling the process of them being modelled/ and adjusting behavior explicitly. So with people like Arthur, "barely acceptable metrics" are your ideal state, and "good to perfect metrics" are a sign that somebody is about to snap and start spree killing, because it implies they've stopped treating the crew as people and are now treating them as systems. (The broken social processing is the only one that /cares/.) Obviously this does not speak highly of the metrics. :P

********* I think you're probably underestimating just how much data they have and how long they've been refining their metrics based on it. I'm also not sure how much they care about the difference between measuring the person and measuring the externally visible characteristics of the person (which include quite a lot of preference elicitation due to the voting system).

Spree killing in particular is probably a non-issue (they have a /lot/ of ways to avoid it, but the easiest is just that they've had a huge amount of selection pressure and deliberate engineering against aggression). The failure mode they're trying to avoid is societal breakdown rather than individuals snapping.

****** This is the part that's SOD breaking though. Before I knew they could /turn off the sex drive/ without major maladjustments, it seemed more reasonable that they don't have miracle treatments for social anxiety or just plain not wanting to socialize.

But if you have such a degree of control over brain and hormones, how does it make sense that they wouldn't have conquered social anxiety, too? /Especially/ given the priority placed on social unity!

Also, just making people asexual but not /aromantic/ isn't going to get rid of jealousy, but /does/ get rid of a lot of bonding/grooming functions...

Yeah, the whole thing just seems weird to me, on account of sex and romance have a /lot/ more complexity than plain old social anxiety. Technologically speaking, they should've been able to solve social anxiety /long/ before they got the bugs out of the giant ball of mud that is sex, romance, and gender.

All that being said, I get how, from a Doylist perspective this lets ace readers with social anxiety relate to the protagonist... it just doesn't make sense from the Watsonian perspective, given that we /already/ have more available drugs for social anxiety than we do for turning off sex drive. (While completely ignoring the issue of how you convince people to /want/ to turn off their sex drives in the first place...)

I agree there's a bit of an unfilled plot hole about the effectiveness of anti-anxiety drugs. I think you're overestimating the effectiveness of the ones we have though. Arthur's behaviour is largely based on that of my friends with social anxiety /after/ they've taken their meds (and, to a lesser extent, off mine, but mine is milder than Arthur's and I don't medicate for it), and Arthur is probably on some sort of medication themselves.

I also think you're overestimating the difficulty of turning off a sex drive. A lot of the drugs we currently have for anti-anxiety will do that by accident.

For the moment I'm choosing to just brush the details of this under the carpet as "Brains are hard, hormones are easy" though.

Also in general drug availability is driven by demand rather than ease of the problem. We probably have more drugs for anxiety because more people want to fix their anxiety than turn off their sex drive.

This is actually relatively easy: When creating a new ship, you split on whether people think this is a worthwhile experiment to try. You then do it by default to kids (turns out trade fleet medical ethics are rather different to ours), and the next generation grows up thinking this is normal. Note that the norms you are seeing are those of the /ship/ (and a non-trivial but unknown fraction of their lineage), not of the entire trade fleet.

Oh, also, they've not really done anything medical to romance or gender, that's just a result of constructed social norms.

******* Actually, I've realised the obvious explanation (which may well be fully explained in a future chapter, but either way is certainly consistent with and more or less implied by the current text).

Arthur doesn't have an anxiety disorder at all. They're neuroatypical in some complex way (probably either actually autism or something related) which causes them to have a lot of difficulties with social interaction. They are then made perfectly rationally anxious by interacting with the ship's complex social system while being completely intellectually unsuited for doing so.

As a result while they /can/ take drugs to reduce their anxiety, that can't help that much without severely impeding their ability to think, because their anxiety is more or less proportionate to the situation in which they find themself.

*** A thing also worth mentioning that I forgot earlier is that most of the unpleasant parts of this particular chapter are not the result of the ship's focus on social integration. This is mostly just plain old fashioned gossip mongering.

The only way the social games system plays into it is that they have a reasonable expectation that Arthur might have noticed something was up before being told.

This is of less relevance to this chapter than some past ones, but I recently finally got around to reading /Ancillary Mercy/ and found myself wondering if the way the ship (doesn't) handle gender was influenced at all by the Radch?

Why was having sex seen as odd? The MC had a perfectly respectable view on it, and similar topics I imagine you were paralleling today (religious views, sexual orientation, etc), so Brian's reaction is a bit confusing regarding it.

The crew have rather different norms regarding sexuality and gender than we do. Also a very different approach to naming.

Arthur is something of an outsider due to their social anxiety issues, so their opinions tend to be based on but not in perfect alignment with the broader norms. In this case Brian is much closer to the consensus view but maybe a bit on the extreme side, while Arthur is going "Yeah I guess the consensus view is mostly correct but honestly I have bigger things to worry about".
