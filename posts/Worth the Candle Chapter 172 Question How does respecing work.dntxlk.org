** In ch 74, Juniper moves skill points from one skill to another, which gives him a debuff, "Skilled Trade":

#+begin_quote
  Skilled trade: Skill will decay at 1 per 10 minutes until returned to baseline.
#+end_quote

Because he's removing skills from his character sheet that have points in them, he's first taking the skill points out and putting them into other skills, such as Essentialism, which will then not decay because he has the Meta Stilling virtue, gained in ch 156:

#+begin_quote
  Meta Stilling: You can still any game effect with a duration.

  And there it was, the capstone of still magic. There were very few game effects with durations, at least so far as the revealed text went, and I would have to touch base with Reimer to see whether there was anything he'd failed to mention, but there were at least three that I was currently under: the Skilled Trade, Overcapped, and Double Overcapped afflictions were gradually reducing my bonus to Still Magic.
#+end_quote

The character sheet does not (and has never) shown adjusted skill values from e.g. Virtues, Afflictions, entads, etc. If it did, it would show a 100 in Still Magic, 100 in Essentialism, 100 in Spirit, etc.

I'm removing this post, as it's subreddit policy to remove discussion posts for chapters that already have discussion posts in the subreddit, but hopefully that answers your question.
