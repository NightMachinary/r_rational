** Submission statement: /Ra/ was one of my favorite stories, in part because I love Sam Hughes' writing style (low on the hand-holding, information dense, whip-fast), and in part because I found it inventive, exciting, and /new/ in a way that's pretty rare. It finished ages ago, with a rewrite of the (contentious) ending a few months back, but it's now in e-book form, if you'd like to support the author. Pretty cheap, for being 500 pages.

In terms of plot, magic is real, and it looks a lot like computer programming and engineering. It's approached that way by most of the characters within the work, including the main character, who's studying magic at university. There's more spoilery plot stuff after that.

Edit: You can also [[https://qntm.org/ra][read it here for free.]]

*** Buying. does anyone have a pdf? I've yet to spend the time capital on making kindle to my phone (@voice it reads pretty much anything not drmed) work, but text to speech is my preferred approach for anything not having an audiobook/podcast

***** I've spent almost an hour trying and gotten nowhere (Kindle Cloud doesn't work, the Windows app isn't downloading, Windows update crashed on me), so I'd appreciate it if someone who's gone through this sent me a link so I could read the darn thing.

****** You have a couple options.

If you just want to read it with minimal effort, just read the web version. [[https://qntm.org/city][Start here]] and continue by hitting the next page links at the bottom. It might be a little long to read this way but it can be done.

There's the [[https://qntm.org/files/ra/ra6-fixed-2.epub][epub version available here]] for free that you can put on your (android) phone and read with an ereader app or download an ereader app for your computer like Calibre (which also can convert ebook files into different formats).

If you really just want a pdf or another format like mobi, send me a PM with your email address and the format of your choice and I will convert it for you.

******* The epub you linked would be great but I think that's the old ending, no?

Ah, [[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Sam_Hughes_Ra?id=R5p-DwAAQBAJ][Google Play has an Epub version]]. I'll refund the Amazon purchase and just get that.

*** I'm a big fan of both Sam Hughes' and your writing, so it's somehow very satisfying to see this connection.

May I ask whether the time travel setup of Branches on the Tree of Time (the way time travel works) was inspired by the plot of Sam Hughes' Ed?

**** No. There are only a limited number of time travel models that make any actual sense, and the one that Branches uses (branching timelines) is one of them. I have an unpublished/unfinished novel (/The Timewise Tales/) that uses the other major model, self-consistency, and a planned novel that uses ripple effect, which would complete the trifecta.

(I also have two mostly abandoned and unpublished fanfics that use [[https://qntm.org/hypertime][hypertime]]; that one definitely has the mechanics taken directly from qntm.)

** I actually ended up not liking Ra. I think the opening was good but as it progressed I got more and more confused. It's been a while since I read it but I remember being disappointed with the ending.
