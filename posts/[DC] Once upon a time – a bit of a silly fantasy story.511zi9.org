** When rational self interest meets dungeon crawl.

I was limited to 2000 words when I wrote this. I like it rather a lot, although I may at some point rewrite it and flesh it out a bunch.

*** There /has/ to be more of these stories scattered around the web. If somebody would just make an anthology, they'd make a killing.

** Hehe, the realistic dungeon crawl. I like it!

It's always tough in an RPG who you have to rationalize the meta-knowledge of party formation. "Our wizard just died? Oh good thing he distant cousin, the sorcerer, just arrived and we totally trust him!"

*** I do more with that in my story [[http://dreamtime.logic11.com/index.php/2016/06/05/almost-like-wearing-nothing-at-all/][Almost Like Wearing Nothing At All]]. It's a bit longer than this one, but there is a moment where a party member dies and a new one with the same skill set shows up... Part 3 or 4, I don't remember now.
