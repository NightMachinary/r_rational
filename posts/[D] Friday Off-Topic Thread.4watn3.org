Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** If you are interested in learning more things about problems in the US criminal justice system (as [[/u/kishoto][u/kishoto]] talked about on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4vmxdv/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d6116l9][Monday]]), I recently read an article about a false murder confession [[http://www.westword.com/news/how-to-convict-a-fourteen-year-old-of-a-murder-he-didnt-commit-8134479][(link)]] that police got out of a fourteen-year-old. In addition to problems with trials and problems with plea bargains, we also have problems with investigation. There wasn't some grand conspiracy to railroad this kid; that would be relatively easy to fix, in a way. Instead, we have a much more insidious problem. The police probably think they had the right guy, and twisted things until they had the evidence needed for a conviction. Nobody gathered in a dark room and decided to put an innocent kid in prison. You can't point at a meeting and be like "here are the bad guys" because that's not how it works. Instead, there are bad incentives and bad procedures, and they predictably lead to bad outcomes.

So, what happened here? The police coerced a confession out of him with aggressive interrogation tactics. In hindsight, knowing he's likely innocent, it seems obvious the confession is false. He had to be coached to get the details of the crime right right. Although the confession proper didn't make it into evidence, after he confessed they (perhaps reasonably) decided he was guilty and did their best to build a case against him. "Their best" is very good; the police build cases a lot, as it is part of their job. The problem with this sort of interrogation + confession is the same as the problem with people going for plea bargains, as I mentioned in the discussion [[/u/kishoto]] started: whether or not you take a plea bargain has mostly to do with how desperate and terrified you are, rather than how guilty you are. This is also true for terrified teenagers being interrogated and being told to confess. The guilty and innocent alike plead guilty to reduce their sentences, and so too can they be coerced into confessions.

So, there are a lot of places you can run into problems with the system. Generally, and perhaps tautologically, the criminal justice system deals with criminals. Still, we want it to be fair and just. Besides the question of "is a 12 peer/juror trial a good concept" which should be addressed, but we have problems that happen before the trial. Plea bargains can have problems [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4vmxdv/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d61fsc1][(link)]]. Investigations can have problems. Contact with the police in the first place can have problems. Even if all of this was fixed, sentencing is a problem going back decades [[http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/death/kaufman.htm][(link)]]. There's a lot to read if this interests you!

*** I read a PDF somewhere that a confession alone has a powerful contamination effect on all the remaining evidence, even if the confession is transparently false.

I wish I can find that PDF overview because it's pretty comprehensive.

Edit:

One interesting reform idea I heard from a fictional story is that instead of appointing prosecutors to an office, they are actually part of the same pool and chosen randomly. For each case, a lawyer could be prosecutor, or a public defender. I think it would be great if we get rid of the much maligned political office for district attorney and such.

ISTM that the problem here is people thinking forced confessions are not only evidence of guilt on their own, but overwhelmingly /strong/ evidence.

As problems go, ignorance is at least one we have mechanisms developed to fix (awareness campaigns, training, writing compelling stories featuring the topic, etc.) We just need to turn those tools to this problem.

** As I mentioned in the worldbuilding thread, I've started on an Undertale fanfiction (probably non-rational). It's going decently, I've got about three-quarters of the first draft of the first chapter done, though I'll probably be waiting until I get the first few chapters done and revised before I post anything.

There are two primary things that inspired this, both of which have plenty of spoilers for Undertale -- don't watch if you haven't played, play if you haven't, it's a fantastic game.

The first is this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2mTK1iuGqY][vocal duet cover]], the second is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5296460/chapters/12226634][The Golden Quiche]] by the venerable [[/u/Sophiera]]

Highly recommend that fic to anyone who has any interest in Undertale, it explores and expands on the magic of the universe and is overall pretty fantastic. They also have a work of original fiction, [[https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Sun-Sophia-J-Teh-ebook/dp/B01H1QH652][Crafting the Sun]] published on Amazon which I haven't gotten around to reading yet.

I'd like to add some more information about [[https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Sun-Sophia-J-Teh-ebook/dp/B01H1QH652][Crafting the Sun]] for those who prefer Sci-fi.

In the simplest terms, it's a character driven Science Fiction novel of the robot future variety. It has a set lore and its own consistent world science. It's not hard-science (as in following our universe to its closest), but it still adheres to its own rules.

I will be very thankful if other Sci-fi fans can spare a little money and time to check it out.

Gizmodo's spin is the exciting angle, as always, but the basic point that what looks to me, as a layman, as the most reasonable explanation doesn't work, so that probability mas must be distributed among the remaining ideas, which includes alien mega-structures, or something we just haven't thought of yet.

The "homages". Sorry Hollywood, in my mind an homage is a quick reference to another work, like with a throwaway line of dialogue or a quick shot done in another film maker's style, NOT plot lines and character dynamics.

**** The difference between the two types of homages you just referenced, is that not knowing about the other work would subtract from my enjoyment of this story in the case of a "throwaway line of dialogue", whereas plot lines and character dynamics are able to be enjoyed without understanding everything that came before. In the end, there's only a finite number of combinations of good plots and character dynamics, and [[http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/][creativity inherently depends on copying]], so I'll give /Stranger Things/ a free pass on both those elements.

The Quantum Thief, The Fractal Prince, and The Causal Angel [[https://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=Hannu+Rajaniemi][Hannu Rajaniemi]] /One level is an adventurous thief tale with a rising Godzilla threshold, another level is a mostly fair mystery told in median res about what happened in the singularity, and a fair bit of physics porn. A book that either disrupts immersions by smacking you in the skull with the setting vocabulary or makes you fight to tread water and figure it out before you get a definition/ *Note: no glossary*

The Expanse series [[http://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=James+S.+A.+Corey][James S. A. Corey]] /The closest a series can get to Firefly, while still observing Economics and physics IMHO.

Seconded on Leagion, or really anything by Sanderson, but I was hooked on the Wheel of Time over two decades ago, so my bias probably needs reassessment.

Just about anything by the [[http://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=Robert+Heinlein][Robert A.
