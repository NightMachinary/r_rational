I love Catherine. I'm really curious to see how exactly she changes her corner of the world.

*** i wonder if she'll have one, she mentions in one chapter she wanted to travel when younger, so when she've handed off the crown i think she might just ride towards the sunset with any woe wanting to follow her, all she wanted was for callow to be free after all.

â€‹

then she might visit every now and then to make sure the kingdom is healthy but she have no desire to rule it, she hates ruling.

**** I think she'll rule in spirit even if she departs, if only because the future kings and queens can't help but wonder if they can screw up badly enough to drag out the Black Queen once more.

***** yea that's also what i was thinking, and depending on if she still have villain immortality she actually might show up a few 100 years later, so tyrant of callow is her title everlasting even if ruler is not, because if someone tries to take her title she'll come back.

****** I dunno about that, she seemed pretty insistent on the whole mortality thing. I don't think she has any sort of Name at the moment.

******* different kind of mortality, villains don't age it's a perk that comes with the job, they are however just as mortal as everyone else otherwise, so when she was back to being mortal she was no longer a abstract concept given form but have a actual real body of flesh to call her own.

but i don't think she currently have a name so i don't think she have the agelessness unless the night boon her with it, something it clearly can do if you look at the drow.

***** Oh gods this would be fantastic. Instead of an Arthurian legend - where the missing king shows back up in the time of greatest need - it's a Callowan legend, where the limping, snarky mistress of violent chaos shows up if you fuck up too much to spit spite in your eye. And then stab you. How could anything be more Callowan?

*** Originally only 5 books were planned, but we know now there is at least one more after this. It may have changed to two more but I have not seen a direct quote from EE on that so I don't know what the plan is. Regardless, there is a planned end.\\
Book 1 has 30 chapters including prologue, interludes, and epilogue\\
Book 2 has 61\\
Book 3 has 97\\
Book 4 has 107

So guesstimating and assuming the trend line stay the same I expect book 5 to have ~100 more chapters and then a ~130 - 150 chapter book 6 unless it gets broken up into books 6 and 7.

*** IIRC it's six books. As for chapters probably around the same as the last books, 50-80 per book.

**** It would be awesome to get an Epilogue Book. Like Book 7 could just be ten chapters exploring the future of Calernia after Catherine Foundling has passed. How society was changed and all the other consequences of Catherine's path to a more sane Calernia.

That would be neato and prime fodder for us fans to start writing fanfic sequels.
