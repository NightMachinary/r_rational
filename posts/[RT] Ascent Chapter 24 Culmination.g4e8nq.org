*** the next chapter buttons on each chapter just link to whatever your next post was, not to the actual next chapter. I had to start using the contents page to navigate instead

**** Good to hear - anything in particular you liked/disliked?

Also, where you running into the chapters out of order, or did you see them in order but just run across the short stories, The Facilitator and The Utilitiaria?

***** I think there might have been 1 or 2 places where the chapters were out of order, but mostly it was just the short stories. I ended up reading like 3 of them before realizing that they weren't chapters. There was also at some point a link to "Update" which I assume was some blog post about writing progress.

I thought the story was an interesting take on alien invasion. I liked that you addressed the similar tech levels. I liked that the ending was rather dark. The plot was tight which was good. We didn't get to see a lot of what the society under ARCO was like I guess, though that wasn't really the point of the story. It also wasn't super clear why there were so few pre-invasion survivors left. Aurelie was obviously unexplained but that was clearly intentional.

****** So you did read some of the short stories - what where your thoughts on those? The ones marked interlude are a part of the main plot, the others are there unintentionally...!

As for

>! Vash and Aurelie's age - the invasion was 165 years ago and the form of anti senescence technology used here requires regular access to rejuvenation, which Vash alone has. I think that was mentioned.!<

** And that's a wrap - I have another short story, sequel to [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/08/30/seeker/][Seeker]], finished today as well - [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2020/04/19/frameshift/][Frameshift]]. I'd love to know what you all think now that it's finally finished. More short stories to come, stay tuned!

  Maybe Vash could, for this moment, believe it would all turn out for the best. Maybe this was what they all needed. Another brave new world.
