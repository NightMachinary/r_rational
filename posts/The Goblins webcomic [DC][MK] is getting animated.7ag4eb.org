** Cool. I stopped following its updates when Tarol had his major breakdown and never started again. Hope he's doing well.

*** He seems to be doing okay, but the quality of the comic has never recovered.

**** Do you mind recapping what happened? Does he want to do it full time with patreon? iirc he had a job and was doing the comic part time. But i have seen the comic in years.

***** He is doing the comic full time with Patreon, although updates are very slow.

** Hey guys! I know Goblins was a big influence for a lot of people in the era before rationalfics. I remember EY said it was an influence for his Sword of Good story. Figured I'd spread the word since a ton of famous people are going to be in it, like Tara Strong and Phil LaMarr.

*** Important clarification: This is a /kickstarter/ for an animated Goblins series.

Given the creator's past track record, I doubt that this is going to happen, at least not without racking up unexpected expenses and running into severe delays that seriously hamper the quality of the product.

In fact, I strongly advise against donating to this campaign. There was a previous Goblins Kickstarter (this one for a card game) and... Let's just say that the story of its creation (or lack thereof, for a period of several years) is a frustrating one.

Much of the blame can be laid at the hands of Evertide, the company responsible for producing the card game, but Tarol was incredibly flaky and uncommunicative on the matter. Not only do you run the risk of your money going into a deep pit, but you can't reasonably expect a response about it.

(I recognize that he's got some big names attached to this project, but I still wouldn't risk it. He's dropped the ball too many times before, and to be honest I'm worried that this project is going to be /too/ big for him.)

**** I'm actually really surprised that he would do a Kickstarter again, given how it turned out for both him and his backers last time. I know from his perspective it might seem like the problem was entirely with the Evertide, but even then, he has to realize that it left a sour taste in everyone's mouth, and that it would be the thing his fans would think about when he did a new Kickstarter.

**** I agree, the project is unlikely to materialize. The people I know who are following the kickstarter have said that it's nowhere near on track to be funded.

***** looking at the page and you can see that unless they get a sudden wave of support, that it wont be successfully funded
