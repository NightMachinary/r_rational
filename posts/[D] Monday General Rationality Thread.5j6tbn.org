Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** My husband is obsessed with SSC's Moloch and he's proudly telling everyone of how we defeated him this week.

Like most households, our rubbish bins often end up overflowing before someone finally gives in and empties them. And it's a standard Moloch thing: we all benefit from having the bin emptied earlier, but nobody wants to be the one to do it because it requires effort and someone else can do it.

The big reason we don't like emptying the bin is because the wheelie bin outside is now kept out the back (so that way I can scoop our dog's poops directly into it), which means you have to go out the back garden, put shoes on, risk stepping in a poop that is recent enough not to have been scooped, etc.

Added to that our recycling bin is pretty small and often full of empty almond milk cartons (<--- gratuitous virtue signalling).

So, we thought of an idea to fix it. The problem was that the wheelie bin is out the back, and we need the wheelie bin out the back because otherwise scooping the dog poops is almost impossible, since I'd have to transport each individual poop through the gate into the wheelie bin, and it's much easier to have the wheelie bin in the back yard and transport it to the front once a week for rubbish collection.

So, we decided to buy a new bin to have out the back, so that way both bins were out the front. We ended up buying a bin that was bigger than our recycling bin and now our old recycling bin is out the back collecting dog poop while we have a much higher volume in our new recycling bin (plus it has a proper lid so the aforementioned dog can't get into it).

I am not sure if it's going to work, we've only had it since Saturday, but my husband is /so proud of himself/ for it, and yesterday when the bin was only about 80% full he went and emptied it and proudly proclaimed he is doing his part in the fight against Moloch.

So, my take-away from this is that if nothing else, at least my husband now feels /good/ about taking the bin out.

Discussion question: where have you folks applied rationality to the general domains of housekeeping?

*** That sounds like an excellent plan (and good virtue signalling there!)

When I had a partner the most rational thing we ever did was agree we could each do the tasks we hated least, which turned out not to be the traditionally gendered tasks, but I didn't mind taking bins out half as much as he did so that was cool.

Nowadays I find the most rational thing is to actually pay a friend's kid to do some cleaning. This means that unlike most cleaners I feel comfortable doing tidying and stuff while he's around and we can chat about science and gaming while we do it.

I earn $45/ph (my husband's on $180/ph but as a lecturer most of his work is unpaid, and the hours aren't good...) so it's such an efficient use of time, and we can focus on the tidying rather than wiping our counters down and mopping and sweeping.

A friend's kid would probably be an ever better idea, but with this, every second Wednesday I come home from work and everything's so nice (ooo, speaking of which, that's /tomorrow/!!!!)

*** My favorite was switching from one large bin in the kitchen to two smaller ones. When one gets filled, someone takes it out. We have to take out the trash twice as often /but/ we also always have half as much trash in the kitchen. We barely ever fill one up and start on the second one, because as soon as it gets filled up, someone takes it out, replaces the bag and we start using that bin again.

The second one is really for emergency use.

The study was done on knockout mice with a rapid aging disorder, so that's several variables to isolate out right there. Even if this method doesn't work on humans it's a start, and it's definitely something to be happy about for humans born in the next ten years with an aging condition.

** Weekly Monday Update

In an effort to have no more zero weeks (see: zero days), I am now making a post in the Monday general rationality threads to catalog goings-on in my life and efforts. From what I've discussed with those on the Discord channel, the post will be great. To that end, if you enjoy these posts or I don't make one one week, please pester me. It means I'm depressed or I don't feel like anyone enjoys my posts, and seeing that someone cares will make a big difference should I not post.

If anything I mention here seems interesting to discuss, let me know, and I can go into more detail.

--------------

Approximately a year ago, I had the opportunity to take a programming class which encouraged a semester-long project and at the end we had to demonstrate the project to someone in the industry. I wanted to do image processing, and so, using a Raspberry Pi, a NoIR camera, and the OpenCV library, was able to track a bright red object across my room with inch-degree accuracy at about 12 fps because I wanted higher resolution more than framerate. I figured out networking and got the pi to network with Unreal Engine on my PC, mapping a 3D-in-game object to the Raspberry Pi's camera space. I took, made a demo video, and sent it to Oculus' developer outreach. Apparently they enjoyed what I had and now I have a free pair of Oculus Touch Controllers and an Oculus Rift. Received a B on the project though, lol.

At any rate, I am about 20% of the way through actually making the game, and hit a major snag dealing with some of Unreal Engine's subsystems, so the project was put on hold while I recuperated from major losses this last semester. If someone has ideas for a filter which removes all visible light but allows IR light through, I would love to know. Couldn't find anything that would attach to the camera for less than 15 bucks.

*Pokemon*

*Renegade Engine*

I talked last week about making !Pokemon separate from the game engine. As of today it is official. No class or method from here on out will directly reference Pokemon except for data generation, and most references to Nintendo's IP will be removed from the actual engine code. This will allow us to distance the engine from Pokemon, and will promote good design in that the game can be differentiated from the Engine. Here on out the Engine will be referred to as the *Renegade* engine. It also allows us to have fun with the naming schemes of various people's mods or games made with the engine, "Renegade Monster Hunter" "Monster Rancher: Renegades", so on and so forth for people's fan games or custom fantasy games. The discussion on the actual name of the game is still heated. I have preemptively registered "[[/r/PokemonRenegades]]", however. :P

Anything Pokemon related will be separate from the engine, giving us the ability to make a more generic monster battling system. This will be the true test of our ability- allowing someone to make a Pokemon-style game or do a Final Fantasy Tactics style game without having to touch much, if any, engine code. All throughout, I will be keeping that in mind.

*Persistence* One thing that we want to do is to be able to "fake" a crowd, but at the same time we want to be able to give each person a home location, as well as anything else. This is where our priority system comes in. A player for example, may be in a town, and try to converse with some non-important individual from a crowd. Prior to this moment, the game hadn't given that ai a name, or relationships or anything. The ai will instantly give that character a name, an address, and random opinions/bits of knowledge right then and there. That specific character will now has a name, address, and some generated factoids assigned from the hive mind. After some arbitrary amount of time not interacting with the player, that ai will be re-entered into the hive mind, potentially be completely forgotten by the player, but the newly-generated name and base information will still exist, just in case.

My guess is that we'll use some kind of database style container system for most AI information unless they enter the high-interaction/high priority queue.

--------------

*Other* After some discussion, I have also come up with a fun story concept regarding a pokemon fanfiction. I don't want to talk too much about it, as it's only going to be a short (5-10 chapter max) story, and easily spoilerable but look forward to hearing about a new pokemon fanfiction from me around January-February.

** So I've been combing through a ton of cognitive psychology / behavioral economics for a school research project.

I've found several good papers on trying to make better plans, teaching the proto-skills that CFAR's turned into their own techniques like Murphyjitsu.

Similar to the Rationality 101 writeup, I'll be working on a Planning 101 writeup focusing exclusively on fighting the planning fallacy (which is in-line w/ my research).

Unsure if anyone's interested in just browsing through the actual research papers themselves, but here's a link of my resources, if anyone wants to check out papers related to planning:

** My mom (who I will say I do not have a good relationship with) recently told me I am too analytical in my life. This is something I was already aware of: my brain refuses to turn off and is constantly trying to find the underlying patterns or reasoning behind anything. As a brief example, I once hooked up with someone I had feelings for since we were both barely into our teens---and even as we kissed, half of my brain was trying to figure out what this meant for our relationship, whether this was a good course of action, how to proceed past this, et cetera.

I will clarify that I am quite charming and charismatic in day-to-day life, and don't come off as any kind of strawman Vulcan or Sherlock-wannabe. (She also thinks I'm arrogant and prideful, but I think that an accurate appraisal of one's strengths is as important as understanding one's limits and weaknesses. I also don't go around bandying this information wily-nily. But I digress.)

My question to you all is, have you experienced this inability to not analyse? Do you think it's negatively impacted you?

*** Have confidence in your ability, but make that confidence silent. It makes you look like a braggart or a ponce when you ask for help about your own intelligence. You probably analyze too much, but like hell anyone needs to /know/ that. When in doubt, proceed according to a precommitted social code rather than snap judgement, even if it seems like a good idea at the time. You can update when you have sources and time to think.

It might be a handicap to think to deeply on things - primarily because you might take issue with things that are ordinary or mundane. Avoid paranoia, pretend stress doesn't exist. Remember, your intention with every action is to /cut/, not to think about cutting, or to make preparations for the act of cutting. I think rationality has helped me in this regard, but for you it might be something else.

Most of all, don't worry so much about what other people think that you stoop to asking for help or similar scenarios on the internet. This counts as "bandying this information around willy-nilly". I could have just as easily called you a fag and walked away - or otherwise posted this to [[/r/iamverysmart]] for internet points. Committing your worries to word means that they are real, if not physically, then in the pain that they will bring when others spring on your vulnerability.

These are the rules I follow. I imagine if you've put as much thought into it as I have, you follow them as well.

*** I often experience it and it can degenerate into cynicism if I'm reading too much Evo Psych or economics recently. Concentration meditation also causes this kind of dispassionate analyzing that verges on cynicism/depression, which is countered well by compassion/metta meditation. Metta meditation makes me a lot...Softer/warmer and less focused on possible reasons for why people do things.

Being analytical can be helpful for many things, and can prevent people from taking advantage of you by manipulating, but it can make social life a little gray or depressing.

Wish you the best :)

*** In popular parlance [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin][(link)]]:

#+begin_quote
  The Munchkin is the Tabletop RPG player who plays the game to win at any cost, even if that isn't the point of the game. Perhaps the most ridiculed Player Archetype of all time, this player is rarely interested in the story behind the game. Indeed, his characters are little more than extensions of his own personality or whatever personality would give him the most bonuses.
#+end_quote

In how it's often used on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], though, Munchkinning refers to seeing beyond the rules as they are societally constructed to see the rules as they are truly--it's not a purely negative description. A Munchkin finds edge cases or areas where the rules provide unique advantages not previously thought of. "Low Hanging Fruit" that people didn't even know where fruit. But also, a certain sense of /ruthlessness/ when it comes to exploiting these things.

For example, let's say you have a character construction system that lets you take Flaws, and the more Flaws you take, the more bonus points you get to spend elsewhere. So, you take a bunch of Flaws, like maybe you take Poor Vision, and also Color-Blind, but you use the bonus points from those to gain Mage's Eye which gives you perfect vision anyways, and you still have points left over to put elsewhere. Or maybe you age your character up to age 35, when everyone gets +1 to each mental stat and -1 to each physical stat. This seems balanced, except your mental stats are all high--15, 16, 17--and it would cost like, 10 points to increase them. However, your physical stats are all low-- 8, 9, 10-- and it costs 1 point to increase them. So aging to age 35 gives you valuable stats that are hard to buy and frees up points to offset the cost.

At the end of the day, John is playing Tuvo the Elf Ranger, Alan is playing Alaric the Halfing Rogue, Peter is playing Thoromund the Dwarf Fighter, and you're playing Marvolo the Magnificent, the Murky-Eyed Poor Vision Color-Blind mage-sight 61-year-old (he'll turn 62 and get more stat bonuses and maluses after he learns Polymorph) aquatic (for bonus swim checks, of course; this template has no downside so why not take it) human wizard 1 / sorcerer 1 / double-arcane thaumaturge (The rules don't prevent this).... etc

In stories, it often means someone who grabs low-hanging fruit etc in this style.

Encouraging people to bury paper does increase the level of carbon in the ground. However, the bottleneck in the cycle that's causing it to run down isn't the rate at which paper is buried, it's the rate at which trees scrub carbon dioxide. Thus, sequestering carbon back into where we bring out coal and oil won't affect CO2 in the air, unless the global effort to produce mass amounts of potting paper would increase the amount of trees, at which point why not just increase trees normally.

****** If paper recycling were to be reduced greatly, and the paper buried, then we would have a constant stream of carbon sequestration. This would definitely also lead to a greater forestry products industry, which, in turn, would mean a larger footprint of harvested rapid-growth trees. Paper is one of the most heavily recycled products. Stop recycling it, and the forestry products industry will take off.

The initial statement that paper sequestration might be 'the answer' to human carbon emissions is probably a bit of wishful thinking near term, but in the long term, as we move more and more to non-carbon-based energy for the power grid, paper carbon sequestration would be more and more effective in offsetting carbon emission.

The best thing about it is that it is a partial solution that doesn't require new technologies, and encourages multiple industries. Additionally, if wood/paper becomes more socially acceptable, there will be fewer plastic bags made, less plastic furniture, etc.
