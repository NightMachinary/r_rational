Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** This comment about propaganda in modern politics has been making the rounds on both [[https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/][r/bestof]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=AdviceAnimals][r/depthhub]], so I thought I'd share it here due to the incredibly important implications it has for the current state of rationality in our society.

#+begin_quote
  Someone else pointed that comment out to me recently as well. My initial response is that cynicism, believing in nothing, is rational. It takes a lot of work and mental energy to sort signal from noise. There's a lot more news (or things that look like news) and the overall signal is starting to be overwhelmed in noise. So it's a rational sort of response to just write the entire spectrum of information off as a lost cause.

  However, I don't think blaming the victims (the public) is a good approach to solving this issue. Yes the news is noisier. Yes, people are starting to disbelieve all of it. But the solution isn't to shame and blame people for not taking the mental energy and time to parse the news. That just taxes everyone to maintain the status quo. The solution is to remove the noise from the signal, create punishments that hurt noise-miners.

*** Eh, seems to be a lot of projecting going on in that post. "Fake news" as a term was destroyed by the people who first coined it; the strict sense of "clearly false news written purely for clicks" lasted maybe a few days before people were using it to mean "everything from the other side". Then the other side applied that standard back at them, they squawked in impotent, idiot outrage for a few weeks, and are now calling for the term to be retired, having completely backfired.

Similarly, the bit from Sartre would be at least as familiar to any libertarian or conservative as it is to a progressive. The_Donald didn't invent that crap, they stole a technique and a gave it a new, gleeful vibrancy.

All that aside, the basic thesis seems invalid to me. The dynamic of cynicism doesn't work the same way in a dual party democracy as it does in a single party autocracy, because there's always someone from the other side to call out bullshit and lies. People either flock to the media of the side they lean to, which they more or less trust, or they conclude that it's all /bad/, but some truth can be gleaned by consuming widely while taking biases into account. That sort of cynicism is something that I think is rarely truly felt, but sometimes offered up as a sort of conciliatory gesture between people of different factions. "Let's accept that they're all garbage instead of arguing about which of us has a slightly greater credibility".

***** Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Why do /you/ trust self-appointed fact checkers? Would you trust one funded by Breitbart? Even if they could point to a few times they said a Dem was being honest, and a Rep was being dishonest? You mention in your linked post that you consider them unbiased, but that's honestly laughable, particularly from someone in this sub. Everyone has biases, *particularly* when talking politics, because Politics Is the Mindkiller. Someone claiming to be totally unbiased is a major red flag that they are full of shit. If they at least mention which way they think their biases go, well, that's a show of good faith. It means they're at least trying to take it into account, and that /I/ can take it into account as well.

"Everybody is biased" is a much more common (and reasonable) claim than "everyone is false news propaganda". From my observations, I see (generally speaking) "we're all biased, but my side is better/more honest about it" from the right, versus "they are fake news but my side is solidly factual" from the left. Neither of them is falling into that cynicism pit you originally linked to.

The simple fact is that there are only a few formal "Fact Checking Organizations" and all of them are associated with leftwing outlets. That's not to say factchecking doesn't happen on the right, but it's decentralized. You say in the linked thread that you trust them because they hold themselves to a higher standard than regular journalists, but that could still easily fall below acceptable standards. Remember politifact's nonsense over "if you like your plan you can keep your plan"? Iirc, their defense was essentially that Obama did in fact make that promise, so totally true. On the other hand, I've seen them give republicans "mostly false" for not bending over backwards to mention potential counter-arguments to their own claims, /while admitting the claim itself was basically factual/. The whole debate over factcheckers has seemed to me, since 2012, to be mostly about one side wanting to be able to Appeal to Authority after their previous authorities (academia, newspapers) had lost a lot of credibility.

But that doesn't mean the people doubting Fact Checkers are disputing the concept of facts in general! Just from reading Instapundit during the course of this last administration, I've seen thousands of factchecking articles. They're just offered on their own merits, without any appeal to authority. And I've seen, online, on TV, and irl, the very fact of someone disputing the authority of the Fact Checkers being held as evidence that they dispute facts/logic/reason/etc in general.

TL;DR; This complaint comes off as someone in full football equipment, standing on a football field, in the act of throwing a pass, intently insisting that they're not playing political football. You are.

Speaking of playing football... to make this kind of claim, I feel like you have to either be affected quite a bit by some sample bias in what liberals/conservatives you speak to, or misattributing the epistemology that goes into decrying "fake news" as just "news that is biased." Or you just think that liberals are inherently more prone to irrationality, which... you know. Speaking of biases and all.

The phrase didn't gain traction when FOX was every liberal's punching bag and conservatives blamed every fact they didn't like on "the liberal media." It only became a national talking point when literal fake news began dominating social media... and by both [[https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.ho61n9AXN#.kiJMmQgPk][research]] and one of the major creator's [[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/17/purveyor_of_fake_news_says_he_targeted_trump_supporters_influenced_election.html][own admissions]], the fake news that got the most attention and most shares were the ones aimed at conservatives against liberals.

I see many fewer progressive types willing to admit that, say, NYT, WaPo, Politifact, etc have political biases than conservatives willing to admit that their media has biases. This is understandable, most conservative media is explicit and open about where it falls as a marketing technique, whereas progressives has sunk an enormous amount of effort into marching through the institution of media, and acknowledging the resulting bias to an opponent would negate the point. Hence "NYT and NPR are bastions of objective journalism, while Fox News is worse than Bagdad Bob" seems like a fairly common progressive opinion regarding media bias. Meanwhile, conservative media is much more likely to market itself as such, as an "answer to liberal bias" or whathaveyou, so conservatives have much less incentive to pretend that Breitbart et al are perfect paragons of objectivity. Instead, they say that openly choosing sides is more honest, and a reason why their bias is lesser/better than progressive bias.

That was the case even before the "fake news" meme, and was independent of that meme. We've had almost a generation of a large percent of progressive types hearing Jon Stewart spend 2 hours a week telling them how Fox news lies and distorts and makes shit up. Remember "facts have a liberal bias"? Do you remember that that was a joke, before a disturbing number of people defended it as a face value truth?

This, I think, is why the "fake news" meme went off the rails so quickly. A large chunk of progressives were super-primed to think of most/all conservative media that way long before someone came up with a catchy phrase to describe a different phenomenon. Which is why, in a span of days, we went from "people are publishing Batboy-level political articles for clicks" to "here is a list of 200 vaguely conservative sites that are all shills owned by Putin".

Even just look at the OP here. Factcheckers are paragons of fairness, but his opponents just hate facts on principle.

I don't know that progressives are "inherently more prone to irrationality". I think both sides have quite a bit of it, and the incentive structures for both differ in interesting ways. One of those differences is in the way they describe the relation both sides share with partisan bias.

Oh, I don't know that they're actually better at recognizing it. My point is that they have an incentive to /admit it/, even if ironically, they fail to truly take it into account. Conversely, progressives have an incentive to pretend that the powerful institutions that they own are unimpeachable paragons, even when they are demonstrably not.

And conservative media has sunk an enormous amount of effort into painting themselves as the brave underdogs against the liberal titans of hollywood and places like the NYT, despite FOX consistently having the highest ratings among cable news stations and conservative talk radio blanketing the national airwaves, with the sole notable exception of NPR. I think you might be confusing "more open with their bias" as "more ready to admit their biases."

Super-primed by who? Jon Stewart pointing out all the lies on FOX, or FOX for printing and broadcasting the lies in the first place? Or are you going to defend FOX's journalistic integrity?

I'm not saying that CNN or MSNBC aren't biased, and you can make fun of liberals for taking "facts have a liberal bias" seriously rather than tongue-in-cheek, but when the forerunners of conservative news is FOX and Rush Limbaugh, comparing them to "liberal media" is false equivocation.

"Politics is the mindkiller" is not an excuse for cynicism or the golden mean fallacy. "Both groups are biased, but conservative media is better at admitting it" is a slanted view, just in a different direction than "Conservative media has more bias than liberal media" is a slanted view.

I've seen liberals attacking those "powerful institutions that they own" far more often than conservatives have their own media. Jon Stewart grew his most irate at FOX, but he facepalmed over CNN or HuffPo fairly often too.

I haven't checked recently, but I remember CNN being a /centrist/ network. When I see their coverage today, it seems basically identical in tone and content.

Frankly, placing those fact checkers on the same tier of presumption as "scientists" is /insane/. We have several /centuries/ of evidence for believing that even if many scientists are wrong about something, the truth will come out.

Here's a post on adventures in ai:

** /Machine Learning//AI/
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: machine-learningai
   :END:
So, here's a question, and I'm going to give you a mid-complexity answer. How on earth do we even make GAI? One step at a time.

I know that there's plenty of people who are knowledgeable in the area here, but I don't think we can actually stay away from discussing it for too long. In 2015 (oh dear it's been a year and a half now) SethBling came out with MarI/O - a neural net designed to play Super Mario World on the SNES. (link here: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44]]) During that time, I became infatuated with AI and machine learning in general, and read scholarly paper after scholarly paper on the subject. This was during the time when Andrej Karpathy wrote [[http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/]["The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks"]]

That article and SethBling's MarI/O ai ate about a 6-month period of my life, and I had a ton of fun with the basics of ai from a programming standpoint. If you find them as fun as I did, you might even start playing with the ai yourself! Anyway, Andrej has made his ai package publically available via Lua - (SUPER SLOW WITHOUT A GPU) there are versions which work with OpenCL and CUDA available on github, check it out. Additionally, and more simple to setup, you have MarI/O which is available to run via a pastebin post of his Lua code. You'll want to run the code on the latest version of BizHawk found here: [[http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources.html]]

After reading SethBling's original code, I noticed that there were a *LOT* of weaknesses in the code which I attempted to improve upon on my own git repo here: [[https://github.com/Dwood15/LuaNEAT-rnn]] For more information on what I saw wrong and attempted to fix, the readme on that page should suffice. On an existential note, this AI does not actually have any indication that there is anything going on other than Mario. That is its reality, its Biome, if you will.

** /What's happening in the code?/
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: whats-happening-in-the-code
   :END:
For those that have no desire to read the code, here's what's going on: First, we set up a lot of constants, we create a "Species" pool, and go from there. ([[/r/restofthefuckingowl]]) Sorry, this is all based off memory, and I'm lazy. Once we have the desired number of individuals and species for our generation, we run each one in mario, evaluating their fitness. Then we literally kill off the failures (delete them) and breed the ones that were acceptable according to our fitness function.

Originally, Sethbling's fitness function was merely just tracking how far to the right the ai would go, and penalized any delays whatsoever quite heavily. Instead, I chose to mess it up a bit. I have it so that no run ends early unless the ai hasn't transitioned the screen in a certain amount of time. This allowed me to ensure that the ai wasn't doing nothing, but at the same time, let me have it so I could go vertical or to the left, or down even.

Anyway, after all's done, each individual is "bred" with each other to produce a new individual or two, or three or four, which biases the ai towards progress, as defined by our fitness function and our culling function.

It does not adequately determine how different an ai is from another- if they all jumped off the cliff in the 2nd level, it would still pick the ones to the furthest right.

** This means, that for MarI/O, we need a new fitness function.

Anyway, I'm getting kind of rambly. It's late, so the post is getting cut abruptly. If this interested you, download my ai from my github here: ([[https://github.com/Dwood15/LuaNEAT-rnn]]) And run it on super mario world for the SNES! (BIZHAWK ONLY)

*** I disagree with some of your criticisms, particularly the ones about the fitness function. I think time is a valuable constraint since it prevents AI from sitting around and wasting time doing nothing. I agree that in some levels there are times when you need to go up or down or even left, but that's ultimately in service of eventually getting further to the right. If one AI blindly goes right and dies and the other takes its time and survives longer and gets further, then the second should score more. But if both paths are valid and both survive and get to the same final distance then the one who took the faster path should score more. Time should be worth fewer points than distance, but still be a measurable part of it.

Additionally, I don't think things like getting further into a pit is much of an issue. I haven't actually looked into or run the code myself, but as long as your breeding system is robust enough and has a decently large population, small advantages like that would have little impact compared to legitimate progress.

One possible solution to these issues (which only really occur in more complicated maps) would be to create lines through the map that indicate progress and have the fitness function measure how far along the line the AI got. So in normal circumstances it would just go right, but in levels where you have to go up a certain platform before resuming travel to the right, the line would bend upwards and reward AI who got higher up along it. Or something like that. You'd have to manually make a separate line for each level, but it'd make the fitness function more accurate for measuring progress in complicated levels.

  then the second should score more.

And that's the issue, in SethBling's code, the function has a harsh penalty for taking time. The first will almost always be a higher fitness in his code.

#+begin_quote
  small advantages like that would have little impact compared to legitimate progress.
#+end_quote

The fitness function does not account for that in the original code, and I struggled to create a fitness function to account for that myself. Part of why I left the code behind.

#+begin_quote
  lines through the map that indicate progress
#+end_quote

Right, that's a potential option, but there is a way to dynamically tell if a direction is the correct one in general. It however, does not define the exact correct path.

You should run SethBling's code on the first of level 2 in Super Mario World, as your understanding here would be greatly increased on what I'm talking about.

** Julian Jayne's [[http://www.meltingasphalt.com/hallucinated-gods/][Bicamaral Mind]] has been on my brain ever since I read about it, and it seems like a fascinating theory that maps closely to my own lived experiences, and it makes for a fascinating read. Even if the theory is totally wrong, it asks some important questions that no one else seemed to ask. Maybe the answers to those questions that Jaynes gets are wrong, but he's asking the right questions.

*** That was really interesting, and reminded me of how interesting split brained people are. Unfortunately, while reading about this I learned about "the functional hemispherectomy", which is probably the most horrifying thing I've learned of in a long time.

#+begin_quote
  If that is unnerving, try this on for size: In some cases, the hemispheres aren't just severed from each other. In the past, the right hemisphere would sometimes be completely removed (hemispherectomy). This could cause all kinds of complications, so eventually a new procedure was developed - the functional hemispherectomy - which severed all tissues supporting sensory input and motor output from the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere doesn't die, but it can no longer access any sensory information (sight, etc.) and it can no longer cause the body to move. At all. It just lives on, in the dark and silence, unable to do anything at all. These procedures are sometimes still performed. (Ben Carson was actually one of the pioneering neurosurgeons behind them!) [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/16/hardball-questions-for-the-next-debate/][Think about it.]]:

  #+begin_quote
    So my question for you is -- what do you think happens to that person who is in an empty hemisphere, locked out of all sensory input and motor control? Do you think they're conscious? Do you think they're wondering what happened? Do you think they're happy that the other half of them is living a happy normal life? Do they sit rapt in unconditioned contemplation of their own consciousness like an Aristotelian god? Or do they go mad with boredom, constantly desiring their own death but unable to effect it?

**** I think a way to test this would be to do a partial functional hemispherectomy. Instead of cutting off all sensory input and motor output, just limit some of the inputs and none of the outputs (e.g. functionally deafen the other hemisphere, but leave vision, touch, motor movement, etc. intact).

You would then monitor the patient to see if you can attribute any changes in behaviour to distress as a direct result of that operation. If not, it strongly implies that there is no "other person".

Of course, you'd rightly be denied ethics approval for any such experiment even if we found a drug that could have the same effect (or a reversible procedure). After all, if the hypothesis is true then we're mutilating another person (and even if it's false, we're mutilating one anyway).

You might be able to achieve the same result by putting an eyepatch on a patient who has had a corpus callostomy, but I don't know enough neurology to say.

**** That's great, thank you! The problem indeed becomes much simpler when you realize that we don't need to be needed for genuine reasons, only the feeling of need must be genuine, the reasons can be phony. The same approach also works for excitement, etc. Though maybe not for the sense of scientific discovery, not sure what to do with folks who want that.
