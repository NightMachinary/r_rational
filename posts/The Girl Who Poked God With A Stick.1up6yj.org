** Reminded me a bit of the later parts of [[http://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]] for spoilery reasons, and Vernor Vinge's Zones of Thought universe (where technological progress is more or less limited depending on where you are in the galaxy). I liked it, though it was one of those things that I might have liked better at novella length (although there are always risks that an unlikable protagonist can't carry a longer work).

*** I don't think it could have worked at novella length. The [[#s][ending]] ending is one that irritates me for how often it's used. The longer the story, the larger the plot, and the more difficulty I'd have swallowing that as an ending.
