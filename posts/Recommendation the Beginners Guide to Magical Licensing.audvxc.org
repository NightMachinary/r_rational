Off the bat I'd say this isn't a rational story. I can think of a couple of bizarre decisions / discrepancies in the protagonists behaviour.

But I think this story will appeal to people here. It's abut a corporate mage who discovers a new and potentially lucrative magical technique; and his battle with entrenched monopoly interests who're willing to play very dirty.

** Sounds kinda like /Unsong/ but less Jewish. (That's not particularly a criticism; fantasy books keep ripping each other off, on purpose or not on purpose, depending.)

*** I actually recommended it here shortly before Scott started unsong, so it was here first. I actually wondered if he saw it and it was part of his inspiration for the start but he said in a post it was something else years ago.
