** Damn, Juniper showing excellent tactical awareness as usual. This is one of those stories where the term "good general" is actually backed up by said generals making sound tactical decisions.

** Any bets as to what role the drow are gonna get when they merge with the main force?

So far I'm thinking saboteurs. They operate during the night, are good at moving fast and stealthy, are powerful, have experience fighting against single opponents and have tricks to confuse and retreat.

Give each a pack of goblin munitions and let them "hit and run" the opposing army during the night. Combined with traditional forces to fight during the day gives you a 24-hour working army.

*** If the opposing army ends up being the Dead King's, then I think they are the answer to "the dead can fight 24 hours a day but we can't"

**** Nice! Drow push back the assault during their peak, and the rest get their beauty sleep over the sound of skeletons getting pulled apart by Night.

*** If they actually keep their power from the previous book, you don't even need to fight during the day. There was that one drow which was supposed to be extremely weak as far as Mighty went that could create a giant surface of acid that melted everything it touched and caused real trouble to cat's demigod butt. Just sneak up on the camping enemy army and use that repeatedly, whole army dies more or less instantly with no way to counter. And if a hero shows up that can counter that trick, well, use a different one, they had a buttload of them. A single ten minute raid by a team of high-level drow should absolutely flatten any normal army without very specific heavy magical defences tailored to work against drow specifically.

It's like if in real life artillery cannons, the kind that can flatten a small bunker with one shell, could be used in handheld form and didn't require basically any supply lines.

**** Considering the sisters not only went through apotheosis but also added winter to the night, I don't see why the drow wouldn't have their powers anymore. Could be that the sisters need more focus or even power to deal with their new state, but so far there was no hard indication of that.

** With Cat thinking there might be a possibility that the powers of Night could somehow heal Nauk's mind (even if it is a longshot), it seems strange to me that she still has an injured leg.

Was there an explanation I missed for why she does not try to heal her leg with the power of Night? If she can contemplate healing a damaged mind, it seems like a leg should be child's play.

*** I'm pretty sure that this came up in story a chapter or two ago. The TLDR is yes, she could, but the constant pain// feebleness is a reminder that she is still a fallible mortal.

As we saw in this chapter, it's not like it takes much effort at all to overcome

*** Chapter 3, about Cat not fixing her leg.

  “Sometimes it's a good thing,” I said. “To remember what it feels like for the people who don't make pacts with gods.”

Winter!Cat also had a limp, but it didn't hurt or slow her down so it wasn't brought up much.

*** I think 6000 drow is the force Rumena was preparing to take a town with. That's why they were at a forward outpost. I think the drow force was stated to be around 50 thousands in a previous chapter.
