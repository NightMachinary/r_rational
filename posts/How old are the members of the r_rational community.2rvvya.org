** I interact with you guys fairly regularly, and consider us a community. Was just curious on the age demographic here. There's no real purpose to this, just satisfying my curiosity. I encourage as many people as possible to fill it out! I'll publish the results publicly, if people want, and of course it's *COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS*.
