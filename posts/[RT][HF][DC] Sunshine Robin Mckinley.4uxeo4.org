** Years ago, I heard about the movie /Sunshine/, where the sun goes out and a group of people take a spaceship there so they can nuke it and hopefully start it up again. I saw something in a magazine that made me think it was based on a book, so I went to the library, found this was only book in the catalog titled /Sunshine/, and checked it out.

It was not exactly what I expected.

I finished it anyway. I probably never would have read it if I knew what I was getting, because I was predisposed against vampire romances. I remember liking it far more than I expected, even though I can't recall many specific details or scenes. Still haven't seen the space movie.

*** the space movie was a bit odd and rather forgettable for me but the soundtrack is golden.

** This is a very good story that on reading it struck me as being a quite rational and intriguing set of world building. I'm almost certain it was done as a 'take that' deconstruction of either Twilight or Anne Rice novels (I suspect the later).

The protagonist is a baker in a mostly modern world that happens to also have magic and this is handled quite solidly.

The author did very effective research into what working in restaurants and kitchen professionals are like and captured "the feel" of that kind of work as a realized character.

It is not rationalist, but I would say the world is rational.

*** It rather predates twilight. .. I don't know if take that is the right term for it. It feels rather like Mckinley read some urban fantasy and went "What a neat idea, I can execute it much better". And then went and did so. It is a very good book.

**** hmmm yeah sorry, twilight and anne mcaffery as a cultural phenomena sort of bleed together for me.

So I actually read it when it was new because Mckinley was a bit of a staple of my childhood (family reading/pre bed story time) and my brother recommended it to me . I guess it was midway/near the end of the pre-twilight anne-mcaffery vampire craze, and magic realism/urban fantasy was rather strong too at the time too.

You mean Anne Rice, right? McCaffery writes about dragons.

** Just finished reading based on this recommendation. Greatly enjoyed the book, just bummed that there isn't going to be a sequel. The world is intriguing, and there is quite a lot of mystery left unsolved, for example, [spoiler](what makes the head of the SOF so strange?)
