** Incandescence and his Orthogonal trilogy are even harder. :) (He pretty much wrote an entire physics textbook for the Riemannian universe. (Orthogonal's premise is a universe with positive definite metric, ie, a universe that's almost the same as ours with the primary difference being that time and space are fully symmetric with each other. As far as Incandescence... well, a general relativity textbook could be counted as a spoiler (or a reader's guide) for Incandescence. :))

** Belated note: I love this book because it serves as a really good primer for Mathematical Universes. (By being flawed enough to leave people still wondering, but simultaneously introducing the concept)

** Perhaps a warning - not everyone agrees with me on this, but if you're averse to existential horror you may want to avoid this book.

**** Because it repeatedly creates solipsistic universes.

Some vague spoilers below... I'm not really giving away any plot points, but themes are presented flatly rather than being introduced through a story, which does change the experience. People who haven't read it yet should consider not continuing.

I've never read Egan's opinions on this book so I could be way off, but going just on the text, I think he was writing a horror novel intentionally. It starts out with a character gradually realizing he is essentially [[#s][]] . And it just gets worse from there.

On more than one occasion a character finds themselves in a world where nothing is real except their own consciousness, and even that's up for debate. More than one character self-mutilates his mind to where they become unrecognizable entities. This sort of self-mutilation seems to be pretty common, at least to some of them, as it's stated fairly matter-of-factly.

[[#s][quote from book]]

He is doubting the veracity of his own perceptions because he knows he can't be trusted with write-access to his own brain. It spirals downward from there. The desperate, hopeless isolation is palpable. The inevitable decent into insanity and self-destruction is overwhelming.

***** Wait... and [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] took this as positive inspiration?

Wow, in a small but significant way, that makes me feel way better about myself. My inspirational futurist lower bound is substantially nicer than that.

******* Oh good. I worry about him, sometimes, when for two whole minutes at a time he sounds like an [[/r/Futurology]] denizen just waiting for the opportunity to do something /really dumb/.

/shrug You'd have to ask him. As I said, not everyone agrees with my interpretation. :)
