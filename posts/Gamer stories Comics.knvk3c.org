I really like the gamer stories! Any particularly good ones? Its not a problem if they are translated, fanfiction or comic/manga. Now that i think about it, i really haven't read any rational comics either.


** Do you mean litrpgs, isekais where the MC is transported to a game world, or stories involving VR gaming in the real world?

*** They are probably talking about the [[https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-gamer/list?title_no=88][The Gamer]], a manhwa largely based in our world where the main character is the only one who has access to a game-like system, if I remember correctly. Fanfic crossovers with it are more popular than the original, as it's quite easy to think "But what if Frodo could spec into magic and just summon his own eagles?" and get to writing. The Erogamer has been mentioned numerous times on this sub, and that story is basically "What if The Gamer, but lewd (and better written)?"

**** Idk what kinds of stuff you'll like, but these are stuff that I enjoyed. To be honest, I haven't read too many novels like The Gamer, but The Novel's Extra kind of qualifies. It's technically an isekai, but many characters in The Gamer also have powers, so it's easier to consider it an alternative universe than “real life Earth”.

At the end of the day, The Novel's Extra is a flawed work. The system is not really interesting or creative, and the plot is kind of all over the place about half way through the story (which is about the point I dropped it). However, I rank it very highly among light novels for the things it does really well: - The characters have depth. Not a whole lot, but the MC has moments of quiet self-reflection about his circumstances, and the side characters' backgrounds and motivations are explored. - The plot progression is really great, at least in the beginning. The story moves quickly from one threat to another and each one feels unique. It's not just another powerful monster for the MC to beat, or a generic fight against some other character. - The author knows how to build anticipation. This is best evidenced when the MC challenges another character to an archery competition having never used a bow in his life. That whole competition is hyped really well and payoff is very satisfying.

If you want a really detailed system, then Delve is pretty good if you're okay with other characters also having access to the system. In this story, it's more about how people choose to distribute their skill points and which classes they try to gain access to. However, the story progression is really slow, and is often bogged down by math when the MC is trying to optimize his growth.

Another interesting idea is Leaves of Terranthir, in which, only the main character has access to the system and is reborn in a Dark Souls like world. In this one, the story revolves more about figuring out how the system and the world even works. It's a bit slow and there's not a whole lot of character interaction yet (MC meets the first living character about 15 chapters in).

** Solo Levelling Probably the closest to what you're looking for. Similar in nature to The Gamer in that you have a main character with video game powers in a world with non-levelling supernatural powers. Less whimsical, more gritty, death happens a fair bit. Korean web novel being converted into a manhwa. I'd recommend reading the manwha first until you run out and then picking up from the web novel.

"Greg Veder vs The World" is a The Gamer/Worm fusion fanfiction. I haven't checked up on it in a while so I don't quite remember where it's at. Main character has game type statistics but is not in a video game. Warning: Has a lot of the grittiness you'd expect from Worm.

"The City and the Dungeon" by Mathew Schmidtt is a good audiobook. Set in the near future, main character has game type statstics but so do all "Delvers".

"Dungeon Crawler Carl" used to be free on royal road, now the first book can be gotten from Amazon and I think the rest of the chapters are still available on Royal Road. Fantastic. Main character has game stats, and so do most others, but the nature of reality is a little bit uncertain. Each chapter has an afterword by the author where he chronicles his pug's valiant struggles against an army of clone infiltrators

"Worth the Candle" is a high fantasy type story available on Royal Road and AOOO. Main character has stats and is working through what appears to be a fantasy world. Nature of reality is heavily uncertain. Warning: Really heavy sometimes. Author chooses not to use content warnings.

"Street Cultivation" Audiobook series. Low powered street-level fantasy. Technically everyone has stats- Everyone has access to ki and it can be quantified using a phone app. I recommend it if you've got audiobook access but it's much more of an underdog story than the Deus Ex Machina stompfest that The Gamer tends to be.

*** I'd HARD de-rec Solo Leveling. Now I'm less of the rational-seeking type of reader here, commonly delving into the trash piles of Japanese, Chinese, and English webnovels(and god forbid, sometimes even MTL!), and even then Solo Leveling was one of the worse ones I've read.

After the MC gets his Gamer Power, his identity literally turns a complete 180, from a hardworking, average, and kind Korean teen to an aggressive mega-attractive Kpop star-looking asshole who responds to even the slightest provocation with death, all while acting very arrogant.

It's not wrong to say that he becomes the stereotypical Chinese webnovel protagonist, and that is NOT a good thing, given their propensity for violence, arrogance, and violence. He also really never uses his brain for any fights since his abilities are so broken, and then there's the extreme nationalism and the treatment of Japan and America. After the shit Japan pulls they literally call him his savior, and both America and China are licking his boots.

The ending was also quite a mess. The story is so unpolished that I wouldn't recommend it to anybody on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], and even on subs like [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]] I'd be very cautious about it. The only thing good about the series is the manhwa's art.

Worth the Candle and Dungeon Crawler Carl are fantastic though. WtC is praised enough on this sub, but I really appreciate what DCC does. I don't really like how over the top comedy is blended into a lot of stories, especially ones as dark as DCC, but DCC does it perfectly. It fits so well with the dark story without ever feeling out of place or unnecessary, I'd even say it's crucial to the atmosphere of the story, which I absolutely love. The writing is not a masterpiece but it's my favorite in how it blends in the humor so perfectly. For a web novel, Carl is surprisingly rational too, arguably showing more smarts than you see from the typical game system MC. I really enjoy watching him try to break the limits of the system constantly for one benefit or another.

**** My least favorite part about Solo Leveling is the fact that no one other than the MC can improve. Like what's the point of training or practicing if you're always stuck at the same rank regardless of what you do. Maybe this changes later, but I couldn't get past more than 30 chapters. The world just seemed very poorly thought out.

How you use your abilities matters as much as what they are.

Sure, but whether this can actually make a meaningful difference really depends on the design of the world. If you have a world like Worm, this can work because powers are so varied in scope and application. There's a lot of room for creative uses of ‘weak' powers.

But if you have fairly generic video game skills with limited scope (e.g. attacks deal poison, increased durability, etc.), this doesn't really work. At some point, diminishing returns from practice means that you'll reach the peak of what you can achieve with that skill.

Also, to make a setting like this work, you pretty much need the MC to have a ‘weak' skill that they use creatively. Or if they have have a strong skill, then there needs to be meaningful limitations or restrictions. Otherwise, it's basically a power trip with very little that's interesting in terms of plot. (Unless it's a parody of some kind, but that's a different discussion).

**** The Solo Levelling /manhua/ is great purely from a rule-of-cool spectacle sense. The plot and characters are pretty garbage, but it's sort of like complaining about the plot at a fireworks show. If the OP likes The Gamer they might even like the plot idk.

I'm not sure I really get the degree of praise for DCC, having only read the free chapters. It's fun, and the occasional cleverness can be interesting, but it feels bogged down by just how much of the story is the setting being gratuitously dickish. Everything ends up revolving around that to the detriment of depth in almost any aspect of the story; what the characters do, how they do it, the humor, the NPCs, etc. WtC also has a fucked up setting, but it's also a lot more than just that, whereas it's plausibly half the word count of DCC.

I'm not a fan of Solo Leveling, but criticizing the mc for being handsome is kind of silly. Which is all your character criticism seems to be. Because his appearance changes, your perception of him changes and so does the words you use for his traits. He continues being a kind (helps his family and friends), hardworking, timid korean kid.

​

Sociability level for instance, good looking people can be introverts, it just changes how they are perceived, instead of shy or quiet people see them as distant, arrogant, aloof, standoffish, cold etc.

​

Hardworking can just as easily be seen as arrogant, proud, aloof, assholish etc.

​

He's not particularly violent either, maybe something changes in the novel but he doesn't kill anybody in cold blood IIRC. The most he does is spar or face off people that are rude towards him or people he cares about, generally involving 'showing off his powerful aura'.

​

I'm not a fan of solo leveling though, I'd have dropped it already if my IRL friends didn't force me to read it so we can talk about it..

***** That's not really what I intend, but it's one of the signs. It's hard to explain. Why does the MC getting his Gamer Power(I know what it really is but let's just call it this) suddenly turn him from short and average kid into a tall, buff, supermodel-like person? I've completely read the web novel, and his appearance change is a big symptom and indication of his total personality change.

Whenever he meets that strong American hunter, he always acts cocky and looks like he's picking a fight or disrespecting him, and this is literally how he acts towards everyone. I wouldn't really put much into the fact that he's nice to his family, in every Korean web novel even the most evil and assholish of MCs are at least nice to their family. The MC's interpersonal relationships with people that aren't his friends are just terrible.

There's also that one guy he kills in the ice elf dungeon. Sure he was kinda an ass, but it's not like the MC did any reassuring or even tried to calm things down, especially when he just hopped into their group. These things are a lot more noticeable in the webnovel.

There's nothing wrong with being handsome, but I have issues with how the novel handles his transformation. His personality both pre and post Gamer Power is totally inconsistent, and even if you factor in how overpowered his Gamer Power is, that's a lot of dissonance still. It just feels incredibly cheap, the way everything is set up and handled.

That said, as long as you stick to only the manhwa and ignore the web novel and don't think critically about the story in any capacity, it's great.

Perhaps I just have my grievances against the edgier power fantasy novels.

****** Again I'm not a fan. It's a generic 'Look at how cool the author self insert is today' type of story. The plot and everything around is there just for that purpose.

I only read it because a friend kept recommending it to me and the art is good. It's too good for what it is in fact, 50-100 years ago that level of art would be museum worthy, it's insane that nowadays that's normally seen in popular korean webcomics.

My only problem was that your criticism of the main character seemed to be exclusively caused by the fact that he becomes handsome. Sure, that's something that didn't need to happen, it's silly power fantasy, harem type generic manhwa fluff. That type of thing is expected there, it happens before chapter 5 if that's an issue you should have dropped it there.

My view / point is that the MC didn't change, that's always who he was, it's just that in the beginning those traits seem different because people can more easily empathize with him than they can later on. Coupled with a general tendency some people have to disliking good looking individuals of the same sex as them.. This dislike can alter the way they see the character or person and label their traits more negatively than they would if the person wasn't good looking.

******* I'm sorry, but you may want to reread the first chunk of the manwha. You are completely wrong about this. The character you read about at the beginning is nothing like the character after he gets the power. If the story was self aware at all it could make the argument that power corrupts, but it never points out that he has stopped behaving like a human being with empathy.

Note that the whole thing is also available from Patreon [[https://www.patreon.com/dinniman]] for $3 / month. That means you can get the entire story, first to last, for $3. You don't get the cute Toby bits (his pug, not part of the book proper) and there are tiny differences between the three versions (Patreon, Royal Road, Amazon) -- a sentence added, a typo fixed -- but nothing that matters.

Also, the part that's on Amazon is in Kindle Unlimited, so you can read it free of you have a KU account.

I strongly recommend this series. It's brilliantly written and incredibly engaging.

** The Gamer has been ridiculously popular for fanfiction crossovers, but they're almost all written for the "Wow, cool!" factor rather than being rational.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/reader/][Kill Them All]] is a Worm/Gamer crossover where Taylor gets the Gamer powers instead of her usual bug control. It's a train ride of escalation, bad teenage decision making and some actual character growth, and is complete. I wouldn't call it rational, but it was a fun read.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-hardcore-game-gamer-40k-si.846904/][A Hardcore Game]] has a Gamer character inserted into Warhammer 40K. The writing quality is not great, but the character makes reasonable decisions, faces actual consequences for his actions, and real threats.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/siren-song-worm-x-the-gamer-oc.633613/reader/][Siren Song]] is another Gamer/Worm cross. One of Heartbreaker's children from the original story gets the Gamer powers. This actually makes him more sane rather than less. He exploits the system reasonably well, experiments with it, weighs the pros and cons of various social decisions, it's sort of rational. Long but probably dead now.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/reader/][A Daring Synthesis]] Another Worm crossover. Spacebattles loves Worm. This one has a canon-correct Greg Veder. In other words, 100% cringe. One of the few Gamer crossovers that has mental stats actually affect personality. Greg grows into it. Painfully. It feels very realistic, and given Greg's low starting point, it's rational enough.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/][The Games We Play]] The most well known one on this list. A cross over with early RWBY, it's better viewed as injecting a Gamer into a completely original world, since so little of the canon worldbuilding was complete by the time this was finished. Its own worldbuilding is very good, the Gamer makes good use of his abilities, but it does start to feel like a treadmill of bigger enemies, bigger numbers. Still, complete and fairly well written.

Why are these all Spacebattles? Because it's easy to find the stories and they have Reader Mode to make it easy to read.

** One manga I enjoyed with this premise is "So I'm a spider, so what?!" (Kumo desu ga, nani ka?!). The premise is a girl getting isekai'd as a low level spider in Generic RPG-land, and from there on just leveling up her way to godhood. I've read the manga, but apparently the LN (and upcoming anime) cover a bit more than just her personal journey. In general though I'd say it does a good job of balancing the typical grinding mechanics of this genre (which, let's face it, is basically the literary equivalent of a clicker game) with some good humor, carried mainly by a protagonist who is somewhat goofy and quirky.
