In Ra I swear I remember Exa being (uniquely) able to check if he's in a simulation and being able to unilaterally choose to remove himself from the simulation and get his own kara (body) in the base reality.


** This happened in [[https://qntm.org/scrap][Scrap Brain Zone]]. My impression is that Wheel in general have an API for cross-layer communication, which is usually not in use because it would foul the accuracy of the simulation. Exa derives that they're in a simulation because that's the only way there could be unaccounted intruders in the Wheel meeting.

I think Exa became real by Laura wide-area copying her entire surrounding out of Akasha. She probably doesn't have enough control to limit the range precisely. It doesn't seem like an action he deliberately takes.

** I think there's [[https://qntm.org/jesus][one instance of this here]] and another when an Exa in the Akashic record checks his simulated state once symmetry is broken with history. I'll edit this comment with the other one if someone doesn't post it first.

Ahh [[/u/FeepingCreature]] found the other one.
