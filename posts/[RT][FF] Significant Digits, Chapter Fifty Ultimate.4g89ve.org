**** Um. That it wouldn't stick the landing, and would ultimately be a "meh."

Aaaaand now I feel like a dick (I guess because I'm /being/ a dick?). But it is my honest, considered opinion, having read almost every chapter twice. I know that's not constructive at all; if you'd like more specific thoughts I can offer them privately, but this week is insane and it would have to be next.
