*** Disagree with it being important.

The game powers makes it completely seamless and the MC is indifferent.

MC basically forgets about it, occasionally mentioning:

"Oh, I'm pretty tall now. Weird."

"Why is she flirting with me? Oh yeah, I'm attractive now."

It has little plot relevance, and doesn't impact his decisions in any way.

***** Was intentionally ambiguous. I assert both that WtC is an important case, and also meant to be vague about the fact that in WtC there is only the one case of the phenomenon that OP asks about.

Now that you point it out it is a little odd that Joon reflects so little on his changing physique, given the extreme high fidelity Joon is written with.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He Who Fights With Monsters]] your body literally turns into magic as you level up. In addition to the obvious becoming physically stronger and more resistant to damage, you get more attractive and depend more on magic and less on physical things. You don't need to eat, or even breath.

But it is more a side effect rather than the direct method of getting more powerful.

***** Nah, there was a reason for that. Spoilers for late in arc 01:

The reason the menus had so many problems (like having missing or incorrect information, not integrating properly with people or integrating with animals instead) was because the menus were initially calibrated for an entirely different species on a another planet. However that species had been wiped out by the titular Homicidal aliens and the menu systems that had been launched already had to be hastily re-calibrated and redirected to Earth remotely which led to a slightly malfunctioning system.

On the one hand, yeah, I like pangolins and liked the ideas of non-human characters coming to grips with this stuff. But I wanted some kind of rationale behind it besides just that. Rule of cool is fun but I think it's more fun if there's some kind of internal logic behind it too.

**** That's not true. The pangolin undergoes significant changes as does another animal character who actually adopts the idea as a power set. This is in addition to a demon summoning character who allows his body to become more and more corrupted over time and the MC herself commenting on her new body type in the fourth volume and deciding to keep it. It's not a major plot point and was mostly included to display a dramatic shift in what the menu system in-universe can physically do but to say it's never relevant or pops up again isn't accurate.

** "I Am Going To Die In This Game-Like Dimension" is litrpg and has characters become progressively more weird looking as their stats go up. For example, one character start growing horns as a result of developing their affinity for a particular energy type.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29145/creep][Creep]] has body evolution to an extreme degree, although it isn't LitRPG. It's more of a superhero drama a bit like Worm with transhumanist themes (his powers are like Darwin from X-Men).

Some of the cultivation litrpg type fics have it, but tends to be subtle. For example, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31837/everybody-here-is-a-cultivation-idiot][Everybody Here is a Cultivation Idiot]] has some aspects of body evolution related to power levels. Written as more of a comedy (although with some dark themes). Gender-bender.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall][Defiance of the Fall]] also a combination of cultivation and LitRPG kind of fits. More serious and better written than EHIACI. The hero seems overly lucky at times, and bodily changes involved in power growth are mostly relatively subtle.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] is another cultivation world example, with some of the bodily changes being not-so-subtle. More on the well written side IMO, with more comedy than drama. No specific system, but more organically defined.

** The Erogamer gets sexier the more stat points she gets, starting at seriously overweight with associated psychological issues and quickly reaching "median 19 year old girl" level of attractiveness before things in general start getting crazier. It's a weird mix of erotica, heartwarming character development, and existential horror that wouldn't be out of place in a Lovecraft or Greg Egan novel.

** The New World has the main character become taller and denser and less biological as he levels up. By the latest chapters he weighs like 500 tons and is about 10 feet tall. It starts off strong imo but slowly tapers off into something barely passable. I'd recommend just reading until you don't enjoy it anymore.

Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends has this. Cultivators get True Bodies, which change their body fundamentally, such as one of the main character's bodies becoming less affected by physics. Other characters become taller and stronger, get tougher skin, more organs, etc. It's very consistent and has proper character development so far.
