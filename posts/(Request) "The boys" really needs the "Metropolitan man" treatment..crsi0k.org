I'm watching Amazon's "the boys" and it's quite enjoyable, haven't read the comic yet.

Might enjoy it more if the protagonists weren't constantly making mistakes.

Would love it if

!spoiler alert! Butcher was still working for the government

and used his limited resources to do the best impression of Lex Luther from metropolitan man he can.


** What mistakes in particular? The only one I can think of offhand was not doing a better job disposing of Translucent's skin. Aside from that, everything seemed pretty believable. Sure, doing an audit of all the newly-installed RF shielding after someone fires a bullet would be a good plan, but I personally would not have thought of it and the characters were under a lot more stress than I was.

*** I would think professionals can scan for hidden cameras, would find that hidden camera in that bear.

And the hidden camera on mesmeriser that burned them all.

I'm not saying I would do better, but would enjoy reading a hyper competent non super powered protagonist just pick them off one by one.

**** Choke them out.

Seriously, it doesn't matter how durable you are if you don't have super strength to deal with the numerous counters. His skin's may be indestructible, but that doesn't matter if you can't breathe.

Honestly, this is how Black Panther should have ended, with the special forces guy realizing that a battle between two 'invulnerable' foes wouldn't be won by punching or stabbing each other, but by cutting off the other guy's air supply in like 3 seconds with the proper hold.

**** There weren't good other options aside from fighting, and if you're going to fight someone wearing hardshell armor then your best bet is blunt impact. Piercing and cutting won't work but blunt force can be transmitted through the shell to internal organs or, if you're very lucky, induce spalling.

***** Running was the only sensible option. Hughie and Butcher die or are captured in that situation 999 times out of 1000 if they try to engage. You hit the guy with your vehicle, yell at Hughie to get in the car, and then leave as fast as possible, as opposed to casually strolling up to Translucent with a crowbar in hand like your some type of threat.

****** Oh, you're right, that started off with Butcher hitting him with the car. Yeah, they could have run for it at that point. Before or after, no -- Translucent was always between at least one of them and the door, if not both of them. If they did try to run (as opposed to drive), he's a full-time superhero so I'm going to assume he's got better cardio than either of them and could easily run them down in a foot chase. But yeah, there was a segment of time where they could have piled in the car and booked it.

*** Yeah I was iffy on it (them being normals) at first, but as it went it on, I felt like it worked much better thematically and narratively to have The Boys be normals. I also didn't much care for the comic and gave up on it pretty early, but enjoyed the heck out of the show.
