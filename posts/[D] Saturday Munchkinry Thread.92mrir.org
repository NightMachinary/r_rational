Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** R&D have announced their newest discovery: Antinertium. An object coated with a thin film of antinertium dodges the laws of conservation, as small fluctuations of forces applied to its outside through the coated areas are not transferred to the coated object. The material slowly normalises to its current external pressure (about 0.01 Pa/s, or 100 days to adjust from vacuum to 1 atm), and negates about 100 Pa of dynamic force. Going above its dynamic limit breaks the affected material permanently and immediately.

The material is going to be expensive to produce, about $1M/mÂ², but you project this to slowly drop a factor of 10 or so over the next couple of decades before levelling out. The material is nontoxic, thin, otherwise durable and applicable to most materials.

You have yet to announce this product to the world. What do you do with it? Who do you sell it to?

- Noise removal from scientific tools.

- Ion-thruster alternative; you need to be able to modulate pressure to avoid it just adjusting to the current environment, but it should be self-sustaining since the energy required to compress/decompress a small amount of air isn't very high.

*** What if you stack it in layers? Say you have a bunch of thin plastic 10 gram discs with the tops coated in this material. You take ten of these, put them on top of each other, then put the stack on a scale with the bare side down. What happens? Does the scale only measure 10 grams instead of the full hundred?

What if you flip the stack and put the coated side touching the scale? Does the scale then read 0 grams?

**** The scale will weigh 10 grams the first time, since that works as you expect. Never rest one on its face, though, since the coated object won't stop falling down due to gravity until the pressure exceeds the threshold. So it'll weigh 100 grams the second time and all of the surfaces will be broken.

I do think you can achieve flight with this, though I'm not sure how efficient it'll be.

***** Yeah. I'm more thinking about getting around the rocket equation and lifting massive amounts of raw material into space. With assembled goods, it might be tricky to distribute the weight, but sheets of metal would work.

Take a square meter of thin plastic film of negligible weight, coat one side in plastic. This can hold about 10 kg at rest without transferring the weight down through to the other side.

We want to move it around, so let's set the cargo limit at 5 kg per layer. 5 kg of iron spread out over one square meter gives us a sheet .64 mm thick. Is that the right thickness for construction in space? I dunno.

--------------

Aha! I figured out how to safely turn the effect on and off.

Step 1: Build a lightweight rectangular plastic enclosure with the special goo coating an inside surface. This prevents the object from resting on its goo face and shattering.

Step 2: place a thin sheet of metal within the plastic enclosure with small rails sticking out the side.

Step 3: Build a device which manipulates the external rails to lift the metal sheet off of the goo. When the metal is lifted, the weight is transferred through the device into the platform underneath.

I drew a picture: [[https://i.imgur.com/Hwon7o8.png]]

So what can you do with an adjustable ballast that costs 200000 dollars per kilogram and breaks if you jostle it too much?

You can build a [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Perpetual_Motion_by_Norman_Rockwell.jpg][perpetual motion machine]], obviously. Just have the ballasts on a wheel with them weightless going up and heavy going down. This will be useful in the distant future when all the stars have gone out.

But since the sun still exists, then the question becomes whether this is actually more cost effective than other forms of clean energy. I'm guessing no.

Let's see. With a perfectly efficient generator, raising a 5 kg Antinertium cell 1 meter and then letting it fall back down has the potential to create up to 49 Joules of usable energy. Energy output is higher the faster the wheel spins, but accelerate too fast, and the whole thing shatters.

For fun, let's put some of these on the original [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Wheel][Ferris Wheel]], and replace the motor with a generator. The wheel lifts the cells 80 metres, so each cell generates 3924 Joules per rotation (ignoring friction and whatnot), and the ride takes 9 minutes to complete a rotation. A Watt is a Joule per second, so each cell gives us an ouput of 7.27 Watts. Enough to power a small lightbulb.

For a device that costs a million dollars, that's not great. The lifting cycle could be sped up of course, but I don't think we're going to bring the cost down to anywhere near that of wind turbines ( ~80k dollar for a machine that outputs 10k Watts) according to [[http://www.windustry.org/how_much_do_wind_turbines_cost][this.]]

****** There are quick issues using this for getting to space; first it needs to be sealed lest the change in atmospheric pressure breaks it; secondly it has to be active since any static configuration will move the set point of the material in a couple of hours. This is fine if you're building an ion thruster alternative where the weight of these additions is irrelevant, but when getting to space you really don't have much headroom before gravity wins.

You can reduce some of these issues by launching off a high altitude aircraft, where the atmosphere is far thinner, which should make it easier to build within weight constraints. You might even be able to echew containment if you take a few days to ascend.

******* Hrm. So when the material adjusts to a new set point, it starts transferring the energy through again? In the scale example, the measured weight increases over the course of several days until it registers the full weight of the object, right?

If pressure is decreased, does the set-point instantly decrease? Say you add a sheet of metal, leave it for a while, add another, etc, until you have 50 kg sitting on top of the sheet. Then you lift up 40 kg of metal and then set it back down carefully. Does this instantly shatter the platform or is there a grace period?

******** An antinertium coat with a set point of 1000 Pa will constantly transfer 1000 Pa of pressure to the coated object, as long as the real external pressure is between 990 Pa and 1100 Pa. The set point moves at 0.01 Pa/s, so it takes 10000 seconds for the set point to change by 100 Pa.

In your example, if you lift up the 40 kg of metal, the coating immediately fails.

However, its special effect is going to do weird things when the pressures are mismatched; the right answer isn't obvious to me yet but it should be roughly equivalent to the coated object experiencing the external object as if it was time dilated such that its pressure was equal to the internally-experienced pressure, which means that the temperature as experienced from inside is scaled by that same factor. Vice-versa applies to the external object. I'll think about this more.

** Alright, so I have an illusionary magical system in which the magic can be attached and delivered through a sensory medium (light/sound waves, gases, maybe heat). In order to break out of an illusion that is delivered by a constantly emitting sensory medium you have to first prevent it from reaching whatever sensory organ it is targeting, then do the necessary procedure for escaping the illusion. So for example, if it is a flute, you have to plug your ears first and keep them plugged. The problem here is if someone, or a group of someones, cast illusions delivered through light and sound waves, then the only way to escape the illusion is to render yourself deaf and blind which is ridiculous.

So this is basically a reverse munchkinry question, there is an obviously overpowered exploitation and I need to find a way to limit it without gimping the entire branch of magic. If you see any other OP exploitations feel free to mention them too. I feel like this may be untenable.

*** This sounds a lot like Genjutsu from Naruto. Which is fine, but the thing is, when you have magic that can interact with the brain indirectly, through a sense, well, I've always thought it could ONLY be extremely overpowered.

Just make the person experience unbelievable pain. Enough pain can make someone unable to act. If you are unable to act, then you can just be killed or subdued by a second person.

The only thing I can think of is for people to have automatic self defense systems, with some sort of trigger (falling down, rapid blinking, etc) that automatically casts a spell that turns off all of your senses and then turns them back on.

But then you could counter that with a spell that is automatically set to just constantly emit a spell.

Maybe being a mage is so so so difficult because you have to internalize this self defense spell before you can ever deal with another mage.

I dont know. Illusionary magic is really tough, in my opinion.

I mostly agree, but I've seen instances where mind/illusion magic are underpowered (or should be) in which people can sense the magic before it reaches them and prevent the illusions from ever taking hold. So to me, it seems it'll be OP or completely useless against people that have been trained to fight it.

I've thought extensively about this and it seems almost impossible to deal with unless you remove somatory illusions from the magic's capabilities. But even then, you could simply render someone blind and deaf and it'll probably take them a second to recognize what happened and break out, but we're dealing with ninja in the Naruto universe so a second of being blind and deaf almost certainly means death. Maybe you can be conditioned to automatically/unconsciously flush foreign magic out of your system when a certain threshold of pain is experienced? Perhaps there might be an inherent problem with causing instantaneously crippling pain since there are many instances where people feel nothing at the time of a severe injury? Idk, mind magic is tough.

*** Sound waves are overpowered because they can't be blocked without completely leaving the area. Loud enough sound can be felt through your body.

But the gas transmission medium is interesting. If all illusion magic is gaseous, I can imagine people holding their breathe for a long time, and almost passing out, just to get a glimpse of reality before they take a deep breathe and fall back into the illusion. And if you know you are going to fight an illusionist, then you would want to wear bulky breathing equipment. If your setting is less technologically advanced, there could be superstitions about hanging pungeant stuff like onions around your neck to ward of the 'evil miasmas' of sorcerors.

*** The risk is always that the illusionist's victim will realize they're being fooled and ignore the illusion one way or another.

Based on the other post, I think you can make it work by adding a time component. Say it takes five seconds of sense delivery for the illusion to become absolutely believable, and it does so by degrees. It would also take five seconds of sense avoidance to undo it, again by degree. Plugging your ears for five seconds will render the flute bard's illusions completely obvious, and as soon as you unplug them you've got five seconds before they re-resolve. At that point you'll know what's fake and what's real. Similarly if you stop looking at a hypnotic light or stop inhaling a hallucinatory gas for even a few seconds their respective illusions dissipate from your mental frame.

Shorter times make the illusion easier to break, but also easier to establish, favoring quick-thinking illusionists against ignorant opponents. Longer times make both harder, favoring prepared illusionists against unprepared opponents.

***** I was imagining them fading into coherence over the course of their creation: visuals start out abstract or fuzzy, sounds quiet or indistinct, smells vague or artificial. They fade from perception the same way while ignored. A victim that can withdraw partway might be able to identify illusions from reality by examining them closely, but if they withdraw entirely the illusions would be obviously fake.

So an illusion that casts quickly has less persistence than one that casts slowly. It's not imprinted on the brain very deeply. An illusion that take a long time to fully resolve is a lot harder to ignore or forget.

*** Option: Limit the spells to being delivered through a single sense at a time. Thus, you might have to deafen yourself /or/ blind yourself to escape a given illusion, but not both at once.

A canny opponent might be able to use one sound-based illusion and /at the same time/ one sight-based illusion of the exact same thing - this can be broken out of by first closing your eyes (and escaping the sight-based illusion) and /then/ opening your eyes but blocking your ears (and thus escaping the sound-based illusion) - then you never need to render yourself entirely insensate.

*** What do you mean by "break out"? Closing your eyes doesn't let you ignore things in the real world because, for example, a real bus will hit you whether you see it coming or not. An illusory bus /will never hit you/. Similarly, an illusory bus isn't going to run you over even if you hear its engine, squealing brakes and tires, and blaring horn.

The illusory bus might make you turn around, or jump to the side, or some other action convenient to the spellcaster... or your steadfast quip, "I'm not going to fall for /that/ again" may prove ironic as a spellcaster playing the long game tricks you into ignoring a real bus.

**** Breaking out of the illusion is basically expelling the foreign magic out of your brain, preventing the caster from creating any more illusions. I probably should have clarified this, but what I was talking about was simply methods of delivering magic into another person's brain. So in the flute example, as long as your ears are receiving sensory information from the flute, the person with the flute will be able to conjure any illusion they wish (auditory, visual, somatory, olfactory, etc.).

Well, it's supposed to be extremely easy to escape, expelling foreign magic and blocking/plugging one of your senses (with magic) takes a fraction of a second with no incantations or gestures required, the only cost being that you can't use magic for anything else during that fraction of a second (so you can't break out of an illusion while casting a fireball). I had hoped it would be somewhat underpowered (at least on its own) so that it's only effective when used very subtly, or on someone that is already incapacitated/drugged or while the opponent is in the middle of something.

***** If magic is being delivered to your brain, why don't you just cast illusion magic on yourself to deliver interfering magic? You can't fill it with magic if it's already filled up.

Better yet, in a world where illusion magic is real and humans/animals evolved alongside it, they probably /already/ have some latent magic in their brains that needs to be overcome.

Since this /saves/ you from the magic and automatically /throws/ it out of your brain, you could call this natural resistance something like a 'saving throw'. It usually blocks illusions naturally unless the caster is much stronger than the target, or the caster is doing it sneaky enough that the body doesn't realize or isn't ready to fight it off (eg, they have disadvantage).
