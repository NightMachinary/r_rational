** Enjoyable chapter although, correct me if I'm wrong, this seems a little shorter than usual. Or did I just read through it quickly?

I'm loving your take on Orochimaru. He's very compelling, and a lot more interesting than a lot of the standard Orochimaru's used in fanfiction. The fact that Orochimaru is the head of an entire country is never properly addressed, in my opinion. Anyone with the intelligence and power to do that has to have some depth. Overall, great story so far. I like.

*** No, this is short. It's 3333 words[1]; the first few chapters were 8-9k, the middle ones were about 5k, and these last three have been around 3500. As a very rough rule of thumb, there's about 300 words on an average paperback-book page, so you can get a sense of what the counts mean.

It's been getting shorter because I've been focusing more on for-sale stuff, but I'd like to try to get back to longer chapters again. We'll see.

[1] I was going to just say '3300' but the coincidence amused me.

**** Ah, I see. Cool then. Also I have to say, I thought it was hilarious how there was that little bait-and-switch type moment with Hinata, when she walks in and starts undressing with Shino in the bathroom. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who was very confused by this supposed OOC-ness, and then you brought it back around when it was pointed out and we all realize that, rationally, in a house full of people that see through walls as a matter of habit, nudity is immaterial in the Hyuuga household. I chuckled.

** And today class, we see an example of a second-level deception being perpetrated on a first-level player.

Notice how honesty is mixed with deception in an attempt to attack the target's deeply held insecurities as a method to bypass the training and pre-existing personal traits that would otherwise make him clam up and ignore anything the deceiver says. By using this method, the target listens and understands the argument - if even only to try to prove it wrong to themselves.

By phrasing it as a hypothetical and again hitting the goal state or utility function of the target - in this case, a need to become stronger, fast - the deceiver attempts to subtly influence the target's decision without actually asking in a manner that could easily be rebuffed.

Notice also the constant shift between statements intended to make the target angry, and apologetic in order to confuse the target, who is unsure of what they are feeling. The claim of psychopathy as if a disability may even instill feelings of guilt in the target. "This poor man can't help himself but to be offensive, he doesn't know any better. Why then are you so angry?"

And in the end, the short term goal is for more information about the target. With that, the deceiver can tailor his future tactics even better.

All in all, a master at work in deception and interrogation. Write this down. It will be on the test.

** And once more we see how Orochimaru tries to sway people to his side. Interesting to see this Naruto was raised by foster family - no living by himself at four here! I'm also wondering what's up with the Kyuubi, trying to grab Naruto's chakra and all - honestly not something I would have expected it to do. Maybe it's badly injured from the attack Naruto used on the Sound ninja, considering it's basically a living mass of Chakra?

Nice to see consistency with how you've portrayed the Hyuuga, what with Hinata not possessing any body shame and just casually disrobing while Shino was in the room. She didn't click there was a problem till Anko mentioned it either, and then seemed embarrassed moreso for the fact she must've been making the situation very awkward for her team-mate than anything else.

**** I agree with this point. I believe this is what's happening. Even if Naruto's completely drained of his own chakra, the fox's chakra is known to be so much more massive, it's not worth comparing. There's no reason for him to try and take any chakra that's pumped into Naruto, unless it's unhealthy (maybe curse sealed or Orochimaru infected?) or it used a bunch of its chakra to do something (and, unless this is different than both canon and almost every other fanfic out there, the usage of the fox's chakra would've been noticed) And even then, I highly doubt it would bother risking Naruto's life for the petty amount of chakra he'd get in return, and I highly doubt the Fourth's seal would let it take any, regardless.

My theory here is that Orochimaru is using this as a convenient excuse to keep Naruto laid up. I presume his chakra levels had already stabilized, and now Orochimaru is having his chakra drained periodically to fill the battery. The draining also provides him with a convenient excuse to keep Naruto detained, under the guise of his chakra not producing.

He lived on his own after a while -- I think I put it at either 6 or 8, I would need to check my timeline. I don't know what's up with Kishi, but kids just cannot do the things that he claims. Child soldiers at 12 after four years of study? Absolutely, right there with you. ANBU captain at 6? No way. Live alone at 4 and don't die? Hell no.

And yes, that was exactly Hinata's reaction. She has no body modesty at all, she was just upset on Shino's behalf.

****** Because a central conceit of the shonen genre is that there is no upper limit to the curve of human ability - if you train long and hard enough (and have enough passion), you can literally headbutt mountains in half without superpowers.

Itachi is one of the purest examples, but the whole setting is full of people so far off the curve that they can casually slaughter armies. To achieve S-rank means you have transcended the limits of humanity, and can exempt yourself from any force - physics to geopolitics - with a simple act of will.

Nietzsche would be proud.

******* [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] makes a good point about the "no upper limit in shonen", but yeah -- a 6 year old simple cannot be a chunin. It takes four years to make genin and then usually another year to make chunin. Assume you're so good you can get that down to two years instead of five. That means you started training at age four, when you're hardly even a self-sufficient human.

And yes, I realize the oddness of saying "throwing around giant energy blasts that tear the fabric of space and time? No problem!" given that I then turn around and say "chunin at 6? Not bloody likely!"

******** It all comes down to consistency, I guess. For me, especially in the beginning, Naruto took itself fairly seriously. Adult ninja couldn't be touched by fresh genin. It took training and determination to get strong. You got the impression that strength was earned in Naruto, as opposed to being handed to you (I'm looking at you, Gohan!)

Haku was good, but we got the impression that, despite Zabuza's bluster, he wasn't that good. Good enough to beat two fresh genin, but probably couldn't take Kakashi, so probably around chunin level. Chakra wasn't like ki. It had some pseudo science behind it, and was clearly a precious resource (cite Kakashi on the Wave mission)

So for a show that seemed fairly consistent (can't say normal. Come on, they were flinging around water dragons!) it didn't jive that you had 6 year olds who were as good as 15 year olds. It just wouldn't work, physically speaking, no matter how you train them, bloodlines and jinchuuriki not withstanding since, ya know, shonen. But that didn't even become a huge factor until near the end of Part I anyway.

********** Yes. In a way. Even though, in the Wave Mission arc, Kakashi gave off a big line about how there were people in the world "younger than Naruto, but stronger than him", you don't see much evidence of that. Adult ninja are kicking the 12 year old's asses all over, as it should be. Zabuza's water clone (which was 1/10 as strong) took Naruto and Sasuke teaming up pretty hard to beat it, while the original stayed stationary. Orochimaru dominated Sasuke and Naruto effortlessly in the Chunin exams. Itachi beat Sasuke one-handed. Kabuto wrecked Naruto thoroughly, and was only taken down because of Tsunade stepping back into things with the assist.

Don't get me wrong, the whole 6 year old Chunin thing is established from the get go. But the evidence of it isn't displayed in the story at all. It's moreso just brought up but never actually shown. As far as actual in canon fighting, the skill gaps are pretty well defined until we hit the Sasuke Retrieval arc. I'm just saying that even though it's mentioned, there was no evidence, so you could almost ignore such a possibility.

Just because someone is a sociopath with inscrutable values is no reason to automatically assume him to be the enemy. It would really be delightful, if Orochimaru turned out to be a hero instead of a villain. Perhaps he has some well justified utilitarian reasoning behind his actions just as he says. Perhaps he really is doing the best he can to make Elemental nations a better place to exist.

Also, Simurgh gets way more hate than she deserves. To me it looked like she was primarily responsible for averting an extinction event.

***** The Simurgh gets the hate she gets because of what she represents. It's a long accepted fact that free will and choice are core facets of being human. To have something that damages you and alters you to the point that no action you do is your own, in such a way that you can't even /perceive/ said alteration? It's terrifying. With pretty much every other threat in Worm (Exceptions are people like Greyboy and Bonesaw, I'm thinking) the threat is more...tangible? It's scary and threatening but, once it's over, you're good, if you aren't dead. You may be crippled or injured, but you can make it. With the Simurgh, you go through the rest of your life causing destruction, or waiting to cause destruction. Branded like an animal. Caged. And there's no defense except not being there. And considering she flies and moves at speeds most people can't react to in time, it's more like "pray to God she doesn't visit my city". Behemoth, Leviathan, S9...these threats were all fairly straightforward. Get caught by them, die or be really injured. Same as any natural disaster. The simurgh is a sentence. A sentence to what's as close to a cursed existence as is possible to get in a world without actual, magical fate and destiny

The situation is similar with Orochimaru.
