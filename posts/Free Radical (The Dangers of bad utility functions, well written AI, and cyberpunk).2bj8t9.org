** Repost, but I don't think it got nearly enough attention last time.

It's damn good cyberpunk, written by a programmer. An actual honest to gods programmer. Which puts the technology a head above most cyberpunk, which is a weird sort of dystopia fetishism.

I don't think I'd be spoiling it if I told you that AI was the central conflict of the story. But he does a very good job deconstructing the "[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot][A.I. Is a Crapshoot]]" trope.

** I read this a while back. I enjoyed it a lot, but thought that the first third/half was better than what followed - in part because this is a fictionalization of a videogame, and it sort of shows. It lends a lot of believability to the cyberpunk setting.
