** This was great :) Particularly loved the "moral crises" the doctor had and Alice's response.

** That was quite hilarious. The O5 response was appropriate, too. Considering what [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3000][else]] the foundation has to do for good amnestics, though, I worry if it lets them too far off the hook.

  Since all communication by an instance of SCP-3171 can be overheard by neighboring instances, SCP-3171 developed a rudimentary version of public key cryptography to communicate privately.
#+end_quote

So, uh, how would this work, considering that the private key wouldn't actually be private?

*** Diffie-Hellman key exchange creates a key that both parties know without an outside observer being able to figure it out. It relies on some clever mathematical "tricks", and on the difficulty of reversing some mathematical operations.

*** It's completely possible that I'm very confused here (my understanding of crypto is weak) but why wouldn't the private key be private?
