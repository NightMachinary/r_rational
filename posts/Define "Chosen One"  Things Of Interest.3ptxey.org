** Just want to clarify that this was part of my "30 First Drafts" project of November 2010 and was probably written in about two hours flat, making almost no use whatsoever of the backspace key. This is the reason for those strangulatingly bad run-on sentences.

*** Do you have any plans for NaNo 2015? I really enjoyed 30 First Drafts; it's hard to believe that was five years ago.

*** To be honest, I /kinda/ liked some of those run on sentences. Most of them.

*** Content has been a bit slow. I keep some filler to try to prop this sub up during slow times, in a vain attempt to keep it alive.

** I remember that this sort of happened in [[#s][book title]], but are there any other examples of multiple chosen ones?

*** It's a plot point in the [[#s][book title]] that the prophecy was adjusted in secret to match the "chosen one", rather than the other way around.
