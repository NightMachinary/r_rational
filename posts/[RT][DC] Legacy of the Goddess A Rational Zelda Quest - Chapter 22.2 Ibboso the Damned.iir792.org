** A report:

Two hours and sixteen minutes prior to my most recent update, Link and his party departed their campsite on horseback. One hour and two minutes later, at approximately five hundred and fourteen meters from their supposed destination, the party dismounted and proceeded on foot. They stopped in front of an obelisk of unknown construction and unknown origin for a period of twelve minutes, twenty-six seconds. At this time I sensed a potent magical presence and attempted to inform Link of such. I received no response or acknowledgement.

Notably, I observed no communication between members of the party during the interval between them dismounting and the aforementioned event. My models overwhelmingly suggested Link and the others were being adversely mentally influenced by the aforementioned magical presence. I attempted to inform Link of such and received no response or acknowledgement. I unsuccessfully attempted to Compel Link to leave the area. It was at this point I alerted Zelda to the potential danger.

Three minutes and thirty-five seconds later, the party entered the pass. Eleven minutes later, they came upon the ruins of a small town. From my observation of the weathering patterns of the stone buildings, I estimated the age of the ruins to be between three-hundred and eight-hundred years old. The ruins appeared to be uninhabited. I attempted to inform Link of such and received no response or acknowledgement.

Upon entering the ruins, the party came to a halt for a period of one minute, twelve seconds. At this time, I noted adrenal stress responses from each of the party members and informed Zelda of such. I also observed that Ryn was using magic at an unusually high frequency. As per Zelda's suggestion, I restored Ryn's magic and again attempted to Compel Link and the others to flee the location. The attempt was unsuccessful.

Grenja, Koja, and Ryn then proceeded to the remains of a stone building approximately forty-three meters away. Thirty-three seconds later, Link sprinted to the same location. The party remained at this location for thirty-one minutes. During this interval I observed no communication. Additionally, the party continued to exhibit signs of physiological and psychological stress.

At this time, Link and Ryn departed the building and proceeded to the remains of a ritual burial site on a hill overlooking the town. They arrived at its central structure four minutes and twenty-nine seconds later. After eight minutes of inaction, Link used approximately seventy-three percent of his magical reserves on a single Soothe effect. As per standard operating procedure, I restored his magic. One minute, twelve seconds later, Link used Invigorate at his observed maximum capacity, consuming sixty-five percent of his reserves, and then Scry moments later. It then that I ceased being able to sense his presence.

** *Announcement:*

My co-QMs are strongly in favor of moving the quest back to SV, and despite my other objections, I have been convinced of the merits. As the [[https://discordapp.com/channels/196309529850281984/588230711987798026/744749079032103023][Discord poll]] was a resounding "¯\/(ツ)//¯", we will be moving back to SV in the coming days. Given the prior retcon, this will be a new thread since it will be less hassle to post the chapters anew than to edit old ones in the old thread. As such, please hoId off on voting until the new quest thread is announced.

(One of us will continue to crosspost to r/r -- voting just won't happen here. You can also [[https://chaossnek.com/Account/UpdatePreferences][subscribe]] directly on the site if you just want story updates.)

** Hi, longtime reader/lurker of LotG here. This chapter was super depressing to read--I've been invested in Link's character arc since the beginning, and I don't want it to come to a close. Losing him has been really demoralizing and it'll take me some time to process what's happened.

​

For a variety of reasons, my life circumstances haven't permitted me to be an active participant in this quest, but I wanted to wish the current active participants the best of luck and--as a personal request--ask that they try their darndest to get Link back. I don't know whether his consciousness can be saved from whatever Ibosso has done to him, but I really hope it can be.

**** Thank you for letting me know, I'll keep an eye out. And thank you for writing LotG thus far, the quest has been truly incredible.

** Welp, I'm dropping reading this quest. There's a sweet spot between being GRRM and killing everyone and plot armor always saving the day, and this isn't it. I would also be okay if we could see the "show" behind Ganondorfs plan, revel in a villian succeeding, but with the "tell" we are given, we can't. So... I as a reader don't care about the characters left sufficiently.

My advice is to offer to redo the last arc, with some serious penalty, but I doubt that anyone will see this.

**** At the end of 22.2, it was very likely that Ibosso had taken over Link's body, which would either involve extinguishing Link's consciousness or merely "pushing it out of the driver's seat." If the former were true, Link would be dead. If the latter were true, while the situation would be less dire, Link would no longer be a player character.

And that's before we even ask whether Link's team of Sheikah survived.

If you're coming from chapter 23, then you probably already know the answers to a lot of these questions.
