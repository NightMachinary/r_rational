Isn't that the whole point of that phrase?

  When Nightmare Moon's rebellion tore across Equestria, leaving a trail of blood and horror in its wake, Princess Celestia knew that merely banishing her sister wouldn't be enough. Her army was too powerful, and too bloodthirsty, to be left behind without a leader. When she finally turned the Elements of Harmony against her, she didn't just banish Nightmare Moon. She banished thousands.

  Now they're in a race against time, to find a way to survive in an environment so alien that every aspect of it is trying to kill them. They face suffocation, freezing, boiling, starvation, radiation, meteorite impacts, low gravity... the list goes on.

  Nightmare Moon thought she should be the ruler of all Equestria. Now, in a world nopony was ever meant to survive, her abilities will be put to the ultimate test.

  Updates Saturdays.

An AU story where Celestia banished not only her sister to the moon, but her entire army as well. Now the thousands of ponies under Luna's command must find a way to survive on the moon with nothing to rely on but medieval technology, alchemical knowledge, and a little magical assistance.

This isn't a story about battles and sieges. This is a story about engineering and logistics. Watching Lord Commander Iron Quill and his ragtag team of advisers tackle problem after problem just to keep the army breathing is a delight.

There's a subplot early on about the army not respecting Iron Quill (who has been newly promoted from his previous position as master of stores) and him having to prove how badass he is to gain their respect, which I didn't much care for, but now that's been resolved and the story can focus on its real strengths.

*** Not many people post to this subreddit, but there are a bunch of readers who come here. This makes it easy for one person to start a trend. Recently, the sub started shifting more toward Worm fanfics. Now it's ponies again. The pony fics are pretty well entrenched in this sub's history, actually. We've got [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]] and other [[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1857/folder/4096/canon-compatible-optimalverse?order=rating][Optimalverse]] stories like [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][Caelum Est Conterrens]]. Then there are a bunch of stories where the authors just happened to be in the LessWrong group, which resulted in stories like [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal][Mortal]] and [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]]. There are more, but you get the point.

This is one of them. It's like the bastard child of Frostpunk and OxygenNotIncluded. I approve.
