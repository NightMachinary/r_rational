** Unpopular opinion; while I like Fiona I really wish she would get her own story so we could focus on Milo & co. Milo's D&D antics > muggle antics.

*** I'm one of those pro-Fiona people, but I am willing to admit that what I really want is a story whose premise is "someone trying to infiltrate wizarding society and break the masquerade". The fact that it's grafted onto this story probably doesn't do it many favors.

(I started writing my own story along those lines, but it wasn't working well enough to continue with.)

*** The author kinda agrees: [[http://sirpoley.tumblr.com/post/101111757091/you-need-to-make-an-entirely-separate-fanfic-of-fiona]]

Although the issue being adressed there is more about underrepresentation rather than Fiona and Co. getting in the way of the "main" story.

**** I think the problem is that Fiona, in some sense, has the least power compared to the problem she's trying to solve, which puts her in the most jeopardy and is a huge gravitational force attracting the story to her. Same reason HPMOR's perspective shifted hard toward Hermione after Ch. 63; Harry had become too powerful post-63, and couldn't be the center of the story again until the threats had amped up far enough to balance, but the threats couldn't come out of thin air, so they had to develop out of the story, but the story couldn't center on Harry until the new threats appeared, etcetera.

*** I wish she would her own story, because her own story is now so much more interesting than the Milo story. :-)

I think she's the first Muggle character of interest I've read in any HP fanfic, and the first time I've seen the plot of Muggles trying to reveal wizarding society...

**** There's actually several fics doing that, although generally more organisation-based rather than a single person doing detective work. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]] has an infiltration, and the sequel of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/40/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]] also touches on it.

** I understand that Polymorph would wreck the story, but Milo avoiding it because it's too broken still seems tremendously out of character to me.

*** Avoiding Polymorph because it's so broken was actually pretty popular back on the old D&D 3.5 Character Optimization boards. Milo has a lot of their other quirks too, like a love of Benign Transposition and the Spontaneous Divination option. On the other hand, he's broken much more serious taboos before.

Story-wise, having Milo be able to pull new forms out of nowhere is a lot less satisfying than his limited list of abilities. And a lot of challenges would be negated by his options to be a 7-headed hydra or an invisible flying will-o-wisp.

*** I's mentioned a few times (the last one in chapter 10 I think) that if you try to use something /too broken/, you'll feel the wrath of the gods (and DM).

And presumably, Milo doesn't feel ready (yet) to challenge the gods (and the DM).
