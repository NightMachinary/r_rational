** I liked this.

Not the usual fare for this sub, and a bit more tell than show, but nonetheless a good instance of rational fiction with low stakes

**** It's a short story so you have more leeway in this regard, but a lot of their relationships are established through them outright saying it.

Exposition is not a mortal sin, of course, but at times it feels stilted.

Overall I liked it, as I've said, I'm a sucker for rational stories outside of the usual fantasy/sci-fi paradigm
