** I know it's sort of been hinted at before, but that meeting with "his mom" really drove home for me the fact that June had a /shitty/ childhood. It really shouldn't be a surprise that he turned out like he did. Also, this definitely means he'll be meeting "his dad" too at some point, even if he doesn't interact with the entire cast of doppelgangers.

Also, is it just me, or was that last June/Amaryllis conversation unusually... jovial? Like, there was a lot more joking and smiling going on than there usually is when the two of them talk. I really liked it, especially coming off the Bethel thing. June feels like he's slowly getting himself into a healthier place, in part because he keeps being forced to confront and work through issues from his past (like with his mom, here) and in part because he's got a lot of people who care about him and are looking out for him now.

***** i agree that that's probably *part* of it, but I don't think that's the whole story. If the non-juniper characters turn out to be philosophical zombies and this was *just* an extended therapy simulation, then that would invalidate all of these experiences that Juniper is having *because none of it is real*.

My suspicion is that this is an Earth that got a kinda sorta benevolent ASI a bit early, and that ASI decided to create Aerb as a real simulated world in order to help Juniper overcome his past, by providing him with a community of people with cultural and psychological baggage in common with him. As Juniper overcomes his own traumas and steps into the light of a better future, so will the people of Aerb. Also, the Dungeon Master is obviously just future Juniper with some wacky simulated time travel shenanigans, made possible by a *probably* friendly ASI. The Arthur who became Uther probably isn't the original one from Juniper's Earth per se, but a simulated copy that the ASI created by predicting what kind of person Arthur was with a high degree of fidelity, based on how he impacted Juniper while he was alive.

Also, the part where Palida said that too much power corrupts everyone including herself, probably is foreshadowing. The DM at one point promised Juniper that he could become the Dungeon Master, the new god of Aerb, or something along those lines. I'm guessing that if one goes back and looks over the chapter where that was said it's probably worded very carefully. Probably the Dungeon Master just said that Juniper would become Dungeon Master and would become a God, but did not say that he would become the ONLY god of Aerb--because maybe all the mortals of Aerb ascend to godhood rather than just Juniper. I don't remember which chapter I'd have to look back at to verify this though.

He taught himself to stop processing language in order to filter out his parents arguing. That was a pretty big holy shit moment.

The terribleness of his home life does shed some light on how attached he was to his small group of friends, and devastated when Arthur died. With his family being so awful Arthur was his main support system, and he didn't have any way to process his death.

Random thought, he used to escape into fantasy to escape his parents in the form of worldbuilding, now he has literally escaped his parents and problems by moving into a fantasy world.

She never believed me when I said that I was out with friends, she never believed which friends I was with, she didn't believe that I wasn't smoking pot, that I wasn't autistic, that I wasn't gay, and maybe some of it was just the kind of paranoia that a lot of parents had, but it had been grating.

** I have or had this deeply misplaced hope that for some reason the Draconic Confederacy would decide to be merciful. Now that I think of it, I bet the Second Empire also had little success using soul magic on dragons. /That/ would be too easy. On the same note: Would the good relations between the dragons and the hells curtail Valencia's influence?

My understanding of relative power is that Bethel could probably win in combat with one or two dragons, especially because she has a few wishes daily, but the political implications are probably untenable.

This latest chapter explores the original meaning of its title: the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. First the tabletop party, and now the kharass.

I can't help but think a manic water mage is literally a disaster waiting to happen. Maybe this incarnation of his mother has (occasional?) depression but not mania.

Water as depression checks out, unifying the chapter nicely.

  deeply misplaced hope that for some reason the Draconic Confederacy would decide to be merciful
#+end_quote

The Draconic Confederacy is so depressingly irrational for a bunch of uber-immortals. Reading about their strained relations with the rest of the mortal species just makes me wonder if they're fundamentally incapable of fighting their genetic predispositions or if their alliance at large is ruled by the bell curve and the tragedy of the commons. Their desire to control airspace is probably an innate territoriality or tied to their pride, but it still feels like such a horrible waste of political capital given this fresh example of overwhelming strongarm negotiation. For all their longevity, it seems like the majority of dragons are blind to their self-destructive trend. So now they're endangered. Screw Violations Officers, they're desperately in need of a public relations officer. And maybe the narratively-savvy Perisev should ring up the DM for some quick therapy / gene-editing.

In other news, why does the Confederacy want Cpt. Blue Bottle dead? (There's a smallish chance Perisev is pushing her own agenda as the Confederacy's will and never intended to honor their agreement but seems unlikely) Besides the obvious follow-up of why the hundreds of dragons can't do it themselves, what did the Captain do to offend them? Or possibly related: like Joon asked, what's Perisev's game (not sorry) revealing the dracicide? Her implication was that it was a move to array the D.C. against any possible return of Uther / new Uther-like figure. But then some way through the negotiations, she just happens to give Joon a 'quest'? Full well knowing how the quest features in Uther's oeuvre. Joon gave away a lot of confirmations during their chat but maybe this is just bait to /prove/ Joon is the new Uther. Casually agreeing to end exclusions /cue eyeroll/

Plus, why is her title 'the Wretched'?

Well, what did she accomplish? She's arranged for Juniper to reveal himself to the world at large, and she's arranged for the dragons to oppose him. She also believes that opposing him is suicidal.

It was stated that dragons don't really care about each other. Perisev seems to care even less than is usual for them --- if Tommul had some respect for "the dragonkind" as a concept and was offended on its behalf by Uther's slaughter, Perisev seemed entirely unperturbed.

I'm guessing she wants to kill off the majority of the remaining dragons (herself excluded) using Juniper as a tool (possibly because she sees them as a threat to herself). The Wretched indeed.

They're slowly dying off and they live long enough to see long term patterns: they're sapient, so they can put 2 and 2 together.

If long lived dragons start banding together to talk to people, after centuries of not banding together, and then they start dying, they will draw back, not rush forward.

The trope can be seen all over the place in fantasy, dragons, elves, even dwarves in the worlds they are long lived. Long lived beings are notoriously slow to adapt to a quickly changing world. Tommul is listed as 2000 years old, Uther's time and all the changes it brought were recent for him.

  (((This is probably the part where you're wondering to yourself, ‘but I thought Juniper was our narrator, how does he know, and why is he talking in the third person?', and here, safely hidden within triple parentheticals, I can tell you: some of this might not actually have happened in precisely these ways. We're operating under really loose definitions of ‘actually happened' already, but I don't just mean that it ‘might not have happened' in the sense that people might just disappear as soon as I stop looking at them, only to have an interstitial history written for them in accordance with the demands of the narrative as dictated by the Dungeon Master as soon as they become relevant to me again. Here, I mean ‘might not have actually happened' in the sense that this is a recreation of sorts, me working backwards from information that I didn't have at the end of the last chapter, and won't have at the end of this one. The thing is, if you learned it like I learned it, it would be a drawn out, incomprehensible mess, so this is a little bit of poetic license and extrapolation on my part in order to present something coherent. I hope you don't mind.)))

*** It's slightly complicated. The suggestion of [[/u/Gr_Cheese]] that Juniper breaks the fourth wall in triple parentheses isn't exactly accurate, either.

Juniper narrates with a lot of asides and comments, some of which break the fourth wall. The first example is way back in chapter two, when describing Amaryllis.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not really sure what protocol is here, in terms of prose. I mean, I don't want to sound like a creep, so maybe I should stay as generic as possible and tell you [...] And if that analogy sounds a little bit frightening to you, then I think it did its job, because [...]
#+end_quote

WtC is narrated with knowledge of future events, but not unlimited knowledge. In Amaryllis' first POV chapter, she references the Cannibal implicitly in her thoughts as narrated by Juniper. When Juniper himself learns of the Cannibal, he notes how he didn't understand that reference until that moment. Then, there are a few more examples of Juniper referencing future events, such as Amaryllis planning to alter her soul in the chamber.

#+begin_quote
  Looking back, that might have been when she'd started making plans.
#+end_quote

The DM appears with a time titled "Worth the Candle" by "Juniper Smith" in a recent chapter, causing Juniper to muse -

#+begin_quote
  (It did occur to me to ask about the book, especially given the supposed author. The byline could have just been metaphorical, or it could have been a joke, or it could have been literal in some fashion, written by me after it was all over, or when I was asleep, or simply by yanking me out of time to write a chapter whenever anything important happened then scrubbing my mind afterward. But the number of possibilities, and the untrustworthiness of the Dungeon Master, made it sort of pointless to ask about. Besides, I didn't really care about the poor schlub who was writing that book, even if it was, in some way, me.)
#+end_quote

Finally, triple parentheses aren't a general safe space for breaking the fourth wall, they're specifically for interjecting in third-person narration. These comments (of which there have been four, three in Amaryllis first POV chapter, and another in her most recent POV half-chapter) are generally /sort of/ fourth wall breaking (since anything readily apparent could be communicated through third-person narration) but not inherently so.

**** There's even more than a fourth wall when you take into account that the story is a self-insert written for an audience who are told that it's a self-insert. [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vxian/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_7274/dtxq5ax/][On ch. 73, I noted]] that quote as the first time the nature of the fourth wall changed for me, with the line "I hope you don't mind." The narrator [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-reference][meta-comments on their own narration]] and expresses a desire to tell a good /story/, which raises all kinds of wild theories about the frame and phenomenon of Joon's existence within the game. Since then, my leading theory has become that the game is /not/ a simulation being run post-Singularity but rather a literal fictional story written live in the vein of D&D, as a form of soft therapy. [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zbyej/wiprt_worth_the_candle_ch_79_rule_zero/duohhko/][I've been a big fan of the therapy theory]] and the author himself (as [[/u/cthuluraejepsen]]) [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7h4qqb/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_63_the_chemical_history/dqoct4t/][lightly implied this in retrospect]], but it never clicked why the DM or creator would bother with such indistinguishably magical technology and resources just to fork a brain simulation of (presumably) his 2017 self for such a relatively mundane purpose. Rather than explaining away the gross jump in tech between 2017 and the current game timeline, it makes more sense if Joon and the game is a "simulation" /within the author's mind/universe/. That's why the book is already written (up to the point we get to see), that's why the DM is a kindred spirit - because the DM is AW at one remove is Joon at two removes, except on actual Earth. Joon is the what-if split: he is literally the *self-insert* into AW's cumulative, conglomerated D&D worlds. Time is a flat circle for poor sim!Joon...

****** So, the setting is a post (or ongoing? I forget) climate apocalypse where food is the major resource everyone is fighting over. Massive agriculture conglomerates control the seed strains that can actually be grown in the current conditions, and are always on the hunt for new varieties. Nations have secret seed banks of native plants and stuff which are guarded like blueprints for WMDs. The story takes place in Thailand, which is one of the few countries not yet utterly enslaved to the conglomerates on threat of starvation.

The first character we meet is a spy from one of these conglomerates in Thailand, walking around a marketplace and exploring some exotic fruits, beautifully crafted worldbuilding and scene dressing. Like I said, the early chapters are actually quite nice.

This all sounds good, right?

The problem is when the titular windup girl is actually introduced. Windups aren't actually machines, they're more like genetically altered humans than robots. This girl is a prostitute, and she and the agri-agent meet and have sex.

Lots of sex. A /lot/ of sex. The windup girl also has sex with other people but whatever. She doesn't really do anything else, but takes up a lot of chapters.

The book isn't even a romance, there's no actual relationship to speak of here, just tons of wheel-spinning until suddenly climatic action occurs and the book ends. There's also some other characters, a revolutionary/gangster dude who gets killed off just when he was getting interesting, not even halfway through the book and another guy who is just some factory dude that allows /even more worldbuilding/ to be presented to the reader.

It's a novel of nice worldbuilding, almost no plot, and no likable characters to be found anywhere. The author blatantly had a I bought it for the title and because it had an airship on the cover (usually a good indicator of something I'll like) but it was a slog from like chapter 3 to the end.

I haven't read the book and it looks like you haven't read it either, nor any other kind of cyberpunk or *punk dystopian literature. Usually dystopian *punk settings with corporate nation-state entities mean that those corporations have their own private military, either as direct employees or hired from other corporations that specialize in that. It's also a common trope of the genre that society partially collapsed at some point, which led to the formation of corporate nation-states in the ensuing power vacuum.

Have you actually read the book or are you just speculating? A quick look at Wikipedia indicates that /The Windup Girl/ is a biopunk novel and provides the following relevant description:

#+begin_quote

** Sounds like someone has personal experience trying to cope with a parent having bipolar disorder, because that did an entirely too accurate job at pulling from my childhood memories of my mother. And chillingly close to home most of all, due to my own even-less-fun-version-than-june's-mom's bipolar disorder. Honestly even though it was only a page or so, that has been one of the most accurate descriptions of the more common variety of BP1, that I have encountered in fiction writing.

You even spelled Lamictal right. I've been taking it for about 3 years and I still have trouble spelling the generic name.

I emphasize with both June and his mom for so many reasons. Her psychiatrist failed her so hard for not doing a better job with medication management. And her husband absolutely failed her regarding her mental health ( even offering basic empathy and trying to understand at all!) and all the impact it had on everything that her life touched.

What sucks even more regarding the frequent and hellishly under-treated full blown episodes , is that they literally cause brain damage and memory loss in a couple different ways. The higher the severity of symptoms, the more cognitive functionality declines, with executive functioning being hit the worst. Which just makes it all worse.

On a non-related note: Something I just realized while typing; it took me 14 years to understand the fruit flies like a banana pun. It was on my biology teacher's wall. I have always just had the wrong internal cadence and tones when saying in my mind. Along with some mental imagery of a banana moving through the air like a missile, or with a super hero cape on it.

**** The phrase is "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana". It's only technically a pun, in that it takes advantage of the ambiguity of the word "like" in English, which can mean either "in the same way as" or "appreciate".

The first half is meant to be read as "Time flies in the same way as an arrow", while the second half is read as "fruit flies appreciate a banana". But because the first half is there, your brain will tend to parse the second half completely wrong, with fruit being the object noun, flies being the verb, like meaning "in the same way as", which is incorrect. (One of the brilliant parts of the phrase is that "fruit flies" is a noun, while "time flies" is a noun and a verb together, which makes the parsing even more difficult.)

The term for this is usually "garden-path sentence". Others include:

- The old man the boat.
- The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.
- Fat people eat accumulates.
- The man who whistles tunes pianos.

Imagine getting upset and staying that way for decades or having a panic attack that lasts weeks. Ever get randomly horny? Well too bad, your erection is going to last days now.

I wonder why Juniper did not explore the relationship of the dragons to Hyacinth when he was talking to Perisev. At least he could try to find out how Hyacinth manipulated the dragons. He might even have been able to get Perisev mad at Hyacinth by telling her how Hyacinth had manipulated her as a tool to accomplish her own ends.

The way dragonfire is stated to just burn cities off the map, I get the impression that large amounts of water would barely even slow it.

On the other matter, Perisev was already aware of Hyacinth's game, the two dragons being there had nothing to do with her. What Hyacinth did was basically tattle to the Draconic Confederacy that they had violated the rules (it seems like she did something more, especially where Dianthus is concerned, but it's not really clear what). Regardless, Perisev makes it clear she's aware of it and doesn't care.

  Grak had all sorts of ideas while he was in his manic episodes, mostly related to warding. I'd recognized the signs when he started talking quickly in Groglir, and tried my best to direct his efforts towards things that didn't have too much of a cost. When the mania passed, he'd realize all his ideas and plans had been half-baked, the warding diagrams he'd drawn up nonsensical.

I also feel we're being robbed of tension a little bit - if this world is built for him (as the encounters with the Dungeon Master have led us to believe, as well as the insertion of the facsimile of the family and friends in his path) then he won't fail.

Seriously? You come with this BS and / I/ don't have a better argument? In no way shape or form she is a bigger threat than Fel Seed. You're also discounting her obvious attachment to the party.

And Amarillis is supressing her love for Juniper, why can't he repress his trauma? Oh right, feels.

They were under the mistaken assumption that Juniper had it under control.

As evidenced by what exactly? It isn't human, regards non-entad life as being inconsequential and shifts personalities based on what it's eaten lately. You complain about feels over reels and then mention the "obvious attachment" this thing has as if it were a given.

>And Amarillis is supressing her love for Juniper, why can't he repress his trauma? Oh right, feels.

She commits a half-assed spiritual self-lobotomy mostly for emtional reasons making herself briefly believe that she's Solace's real mother and then fixes it back once it's clear it isn't doing anything useful. I'm not sure what AU you're reading where amateur self-modifcation hasn't been clearly sign posted as a trap for the unwary.

>No it isn't. Sorry, no intention of arguing with this rambling nonsense.

Then I've yet to hear you advance a single argument other than people shouldn't be emotional so that obviously they should be submissive to a hostile alien instead of doing the things that actually benefit them.

  I was tempted to use Essentialism to put points into Water Magic, but it would have been a fairly rash move, given that it had a concrete cost.
#+end_quote

Does anybody know what the concrete cost would be if Juniper used the sacrificed points he has in Spirit since Chapter 163?

#+begin_quote
  which was a good indication that I should use another sacrifice in order to boost Spirit up to its max level.
#+end_quote

Unless this is an unknown cognitohazard, which makes him think there's an cost and isn't confined to spirit and therefore doesn't fall under the "Loom"-virtue...

*** Every time Juniper sacrifices a skill, it becomes more difficult to re-learn that skill. Old training methods (specific books, tutors, exercises, etc.) don't work at all and even new methods are noticeably slower. So sacrificing skills to increase Water Magic faster would be a pretty bad idea (a lasting loss in order to save time in the short term), and sacrificing Spirit for any reason would be spectacularly bad (he only knows of one way to learn Spirit and he's already used it), sacrificing other things to increase the valuable and hard-to-increase Spirit skill is possibly a good idea.

******** I think he can, at least that's what's implied in Chapter 81:

#+begin_quote
  With seemingly nothing left to do -- a full 90% of Essentialism seemed locked behind various exclusions -- I tried transferring some of my points from Essentialism back into my other skills, only to find that the game still seemed to count them as points transferred for the purposes of the Skilled Trade malus. This was pretty basic anti-cheese; otherwise I could have had over 100 in any skill for a handful of minutes and only have to pay a single point as the price.
#+end_quote

And Still Magic 100 stops this anti-cheese measure^^ Although from a game-mechanical point or for the story to not devolve into an outright power-fantasy, maybe it would be sensible to not be able to transfer sacrificed points at all.

*** It sounds like they were both "toxic" in their own ways to be honest. Joon is making the best of an incredibly bad situation, tragedy in his own life and upbringing. Uther was perhaps a better person on Earth but it sounds like undergoing centuries as an immortal king and savior in another world might have turned him into somewhat of a dick.

Good characters should have flaws. At least Joon recognizes many of his own

My sense is that Arthur never really treated the people of Aerb as "real" in the way that Juniper does, and always acted like he was in a story without real consequences. Hence why he never told anyone the truth of who he was,

The current Joon seems like a really nice person overall, who makes a lot of effort to listen to his friends, be there for them and address their concerns.

You can point at all the people he killed murderhoboing, or at a few social faux-pas he's made, but calling him toxic seems really excessive.
