I was sure this wouldn't happen, based on chapter 84: (the troll wasn't standing, and it seemed too likely to go wrong. I mean, we've /seen/ what happen when a mere rock reverts from transfiguration within a mouth...

  The Headmaster drew a circle, and told Hogwarts that he who stood within was the Defense Professor.

That...

Well.

I notice still that nothing has been said of souls.

*** Yeah, that is ... somewhat mystifying, since this is yet more evidence of something soul-like in the HPMORverse.

*** Chapter 40

#+begin_quote
  Harry set aside his teacup, then drew on his saucer the symbol he had seen on the inside of his cloak. And before Harry could take out his own wand to cast the Hover Charm, the saucer went floating obligingly across the table toward Professor Quirrell.

**** Thanks, but after re-reading the relevent portion, I'm still confused about the consequences of that action. As far as I can tell, he [[#s][basically]], but how did [[#s][that]]

****** Got it, ok thanks, I just didn't make the connection between that line and the later statement. Despite how excited I am about the new chapters, I guess I need to force myself to slow my reading down lol.

** That was awesome. Totally lived up to the hype this far. Finally some answers. Unless he still can bypass that truth thingy. Would be kinda shitty though.

** Still wanting to know more about the function and nature of souls. I've mostly been expecting horcruxes to be strictly brain-backup devices, but apparently there is more to it in HPMOR.

** Here's a question:

#+begin_quote
  "Now for the Mirror," said Professor Quirrell, and he drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility from his robes, and floated it to drop before Harry's shoes.
#+end_quote

Is this the real Cloak? If it is, has Quirrellmort figured out it might do more than just make the wearer invisible?

From this chapter's conversation, it seems like it's been established that AK doesn't /have/ a failure state as it did in canon on Harry, so it might be something that just wasn't thought about. It might have anti-death effects as well.

Obviously I'm borrowing a bit from Following the Phoenix, but it could be relevant and that could have been a long term plan that the subfic just got to first.

On a related note, is it not /really weird/ to anyone else that Voldemort doesn't even question that the Stone must have at some point been made by human mages? Admittedly Perinelle's Stone Ritual was a false flag, but the real thing must have been created at some point. He never mentions Atlantis or the obviously overpowered Precursors who created magic or whatever the system is, and he seems to have ignored the descensionist tinge of wizarding history in a way Harry has not.

If Harry escapes this situation and survives without destroying Quirrelmort, I can only assume that some aspect of that concept fits into his final victory:

Voldemort seems content with being the strongest and immortal.

I don't think Harry has an end-point content state.
