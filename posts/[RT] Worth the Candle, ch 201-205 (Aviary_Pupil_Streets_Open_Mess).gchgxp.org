** It took me a while but I think I get why "Good Samaritan" is considered offensive. Samaritans were a group of people that weren't exactly liked by the people Jesus was preaching to, and Jesus was saying that a group that you wouldn't expect to be kind can still be your neighbor more than your fellow citizens. But saying the "Good Samaritan" implicitly says that all or most of the other Samaritans are bad. If we replace Samaritan with a group that exists in popular conception outside of the Bible, the offensive nature is clear. "The Good Jew" or "The Good Korean" would be horribly offensive phrases to modern sensibilities. On Aerb, it would basically be the same for the Samaritan Orcs.

I wonder if the Amaryllis clones could use star magic, because most of the actual work of star magic is doing math. Even if they're unable to lay the actual lines due to DM fiat, they could still help enormously with star magic projects.

I can definitely see why the WB doc says that the Doris Finch EZ would be a paradise if the person excluded was anyone other than Doris Finch. Being able to duplicate entads alone is absurd, and a person that could actually get along with themself could break the world over their knee even locked to a 31x31 mile patch of land.

I had the thought of using DF to duplicate Bethel, which is honestly pretty scary. Could easily get her excluded.

I absolutely love Amaryllis' description of Doris. "She's the person who ruins everything. She is the tragedy of the commons".

The dynamics of a person that can duplicate themselves at an absurd rate is really interesting. Conservation of Dorises is super neat, and the hinted at evolutionary arms race of how Blood God Doris came to exist is really cool. Every Doris has the same blood, they're in a zone filled to the brim with blood, and there are huge selection pressures to become better at blood magic because every added bit of skill and power gives more survival power. A Doris who becomes slightly better than her neighbors at blood magic could quickly populate the entire zone with copies of herself, with no conventional limits on scarcity of resources, culminating in a god of blood.

Absurd amounts of blood compression seems like it would give extremely good protection against void rifles, one of the few conventional things that Joon doesn't have a real counter to. Normally, someone shoots you in the head, it eats through the negligible amount of blood and skin, them into bone, and then eats a couple inches into your brain. But with extreme blood compression, someone shoots you in the head, and it has to tunnel through something like a gallon of blood before it can hit your skull or brain, which void just can't do. Plus, it reactively shoots a spray of blood right back at whoever shot you.

What I love the most about this batch is the turn, from Mary (and to an extent the narrator) believing this in the depths of her bones and holding Doris in the utmost contempt, to the relatability of everything Joon says while talking to Clone Zone Doris.

**** Doris as we know her started naked and alone, with the only tool available to her creating another Doris that's also naked and alone. Can you spare a set of clothes for your clone? Congratulations, you're now in an infinitely better place than Doris was. What Joon was saying wasn't that he /would/ have ended up like her, what he was saying was that he understood every impulse that went into creating her because he could see those same impulses in himself.

Where Doris went wrong was that she cut herself off from any kind of social safety net. She had no reason not to defect because she had nothing. She wasn't hooked into the promises of society, that said if you cooperate you'll be able to harvest the slow fruit of cooperation.

Think about placing yourself in her shoes. You make your first clone, what do you do? Do you kick them out naked, or do you give them clothes and find them another job? Do you recognize that two clones have fewer needs than two separate people, for example, that sharing a house halves rent, that pooling your money together to get a nice toy means that you can share it, and so on?

Sure, there are a lot of failure conditions. But there's a lot of stuff that you could do to fuck up your life right now, and with clones you're usually in a strictly better position than without clones. For a lot of people, the worst case is that you have a massive gang that doesn't have a lot of trust in each other working minimum wage jobs and not sharing resources. The middle case is that cooperate poorly, working less and spending money on stupid shit while not actually changing your circumstances that much. The good case is you do what Amaryllis suggests and leverage the massive amount of latent cooperation between all your clones to Get Shit Done and like, at least pool all your minimum wages together and buy stock or something, living off interest so that you can be fuckups without a risk of going bankrupt or something.

***** I love the points you've made, but you seem to have missed that 'kick them out naked' is not quite accurate.

When Doris splits there is a coin flip that Clone A is the original or Clone B is the original. They do not know which is the clone and which is the original. The original's gear will persist past 24h. The cloned gear will disappear after 24h.

It's the fact that no clone can persist past 24h without their standard of living massively degrading that was at the root of the Doris Problem, which escalates their need for an initial split to be resolved with one Superior Doris and one Inferior Doris. The Superior Doris gets to persist with gear after 24h, the Inferior Doris does not.

If the splitting conflict is not resolved immediately, and Doris escapes herself... There's infinite escalation. As neither half of the split can risk waiting 24h and potentially losing everything, she must split to persist her gear by robbing her new clone. And the Doris population grows exponentially as branches grow without being reliably trimmed.

Why rob your clone, and risk retribution, when you can kill it? Why not victimize other Dorises if you're already willing to 50/50 killing yourself via cloning? Why not continue to clone yourself, if that is your best offense / defense against other clones?

****** I'm not talking about thw horrific dystopia she ended up in, I'm talking about when she first split and was still a part of normal society. Again, that's /Doris's/ problem. She explicitly acknowledges that her initial behavior was due to psychological issues, and that by simply sharing her stuff and that by cooperating with her clone she would have been able to avoid this whole mess. The problem isn't the cloned gear, it's the inability to pool resources and engage in cooperation.

The Republic of Doris Finch is described as very barren and bare, not just because the Dorises have absolutely stripped it, but to the point where it was probably 31x31 miles of nothing much to start with.

If you "Dorised" right now, including the exclusion consequence, you'd probably be inside a house with lots of little duplicable resources, inside a town or city with an enormous amount of duplicable resources.

For some reason it seems that she wasn't anywhere near anything of any use at all. Maybe the original Doris (wisely) conducted her research into potentially excludable magic way out in the boonies, in a tiny shack. Which speaks well of her potential to re-humanize.

******** That's handled in the chapters we were just shown, it's implied that the literally billions or trillions of dead dorises have essentially salted the earth (not least because, you know, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, and so on are extremely vital to the human body).

If you Dorised right now you'd have half the resources you did before, because now you need to kill your clone. And it's important to note that it was confirmed that Doris is mostly just a fuck up, and isn't a sociopath or anything. She wasn't going to immediately resort to killing a copy of her just because it'd dupe something for her. Remember, every duplicated resource either dissapears in 24 hours or requires you to kill someone every 24 hours for the rest of your life. Are there things that might be worth that? Definitely, as long as you've got an insta kill closet and you're chill with patternist theory. It's still something of last resort that you don't use unless it's literally your only option. For example, you're stuck in a barren EZ where you can't buy anything of value and anything that is valuable is already hoarded and claimed.

Again, "tragedy of the commons". The reason there is nothing of value in the EZ is because Doris can't cooperate and will defect at the first sign that she can gain a temporary advantage. Sure, they started with a lot of stuff, but then they ate it all and didn't husband it and shit broke and now there's a couple million doris's fighting each other for scraps.

yeah this loophole does seem to be the crux of the problem. just to be clear, my understanding was it's not that the clone whose gear *wasn't* going to persist splits, and now one of those two has permanent gear; rather that each clone will split at the 23 hour mark to reset the timer and steal that clone's stuff.

******* Yeah that's the point I meant to get at, if I was unclear. After a split, if both Dorises survive, they must continue to split prior to the 24h timer because all of their stuff *could* disappear and they cannot determine who has the permanent gear. Plus the longer a branch, the less likely any of their stuff is permanent and the more of an incentive they'd have to continue to clone their gear.

Doris becomes unmanageable veeeery quickly because of this feature, and it's only compounded because her main method of attack / defense is splitting.

The NEW clone gets the clock reset. The old clone doesn't. so murder for resources is almost demanded. essentially no one would have permanent gear, either; the odds of anything you find being an "original" item are vanishingly slim in this scenario.

Because I can imagine a situation in which Doris realised what she could do, cloned herself while holding food or money, then repeatedly cloned themselves while gathering the resources together on one Doris until they had enough food for every Doris.

And then 24 hours later, it all disappeared and suddenly they're without food or any other resources and there's a couple of hundred of them.

Doris, burned by cooperation within a day of getting her ability, then realises that she's better off looking after herself rather than working with that /bitch/ who wasted all their food.

starting to seriously consider these questions - assuming it worked like the story and after the split neither knows whether they are the "original" until the 24 hour mark and gear disappears, one thing I might do is intentionally obfuscate which is which. at 23 hours, both put everything we were wearing in a box and shake it up. Sit naked for 1 hour. after the 24 hour mark passes, we re-dress and proceed with our lives, not knowing which one was "primary."

maybe more gradually than this, though. Not all cooperators died, but cooperators didn't reproduce as aggressively. All it takes is one with the mentality that they are willing to reproduce to create a gang and use force to get her way; poof, you've got an army all with this mentality.

it is interesting though that entads still exist that allow cloning, even though DF's cloning was excluded. this seems different than other exclusions, where ALL instances of that magic just...stop working. I wonder if there's a reason other than plot necessity that this one is a little different.

I don't think that's necessarily true. The parable itself works just as well if you use "a firefighter, an accountant, and a Yankees fan," or any other set of 3 descriptors where the highest implied social status is obvious and goes first. The message was just "be like Sam" with a bit of spice thrown in to show the priest was not like Sam and did not set the correct example. The phrase "good samaritan" doesn't appear in any text until the 17th century, and by itself is enough to create the perception that Samaritans were, in general, bad, because most humans use lazy cognitive bias.

  “There's a feedback loop,” said Raven. “A blood mage with an excess of blood can draw on the power of that blood in order to boost herself, and that boost can make it easier to squeeze more power from the blood. At a certain tipping point, which is more like a hundred times normal blood volume, they can get taken over by something else, unless they're sufficiently skilled at handling it.”
#+end_quote

Killing a clone releases all of the Doris blood that she had. Drawing on the power of that blood boosts her ability to kill other clones, releasing more blood for the blood god. I think as soon as any Doris developed the ability to draw on the power of her blood to boost herself, the entire plane would only have a single Doris in minutes or hours, so long as she didn't pointlessly make a copy of herself midway through (the only copy with the ability to kill her). This would still hold even if the first Doris finished learning the technique an hour before some other Doris managed to do it, because it would snowball so incredibly quickly.

Unlike for other blood mages, she wouldn't need to develop a technique of extreme hypertension beforehand, since she can hold usable blood in other bodies. She could learn the snowball technique, and make actual use of it, before ordinary blood mages could.

He also would probably have gained some powerful SOC skill unlocks likely capable of overcoming some of the anti-memetic effects, maybe even something like "Things trying to hide from your attention become MORE obvious than if they were not". A sort of super-sherlock that is also good with people.

At a certain point, a SOC character campaign becomes extremely collaborative, delegating out and choosing the right people to unite Aerb in its own defence. June only gets called in to flashpoint events that require the perfect hail-mary diplomatic touch from left field. He becomes famous not as the 'impossible warrior, Uther reborn' but as the 'great uniter, Uther reborn'

Max Level SOC June is finding ways to stop the decline of Aerb society and social-engineer its systems to prevent future exclusions. He probably also realises that Uther/Arthur was never the answer, that the only person who can reckon his internal struggle, is himself. He helps ordinary people perform the extraordinay, Aerb learns that they don't need a singular hero with fabled awesome power, but can collectively hold off the horrors together.

People don't want to fight the current June because he is a fierce warrior who could likely win. Max Level SOC June puts people at ease, because everyone knows that wherever he shows up, the optimal solution for everything that no one else could think of is not far behind him.

For Mome Rath you are taking as a given that Juniper would get some way around the anti-memetic effect in the Soc path. That seems like a big assumption to me. With anti-memetics in play he can't leverage his social skills to get an army as he'd forget about the problem the moment he left.

Even if you can finagle some solution for Mome Rath it doesn't answer how Soc Juniper would deal with his level up addiction without mental investment. Also if they do go to P Space that seems like something that a Soc Juniper would not be able to do.

******** Given how little we know of SOC virtues (which would have a bigger impact than MEN and PHS really) all we can do is speculate.

Mome Possibilities:* It's likely June wouldn't have even had to deal with the anti-memetic effect. Penetrating the cult before Mr Mome and his back lice were even an issue.* Given how all other magical effects are slowly being discovered to be accounted for in the system somehow (bladeborn are PHS, magics are MEN) I think its actually quite intuitive that Memes and interacting with them are unlocked in varying degrees by pushing up SOC and SOC skills unlocking synergies similar to how multiple PHS unlocked the bladeborn etc.* Even without though, June could do two-step removed social-fu on himself similiar to that chick that could resist Soul-fucking even though she was entirely under its thralls. A SOC June likely has many options like that, the ability to pre-condition and even retroactively post-condition himself to undertake tasks even if he himself no longer knows why.- The point is, there are possible ways. The game is still set up for conflict, and I consider Memes to be a form of SOC attack for which a high level SOC character should have defenses.

Level Up Addiction:* Probably the same thing here, where June can ignore his own wants and desires with perfect rationality if he chooses to. He would be utterly addicted to leveling up, but able to indefinitely act as if he was not.* In fact, rather than slapping a bandaid on the level up addiction with Spirit Magic, a SOC June likely could have directly removed the cause of the addiction rather than magically hiding the symptoms.

P-Space:A SOC June would utterly destroy anything they liked in P-space. In fact he would be insanely overpowered there. Its all about conceptual and abstract connections, a SOC character is a god there. In fact in might be advantageous for him to remain there and use the enormous power he could amass there to push influence back onto Aerb similar to how the original inhabitant did.A SOC June in P-Space is the equivalent of Blood-God Deloris.edit: In fact that's probably how a SOC June defeats Fel-Seed, they go to P-Space and find a way to erase the conceptual linkages of Fel-Seeds existence, unknitting him from reality.\\

For Mome it's possible social fu would have let Juniper dismantle the cult early, but I'm not sure. They had Valenicia after all and she's currently our best approximation of what maxed out social looks like. (Yes being a non anima limits her usefulness but I think the point largely stands.) To be fair though a Soc Juniper would have no reason to go to Li'o so they wouldn't be there to prevent Mome Rath's summoning or kill it in the first place.

You had a significantly different reading than I did of the level up situation. For one thing, he did directly fix the problem. It is permanently solved, not a band-aid. Second perfect rationality is not a universally agreed upon thing and the soul dictates what a person values. A perfectly rational Juniper dedicated to the level up would be insanely dangerous because he'd take the optimal path to getting level ups morality be damned.

For P Space you might be right, Social Juniper might dominate in combat there. The problem is without magic, he could never get there in the first place which is the primary reason I brought it up. Uther had to use some novel combination of magics that Raven didn't understand to get there, and that magic would require mental.

He also would probably have gained some powerful SOC skill unlocks likely capable of overcoming some of the anti-memetic effects, maybe even something like "Things trying to hide from your attention become MORE obvious than if they were not". A sort of super-sherlock that is also good with people.

edit: At a certain point, a SOC character campaign becomes extremely collaborative, delegating out and choosing the right people to unite Aerb in its own defence. June only gets called in to flashpoint events that require the perfect hail-mary diplomatic touch from left field. He becomes famous not as the 'impossible warrior, Uther reborn' but as the 'great uniter, Uther reborn'

Max Level SOC June is finding ways to stop the decline of Aerb society and social-engineer its systems to prevent future exclusions. He probably also realises that Uther/Arthur was never the answer, that the only person who can reckon his internal struggle, is himself. He helps ordinary people perform the extraordinay, Aerb learns that they don't need a singular hero with fabled awesome power, but can collectively hold off the horrors together.

People don't want to fight the current June because he is a fierce warrior who could likely win. Max Level SOC June puts people at ease, because everyone knows that wherever he shows up, the optimal solution for everything that no one else could think of is not far behind him.

****** I think it's less the material privilege and more the material inequality which degrades empathy.

I think a human born into a lush paradise with other humans will grow into a better person than a human born on a throne with slaves, even though the two have similar material conditions. The wealthy in our world are closer to the latter category. Meanwhile, within the latter society, the slaves will grow into better people than the one on the throne, but worse people than the ones in the paradise.

In the real world, there's a strange effect where the former warlords can create sheltered bubbles for their grandchildren where they only meet other high-resource people, sort of mimicking some but not all features of the paradise. However, the moral conviction of these bubbled people can usually only go so far, because they ultimately have no incentive to deconstruct the blood-built edifice of their bubble. Especially once they grow up and must take on the mantle of power, with the incentive to maintain that wealth, they'll find their ideals becoming more... flexible.

******* Anecdotally, out of all the scion class, the children of arts-industry (movies, books, pictorial arts etc) multimillionaires seem the most grounded and compassionate, especially the ones who follow their parents into the work.

I suspect this is because the success of art is directly related to its relatability to the masses; if the child of a successful actor is to themselves become a successful actor (eg Ben Stiller, Domnhall Gleeson, Angelina Jolie, Liv Tyler), then even with the leg-up past the initial barriers, they /still/ have to be capable of convincing on-screen portrayal of some relatively ordinary person. They still need to seek out direct exposure to how relatively ordinary people live. If they are to portray a character from an author's book, they meet the author. If they are to portray a real person, they meet that person, and that person's associates.

Fundamentally they are /role-players/ that get significant professional success just for /role-playing/. Especially with modern directors and screenwriters encouraging much more improv, and actor input into character development. This is specifically why Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul is /so good/ - Vince Gilligan encourages a very high level of actor investment and contribution into their characters.

LMAO. You can just feel the irritation at Joon going off the plot rails.

So, I'm still /very/ curious about how their Heisenberg scrying works. This kind of magic has never been mentioned anywhere other than "that thing the Doris Finches can do".

So she has a unique kind of magic to find people, and she has a unique kind of magic to clone herself. It seems... /odd/ that she would just /happen/ to have two kinds of entirely unique magic that no one else even knows about. So I've assumed for a while now that she somehow uses cloning for this, by Munchkining it together with some other magic, in a process that (presumably) involves killing loads of clones and at the end you have a clone that knows where whats-his-face is. Maybe through an entad that, I dunno, kills you if you lie or something, and they keep narrowing it down? But it can't be /just/ that, it's probabilistic, and from the Larkspur thing there's maybe Library-style time travel involved as well.

Really hoping we get an answer to this eventually - if it's horrible and barbaric, then I suppose putting an end to it could be part of Blood God Doris's (and Doris Finch's in general) character arc.

Luck seems to be exactly the thing that should break through an anti-scrying entad. Partially because it's not actually scrying, and also because it's /luck/.

It's also the same brand of dumb bullshit Doris would come up with.

Yeah. 100% this.

Give a single Doris an elf bone, strip her of all weapons, handcuff her or otherwise tie her up, tell her to make a hundred clones at gunpoint. Once the clones give you the answer you want (with multiple redundant cells so you can compare results and know if they're lying), kill all but one of them, picked at random. Have some deadman switches, like a bomb that can blow up the entire building if they try to rebel (or more likely, an underground room that can be flooded or filled with smoke).

The clones have an incentive to cooperate (99% chance to die vs 100% chance to die). The logistics are hard, but it's just a scaled-up version of something Dorises do every day, and it's not that much more ambitious that the other projects we see the Blues do.

I can see how they have cloned sweatshops where they give a bunch of Dorises a bunch of books on known magic, and kill the ones who don't learn it. I'm less sure how they'd use this setup to invent new branches of magic - the success rate would be astronomically lower (it's 0 until it happens), so the Dorises in charge would produce no results and get /themselves/ killed. (or it works, and they take over and kill the ones in charge - another risk they have no reason to take)

********* I figure that applies to magical research.

Consider a toy model where Original Blue figures she has a 30% chance of figuring out Passion Magic, a 20% chance for Air Magic, a 15% chance for Wood Magic and a 10% chance for Flower Magic. She also figures she has a 25% chance of improving her situation if she tries to get a Void Rifle and sets up as a bandit instead. For the sake of simplicity, we're assuming that any of these five advantages are approximately equal in value - figuring out Passion Magic is just as good as figuring out Flower Magic is just as good as owning a Void Rifle. We're also assuming she only has enough supplies to try up to two options - if she runs out after that, she won't have enough resource security to keep doing long term planning and will have to try getting more with whatever she still has.

If she decides to go it alone, the obvious answer is to keep trying Passion Magic until she either figures it out or hits a dead end, with banditry as the fallback option. 30% chance of figuring the magic, 70%*25%=17.5% chance of having to abandon the research but successfully stealing a Void Rifle afterwards. Total expected value of 0.475 Life Improvements.

If she decides to split, Passion Blue still has the same chance of figuring out Passion Magic, but her fallback is much better - if any of her other clones manages their project, she'll notice and can flip to working on that instead. And only has to do the potentially deadly Void Rifle heist if none of the clones find anything. Total expected value of 0.8571 Life Improvements - nearly twice as good!

You might think that Flower Blue would be tempted to covertly start working on Passion Magic instead (since it is more likely to work), but she actually has no incentive to do so - there's already a Blue working on Passion Magic, so all of the Blues involved are going to find out if Passion Magic can be re-derived using their current resources regardless of whether they personally are the ones working on that topic. If she sabotages the other Blues or refuses to put in any effort toward her own project, she is only /reducing/ the odds that she gets something out of this scheme.

********** Having intellectual knowledge is not actually a good thing for Doris in the text as presented. The Star Doris we see in story is a slave forced to work on threat of death and there is no indication the Doris's situation is better with other magics. Even the Blood Mages were slaves until they grew so powerful the Blues could no longer control them. Now you could clone yourself with the intent of enslaving your clone, but Doris doesn't actually like those odds. 50% chance you end up as an enslaved clone performing magic for yourself is not what Doris wants. Remember, she is lazy. The same applies as we scale up the number of Dorises. What Doris does instead of cloning herself is she finds some other Doris enslaves them, then using various forms of coercion to make them work on projects with a sub 1% chance of success. Sort of similar to monkeys with typewriters until something works.

If Doris was a different more cooperative person maybe your schemes could work. Its Amaryllis's primary complaint about Doris after all. However that is not the Doris we see in text and that's why her society is as fucked up as it is with only a few different magics being known instead of all of them.

*** In this case, it's achieving relatability in layers. Now that I phrase it that way, they did a very similar thing in Shrek.

Let's take this a chapter at a time.

Chapter 201:

#+begin_quote
  We were expecting a double cross. You had to, when Doris Finch was involved.

  The attack came when I was ten feet away, but it wasn't the attack I expected, not an attack against us, but an attack against them, Doris against Doris.
#+end_quote

So, you come in with an expectation, a stereotype, and the character lives up to it.

The first scene in Shrek is showing Shrek to live up to the stereotype of an Ogre: he's disgusting, scary, and hates people (except maybe for dinner). A couple of times, it looks like it's going to contradict that, but then: nope, the thing he's painting is a "Keep out" sign.

Similarly, Doris is shown to be a serial defector, and, in the first chapter, lives up to that every step of the way.

Chapter 202:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't have the fucking time for this. You understand they'll shoot me if I don't do my best?”

  “And deprive themselves of a star mage?” I asked.

  “No,” she replied. “I split before I came in here. If I fail, then they kill me and keep her. If I succeed, they keep me and kill her. Either way, they keep their star mage, this is just incentive for me to actually do the work. If they didn't have a guard, they would torture me for information first.”
#+end_quote

You've set up your character as a loathsome creature. The next step is to make it clear that /this is miserable for them/. So, you take your character and put them in a situation where it's clear that they know the consequences of being loathsome, but are helpless to change. So, you get a sort of sympathy for them, but at the same time, they're no less of an awful person

In Shrek, this is the whole sequence where the swamp gets invaded by the other fantasy creatures, up until the fight in Dulac. He tries to deal with his problems by scaring them away, because he doesn't know any other way of dealing with them. The problem is, he's just not scary enough for that to work on everyone. But he keeps trying, being especially awful to Donkey.

In WtC, we see a prime example of the pressure that a Doris faces: everything, even a simple magic lesson, is a life-or-death struggle, and if you fail, you die, and some other Doris will live in your place. And all along the way, Doris is still, plainly, thinking of stabbing them in the back.

I'm skipping Chapter 203, because we've about learned all that we could from Star Doris.

Likewise, skipping the castle scene from Shrek.

Chapter 204:

#+begin_quote
  She sighed, then nodded. “Look,” she said. “You told me that you would let me out if I told you the truth. You promised.”

  “You're something different,” I said. “What have you been doing here, just waiting? I don't believe for a second that you couldn't open that hatch on your own. And this blood, that's your work. The blood worms, also probably your work.”

  “Are you letting me out, yes or no?” asked Doris, stepping toward the ward and pressing her hand against it.

  “No,” said Amaryllis.
#+end_quote

The character's problem is based on a mistaken apprehension of the world, which gets confirmed. They are betrayed, the way that they have always been betrayed, so, fuck it, go back to the normal way of life.

So Shrek spends a good couple of days with Fiona, and actually starts to think that things could be different... but then he overhears her say something and mistakenly thinks it's about him. He summons Farquaad to pick up Fiona, and goes back to his swamp.

Doris is expecting betrayal, and probably is ready to go on a rampage here. If she isn't let out, she's breaking out, and then she's going to be the one in charge.

Chapter 205:

#+begin_quote
  I was explaining that the Dorises, as people, are completely fucked up. They've been suffering here, for a long time, at their own hands. And for this particular one, who is probably better off never splitting again, if that's even something she could do, if it even matters given her presumed skill --- for her, it's important that she understands that she's in a position where it doesn't have to be how it was. Once she's there, once she's traipsed up Maslow's hierarchy of needs, then we can start talking to her about what her life should be like, how and why to break herself of her current terrible habits that have been learned over the course of a lifetime of pain and suffering. But I think what comes first is just saying, ‘hey, it can be okay now'.
#+end_quote

In a word: therapy.

Things are at their absolute lowest for Shrek, and we can /see/ that while he's gotten what he says he wants, it's not what he /actually/ wants. Then, Donkey shows up and shows Shrek a different way the world could be. Fighting his instincts (and with the help of people who care about him), he manages to break his habit and actually /believe/ things could be different, and along with a chance to start things over, that's enough to make things better.

Likewise, Blood God Doris is probably among the most traumatized of any of the Dorises, ready to come out and rule as brutally as anything she's been through. That's her next move, even though she doesn't really want that. Then, Juniper comes along and shows her a vision of a world where life isn't just killing yourself over, and over, and over, and gives her a chance to make that vision a reality.

Loathsome, to pitiable, to relatable, to likable (and even someone you'd root for), each layer being peeled away to reveal the next.

Long story short, if you want a character with nuance and depth, give them flaws, and make them struggle to overcome them. Not to the extent that they no longer have those flaws, but to the point where the flaws no longer define them.

The way AW writes, characters generally act the way they do because of realistic motivations rather than acting in arbitrary ways to serve the needs of the plot. Even if they really do only exist because there is a specific purpose for them to serve, he still gives them a personality such that those actions make total sense for them to take. The act of actually ensuring that a given character's actions are motivated results in the character developing a degree of depth.

For instance, it seems the DFEZ is treated like a wasteland with occasional cities, but I feel it should be an uninterrupted megalopolis of slums and misery. Any space not claimed by a city would eventually be claimed by the occasional desperate Doris, and with the ability to make an army of herself, it would be pretty much impossible to maintain a no man's land.

Maintaining an empty space in the DFEZ would take /logistics/; it would essentially require machine gun nests so that everyone knows that, if you walk into that space, you're going to die, no matter how many of you there are.

I really don't see how there could be any empty space (including abandoned houses and the like) that isn't crawling with Dorises, unless that space is actively defended with terrifying violence.

***** I'd argue Doris is her own ecosystem. several core strains of Doris who've specialised into an eco-political niche, so you have Blood bound Dorises, Star mage Dorises, Pustule Dorises and others that have picked up other skills, magic, pseudomagic or entads to survive in and create their own "niche" in the doris ecosystem.

Hell, the plane of blood colony was an example of that. Blood mage dorises rapidly adapted to the locale, and as soon as a beneficial mutation arose (Blood breathing) that strain of Doris rapidly grew and evolved it's own arms race, a-la cambrian explosion.

Another example is Star Doris receiving a working flashlight. She's no longer just a Doris who fills a niche of amateur Star Mage, She's Amateur Star Mage and Flashlight (+ components) user, at least, until she's ganked for it. That's a massive economic niche for anyone who, well, needs light. The Blues weren't giving away their light sources, weren't they?

As for population density, there's presumably some equilibrium point where clone generation in the city is equaled out by murders + clones fleeing the crowded, murder-filled city for the comparatively less populated wastelands. Since Dorises Finch have unlimited void weapons, plague spells and itchy trigger fingers, it is entirely possible that the level of crowding depicted is the maximum level of crowding that a heavily armed population of Dorises can tolerate.

Dropping a TV in the DFEZ would be disastrous.

Or imagine an entad with a remote effect, like, I don't know, a gun that can kill an arbitrary person anywhere in the world as long as you keep feeding it human flesh, or something like that.

It wouldn't be quite word-ending even then (people could always napalm the entire EZ to the bedrock), but there might be an entad combination that /would be/. Even knowing that exclusions and the Library act as safety nets, it's pretty cavalier of the Empire not to put serious effort into making sure so new entads (or long-range canons) ever enter the zone.

In addition to the spectacular characterization of the Dorises Finch (Juniper calls them "Doris Finches" but he doesn't understand the One True Way To Pluralize People) this batch shows a lot of growth for our protagonists. They finally arrive at a diplomatic solution to one of their quests.

"Missing the social/diplomatic solution" has been a running theme since Fallatehr. From chapter 95,

#+begin_quote
  “But that wasn't really what he had misgivings about. He thought that we jettisoned any chance of a successful working relationship with him through aggressive mistrust.” She grunted as she made a long reach, going to full extension of one slender leg for just a moment. The only way that I'd be able to follow her route was going to be with my superior reach.
#+end_quote

And then it's brought up again in this batch with regards to Anglecynn,

#+begin_quote
  I finally caught up to what Amaryllis must have been thinking, which was that if there had ever been a social solution in Anglecynn, we had mostly missed it, and if the Doris EZ was similar, then the thing that would guarantee we went down the combat path would be treating the Dorises how you'd assume they should be treated, just based on what you heard about them.
#+end_quote

Amaryllis comes in talking shit about Doris because she can't cooperate, because come on, cooperating with yourself is easy, you just have to decide to do it. In the end, it wasn't just Doris that needed to cooperate with herself, but it was Joon&party that needed to extend their own trust and cooperation to Doris as well. Extending their trust to someone else, that's fucking difficult - I can't overstate how difficult it is, especially in a world like Aerb - but that's the challenge they overcame today.

#+begin_quote
  “You're saying we should defect against Doris? That justifies a lack of trust in us.”

  Amaryllis was watching me, and I could feel her mismatched eyes boring into me, stripping me bare. She was good at reading people, but not that good if she was in the wrong mindset for a proper reading to take place. Maybe she could see that Doris wasn't actually afraid of us, but maybe she thought that was because of typical Doris fatalism, not because she had the upper hand. Maybe she thought that I was being headstrong, not that I knew something that she didn't. I wasn't trying to make my face readable, because Doris was watching us, but I was hoping she would understand.

  “Okay,” she finally said. “You're right.”

And in the end they got to forge their own way with the quest.

**** I think you're not wrong but at the same time like we already have what 12-ish characters that are still running around and being on screen at least once per chapter bundle? More if you count some of the characters mentioned but not seen, and plus or minus the gaming group as actively effecting the current narrative.

I mean they are and are generally a big part of the experience of reading WTC, but like considering their bits are generally self-contained I can understand why someone wouldn't consider them a part of the actively written about group centering on Jun's current adventures.

** What are we to make of the Earth flashback beginning chapter 203? The connection to the rest of the chapter and arc seems reasonably clear, but in isolation?

#+begin_quote
  It was one of those awkward arguments, the kind that I didn't like when I looked back on it, but which had passed easily enough. No one had really been mad at each other, but it had been uncomfortable, and even running it over in my head afterward, I didn't know quite how I could have fixed it.
#+end_quote

Let's take some wild guesses. There seem to be points of friction within the group that go unaddressed. Reimer is resigned to hear about the worldbuilding, Craig is uninterested, Maddie /is/ interested, Tiff is halfway interested.

Grammatical nitpicking by the players at each other: "can"/"may" "hewed"/"hewn"

So maybe the point is just that Juniper didn't have enough SOC to know what was the impetus of the mood of the room? Or that /Arthur/ failed a SOC check, and asked a question that divided the group?

Or maybe the point is just that the whole idea is too grimdark, a connection to the narration immediately following the flashback.

205 chapters in, and there's literally not a single development where Juniper has an excuse to tell us about them, or just mention how they might react to something like this, or compare Aarde's known powers to what BGD is capable of?

I just don't get why the Five Gods are such nonentities in our perspective of the world... Is it a deliberate joke by the DM as the Only True God or something?

** Doris and her cloned stuff are confined to the zone; what does that mean, exactly? Does cloned stuff vanish as soon as it crosses the boundary?

- How high up does the boundary go?\\
- How far down does it go?
- It is a dome? A column? An irregular shape?
- Whenever a Doris is created, she appears as an exact copy of her progenitor, meaning that the clone has air in her lungs. If a clone breathes out across the boundary, does the cloned air vanish?\\
- What about light? Does the light from those cloned flashlights vanish at the boundary?
- Do void effects vanish?

Imagine an open circuit consisting of a loop of copper wire and a light bulb. In the real world if you close the circuit by attaching a battery to the two ends of the wire then electrons will flow and the bulb will light up. The interesting part is that the electrons in the water behave like water in a pipe: They all start moving the moment the (battery is added / faucet is turned on). The [[https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/circuits/Lesson-2/Electric-Current][drift speed]] of electrons is quite low, maybe 1m / hour. If the wire is a few miles long it will be ages from then the battery is attached until the first electron from the battery actually flows through the light bulb -- until then the light bulb is being powered by the electrons that were already in the wire.

Now imagine that the battery is cloned but the cable and the bulb were supplied by the Empire and are therefore not cloned. The bulb is outside of the zone with the wire crossing the border. When Doris connects the battery, does current flow? Does the bulb stay lit as per normal until the battery is drained, or does it shut off as soon as electrons from the cloned battery cut off the flow by crossing the border? If it keeps flowing, that means that Doris is the solution to the Empire's energy problems -- run a power cable in, have Doris clone batteries or coal or nuclear fuel or etc and send power out.

All you need is for someone to provide some electric motors. Doris clones batteries to run the motors, and the motors spin magnets to generate electricity that is free of cloned electrons.

***** Keep in mind, it's not just the tragedy of the commons, it's overshooting as well. You'll need a lot of resources to keep your new faction together.

At the minimum, you need food, water, living space, and weapons.

If you start with one gun and clone yourself 100 times, then the next day you have 99 clones without guns, clothes, or any other possessions, unless you have some sort of facility to produce large amounts of clones, kill them and take their stuff.

Even if you want to cooperate in principle, you're terrified of death, and you absolutely don't want to go to the "clone yourself and get killed a bunch of times" factory, which means your society needs mechanisms to enforce attendance. The clones controlling the mechanisms of enforcement also don't want to go to the suicide factory, so they're probably going to end up as a ruling class.

And keep in mind that, unless you're a steel mage, you start off with no infrastructure and no way to build it (and even if you can build things, the EZ is probably overcrowded anyway); which means you're going to have to fight other factions for living space (and other resources). Fighting other factions involves being sent to die for a war that doesn't directly benefit you; again, even if you wanted to cooperate in principle, you're probably going to change your mind when being sent into the (literal or metaphorical) meat grinder. Unless you have some kind of suicide squad collar (keeping in mind everything you make disappears after 24h), the soldiers you make aren't actually going to want to go on the front lines.

With all those considerations, I can kind of see why the society would be so dysfunctional. I'm not saying it's an unsolvable problem, but any non-external solution has to account for the facts that clones both really don't want to die and need kill each other on a regular basis to get their food and keep their equipment.

** Another thing I really liked about this chapter was the whole "does Dorisland just need fascism?" thing. That this would be shitty and a 'problematic' resolution to the plot is lampshaded when the characters outright discuss that being a shitty narrative resolution, and why ("fascism's good when its us doing it!"). And then, by treating the situation like the real world to a greater extent than people in the real world treat real world discussions, AW introduces a satisfying resolution.

Where the last arc was the arc of "sometimes the main characters are going to miss opportunities for diplomatic resolution" and the arc wherein we got to see what a physical-combat-focused Juniper might have looked like, this arc was the arc of "sometimes threats that seem unsolvable via diplomacy /aren't/" and the arc wherein we get to see a tiny slice of what a more socially-focused Juniper might have looked like.

** I can tell I am in the minority here, but I didn't love these chapters! Not that they went close to the "bad" territory or anything, I think everything here was just too "neat" so I felt it difficult to suspend disbelief. Like, them showing up just as the Doris EZ is having its largest crisis in history is brushed away as a plot hook by the DM, sure that's true, but hanging a lampshade on it doesn't actually resolve it. It is actually really rare in WTC for something to happen just so the DM can give Joon & Co quests; most have been set up by the DM but a long time ago, and the group either actively seeks it out (Falahter, Bethel) or it occurs in response to their actions/situation (Everett's Group, Larksupr, Raven). Even Lio was a bit of a ploy by Uniquities to get them involved. They even show up here randomly; they try to kill Blue-in-a-Bottle once via direct assault and then just give up and go Finch'ing.

The resolution suffered from a similar problem - the idea of them all being Dorises sort-of papers over the fact that the central 'antagonist', who is their own person, isn't met till the last chapter and is pretty much immediately completely understood and reasoned with. From our perspective we know who Doris is, but from blood!Doris's perspective these are some random strangers telling her her life story. She shows up and is immediately resolved. I think it would have worked a lot better if she was an active player through the whole arc, maybe having recently emerged and the Doris EZ is in an uproar over it. And of course now that its done they are going to just pop off to their main adventure, sight unseen, no big deal.

The chapter had many strengths, don't get me wrong - I liked the dive into Mary's biases and hostilities around the tragedy of the commons and accepting weakness and feelings in others (connecting back to Anglecyn was great), and Star Magic was hilariously pedestrian, real "intro to calc TA" vibes from those tutoring sessions which was great. I just though a thin thread pulled it all together, maybe as a property of trying to move things towards the end-game, and I think the pacing & narrative logic were off-kilter as a consequence.

From Blood God Doris's perspective:

#+begin_quote
  “Fuck that's good,” she said, tossing the canteen back across the ward to Grak. As it passed through the ward, the blood simply slid off it, leaving it clean. She looked round at us. “We traded with the Blues, as much as we could, but we knew that they weren't happy about it. And eventually, there were too many colonies in the blood exclusion, too many factions that were stripping the place bare, even with the heavy losses we were taking from the natives. There's some scary shit out there, when you can only see through your sense of blood, probably even scary if it were crystal clear water, but it's damned near impossible to kill every last one of us, and we can wear down nearly anything, or clog their maws with bodies until they're choking to death on pieces of us.” She looked proud of that fact. “It didn't take us long to be the dominant lifeform of our exclusion. And it didn't take long for there to be an arms race among the colonies.”
#+end_quote

She was /happy/ in that brief period of time where her civilization was halfway functional. She's nostalgic of that time.

She has three option:

3. killing and eating herself

Before she became the blood god, she was stuck doing three, but now that she is the blood god she is now doing 1, and can continue to do 1 indefinitely. Option 2 just came up and is going to go away (forever) as soon as Joon leaves. She can always go back to option 1 or 3 later. She chose to do 2, and you can't possibly see why option 3 might be unattractive? There are no other options in the Exclusion Zone

Let's do an experiment, the next time someone offers to talk and grab lunch with you, instead kill someone and eat them.

Then they change the entire direction of Doris-dom via the power of words in a chapter. I just don't buy the effort-output ratios, its unearned.

********** I think what you're missing is that she didn't want to ‘do nothing and leave'. She'd been standing there for days, waiting for someone to show up (possibly imperial agents), because she was tired of the way her life had been, she wanted it to change, but at the same time she felt hopeless to accomplish it on her own, even with godlike power. She didn't know what to do to change things, she hates and distrusts herself, there's this pervasive idea in her mind that whatever she tries will go wrong (and she has millions of herself out there to prove her right) so instead she wants someone else to tell her what to do, to give her a direction, a push. She is still distrustful of these people, because of course she is, but at the same time she is relieved that maybe her wish came true and someone showed up to tell her how to fix things and convince her that now it's actually possible.

Leaving Joon means the violence continues ... forever. Maybe you are too young to understand, but problems don't just go away. Unless Doris changes something her life will continue. And opportunities can be lost forever.

Sometimes you just have to take a chance and listen to a stranger rather than go back to an endless cycle of killing and eating yourself.

She isn't some cool monster that surprisingly turned out to be both OP and exponentially growing. She isn't more setting-breaking than expected.

Also, the team has been unusually chatty about the library around the Dorises. I wonder if they left enough clues that the new ruling Doris can find out she needs to stop anyone from mentioning that she is ruling the world in book form, so the library folks don't come after her.

  Portals take so long that it requires untethering, which means an immense amount of work on the backend. Not only that, you have to make some predictions of where the stars will be, sometimes up to three months in advance, which is no mean feat. The planes themselves move, if slowly, so if you want something that lasts, you need to figure that out and compensate for it. And the problem gets worse for further planes.” (WTC 202)

***** Yes, really.

Thrown Weapons has the virtue Range Finder which doubles accuracy for the purposes of distance. This notably applies to everything, not just thrown weapons - it makes him more accurate with Gem Magic, Rifles and Entad ranged weapons, including those made via Ink Magic. Also Juniper personally likes thrown weapons, which tipped the scales.

Research, Analysis, and Logic taken together gave Juniper the synergy Virtue Narrow Expertise: Multi-Magic, which doubles his effective skill for the purposes of using two magics at once and allows him to treat his effective skill level as 20 in skills for the purposes of multi-magic benefits. They're also generally useful when it comes to making good plans instead of bad plans.

Logistics gives the Worst Case virtue, which imposes a floor on how badly Juniper can fail at logistics - not to the point where he can never fail, but to the point where his failures can never be more than somewhat bad. Because Logistics got a virtue at 10, there is hope that getting it to 30 will give something else good on top of this as a low-hanging fruit.

Optics improves his vision and has strong synergies with Gem Magic - in addition to allowing him to significantly improve the clarity of a lens or prism shaped gem on the fly while ignoring the facets requirement via a Gem Magic virtue, the improved vision stacks with the improved accuracy from Thrown Weapons and the homing nature of blue-spectrum Gem Magic projectiles.

Engineering offers Runtime Analysis, which allows him to automatically make a number of deductions about how a piece of equipment would work without actually having to use it. It is also important for making use of Earth knowledge with regards to importing technologies not otherwise available on Aerb. Ditto for Alchemy, which handles the chemical side of things and which is important for identifying novel subtances.

Mathematics went in on the basis that it works well with a mental build and because they were hoping it would have a synergy with the Research/Analysis/Logic/Logistics/Optics/Engineering/Alchemy/Library Magic cluster of abilities that he already had. This hasn't panned out virtue-wise, but it might do something at level 30.

Personally, I would argue that swapping the Gold Magic in-case-of-glass option (which could be done using a companion just as well) for Fire Magic would be a great idea if he's already rocking Alchemy, but I'm guessing they don't actually have the Entads handy to unlock Fire Magic and historically going to Athenaeums to unlock new Magics has resulted in Spontaneous Quests, so I can kinda see why they're holding off on that one.

****** Wow, first off, massive respect for you being able to bust out all those details off the cuff. You've won me over on them not being bad skills at least.

Still Velocity just seems too shockingly good. Velocity Mages are known to be able to act with twitch reflexes at hyper speed while still having used higher faculties of thought within those reflexes. This to me would synergise so ridiculously well with his multi-magic build, not even taking into account whatever Virtues would get lumped on top.

And one of biggest limitations on Velocity is air starting to slow you down at higher speeds, he already has air magic cutting out one of the big drawbacks Velocity would normally have.

Void is a big risk for June right now, and the Velocity/Air/Dodge skill combo gives him reasonable reaction time and capacity to avoid it. (Or at least maneuver his body to get hit in a non-vital part).

*** Yes, absolutely yes.

For starters, if I use the power only once, and send of the clones to a different country, the odds of both versions of me dying of a random car accident or something similar drop to almost zero. That's already pretty great.

I can provide hundreds of test subjects to test for dangerous treatments, provided these treatments can be done with me anesthetized for the entire duration (for instance, cryogenics).

It's macabre, but I can provide cheap food to starving people everywhere in the world (in most cases, the clones will probably be fed to pigs or other animals or used as fertilizers, rather than fed to people directly), assuming I'm not excluded.

If I'm willing to have doomed clones live for a few days or more before execution, I can solve extremely complex math problems, engineering problems, programming problems, etc (though we run into the "9 women can't make a baby in a month" problem fast).

Seriously, the number of applications is staggering.

Personally, I don't see too much benefit from this. If I was dying I guess it's kind of nice knowing there's another version of me out there, but meh. I'm a continuity of consciousness kind of guy. I see the clones as two separate people. A death is a death.

Organ donation is a good use. Logistics/legality would be tricky though.

W.r.t to the last one: you could, you know, not kill them; the logistics alone seems terrible.

You could also learn things faster. Have one clone learn something then provide an optimised lesson to the rest of the clones.

I'd institute self rules such as the equitable sharing of assets along each split, etc. When someone clones themselves, they are essentially giving up half of what they have to pool their added manpower together.

The main benefit of cloning is you gain access to a group of people who share similiar values and beliefs to you and that you have a very good idea of their mindset/loyalties up until when you split off.

I can easily see 10-12 of me moving into a large townhouse together and co-labouring toward the Clone-Collectives mutual benefit. It wouldn't be a lock in thing, clones could leave if they wanted, the clones that wanted to stay could simply split off a copy of themselves.

*** Regarding only the 3.5E Book of Exalted Deeds, not WtC, there are several "vows" that you can take, each of which requires a feat. To get the Vow of Peace, you first need to take the Sacred Vow, then the Vow of Nonviolence, and then, finally, the Vow of Peace. Feats are one of the most important character optimization points for a character, so giving up three of them is pretty extreme. From the Vow of Nonviolence:

#+begin_quote
  First, you are constantly surrounded by a calming aura to a radius of 20 feet. Creatures within the aura must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Cha modifier) or be affected as by the calm emotions spell. Creatures who leave the aura and reenter it receive new saving throws. A creature that makes a successful saving throw and remains in the aura is unaffected until it leaves the aura and reenters. The aura is a mind-affecting, supernatural compulsion.

  Second, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus to your AC, a +2 deflection bonus to your AC, and a +2 exalted bonus to your AC. This exalted bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore it. It does not stack with an armor bonus. If you also have the Vow of Poverty feat, the natural armor, deflection, and exalted Armor Class bonuses granted by that feat all increase by +2. If a creature strikes you with a manufactured weapon, the weapon must immediately make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Con modifier) or shatter against your skin, leaving you unharmed.

  Finally, you gain a +4 exalted bonus on all Diplomacy checks.
#+end_quote

Basically, people are more willing to engage in diplomacy with you, you're quite a bit harder to hit, and you can break weapons against your skin. Sacred Vow also increases Diplomacy, though not by a huge amount.

Overall, it comes with enough special requirements that even if you have the book, you're unlikely to take it, but especially paired with Vow of Poverty, a low magic setting, or a character that it works well with (monk), it can allow some leverage.
