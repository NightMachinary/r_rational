*** Direct intervention to move from one place to another invites them being snatched out of the air (like what happened when the Skein intervened) whereas putting them in a fight against the Dead King puts them on a footing where Sve Noc is the offence, not evasion. There's a Lot more weight behind them intervening here than if she'd done so earlier to teleport.

*** I think the point is that calling upon Sve Noc to teleport 20 meters qualifies as high-risk, low-reward, whereas calling upon Sve Noc to steal /a king of Callow/ is high-risk, super-high-reward.

**** I think yes he's baiting this, but in falling for the bait Cat gets to take a page out of Kairos' book. The first step always works. If you play into the Dead Kings bait, you get to use the Good King in conjunction with an army of Callowan Spirits. That lets you fight back all the devils and win this encounter. All you need to do then is Not use the Good Kings crown. Which Cat should be smart enough not to do. It fits her arc better I think to use her own.

****** Oh I love that as an idea. I sort of don't want her to lose the Mantle of Woe, but it makes a lot of sense, would probably bind Akua to the realm and once they beat Larat would leave her as its custodian and guide. Even fits with Liesse being the focal point of the realm.

Edit: also, in losing Akua to an eternity repenting by guiding people through a ruin of her own creation, the Woe loses their placeholder Spellslinging knowledge fountain (and sixth ranger). Which in turn makes room for Masego to re-join the band in his regular Role.

I expect that this outcome is Very Likely, providing that Masego survives the encounter. If he doesn't, then I don't think Cat will give up her bound spellcaster so easily. Roland is great, but I can't imagine him sticking around long term.

** There are now enough extra crowns such that they don't even have to use the ones from the Proceran mobs: Cat, Pilgrim, Tyrant, Spellblade, Thief of Stars, The Good King, Skien, Black Knight, and Dead King. That's 9 right there.

I doubt that all of these super powerful crowns will be even used, but it's an interesting alternative.

*** Is the Skein crowned? I don't think he's crowned, just horned.

Also, not sure the Black Knight and Cat aren't sharing a crown, so to speak. If the crown is your right to rule, then Black yielded that right over Callow to Cat. They may count separately though?

**** The transferrence thing came up when she was collecting the original nine crowns - each has their own right.

Anyway it sounds like the best crown to hand over is the one she originally refused. Or maybe akua's just for fun.

**** I said this in a previous comment, but I think rule is more ambiguous than a title. I think Black would qualify since the legions follow him, although it might not count any more since his encounter with Pilgrim if the prerequisite is 'Able to Rule' and 'Currently Ruling'.

If it's just the former he should still count since I don't doubt he could raise banners and get a fair amount behind him. Not the Praes nobility, or most of Callow, but the soldiers definitely. Probably a lot of Praes's commoners would as well if he's seen as the boogeyman for corrupt leaders.
