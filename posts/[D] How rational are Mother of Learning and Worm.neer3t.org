There are some explicitly rationalist web serials out there. For non-explicit stories, I tend to think of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] and [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]]. But I'm new to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and wanted to know how rationalist you all consider them to be.


** As others have said, both the stories can be considered rational, but not rationalist. They do not teach how to think rationally, but they have a lot of internal consistency.

And they're both pretty well-loved in the subreddit. Mother of Learning in particular had a /lot/ of discussion in the subreddit with every chapter that was released. It fits in very well with this community's tastes and desires, I'd say.

** Worm - Explicitly not rationalist contains some rational tropes. To use the definitions in the sidebar:

Thoughtful behaviour in honest pursuit of goals - Almost every decision a person makes in Worm is reasonably motivated by something but the proportion of the time that decision is “I thought really hard and made a well reasoned decision” is not very large.

Consequences of behavior on world/plot - Yes. Choices have real, large, and far reaching consequences in worm.

Realistic intellectual agency - Absolutely not a part of Worm and I can't say why not without spoilers.

Creative / Intelligent problem solving - This is probably the reason most people are initially drawn to Worm.

Examination of goals and motives - I think some characters this is clear, other are not, but it's all at least consistent mostly.

Intellectual pay off: Worm is very long and has a lot of climactic action. Your mileage may vary for how particularly effective these are.

Aspiring rationalism: No. Worm has characteristics of rational fiction but does not primarily feature a rationalist character.

Thoughtful Worldbuilding: Worm is a genre deconstruction that provides an answer for why a superhero world could be “like that” within the context of things happening for a reason. Your willingness to accept the reasons given may vary. This is probably the second biggest reason it is popular on this subreddit.

What do you mean by this? Are you referring to the probability bending powers displayed by a number of characters which means that technically everyone proceeded on set paths, or do you mean that the characters themselves did not appear to have agency?

**** Oh the full text I was referencing was “realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes”, which is explicitly not the case, people in Worm follow established superhero tropes because they are driven by alien experimenters/parasites to do so, instead of because it is the best choice for them, and often sacrifice rational decision making because of their conflict drive - either by placing themselves in harms way much closer to the scene than they should be (Bakuda is a big example here), or by using their powers for combat instead of civil improvement / maximum utility function - even poor Parian can't escape this. I think more generally this phrase refers to “avoiding the idiot ball” but Worm has a “driven to incredible violence and conflict ball”, and even if there's an in universe explanation for why it exists, I still wouldn't say that Worm prioritizes intellectual agency or decision making over tropes, that would defeat the purpose of the story.

***** Well, nominally so, but I didn't really feel this conflict drive playing a role in the story - as opposed to humans just being humans. Humans by themselves have plenty of conflict drive and are generally not good at maximizing utility functions. And regarding Bakuda putting herself in the harm's way unnecessarily - well, not everyone is smart IRL as well. I'm fine with an explanation for some character's actions like "because they are crazy and dumb", as long as this explanation applies just to that character and not to the majority of them.

I think if the "conflict drive ball" were visible and distinguishable from the normal human conflict drive, it would be indistinguishable from the reader's perspective from the plain old idiot ball, just with an in-universe excuse for it. Good that Worm avoids it.

***** Wildbow has gone on record saying that people overestimate how much effect the shards have on human psyche, and that most of the conflict-seeking and poor decisions that you see are just a byproduct of almost all natural triggers being in bad headspaces either from their trigger event or from the factors in their life that led to them getting a trigger event.

It's definitely still a finger on the scales in the background in a way that's antithetical to what makes rational fiction interesting, a catch-all explanation for any bad decisions he might fail to otherwise properly justify, but I really think people overplay this card as some great and terrible crime invalidating every decision made in the story when WB already came out and said that's not how he was playing it. It's a grievance I have, but only a small one.

** Your title doesn't match the body of your post. Rationalist is different than rational. If rational fiction is a genre where characters try to figure out the gears that make their worlds turn, rationalist fiction is using the scientific method to do so. Really, only a few popular series do that; HPMOR, for example, but also Pokemon: Origin of Species. MoL and Worm are rational, but not explicitly rational/ist/ from what I recall.

** For people complaining about Worm characters making obviously stupid decision or unable to find obvious solution I suggest to read the real world history. Especially history of WW2 on Eastern front which is reasanobly well documented and researched (especially taking into account latests resarch). In comparison to WW2 /all/ Worms characters making decisions no worse then average WW2 officer, especailly on the Eastern Front where fog of war was especially dense for both sides and command&control loop was often broken. Scale of stupidity and inability to see obvious solutions or consequences of own actions was staggering under the pressure of real-world total war.

** Neither is rationalist at all.

MoL is maybe 80th percentile rational relative to its genre. I'd be hard-pressed to define that genre concisely, but "a little more general than 'fantasy timeloop'" is a sort of accurate description. Not specifically meant for that goal, but aiming in the same general direction. Definitely more rational than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][its obvious inspiration]], which was pretty good on that front itself. (This may contribute to its popularity in spite of the other aspects which make it infamous.)

Worm is maybe 60th percentile rational relative to the average superhero deconstruction fiction. Compared to Watchmen and Wild Cards, the most well-known entries that predate it, it's about typical. Relative to actual 'traditional' superhero stories it's off the charts, but that's mostly just traditional superhero stories being /completely insane/.

**** The character dynamics of the main three loopers are nearly unchanged from TB to MoL; there isn't a Hinata-analogue but it's really blatant. The main character has comparatively tiny raw power but really good control that they hone to get even better, plus a gift for mental tricks, and is contrasted with a primary looper who's the secondary character and has obscene amounts of raw power. The timeline of how Zorian/Sakura get pulled in also looks the same. Then we learn that the reason for the whole thing is that the Forces Of Good™ manipulated the primary looper into it, the main characters cycle through power ups and huge-downer Wham Episodes, and some of the largest boosts come from the loopers allying together rather than any new skill they pick up for themselves. CED, by contrast, follows the original looper, doesn't have any of those things, and is a pure power fantasy for the main character.

It's not word for word, but it's /clearly/ directly inspired by Time Braid. With the serial numbers filed off and the BDSM and hurt-comfort stripped out.

** Worm really, really is not. Many people complain about the Spoiler, and the Other Spoiler, but my main problem with the entire story is that the main character used her power very badly, and despite a supposed focus on combat creativity, essentially nobody ever prepared to fight her, or used any of the gazillion obvious counters.

It is not a spoiler at this point she controls bugs, I suppose, but given that power, ever showing her face is the height of foolishness. She has no defenses at all, and can fight by remote. The proper place and person to be is a random civilian /in a bunker/.

And anyone preparing to do anything where they might encounter her, should really have shown up bearing Raid and Fire.

The protagonist faced opponents that used chemical, electrical, and flame-based counters. In those cases she had to run and/or get help. Otherwise she was aggressive and tended to ambush enemies who weren't prepared. Lastly I think you might be underestimating the overwhelming power of a swarm of unnatural size, diversity, and coordination.

*** In a bunker, you can't follow someone, once they're out of range.And bunkers aren't necessarily where you need to fight.Mobility is a tradeoff, too of course. But she did have spider armor for durability.And she was safer than most outside, given her situational awareness.Besides the fights were either not chosen, like Mannequin going after Taylor's civilians. Or culturally tolerated crime, but with zero tolerance for lethality.Being in a bunker takes away important less-lethal options.Or they were fights against Endbringers, where the bunker won't help.Also there was never a reason to prepare for her specifically.

And Worm is not just Taylor's ego trip. She brings friends.I don't think any specific engagement would have benefited from a bunker-mentality.

EDIT: It's been years since I read Worm, though. Might be possible. But this didn't stand out to me, and I think it would have.\\
But truthfully, when the fights became an anime-clusterfuck of powers, I tended to skim them, because I wasn't able to actually visualize it back then.

** Worm is, like, the opposite of rational. All of its characters are drunk on heavy, heavy self-deception and rationalization, and have a tendency of punching each other into submission without attempting the basic practice of stringing together a coherent argument of "Why I believe/do what I believe/do."

I got it, shard mind-fuckery, Jack mind-fuckery, Simurgh-flavored domino mind-fuckery and Contessa-flavored domino mind-fuckery makes people violence-engines with their reasoning in tatters. I just...have a hard time caring about any of them, or deem them rational in any sense.
