*** It was more or less agreed between both the players and QMs to have a 'beach episode' chapter to recuperate in-character after the previous events.

**** Oh wait, this is 34 not 35. My bad. Yeah we did all agree on a beach episode since velorien had the scene between hazou and mari that he really wanted to write.

*** In fairness, they've spent 33 chapters running from one life-threatening event to another. They're entitled to want to chill for a couple chapters.
