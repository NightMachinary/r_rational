November is [[http://nanowrimo.org/][National Novel Writing Month]]. Does anyone have any plans to do it this year? October has always been my "National Novel /Planning/ Month" so that I'm ready to go for when November rolls around.

Here's my advice for anyone in the planning stages:

- Figure out your characters. If you're having trouble with this, just steal from somewhere and strip off the serial numbers. No one is ever going to call you on your main character acting just like Monica from /Friends/ so long as you fudge the life details.
- Figuring out characters means asking questions. You don't actually know a character until you know what motivates them, what they fear, etc. For all your principle characters, imagine them in either some stressful situation or faced with a difficult choice, then imagine the resolution.
- Figure out your plot. Dan Harmon's [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][story circle method]] is a more basic, more prescriptivist version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth][Campbell's monomyth]]. It's very easy to structure plots around it.
- Figuring out your plot means trying your best to link the story beats with "therefore" or "but", not "and". Events which are disconnected from each other are /realistic/ but don't tend to make for great writing (this bit of advice is one commonly given by [[http://www.mtvu.com/video/?vid=689002][Matt Stone and Trey Parker]]).
- Write a single sentence description of each chapter. Then write a single sentence description of each scene within the chapter. It's easier to write a novel (and write a novel /fast/) if you're spending less time stuck looking at the page wondering what happens next (though some of that is unavoidable).

As for making all this /rational/, that's just a matter of what direction you take the story and how hard you can hammer on your worldbuilding and plot, looking for ways that you're failing, then trying to shore them up. A good way to do that is talking to other people to get a different perspective. (Making it /rationalist/ is an extra level of difficulty that I wouldn't attempt if I wanted to hit 50,000 words in a month.)

*tl:dr;* So is anyone doing NaNo this year? Any plans you need help with or plots that need a second set of eyes? Any questions of rationality that need to be addressed? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/nanowrimo][See the wiki page for past discussions.]]


** I have an idea that's been stewing for a couple months, but I keep having false starts on it. The closer we get to November 1st, the closer I get to deciding to just write it then instead of now. Sometimes I wonder if providing writers an excuse to not write is the worst part of NaNoWriMo

** I have plans for November that aren't exactly NaNoWriMo, but probably close enough for the purposes of this thread. I've been working on a novel for a long time; last year, I finished the fourth first draft of it¹. I'll be trying to rewrite at least the first of three parts of this story for good this November. Once I'm done with that first part, I'd like to try to recruit proofreaders from this subreddit, mostly because I've gotten some very good critiques here in the past.²

As for the story: the first part is going to be half clockpunk dystopia and half board game gambling. If anyone is interested in proofreading, reply to this comment or send me a PM, and I'll notify you when the need for proofreading arises, though I also intend to make a post about it at that time.

You're also welcome to contact me if you want to talk about clockpunk or board game design! Only one of the five games that will be featured in the first part has fully functioning rules at this point, and I'd love to increase that number.

--------------

¹: Yes, the fourth first draft is still a first draft.

²: Stories I've previously posted to this subreddit include /The Library Unpublished/, /On the Continuity of Consciousness/ and a number of short stories for the biweekly challenges.

** Is there going to be a sticky thread or normal thread where everyone can post their respective stories.

Might be a good idea to help us all keep track of each other. Give everyone the opportunity to be held accountable, to a certain degree, if they would like. I know stuff like that usually helps me.

*** I will probably do a weekly thread, but it won't be sticky this time as it has been in past years, because we already have two. The plan will be to post one every week for check-ins.

** I'm planning on writing a sentient dungeon story and I'm hoping to make it a much lighter and happier tone than what I usually write, so I decided to go with a child as the MC. This brought up a problem I didn't really think about at the time...

*How do you write children rationally irrational?*

HPMOR, MoL and Pokemon:OoS all seem to solve this by making the children more mature for their age because of special circumstances. I would like the children in my story to be normal 10 years old. Not stupid, but definitely far from rational.

Any tips or advice on furthering a plot in a rational way with irrational characters? Or how to learn how write irrational characters?

*** 1. Children use simpler vocabulary. At ten years old, it /isn't/ uniformly simple, because some longer words will stick in their minds and get used to demonstrate mastery (sometimes to the level of annoyance). Still, it might be good to run dialog through [[https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/][the xkcd Simple Writer]] to check whether you're speaking like a child wouldn't. Children also favor sentences that are less structured, though some of that starts to disappear by age 10.
2. Children know less. Constrain your references and if you find yourself reaching for a bit of knowledge that you possess, think about whether a 10-year-old would have it. It helps to check against what you knew at 10, or maybe ask a 10-year-old if you have one handy.
3. Children experience the same cognitive biases that adults do, but worse (generally speaking). Halo effect, hindsight bias, conformity, typical mind fallacy, etc. are all present in a 10-year-old but usually not corrected for in the ways that an adult might.
4. Kids usually have poor impulse control, which sometimes gets attributed to "stronger" emotions, though I don't know where the social science is on that. It's probably good to think about the imp of the perverse with some frequency.

** Hm. I've got a couple story ideas bouncing around in my head lately, so I think I'll give nano a try! Now it's just a question of whether to aim for this as something to force me to really put my nose to the grindstone on the idea I've been putting more work into, or whether to focus on the other idea as something self-contained and less important to experiment with over Nano so that I don't rush the first idea...

** November is terrible novel time for me (exams!), but I might try and do a mini version to polish up my supernatural romance novel that I mostly finished in January (that may never get published if my coauthor never gets around to editing it, but I've made peace with that).

Thanks for the story circle method - I'm working out a base plot for my werewolf novel, and it's good to have more ways to think about these things.

Here's a question: I want to write a story about my werewolf, but all the "good ideas" I think of are really about her helping another character go through /his/ own story circle. Which kind of robs her of her agency/primacy in the story in a weird way, since /her story/ ends up being about some other dude. Anyone have tips for how I can move from her being the foil of the non-werewolf to the non-werewolf being her foil, or should I just make peace that my "werewolf novel" is going to be more of a "novel with a werewolf supporting character"?

*** My first instinct would be to have that "help" blow up in their face, or perhaps just have an unexpected turn. That is, it /starts out/ with trying to help a friend, but it ends up ... doing something else. Presuming that these are already established characters, it's hard to say, but if I were working from a blank slate:

- Protagonist is the proactive friend trying to set her beleaguered pal up on a date (or whatever), and this works ... only for this to be a turning point, because the protag realizes that she's been missing something from her life, maybe the exact thing that that she was trying to help her pal achieve. (And maybe this realization is the end of her story, or maybe that's just the call to adventure.)
- Protagonist is the proactive friend trying to set her beleaguered pal up on a date (or whatever), but it turns out that she's doing this more for her own (social?) benefit than his, and she gets called out on it, which sends her on some soul-searching, and some PLOT happens, after which she has become a better person for it.
- Protagonist is the proactive friend trying to set her beleaguered pal up on a date (or whatever), but around the end of the first act he confesses that really, he's in love with her, and then she needs to grapple with her muddled feelings of attraction, or asexuality, or problems with intimacy, or her messy life that won't allow a boyfriend, or getting her soon-to-be-ex to actually sign the divorce papers, or ... something like that.
- Protagonist is the proactive friend trying to set her beleaguered friend up on a date (or whatever), only to meet the prospective date's counterpart proactive friend. They work together trying to set their mutual friends up, and end up falling for each other, making the "helping friends" plot into the B-plot.

I think the real problem you have isn't so much one of agency, but maybe tension, because your protagonist doesn't have terribly much at stake, and isn't going through their own character development arc. If you follow the story circle, the "zone of comfort" might be "helping a friend with a problem", which is the character's default state, and you need to figure out what's not right about that default state, which isn't necessarily the "helping someone" part, but "too giving" might be a real problem they have to work through, or "too invested in other peoples' lives", or "living vicariously" are reasonable angles you might take.

**** Thanks, that's really helpful! I appreciate it especially because it must have taken a long time to write.

At the moment if you put me in a Saw-style torture room and told me to write it, and the sooner it was finished the less limbs I lost, the plot would go like this:

Fiona the lawyer is a werewolf, but she is for all intents and purposes a regular human with a link to the supernatural underworld. Malik, a demon who looks human but for his bat ears, feathery wings, and tail goes to her for help "immigrating" into her city. He wants to rent a shop front and use it to sell specialty demon wares. She agrees to help him. He starts making escalating demands: once the papers are done, he has her help him with his masquerade (basically, advice on socially acceptable hats that cover his ears and appropriately padded shirts), assist in ordering things from human suppliers, and so on.

Then one day Malik phones her and says that the police are snooping around and demanding to enter his shop. She explains about warrants and stuff and then Malik idly wonders if it would have anything to do with the human he killed and ate a few days earlier. Fiona is stuck in between two places: she's trying to get a good reputation with the supernatural creatures she wants to help so badly, but she never really was hit with the ugly reality of /murder/ before, and to be fair she never did tell Malik that cannibalism wasn't on (in retrospect, she reflects that a conversation she had with him about his "preferred diet" could have been interpreted as endorsing cannibalism).

Malik's father is a very powerful, very protective gargoyle who lives in town, so if she tried to kick Malik back to the underworld it would go very badly for her (she probably attempts this at first), so she's kind of forced to continue this.

She realises how frighteningly naive she has been about the supernatural thing, since as a whole werewolves are very loving, kind and nurturing. Maybe she goes to the Werewolf High Council for help (????), but she ultimately manages to get Malik to realise that eating "wild" humans isn't acceptable but reluctantly admits that "farmed" human meat he picks up on the "other side" would be acceptable. Malik probably ends up going to prison on some smallish charge (she has a werewolf who works in that prison keep an eye on him?), and upon his release becomes a "productive" member of society.

The end of the story would probably consist of Malik's father introducing William, his vampire master, to Fiona after Malik's glowing recommendation. Although vampires kill and eat people they tend to do it pretty subtly, and regardless, unlike Malik, William has a lot of social influence in town and this could be her big chance to get noticed by the underworld creatures.

The end result is Fiona probably realises that if she's going to be the supernatural lawyer she always dreamed of, she'd better learn to accept that some supernatural creatures really aren't that nice, or she won't be able to help the nice ones.

.... wow, I was not actually expecting to write it all like that, I was expecting one little piddly paragraph.

I was worried about it becoming Malik's story but I think given the plot beats it does look a lot more like Fiona's, and Malik certainly doesn't come across sympathetically. The big issues with it at the moment are there's probably too much Hollywood Law going on in the above, and the thought of the story being about Fiona abandoning her principles could be fine if the principle was something like "honesty is the best policy" except the principle being abandoned is "hanging out with murderers is a bad thing", which doesn't seem like a great ending. Then again, maybe she just wants to nudge them: perhaps werewolves have been nudging vampires in particular for centuries.
