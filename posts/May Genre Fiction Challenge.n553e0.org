May the 4th be with you! :D

This month, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a FANFICTION.

A brief description:

/Fanfiction is a piece of fiction written by a fan about another author's work. It may be an attempt to further explore a character or a relationship between characters -- romantic or platonic -- or it may be a sort of ‘what-if' scenario. Or it could be the urge to throw the characters into a different setting -- like a coffee shop, university, or different time period -- or into a different creator's world entirely. Sometimes, it's a way for the fanfiction author to interact with the characters themselves, by inserting a(n often idealised) version of themselves into that world./

I can hear you saying, “But Ms_CIA, how could we possibly make money off of copyrighted characters?”

Well, I'm not sure, but perhaps we can ask Dante Alighieri, Cassandra Claire and all the people who write in the Star Wars universe. +Or Eliezer Yudkowsky.+

At any rate, I'm sure the opportunity to +promote your fanfictions+ write in another author's world will help you in the future!

Guidelines:

• There is no set word limit. Write and post as many words as you like! (technically there's a 500 word minimum, but I'm not counting)

• You're encouraged to include rational elements in the fiction, but the main challenge is to write an enjoyable genre fiction. Everything else is gravy.

• Post your work as a comment to this thread, which can include a link or the entire story (if it is flash fiction). PM me if you want me to post your work anonymously.

• Last day to post is May 31st

I'm also thinking that if this contest runs all year, I'll create an archive of all our 2021 genre fiction stories. It would be sort of like a rational fiction anthology. :)

That's all guys! Start writing!

** */The/* */Tröllbanamaðrsaga/*

/Of how brave Harald Cleftface had slain a terrible Troll that preyed on the folk of Trondheim, avenging his brave companions and winning the admiration of all./

Amidst the land of frost and snow,

where neither ferns or mosses grow,

terrible beast prowl'd unseen,

craving the blood of Northern kin.

​

Tis was a Troll of strangest spell,

for if ones eyes on its hide fell,

it turn'd as mist or empty air,

present, alas! if was not there.

​

Many a warrior hath stood its path,

brandishing steel against its wrath,

most disappeared, the others worse,

left naught of them but headless corpse.

​

Tales say the troll was Honor-Bound,

leaping at warriors like frenzied hound,

putting brave hunters in early grave,

but would not hurt a maid or a babe.

​

Along came Harald in bright maile clad,

on a fastest longship one ever had,

with him he brought companions ten,

all battle-forged, Bear-Shirted men.

​

A band of Heroes by Norns Fate-bound,

their black-sailed ship had came a'ground,

a storm of swords had spilled forth,

every man eager to prove his worth.

​

The Troll did saw their weapons fine,

and in its heart plot'd dark design,

to slay them covertly one by one,

till Harald's hird is all undone.

​

First man to die was brave Einar,

who joined the halls of Einherjar,

marked with the Troll's scarlet light,

he dropped butchered without a fight.

​

​

Next came the beast's invisible claw,

and gutted old Rolf from groin to jaw,

spilling his guts on blood-soaked snow,

slaying the man with one savage blow.

​

Soon the scythe came for warrior third,

when Sven was plucked from among the hird,

yanked straight up into the trees,

where all waited him was Hel's final kiss.

​

'Hirdmen haro!' came Harald's bellow,

'brace wall of shields, protect your fellow'!

'The Troll casts spells, and might climb high',

'but comes the morn we'll see it die!'

​

Angered thus, the Troll cast thunder,

and wrought the wall of shields asunder,

between the warriors it lept amidst,

and shed aside its spell of mists.

​

In hearts of men crept icy fear,

to see such awful beast come near,

its hide of stone its hair of snakes,

its clawed paws like razor-rakes.

​

Burst forth did pair of blood-crazed twins,

Eino and Ose, two snow-born Finns,

they stabbed the Troll with mighty knives,

and though they drew blood, they paid their lives.

​

'Witness it men, the fight's not in vain!'

'if the beast bleeds it can be slain!'

roared brave Harald lifting his axe,

to cleave his foe a bloody tax.

​

Spears struck like a swarm of angry bees,

but Bjorn was brought down to his knees,

When troll-cursed blade had pierced his eye,

he died in battle , like heroes die.

​

When Harald dodged a mighty blow,

and landed in a a heap of snow,

he saw that cloak of snowy sheen,

made him to the monster's eyes unseen!

​

Egil the swift and Sigurd fair,

fought the vile creature as a pair,

with Danish axe and spear most swift,

in its defense they found a rift!

​

They gave its belly a nasty gash,

but soon their throats were scarlet -washed,

the troll cast a blade from a sheath on hip,

and sliced their necks in a single whip.

​

The sole survivors Harald and Gorm,

engulfed the troll like winterstorm,

slathered in snow and icy water,

they set their blades on invisible slaughter.

​

​

Thus fell Gorm brave with wounds awashed,

and though the troll was also slashed,

alive it stood, against all reason,

against the laws of Gods, a treason.

​

​

'Face me o beast' great Harald spoke,

'take of your helm, untie the yoke',

'today thou will perish, and shall you die,

let me first look thee in the eye!'

​

The mighty Troll his helm unstrapped,

took of the mask that its face wrapped,

its eyes like stones were gray and firm,

its fanged maw like crab or wyrm.

​

'Thou be one unsightly móðirfokka'

jested thus Harald and a fight broke out,

with stabs and slashes and cuts back and forth,

the Spawn of the Stars and the Son of the North.

​

As blades flew a-flash, and weapons raced,

the Troll's blade cleft Harald's handsome face,

but gravely wounded, Harald ever-swift,

caught the beast's blade with his teeth!

​

To take his advantage to its full,

brave Harald charged like a bull,

pressing beast's own blades against the Troll,

he took a vengeful bloody toll.

​

The star-forged blades cut meat and bone,

the edge by Troll's own magic honed,

sliced its own head quick and clean,

splashing the snow with fae-green sheen.

​

​

'The deed is done' quoth Harald Brave,

and buried the foe in nameless grave,

then gathered his slain men on a pyre,

and gave them to Allfather's fire.

​

Some say, the Troll's own star-born kin,

still lurk the wilderness unseen,

but who would listen to such tale,

time rise the cups and drink some ale!

***** Not in any variety of English I know about. It's true that "unseen" has a long vowel while "kin" has a short one, but the vowel quality is also different even if similar enough to cause some confusion, particularly as the one in "unseen" only occurs as a long vowel.

You can check this in the vowel section of the Wikipedia article on English phonology.

Alternatively, if you have correct pronunciation you can try saying "kin" and "keen" and see if the root of your tongue moves. "kin" should be more central.

**** Sorry for the super late reply; unfortunately, it wouldn't. There was a lot of things revealed in the last 30-ish manga chapters that would be needed to understand fully what's happening here.

You could give reading it a try but I don't think it would do much for you other than give a few massive spoilers. Plus the AoT manga's last 30-ish chapters are CRAZY. Super worth a read.
