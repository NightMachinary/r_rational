** I just binged through it after reading the review and I gotta say I'm really, really enjoying this to the point I wish I knew the language so I could read the unstranslated version. I really appreciate the work being put into translating this!

** I don't get this story. I read the first couple chapters and it seemed a bit confusing and the translation clunky. I see it consistently posted and upvoted on here, though. Am I missing the point of the story somehow?

*** According to a review that was posted before the story was even translated, it gets better around chapter 90. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/?st=iwt2lbsz&sh=2cd2f043][Like, a lot better.]]

*** Clunky translations are the norm when you're dealing with wuxia/xianxia novels so I'd guess most of us are inured to it at this point.

Also one of the quirks of the genre seems to be non existent narrative flow/pacing which is even worse when paired with the aforementioned translation.
