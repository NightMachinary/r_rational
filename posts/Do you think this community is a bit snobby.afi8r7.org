I mean, I don't think I've met a single poster who I'd call a bad person or even a difficult-to-get-along with person.

It's just that, the longer I'm around this community, the more I feel like the main purpose of this is to look down on every other community of fiction.

Again, it's not a single person, nor a single comment. But a lot of the small undertones in fanworks have this kind of snobbish feel to them, like they can't stand any character that doesn't belong in this club of super smart characters.

Like say with HPMOR, where every non hyper intelligent character is cut out, like Ron, who in the original material was the part of the main castle.

Or with the third highest upvited post on the sub, where a character in a zombie apocalypse repeatedly goes:

"Oh God, you're so stupid, Oh God, you're so stupid, I'm so fucking intelligent and you're so stupid"

I know that's not directly stated in text, but it's kind of what I got. Not a love of the genre that comes with most fanfiction, but more of a " Oh geeeeze, this is what I have to work with. Can you believe this? "

That's kind of why the above examples felt insulting. It felt like a shallow and bitter satire coming from a person that thinks they know what's better.

Again, I know I'm intruding here a bit, but I'm not doing this out of malice or anything. It's actually a bit out of respect for the sub

If I wanted to post a criticism of any other piece of media I wouldn't do it on the sub devoted to that media but I'm posting it here because I know this sub prides itself discussion and self reflection, so it would felt like unnecessarily talking behind someone's back if I posted it somewhere else.

So yeah. That's it.

So, like, in science fiction fandom there's a subset of the fandom that is really into diamond hard SF... that's what they're into. They get upset that the video version of /The Expanse/ has this illustration of the intercept of a spaceship with an asteroid and they get the orbital mechanics COMPLETELY WRONG. Like don't they even know Newton's three laws? Sheesh. And don't get me started on Gravity.

This is basically the same kind of thing for character and narrative. People here don't care if the story is hard SF or not, they just care that /given that you accept the backstory/ the narrative actually makes sense, and the people in the story live up to their characters.

And just as most SF (particularly most media SF) isn't really hard SF, it turns out that most supposedly intelligent characters are not written intelligently. So it gets on the nerves of people who care about that stuff.

If you're not someone who cares about that stuff, you probably won't dig it.

*** heck, sometime you can pinpoint that single moment in plot where there is an obvious idiot-ball handed to a character for the sole purpose of screwing them over to move the plot along. an action that seems out of character with how that character has been shown in the story thus far. like the author just gave up at that point.

other times, you get a charcter who is, on close examination, a specific kind of idiot throughout the entire story (Merlin from the Amber series books 6 through 10, for example). oh sure, genius at some things, no bloody common sense otherwise. if written well, you may not even notice it right away.

now, the idiot MC can be a good story and very interesting, but it is a very different sort of story than one that focuses on the competance of the MC to move the plot.

in general, i prefer stories where there is some thinking going on. plots that revolve around being clever, or that explain new concepts that i had not heard of before, are good things. i detest stories where the plot revolves around ignorance, and the author never explains anything either so the reader is in the dark to things as well (and yes, i have seen that in a novel, it was very bad).

***** Here's a good example:

In With This Ring, early on the character gets an orange power ring and, because it runs off desire and the OC lost money in the recession, the ring disintegrates money (and credit cards) on contact. The OC got around this by carrying gold coins certified by the US treasury. In retrospect he could have just taken the stupid thing off whenever he went shopping, but he was so caught up in having super powers and high on the orange light that it never occurred to him. That's a /believable/ mistake. On the other hand, if the character never bothered to check if it worked on credit cards and he went around bumming money off people for the rest of the series, that's an immersion-killing mistake.

Also, since the ring takes care of all his body's needs, and the Justice League provides accommodation, and he can pretty much transmute any mundane material at will, he never ran into a financial crunch that would really force him to revisit that. And he found out that Ploutos, the Greek god of money, has helped to make this world's economy a bit more sane, which helped him get over his contempt for fiat currency, making it eventually a non-issue.

**** It's more about both intelligence and consistency. It's great when characters make believable mistakes, but it can be grating when a character makes a mistake that any reader can immediately point to and come up with a better/in-character solution using only the knowledge available to the character. And it's very hard to write a character that's more intelligent than you, so as an author, your best bet is just taking some time to think through the character's actions and their consequences.

Of course, rational fics want the protagonist and possibly antagonist to be rational, but not every character in the setting. And all characters can be rational but working towards opposing goals depending on their experience and outlook on life. It has its flaws, but it's just another structure for a story. And perhaps to a greater degree than many other types of fiction, rational fiction is about diving down and addressing story tropes- sometimes playing them straight, but sometimes deconstructing them in interesting ways.

That would leave it still in orbit, with a lower perihelion and a higher apohelion and possibly in an Earth-crossing orbit.

Of course, everyone has different pet peeves, so not everyone cares about the particular traits that this subreddit wants to fix.

** I know that after finding out about this genre and thoroughly loving it I've found it difficult to really get into books without a rational protagonist. But I personally don't look down on people with different tastes or those tastes themselves.

I've got two roommates, one is a medical student and the other is a doctor. One loves the shit out of cringe comedy (Inbetweeners and Blue Mountain State) and hated Mad Max Fury Road. The other is a huge fan of dark comedies with stupid death scenes and laughs long and hard at them. Otherwise both are incredibly intelligent and great company. in my view a person's taste is a bit like their fetish. It rarely impacts who they are outside of that taste.

*** For me personally this genre made it harder to enjoy thinking about and theorizing about less rational protagonists. Good literature and media that isn't very rational is still enjoyable to consume, but thinking about it during the process and trying to make predictions is less enjoyable since you're likely to be wrong for dumb reasons.

There's also two levels of rationalist fiction in my opinion, the first level is just characters and settings that a trying to be realistically consistent and the second is where characters actively break down their thought processes as a focus. I'm not a huge fan of the second level so maybe that makes it easier on me.

Another factor is that I believe stories that are rational are more likely to be good, authors that think hard and plan things out tend to make more rational works and better authors tend to do those steps better, so we kind of get spoiled here.

I do wonder how people who like mystery/whodunit stories get effected by this community. I never really liked the genre before and this community encouraging deeper examination might have made it worse for me (not counting the cool rational ones where they actively try to be solvable).

I'd also further delineate rational fiction into stories with either a rational protagonist and/or a rational world. I like a rational protagonist trying to makes sense of a seemingly irrational world (Practical guide) or a somewhat irrational protagonist trying to make their way in a completely rational world, although this is rarer.

As for mysteries, I've never liked them unless they're very off the wall (Commander Vimes or Dirk Gently). Strangely enough these also seem to be quite rational.

Rational fiction is a good way to make protagonists earn their powers by cleverly exploiting whatever world they're in, so it doesn't feel cheap. Alternatively, flawed and ridiculous characters like in One Punch Man or One Piece or The Seventh Horcrux makes it clear that you're not supposed to take the characters seriously or praise how amazing they are because that's not the point of the story.

I like rational protagonists who I can identify with and deliberately irrational protagonists who I'm supposed to laugh at and enjoy the show. It's the uncanny valley in between that annoys me, where they're inconsistent and act normally most of the time except when the plot demands that they do something stupid.

** Yes, it's a persistent problem with the community, and has been pretty much since its inception. Part of the problem is that mean-spirited "parody" is a lot easier than an honest attempt at deconstruction and/or reconstruction. It's easy to laugh at some dumb thing a writer did because they wanted to move the plot along and not ask questions, but it's /hard/ (or at least takes /effort/) to follow a premise through to its natural conclusion, or to rebuild the premise so that it's got the same conclusion but with more nuance and thought. So people will just do the mean-spirited pointing-out-flaws thing, because that requires little effort (and frankly, little intelligence).

For my part, I try not to do that kind of thing, because I think there's way too much of it, both in this subreddit, and in the wider culture. It's a tough battle though, because one side is spending more time and effort than the other. (And I will grudgingly admit to not being perfect, as well as being a snob of a different sort.)

**** I think it's useful to divide the community out into the the commentariat and the writers, because they have very different roles, and each contribute to "the community" in different ways.

For writers, the thing I'll see most often is a snide contempt for the source material, namely by having characters point out how stupid some thing that happened in canon was (even though it's not canon in their own work). This is similarly the case when there's a Lone Sane Man who is the only point of departure for the work, and who spends most of his time "satirically" pointing out everything dumb in the world with very little charity given to the original worldbuilding/plot. This, I think, has tapered off a bit with time, but a lot of the 2013-2014 era stuff was in that vein, and I still see it from time to time. I don't tend to find it particularly clever, in part because criticism by way of exaggeration and denigration doesn't seem (to me) like it takes too much work or thought.

For the commentariat ... I actually would say that it's gotten better over time, but it's really hard to judge. What I mean is mostly comments in the form of "that's dumb, why did X not do Y?" without any actual consideration for why X didn't do Y. It's not so much the criticism, I guess, it's the format of the criticism and the feeling that whoever is doing the talking went in with a negative mindset looking for things to complain about, regardless of whether those complaints were actually grounded in cogent thought. To give some analogies, it's like a hard scifi fan picking up a soft scifi book and picking it apart piece by piece, or someone who's really into wine picking up a ten dollar bottle to mercilessly mock its quality.

There's a lot of that stuff all over the internet. "People complain about things" is a cottage industry where you can make good money. It's not that it doesn't have a place, it's just that it seems to me that it's pretty low value, because it doesn't take much effort and doesn't tend to produce good content. I'm much more of the mind that "rational fiction" as a genre should be about creating new things or exploring old things, not simply being negative about works that are outside the genre and don't live up to ideals that they weren't even aspiring to.

(The extent to which the above actually matches to "snobbery" is up for debate, as is the question of to what extent it's actually a problem present in writers or the commentators.)

***** With HPMOR, one problem that it faced is that there's a whole host of good Harry Potter fanfiction that's long since dived into and deconstructed magic in different/interesting ways, or delved into the characters/Voldemort in particular. There are some thing HPMOR does particularly well, but also a fair chunk of things that weigh it down.

As someone who got into it from the "Harry Potter fanfic" side of things, it does a lot of pure rewriting of the magic, which is one of the factors that makes it "feel" less like Harry Potter- these rules works well in fiction where you get to purely establish the setting, but less so when you're changing an existing one and your character's exploitation/munchkinry is effectively only possible because you created rules that allowed it. You're literally rewriting existing rules by author fiat, which is fine in most fanfiction, but feels out of place in a self-proclaimed "rational" fic. For transfiguration, canon HP transfigurations do not actually run out of magic and revert. In comparison, I've read fics like Taure's "The Power He Knows Not" that capture that magic and have prose that feels familiar to the series.

And of course, it feels overly bloated- much of Hermione's adventures, the actual battles post part 1, etc. Or for another example, the idea of magic being stored and transferred for potions with acorns is a common idea in HP fanfic. But HPMOR presents that and other ideas/innovations only up because Harry thought about it without experimentation, offscreen. The magic is only narrated to the reader directly before the event and generally only shows up when he needs that bit of magic.

Trying to tell the story of many persons in many places undermines each individual story you try to tell by drawing importance away from that story.

******* I've always been drawn to it (when reading physical books) because, all else being equal, reading a good book which is longer is better. Sometimes an author didn't feel like splitting up one story into separate volumes, and instead of a series, there's just a stand alone book and it's great and it has less of that problem. I've only read one epic I didn't enjoy (and finish reading) and it was the Wheel of Time - 12 books, each super long, and the author died before writing the last book, which ended up getting published as 3 books, and that really should have been my first clue.

That doesn't mean writing a good book that's longer is just as easy, but as a series goes on, it seems to happen naturally.

****** When I say "prose" I usually mean the sentence-to-sentence particulars of the text, how evocative the sentences are, how well they flow between each other, how smoothly each sentence flows, etc.

When I say pacing, I usually mean the scene-to-scene particulars, how well each scene accomplishes what it needs to, whether plot points lead into each other and are resolved in a timely manner, etc.

(I /think/ that's more or less orthodox.)

So you can have good prose, in that the sentences are pleasing enough, and they each accomplish something, but /terrible/ pacing, where resolutions aren't given enough time to breathe, where plots spend too much time brewing, where entire scenes composed of pretty sentences are functionally pointless to the plot ,etc. In web fiction, bloat is pretty common, and while there's nothing wrong with a leisurely pace, it can really kill a story for me if what's supposed to be a narrative just turns into slice-of-life. (And there are other ways that pacing can be bad than just 'slow', naturally, but bloat is one of the big risks for web fiction.)

Alternately, you can have weak prose, but with a cracking plot that moves along with energy and vigor in spite of that. There, I find that I can usually get into a mindset where I'm ignoring the poor prose and just moving along without examining it or reading all that closely, and so long as things are happening at a good pace, I can keep up that ignoring indefinitely.

I think it's partly the "atmosphere" of the place, where people that like well constructed stories can hang out. A lot of the time, we go out with irl friends to see hollywood movies or something, and it's a bit jarring when they enjoy all the lights and colours and you're just shaking your head at how contrived the story is, or thinking about all the ridiculous plot holes/lack of continuity.

You might try to discuss this with them, but the reply will usually be "it's just a movie, lighten up and enjoy it".

So this is a safe haven to discuss works that have, a "higher" level of story construction, amazing foreshadowing, and all around enjoyable stories that don't have too many writing issues common to mass works.

*** For a bit of a point of comparison, I'd put forth the LitRPG community, and more specifically, one of its biggest ambassadors, Ramon Mejia, who hosts LitRPG Podcast and does several book reviews per week.

From everything I've seen, Ramon is a very friendly and positive guy who is incredibly generous with his time: because he's such a lynchpin of the LitRPG community, a lot of self-published authors ask him directly for advice about how to label and market their books -- and he nearly always takes the time to provide direct (and sometimes detailed) answers to their questions. And one of the things that he's most often asked by authors is, "Is the story that I've written LitRPG? Or do you think I should stick to using a GameLit novel or something similar?" I'm not sure that everyone would consider Ramon Mejia to be "the face" of the LitRPG community, but if he is, I don't think you could ask for a more friendly and welcoming representative.

That being said, with LitRPG being a very fast-growing label in the Amazon Kindle store, there have been a lot of self-published authors who have been labeling their stuff as LitRPG simply to show up in search results. There are also slightly less shameless versions of this, where people will take an existing work, spend a few hours adding the bare minimum of elements to be considered LitRPG, and then re-release it under a new title to find a new audience. And then you have the more earnest version of this, where people say, "Hey, this seems like a cool community that is hungry for more content!" and they start writing LitRPG stories (perhaps even in a way that's well-intentioned) without taking the time to read in the genre and acquire a basic understanding of what LitRPG is.

One of the things that Ramon has been pretty adamant about on his book review podcast is calling out stories that are not LitRPG despite being labeled as such. He gives each book a numerical score on a scale of 1-10, and anything that is not really LitRPG frequently gets several points knocked off. Some of these reviews even praise books for being well-written but then give a score of 6/10 because "not LitRPG." I don't think Ramon has a problem with these kinds of stories existing; he wouldn't take a book like The Hobbit and say "6/10, not LitRPG." But if you label your work as LitRPG, you are asking to be judged by a certain rubric, and part of that rubric is, "Is this delivering on the basic expectations of LitRPG readers?" If the answer to that question is "no," then that's fine, but don't come to LitRPG communities expecting people to respond favorably to your work.

I don't think that many people on this subreddit have a problem with, say, Marvel movies. I myself quite enjoy them, and I think most other people here would say the same. But if you posted a thread on [[/r/rational]] for "[RT] Thor Ragnarok" I think you'd have a lot of people who would say, "This doesn't belong here." I don't think that makes you a snob, any more than pointing out that, say, using [[/r/lego]] as a place to discuss K'NEX is probably not in line with the spirit or intention of of what that subreddit is for.

  For those of you that are checking this out from the "LitRPG" community, this is not a pure LitRPG - it's more of a mix between a traditional fantasy novel and a LitRPG.

Arcane Ascension isn't pretending to be something that it's not, so I don't see why Ramon would have a problem with it.

I think Arcane Ascension comes up a lot in LitRPG circles because it's good at scratching that particular itch for a "progression" system where a character is gradually becoming stronger and mastering more skills in a fantasy setting (usually manifested as leveling in LitRPG stories), and I've seen Mother of Learning come up in the same context for some of the same reasons, but that doesn't necessarily make it LitRPG, when someone asks for LitRPG recommendations it's the kind of story that might fit their intention without necessarily fitting the strict definition of LitRPG. In the same way, if someone came to a community like [[/r/rational]] asking for "movie recommendations for hard-SF about astronauts that has an optimistic feel to it, something that scratches the same itch as the Martian," I might say, "Oh, you would probably enjoy Apollo 13," even though Apollo 13 isn't actually sci-fi, because even though the person asking for recs might say "hard SF" their post makes it sound like what they're really looking for is stories about astronauts and engineers solving problems in space, which Apollo 13 does deliver on.

it also depends what you're comparing them to. comparing hpmor to any other piece of harry potter fanfiction? it comes out way ahead. comparing it to published, polished fantasy literature? half of it needs a rewrite, although that doesn't take away from the readability. and note that hpmor is the gold standard.

The demographics of people who enjoyed HPMOR don't necessarily line up with the HP fanfic community at large.

And of course, popularity doesn't equal quality- robst writes some of the most popular Harry Potter fanfics, but they're all literally the same fic repackaged.

It's just another subset/bubble, but look at HPMOR recommendations on the main Harry Potter fanfiction subreddit: [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=410390511][it's up there in terms of recommendations, at 41st place, but definitely not even close to the most recommended fic.]]

For some good fics that I enjoyed more than HPMOR: Seventh Horcrux, To Shape and Change, The Sum of their Parts, Stages of Hope, Magicks of the Arcane, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, Forging the Sword, On the Way to Greatness, What you Leave Behind, Like a Red Headed Stepchild, The Changeling, The One He Feared. Victoria Potter and Taure's canon magic document/analysis are great to dive into as well.

Short fics/oneshots aren't in the same category and aren't really comparable, but there are also a ton of one-shots that can very much hone in on and develop a single idea: Cauterize, one about Harry using the Resurrection Stone and falling prey to it. The landscape is so vast, especially if you're looking for a specific subset. People who like HPMoR generally like the well-written super/munchkin-type fics, which exist in abundance, i.e. Harry Gets Motivated, The Greatest Minister of Magic. Or fics that focus more on Voldemort, like There is Nothing to Fear, which the author posted about here on [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I also greatly enjoy fanfiction more for the interesting ideas it brings up, so I have a soft spot for fics like 0800-Rent-a-Hero or Percy Take the Wheel, which both look at characters in a new way and introduce/vastly expand on magic while still making it "feel" like it fits in the world.

The aforementioned Nightmares of Future Past is basically apocryphal (IMO hasn't aged all that well), Isolation is a more recent popular fic. HPMoR is still great, and is actually complete in addition to being edited, but it's also good to read other stuff in the genre rather than just saying it's better than literally any Harry Potter fanfiction. I think there will certainly be people who will read all this other stuff and still consider HPMoR the best, especially on this sub, but that's far from the general consensus.

******** i thought about this all day at work (slow day) and decided it basically comes down to different definitions of what readers want/expect in terms of harry potter fanfiction.

1. just stories set in the harry potter universe; in this case hpmor is somewhere in the top .01 percent but not at the top. i would put life and times first, if pressed. a long journey home second. stages of hope perhaps third. i actually think the vast majority of this category is taken up by pre-canon stories by people like cgner and whoever wrote the shoebox project, who have an actual writing style.

2. or is the goal to extract real actual "literature" (in the vaguest sense)? because if so, hpmor is just about the only thing that even qualifies. i am not comparing hpmor to tolstoy; that is not what i mean by literature. it's probably the wrong word. i am commenting on the fact that of all the people i know who don't care about harry potter and don't live on the internet and are "serious readers," etc -- /some of them sat down and read all of methods when i mentioned it to them/. if i sent them stages of hope afterward they would be completely nonplussed, despite the fact that it is also grammatical, has a tighter plot, and doesn't have any obvious shortcomings like methods does. stages of hope is certainly a more enjoyable story.

the plain fact is that hpmor is in a different category. it's a category that i value more (and [[/r/rational][r/rational]] values more, and people who aren't mostly teenagers on the internet tend to value more), so it's... better. for a given definition: the second one. if i had to try to quantify why it's better, which is always a disastrous endeavor for opinions, i would say it's got more going on under the hood than fanfiction is supposed to. there are thematic elements, big ideas and fascinating plot points that just aren't present in "normal" fanfiction, even the best. this is what makes it worth spending time to read in sort of the same way tolstoy is worth spending time to read, although that's a comparison that will no doubt get me in trouble.

my original point was about the contents of [[/r/rational/top][r/rational/top]] though. most of that is crap because people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] will accept subpar writing quality if the characters think like they think, often /ad absurdum/. this is different from the upper range of harry potter fanfiction, which is definitely superbly written, just suffers from a category error.

******* HPMOR is amazing at it's best, kinda decent on average and terrible at its worst. The whole thing is in dire need of polishing, but it still manages to be a masterpiece despite that. Also, HPMOR is not the gold standard of quality rational fic. It was the first rational fic and it began the genre, but if you're looking for a gold standard it might make more sense to read Luminosity or Pokemon: the Origin of Species. I will note that Luminosity is better written than Twilight, and yet Twilight is on book shelves while luminosity is not.

As for barriers to entry, being at all interested in rational fiction is a huge barrier to entry. Most people don't know the genre exists, and even when they do it's a really hard genre to write in, and many people probably are hesitant to share their work because their attempts at rational fic don't hold up when analyzed by people on this sub.

********* Good point. Tbh I'm not entirely sure myself whether rational fic counts as a genre or whether it's just a style like "literary fic" or "genre fic". I think it kind of blurs the line between them a bit to be honest. Of course that could also be because a lot of rational fic is written in the same or similar clusters of genres, and if we got more people outside of this community writing rational fic they would write rational mystery, rational romance, rational family comedy etc. rather than the rational scifi and fantasy we usually see. Perhaps rational fiction. Perhaps the whole reason we have trouble telling whether rational fiction is a genre or merely an overarching style is because there simply isn't enough rational fiction and not enough rational fiction authors for the full shape of the cluster structure of potential works in rational fiction space to emerge.

That being said, I think that the case could be made for the genre of contemporary drama merely being science fiction that takes place in the present which lacks self awareness of ongoing technological and cultural change, and which focuses primarily on "normal" people doing "normal" things, or what their societies consider to be normal, anyway.

And the case could be made that the mystery genre isn't really a genre either, it's just all the stories that are about solving crimes, which is a very specific subject matter and arguably one not broad enough to be an entire genre of literature on its own, but rather a subgenre of "drama" with a focus on law enforcement and criminals rather than on "normal" people living "normal" lives.

I could probably go down the whole list of genres like this, but I won't. Genres are just a way to organize fiction into categories, and those categories will naturally tend to be constructed based on cluster structures in the interests of readers. If you try to rigorously define such categories, they break down.

Not really. I mean the case /could/ be made. Like, technically. The way the Bible is sci-fi about a weird simulation on Yahweh's computer. Or a dictionary is fantasy, but only including supposedly real stuff and written in a really really dry and boring way.

** I mean a lot of what characters in fiction do is pretty stupid.Most readers don't care that much about that kind of thing and will suspend heir disbelief and pretend it makes sense.And writing the kind of intelligent characters we care about is more difficult , and most people don't really care.The same thing for writing settings that make sense .

So of course most fiction is not optimized for that kind of thing.

We should expect most fiction to have characters acting dumb in ways and stories that don't make sense.Complaining about how specific pieces of fiction don't cater to your specific taste doesn't have to mean you are looking down on people that like that kind of fiction.But it does usually come off as that.

Like [[https://www.reddit.com/user/ArgentStonecutter][ArgentStonecutter]] said there are people that care about about physics accuracy in SF .

Different communities have different tastes in fiction .People like to find people whith similar tastes ,complain about the aspects of fiction that they don't like , and write things that are more optimized for their specific tastes.Snobbishness seems to be about thinking your tastes your tastes are "better" in some people than everybody else's

.Intelligence has much higher status than orbital mechanics , so complaining about it probably comes up as more snobbish.And some people probably do look down on other communities of fiction but ,as you said , most people here are nice.

I suspect rational fiction by virtue of trying to make stuff whith smarter characters is always going to look snobbish , regardless of the actual snobbishness(Not sure if that's even a word) of the people writing it.

The same whith any attempt to make stories better for an specific audience that looks like it's about some kind of general quality of the story.

The zombie thing its making fun of how crazy people usually act in zombie stories.Its not really about making fun about people that like that kind of zombie story.

The writers of zombie stories are usually trying to make thematic points about humanity and things like that.

They aren't trying to write what a sensible approach to the situation would look like.

The same way the writers of a lot of "hard" scifi aren't really trying to make it that accurate.

So its not necessarily looking down to them either.

** A bit is probably an understatement.

But it's not so bad in small bursts, and the stories themselves can be really good. I have a lot of gripes about HPMOR, but I followed along with it as it was being released (from ~2012 onwards). I enjoyed Luminosity, and I thought The Waves Arisen had its share of highs and lows. I've been a fan of Mother of Learning for well over half a decade, now, but more from being a fan of nobody's Naruto fanfic.

But if I didn't come back here for the recent discussion threads, I wouldn't have gotten into Worth the Candle or Alexander Wales' other works like Metropolitan Man, or A Practical Guide to Evil, which are three works I've enjoyed immensely.

There's also something to be said about exposing yourself to different styles of tropes/writing over time. I love to read. I've had two or three phases where I basically tried to down everything in [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]], which itself is a subset of sci-fi fics- there was an EY story linked from there called Three Worlds Collides, which effectively led me back to this sub just a few weeks ago. I've had a few focused phases with fanfiction from several different fandoms, a few phases focused on more traditional fantasy or mystery books, a few phases where all I read was manga and Japanese light novels, and a few phases that branched out to light/web novels from Korea and China. So even the stuff that's solidly middle-of-the-road here can be fun to read because it feels fresh/creative.

The kind of thing you're describing, like cutting Ron and Hagrid from HPMoR, is definitely one of the things that turned me off HPMOR on a second reading. The snobbiness and whatnot bothered me a lot less when I was a young teenager, less emotionally intelligent and less critical of its faults. I already wasn't a fan of many of the author tracts, though, and while I didn't agree with much of su3su2u1's rant on HPMoR, it brought up a large number of valid points/problems I had with the story.

** I've noticed that some of the community as a whole seems to treat rationalism as a sort of religion, and things that don't adhere to it are often treated as 'lesser' rather than different. There's a certain atmosphere of superiority, though it's rarely direct or obvious in individual posts. Obviously rationalism has been a big part in many of your lives, but some treat it as gospel, to the point of alienating others.

Some of the community seems to be made up of people entirely unable to enjoy non-rational media, and that bleeds into a lot of the content the community consumes. Furthermore, some enjoy content exclusively BECAUSE it's rational, with no regard to quality, pacing, or anything else that traditionally good fiction is built on. There's nothing /wrong/ with that, but some of the praise/criticism I see for certain (off-site) fictions is almost jarring. It's important to remember that being rational does not mean objectively good, which some of the community seem to forget at times.

I'd very much be interested in an official stickied survey on the demographics present on the sub, because this community feels like a few /very/ specific types of people. Hell, I'd even like to see a Myers Briggs Test (Not as a scientifically valid test, but just to compare to the general population).

Anyways, every community inherently has a sense of pride in itself. People in the community "get it" and people outside the community don't. This applies to everything from gun owners to shippers to us. The only difference is that since our community is literally dedicated to the idea that fiction should be written smartly, about smart characters, the usual pretense that we don't /really/ think we're better than everyone else is that much harder to maintain. After all, the fact that this subreddit exists implies that the fiction we like is the exception, not the rule. And it is.

Yes, and HPMoR is a bit more nuanced than "everyone else is an idiot". That doesn't mean HPMoR isn't snobbish, or that Ron's treatment isn't part of a larger problem.

**** Finding Ron useless is a time honoured tradition among all the fanfiction communities I've ever had any familiarity with. His up there with Jar-Jar Binks to be honest.

I've seen this complaint about how ratfic is for dweebs who are too full of themselves a lot but nearly everywhere in the internet is full of people who love to hear themselves talk so I don't really understand it. Snobbery happens less here than anywhere else that talks seriously about fanfiction. Mostly I think because there aren't as many actual fans.

In particular I remember how someone complained about the elevator scene in worth the candle where the author explains how elevators work and how the cable is connected to the top. The argument was that since nobody could find this interesting in and of itself the only possible reason to include it was to show off. Thus confirming that ratfic is written by pseudo-intellectuals. This guy seemed entirely serious and nobody disagreed.

Only reason I've ever found ratfic could be controversial is that a lot of it is built on the scary idea that if you never wondered what goes on in a college ethics class you're probably not a good person which I suppose could make people feel threatened the same way vegans do.
