** A rewrite by Alicorn of one of Eliezer Yudkowsk's stories, where the universe as we know it is a simulation and humanity is the AI in the box.

***** Ahhhh. Thank you. The ending of Alicorn's story makes much more sense now.

****** ah yeah, I didn't catch that the guy with the chemicals was making nanomachines. I was like... I know this is part of humanity's plan to break out, but I don't get why they wanted to destroy this guy's house lol

******* Yeah, if I hadn't been familiar with Yudkowsky's original post, I would have found the ending confusing too. I wonder whether Alicorn might be willing to rewrite the ending just a tiny bit, for clarity. (I can't quite recommend the rewrite to people wholeheartedly, because I suspect they'll be confused too.)

That said, I did enjoy the rewrite a lot. :)

** I really liked how the "AI = melted computers" problem apparently could be used as a potential powerplant. No clue why I found that so funny, but I did.

Anyway, great rewrite. Some parts are a little confusing without the context of the original, but it's kinda a weird story anyway so no big deal.
