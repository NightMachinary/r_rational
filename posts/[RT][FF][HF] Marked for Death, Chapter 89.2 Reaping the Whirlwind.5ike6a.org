** One of the funniest updates so far. I was surprised by how long it was and how much happened. Straight up fights between canon and OC characters is the holy grail of naruto questing.

Also, Hazou needs to organize his feelings as well as his ideas. Although, being 13yo really hinders meaningful relationships in the quest.

***** True, and we have done so on a couple of occasions. Still, I was hoping it would make it into the official vote...which it did! (I think?)

#+begin_quote
  If we did not do it the night before, speak to Inoue in private about flirting-focused social difficulties / emotional processing.

  Because Hazou is confused about both Ino and Akane (be open about this). Asking in private so she does not have to manage other dynamics simultaneously.
