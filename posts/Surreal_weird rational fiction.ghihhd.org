Exactly what it says on the tin, but I'm not /just/ interested in recommendations - I'm interested as to whether it is possible to have a work of fiction that is rational while being surreal and/or weird or trippy.

When it comes to being weird or trippy, I'm thinking about the old Jack Kirby Thor comics, with Ego the Living Planet, and the stories with the Silver Surfer, or Doctor Strange, or the Fantastic Four. I'm thinking about Philip K. Dick's weird books like The Man In The High Castle.

Having read a little about Grant Morrison's run on Doom Patrol, I suppose if it's possible to write a rational work with heroes and villains with bizarre and strange powers. The characters may not be rationalist - they might be the exact opposite - but the worldbuilding itself could be rather rational. And I wonder if it is possible to treat weird premises - living planets, acid trip dimensions and whatnot - rationally.

What do you think?


** Check out Chili and the Chocolate Factory and Unsong. (I am under the impression that Cordyceps is also quite surreal, but I haven't managed to read it yet.)

Not all are explicitly rational in their construction, but often they have authors who are clearly breaking that rationality with intent. They often have rational characters, but weird worlds, but there are definitely multiple flavours. Sometimes they're referred to as being anti-rational, but I definitely find they scratch similar sorts of itches.

I'll note that Unsong does literally have a DMT dimension in there, and the Cactus Man makes an appearance (though we don't get any mechanical elves!).

Cordyceps isn't so much surreal as it is terrifying.

It's certainly exploring some unusual themes, but it does so more in a psychological horror kind of way than the other two stories you mentioned.

Edit: I don't mean that as a strike against Cordyceps, btw. It's a great story and I do recommend reading it if you can find the time (it's not that long).

**** In all honestly, I think it's mostly called rational adjacent because the author is involved in the rationality sphere/movement/community/cult/whateverthehellthisthingis.

More charitable, it takes a completely absurd premise for world building and does a phenomenal job taking that premise seriously and exploring the consequences of people acting in such a world (which is a big part of why it is so great).

That said, there are still too many aspects of the worldbuilding and plot that work out much too conveniently* for me to fully call it rational fiction, so I think the term rational adjacent is a fair description.

That's exactly what I was thinking on reading the title. How would you go reconciling the two? I suppose it's possible if the surreality is explained (there are certainly surreal things in real life, and LSD is still a thing, so why not?), but it would take some serious writing chops to keep the tone consistent throughout a story despite it having surrealism.

You might find something similar in first-contact stories with aliens being... alien.

I suppose I'll be back to see if there are decent answers to the question.

I would say it's possible if the surreality is being /explored/: the surreal world has some consistent underlying laws, vastly different from ours, the characters learn about them and utilize them to their benefit. As an example of a world with different laws, Jacek Dukaj's /Other Songs/ comes to mind. It didn't leave an impression of being /rational/ for me, but its world is interesting and thought out.

It's also of a reasonable, if long, length, and the characters seem a lot less obnoxious than some of the ones in homestuck, one of the reasons I could never really get into it. I suppose I might read it one day, but I heard the ending wasn't that good; I don't know.

** Stories in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism][absursist]] genre often portray surreal situations for the sake of exploring rational themes.

One good example of that is the Mars scene with Dr. Manhattan and Laurie in the graphic novel /Watchmen/. On the surface level, that scene looks like two people getting into an argument in a desolate, red wasteland that ends with one of them smashing a glass castle. Pretty weird, no?

But it's more than that:

The entire chapter explores the idea of what exactly makes humans so special. If we discard the selfish, anthropocentric arguments, then what's left to render sentient life inherently better than inanimate nature? One answer offered in that scene is that human beings are uniquely beautiful because of their faculty to create and perceive abstract meaning in a universe which inherently lacks it.

And thus it's fitting that the final panel of that chapter is an allusion to the so-called '[[https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990315.html][Happy Face on Mars]]' that first came about when human beings saw a pattern in the shape of light and shadow on a distant planet.

**** I mainly mentioned it as an example of the themes that absurdist fiction explores, though I'd argue that the pacing of events in that scene interspersed with the backwards-flashbacks renders a fairly surreal impression in the graphic novel.

Even without the broader context of the setting, the situation is presented as absurd:

A godlike entity goes to Mars to mope about how disconnected he feels from humanity. He teleports his ex there to have an 'I'm breaking up with you' talk, but almost kills her before remembering that she needs oxygen to breathe. His version of 'the talk' involves claiming that he now values inanimate rock formations more than human beings. Meanwhile, his ex (who cheated on him for the first time just a few scenes earlier) tries to make an argument in favor of humanity while having a mental breakdown over the realization of her true father's identity. The multiple chains of thought running through that chapter overlap, conflict wildly, and eventually derail. Against all probability, Laurie manages to persuade John to have faith in humanity despite, in the process, nearly losing all faith in her own judgement of human nature.

To me, /The Man in the High Castle/ falls into a similar category of surrealism because it explores how the human desire for meaning clashes with reality.

One of the main protagonists fetishises the culture of the conquering nation, and yet he makes his living by selling so-called "authentic" pieces of his own cultural history to those conquerors. Many of those pieces turn out to be fake, and yet he scorns the real handcrafted art made by his contemporaries until one of the conquerors deigns to see more meaning in it than he did. The entire plot from start to finish plays with the idea of what is real, and whether or not the distinction matters.

A better place is a webcomic. It's best if even the premise comes as a surprise so look at it, might not call it rational but it looks at some interesting concepts. I would definitely recommend.

Onwards to Providence. Brilliant worldbuilding. Could be described as an eldritch roadtrip but that doesn't really do it justice. A nice xenofiction. Even the "Terran" viewpoint characters are more alien than they seem. I especially like the worldbuilding that goes into the logical consequences of a world where souls exist, how they'd evolve that way, how it'd effect culture, how it'd effect development and so on.

For unclear reasons one of the many mad gods placed a bright pink bunny girl with an empty skull contoured for his brain. As it progresses the main character, the world and presumably the author go increasingly far off the deep end.

It never goes far enough to actually be removed from Sufficient Velocity but it got surprisingly far before a mod locked the thread and banned the author for a bit. read the mod post at the end first before deciding to dive into the trainwreck:

Is very weird yet or perhaps because it has a lot of thought put into it. Lots of high concept stuff, time travel, applied infinities, stuff like that. It's broadly a HP fanfiction but the setting has had practically a complete overhaul. I strongly recommend, very strongly considering the request. A couple highlights that are relatively easy to explain are the infinite library where people go on expeditions to attractor points in whatever fractal layout it's been sorted into currently and take out books to decode new spells from, it's quite possibly deriving these spells in a more traditional way would be a supertask. Or Griffindor's Lion(I think that's it's name?), A large abstract sculpture that doesn't change in any way yet the patterns it forms are constantly shifting, the viewer can see a lion moving and roaring in a still object. Or the "train" or the MC being gifted his own perfectly accurate biography but due to the nature of information loops his brain is unable to process the words describing future events until they have happened.
