** been waiting for this, I'm glad to finally see the new chapter, let's see what's going on...

Well, that's quite something.

I did notice that the story was getting more well written as chapters went on, characters other than the MC basically had no voice, I'm glad that got better as time went on and the later chapters were more enjoyable.

Although I'm not entirely satisfied with this ending, it feels sort of lacking, not crazy enough. That's why I voted for saving alter ego, I wanted to experience full-on crazy stuff happening but sadly people voted more for enoshima and her "demise" was quite boring, compared to what I expected alter would have brought.

I hope there will be a sequel in the future, with Enoshima alive a lot of DR2 would be really different.

*** Yeah, I did my best to incorporate other characters more as time went on, hopefully by the end at least that was fixed.

I went with a slightly slower ending since I wanted the piece to kinda feel complete and resolved, even though there's a lot more plot left to happen in the world. There will be a sequel(possibly two, I'm not sure whether I want to combine DR:AE and DR2 into one story yet).

*** Finished DR2 and read the fic and came back to this thread to find this reaction to be the same as mine. I expected twists and action from a Danganronpa story, even a fanfic. I guess this might have been more engaging if I had been there for the votes? It doesn't work as an archived story though.

** Yo, I've always wanted to read this but I still don't know, is it about DR1's storyline only? I haven't finished DR2 yet and I don't want to get spoiled.

*** It includes details from DR2, including one major spoiler. Hmm...if you recognize the name Kamukura, you'll be fine, otherwise don't read it yet because spoilers.
