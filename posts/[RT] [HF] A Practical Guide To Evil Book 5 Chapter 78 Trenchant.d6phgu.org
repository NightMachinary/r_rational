** It seems like a big mistake to say that that the Dead King has no idea. That's tempting the narrative if ever I heard it.

*** Yep. I'd like to think that was somehow intentional, but I can't see what benefit she'd get from Nessy (or Bard) knowing this information.

Maybe she could get him to bow out without too much fuss; he is very conservative with his power.

** A nice chapter about honesty between enemies, little backstabbings and great schemes and a dozen questions to be asked, the first of which being WHY DID YOU SAY HE DOESN'T KNOW? STUPID CAT!

** Jesus, Cat is basically playing as Hungary, yet managing to secure an alliance with both the Russians and the French to fuck over Britain, while the Ottomans just sitting there regretting allying the British.

The HRE is still in the middle of it's Religious War though.

** Looks like the Principate might survive, albeit financially crippled for the next several decades.

I really hope the Dead King doesn't have eyes in the palace. Though he very well might, considering the quality of Proceran wards.

Edit: The Bard could leak it. I don't know why she would, but then we still don't know her motivations.

** Is it just me or is there no way Callow should be able to wage war against the Dead King?

Like, the drow, definitely, they have their back against the wall here. And Catherine could probably act as a general, coordinate the drow with the other alliance forces. She could maybe even spare a few shock troops.

But the bulk of her troops, and most of the Woe? They need to get back to Callow /soon/. The last time Catherine & co stayed on campaign for an extended period, Malicia had half their government assassinated. Their granaries are already running on fumes, and they're about to support the entire Proceran war effort. Any sabotage attempt by the Empire will leave Callow starving.

So with that in mind, I really don't see how Cat could afford to be fighting on two fronts.

*** Praes can kinda be safely put on the backburner for now, for a few reaons.

The Legions-in-Exile are stationed by the Blessed isle to prevent an invasion, and all of Malicia's spies are about to be outed thanks to Scribe (who kinda let the earlier round of assassinations happen, through inaction). So Malicia can't strike out by invasion or assassination.

Praes is also very much not in a fight shape. They lost the warlock, two of their largest cities, the goblins are rebelling, and the Highlords are no longer as afraid of Malicia without Black and most of his legions to keep them in line. She can't get arms/munitions from the goblins or count on the dwarves since they have an agreement with Cat not to do business with any nation at war with Callow.

Malicia still has a couple WMDs lying around in the Tower, but if she starts using those against Callow she's kinda screwed because it'll put her as the greater of two evils in Cat's story. Not to mention they're running out of food (in her last POV chapter she mentions having to open the imperial granaries to feed people, or there'll be a revolt) and destroying Callow means they can't take over their food production.

** Man it still would be soooo easy for Cat to place Princess Rozala at the head of Procer. I mean yeah it would go against most of her morals and probably lead to her downfall but Gods would it be nice for the leader of Procer to be completely and utterly focused on stopping the Dead King. It's probably not going to happen, but man can you imagine?

*** The problem is, Cordelia is practically revered by her government at the moment, Rozalas potential supporters are all gone, and Royals herself seems to be of the opinion that Cordelia has got it handled. If Rozala doesn't become the main general of the Procter forces in the north, that would be dumb, but she does not have the support to do anything apart from military matters so being in charge of the nation would just limit her ability to act.
