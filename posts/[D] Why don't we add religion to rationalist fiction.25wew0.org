For any rational character, or rationally-minded society, it would provide a greater amount of conflict within the story. It could also open-up a broader audience as a way of appealing to people unfamiliar with our valued ideals. Attempting to ignore the impact of religion seems to dismiss the general public as a whole and - to a certain degree - foreign cultures.

Moreover, many of the enjoyable parts of Yudokowsky's author tract fanfic "Methods of Rationality" has Rationalist Harry talking to Dumbledore about the flawed ideas of souls and an afterlife.

Side note: it would probably be better to not attempt to strawman religious believers in their emotional capacity so that they don't feel it's scornful to their beliefs. I'm actually trying to do that with the novel that I've been writing after observing several Atheist Vs. Religious debates. It's actually quite fun making-up your own religion for a fictional setting. I can see why GRRM and JRRT did so in their stories.


** Fictional Deconstructions of religions are stories in which religions are true, or the evidence claimed by religions actually exists and then the most obvious God corresponding to these is inferred. These can be helpful for breaking loose religious people from the trance of carefully not considering implications.

E.g., writing a story about a hard-labouring Egyptian mother with no political power, wailing over the crib of her firstborn son.

Some of the most effective atheistic material, I suspect, is by Terry Pratchett for similar reasons.

I've advocated that serious rationalists need to stop paying attention to atheism after a certain point, because after a certain point atheism becomes bad practice for handling difficult questions; atheism is not difficult and trains you to think that rationality is always easy and that bad ideas are always obvious.

** The problem I have with invented religions in fiction is that the author is completely free to make the religion true with hardly any repercussions for the story. Terry Pratchett plays around with this by having the gods be very definitely real and very definitely interfering with the mortals. It's hard to be an atheist in those worlds, because there is actual evidence for the gods.

On a more more meta level, it's not very useful to have gods in rationalist!fiction because it's often about celebrating the capabilities of /mere/ mortals (and sometimes about more or less building a god). Including existing gods (especially of the omnipotent type) makes the actions of the protagonists mean less if the author isn't careful.

** Because it's boring. Religion and faith have already been gone over so many times, that they're often used as /the/ epitome of irrationality. It's just so easy to dismantle religion (dude, do you even solomonoff?); any argument with religion would be mostly one-sided (unless of course you're writing a story where gods /do/ exist). So writers focus on lesser known examples of irrationality instead.

If, on the other hand, you are talking about world building, the people who write rational fiction tend to interact with 'rational' people. This group /tends/ to take not believing in a god as a given, and sometimes have to do a double take when they remember that people actually /do/ believe these things. If they don't mention religion in their stories, or it is only part of the background, that is because that is the way it is for /them/ in real life.

If you want an example of a rationalist story about religion i'd point you to [[http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/hell.html][Hell is the Absence of God]].

That's not nearly as easy as you make it sound. =K(x)= is incomputable, any approximation can be biased, and the /human mind's/ approximation of "simplicity" is /very definitely/ biased towards human-shaped thingies (see: Discworld series, all of). Before any argument about Solomonoff Priors on God is going to work, you first have to solidly convince someone to revise their concept of universal simplicity to relate to normal, established Turing machines... and then you have to deal with the cognitive dissonance you're about to create by looking for which bits of a person's brain their religion roots in and figuring out what else can root in those pieces (because people don't allow themselves to walk around with incomplete personalities, I should know).

Because most people tend to feel that these were the most wall-bangery parts of HPMoR, not because of "religion versus rationality", but because Canon!Potterverse simply and definitely /does/ have an afterlife. Strawmanning to make Potterverse more like (what we currently believe to be, with very strong Bayesian and error-minimization evidence) real life is simply not very artful.

Well yes.

Here's a reversal for you: transhumanism and extropianism are religion-replacements for secularized, STEM-educated people. I mean, come on, you're literally talking about movements that are based in changing the world to a radically ethically superior state, abolishing death, and creating Paradise. Anyone who claims that religious yearnings play no part in this is a liar.

EDIT: And that's not intended to be an insult to these two ideas. Seriously. I'm the guy who watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U][Tim Minchin's /Storm/]], got to the part where he says, "Isn't this all /enough?/" and basically yelled "NO YOU DUMB BASTARD!

Why are these natural laws not enough for you? Why do you require ignorance of something in order to truly think it is beautiful?" I dont think he was saying that the world is perfect and noone should try to improve it anymore because thats "enough".

******* What do you think I meant? I haven't actually seen whole scale rational ways of thinking; not even by the standards explained by CFAR. The community seems prone to the same cognitive biases, acts in the same vicious manner as any other web forum with generalizations and logical fallacies galore, and the only notable difference is this idealistic and naive notion that death can be overcome through transhumanism.

Transhumanism isn't real. Allow me to elaborate on why this concept has so many clear problems:

- Where will you get the resources to sustain a population over 11 billion? Much as people wish to believe everything in the world is better; there are still millions dying from infant mortality and conditions of poverty to this day. Even if their productivity increased, the natural result would be a quicker thinning of natural resources. The growth isn't sustainable.

- Pharmaceutical companies still test their drugs on children in third-world countries. This still happens nowadays. This includes the U.S. and it's the main reason why they don't see such a problem with selling drugs without FDA approved restrictions off televised advertisements. Will the wonder medication that saves the human race require the deaths of millions of infants in third-world countries? They are still taken advantage of by Western Corporations - including the U.S. so will we require more deaths to get it right? Also, go ahead and downvote for this as I expect you to; it's just another acknowledgement that you don't understand how to make transhumanism practical nor understand what technological civilizations have done to weaker civilizations for their natural resources.

- Why is it not more practical to use warfare to continue to brutalize Eastern societies so that population growth is more sustainable to stop the thinning of resources? That would conserve resources in all practical sense for the technologically elite cultures and food supply shortage would no longer be problematic in plunging the world to self-destruction. As such, transhumanism is only for the minority population of the Earth.

- How do you convince the top 1% to change their exploitative practices and give fair wages to people in Western societies - let alone people in Eastern societies? To do so would mean an increase in prices for goods sold. If everyone in the world tries to live the Middle Class life then will that even be sustainable once resources get stretched so thin?

** Why the downvotes? This is a perfectly legitimate question...

On topic, religion tends to function to fill in the gaps of society, be it by explaining events in the weather, codifying moral norms, creating support structures for the unfortunate, etc.

Like anything else it can go completely overboard and cancerous and radical, and there are as many interpretations as there are members. [[http://xkcd.com/927/][Go figure]].

Speaking as a (gasp!) Christian, and one who has been on several mission trips and witnessed a few miracles and first-hand accounts of plenty more, I'm perfectly fine with including religious topics in rationalist fiction.

People who call themselves believers will give you weird looks if you actually predict and expect that God will carry out some particular act in the testable near future, and they /will/, in fact, tease you when He fails to do so (this is why people laugh at cults).

Despite this, they will never stop claiming to believe in God, because most people don't separate alief and expectation.

****** Are you asking because you're curious, or because you want to try to disprove them? If it's the second, I'm not going to bother. I don't have any hard evidence for these. You can't just say "Wait, don't do the faith-healing yet, I need to get my camera!" When they happen they happen in fractions of a second. It's infeasible to use logic and empirical data to explain miracles. You have to go by faith. /That's the whole point/.

That said, it's not the miracles themeselves which have me so convinced, but the overwhelming number of 'coincidences' in hundreds of personal testimonies. Anyway, your question:

- The most blatant miracle was a faith healing of a woman with one leg shorter than the other by a pastor at a church I was visiting. The pastor sat her down in a chair, took her feet in his hands and called out "Anybody want to see a miracle?" as her ankles reshaped themselves. There must have been an inch and a half of difference before he healed her, and then it was /gone/.

- I went on a mission trip to Honduras. The lead missionaries were a young couple who had been operating in the area for a week already (it was their first time leading a group. They had this story from the previous week: while out building a house in a field covered in a foot of manure, a woman slashed her bicep open on a sheet of aluminum roofing. Blood everywhere, and the wound was /yellow/ with exposed body fat. They took her into the truck and drove her back to a doctor, who was kinda old, had poor eyesight and only gave about half as many stitches as the wound needed. Even so, the woman's injury healed perfectly, no infections, and /no pain whatsoever/. Even when her arm was first cut open, she felt no pain. She could feel it, but she couldn't feel the pain. She didn't start feeling pain until the wound started healing, and even then it was only itches.

- My pastor was a /burglar/ before he had an honest-to-goodness, God-tapped-him-on-the-shoulder-and-turned-his-life-around moment /while breaking in/.

- One of my teachers was making a turn onto the interstate and spun out, directly facing incoming traffic (the road was wet). Around a dozen cars going at 60mph passed /through/ him and his vehicle harmlessly.

- My mom received the Holy Spiritn and developed a prayer language. It's Spanish. Fluent Spanish. My mom doesn't speak a word of Spanish, but good heavens, can she pray in it. There's quite a lot of that in my church.

- I personally have some experience with the gift of prophecy. I have a vivid imagination, but when I pray I can receive mental images that I can't alter. Now, figuring who the prophecy is addressed to can be an entirely different task, but some of the older guys at my church can reach Contessa levels of shaking people to their cores with a couple of inspired metaphors.

I can go on, but I think you get the idea. More importantly, I'd advise to not go by internet philosophy or hearsay on this matter. Talk to /people/. Go to a church (it doesn't matter what church; any church that's the least bit unwelcoming to atheists isn't a church at all) and start asking questions. Don't be afraid to challenge. Don't be scared of being magically converted. Have some faith in your skills as a rationalist -- but don't get into trivial arguments, there are as many interpretations as their are people. Interrogate the pastor after the service if you want to. If it exists, I know I wouldn't want to bet my eternal soul on a half-assed investigation.

*********** 1.) About Jesus Christ:

- If you self-identify as a Christian and recognize Christ as your Lord, among other supernatural phenomena related to the story of Christ, then does that mean you believe in the End of Times? Do you find it acceptable to believe that there will be a massive slaughter of all Jewish people in the holy land so that Jesus comes back to bring only the Christians to the Kingdom of God? Is that truly a good moral system to live by? It would be a genocide that surpasses the scope and scale of the Holocaust.

- If the supposition that Jesus Christ's teachings are true as far as Christianity; if it is absolutely true that recognizing Jesus Christ as Lord is the only way to salvation in heaven then shouldn't that mean every Jewish person who died in the Holocaust went to hell? If they didn't go to hell, then isn't the belief Jesus Christ as "Lord and Savior" be effectively inconsequential for salvation?

side note: The only contention I've heard to this one is that Jewish peoples can ask for forgiveness but that's a terrible moral prospect. Moreover, 1/3rd of every Nazi who killed Jewish people were Catholic. The rest seemed to follow Protestantism. Atheism contributed only to the slaughters under Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot; predominately because of their view of seeing Western culture as exploitative due to imperialism. However, the Nazis weren't atheist by any measure of the word.

2.) Interpreting the Bible and faith

- If the Bible is openly interpretative then how is that different from specifying any religion as openly interpretative? Furthermore, how is contesting the "open interpretation" of the Bible valid when it's no different than a catch-22 logical fallacy?

- If personal testimonies is enough to believe in miracles and Christ, then why not believe in ALL religious miracle testimonies? Why not believe in Hinduism's Krishna, the miracles of Buddha, of Horus, or other supposed deities? Buddha and Krishna predate Jesus, have active believers, both claim to be born of a virgin, both claim to have been crucified, both went to hell for three days, and claim that they'll return to bring about an Armageddon to save only true believers.

- Why believe in personal testimonies written in the Bible when they use illiterate, ignorant, and uneducated peasant women as documented proof of Jesus coming back from the dead? They wouldn't have been allowed to stand trial in open court during the time because they never had any education to the degree of the males. Why believe in testimonies by people who didn't believe in the number 0 because it was viewed as "evil" and didn't even understand basic algebra which came into existence after their time? How can you accept any of their claims as reliable when they were so poorly educated and had high tendencies to exaggerate their claims?

- If there is no documented evidence of a historical Nazareth claimed to exist during Jesus's time, if there is no evidence of even his birth date, and in consideration of the historical fact that thousands of peasants believed in varied and conflicting versions of messiah stories during that time - why believe the bible as credible? There are stories about Jesus that were thrown out because it didn't fit the Catholic narrative. How can you see the Bible as reliable at all to base your life's purpose around?

************ I'll preface this by saying that this is what I personal;y believe. If you asked those questions to 10 different Christians you would get 7-9 varieties of answers, which may be a fun experiment in of itself. I'll answer them in the order you asked.

- I don't know which parts of Revelation are symbolic, poetic or prophetic. If I did I would be the most esteemed theologian of the age. There likely will be an End Of Times in some fashion, but I don't have a clue as to what that will be like. According to the Bible, God has certainly punished his people to great extent before, so it wouldn't be without precedent.

- Yeah, they probably did. I don't like it either. The thing about Christianity is that the rituals, the ceremony, the style, the person's actual righteousness, all of it means /jack shit/ to Christ. [[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A22-23&version=ESV][Seriously]]. The /only/ thing that matters is having a close, personal friendship/discipleship with him. No more, no less.

- I didn't mean to imply the Bible is openly interpretive. Parts of it are vague as events are glossed over and such, but it's usually very clear about what it is saying (people who argue otherwise are often taking the verses they cite out of context).

- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/25wew0/d_why_dont_we_add_religion_to_rationalist_fiction/chnpelj][I was actually wrong on that one]]. Oops.

- Those women were close personal friends of Christ and the twelve disciples they were reporting to, so they had no reason not to trust them (and when he shortly appeared to them in the flesh, that solved that matter). More importantly, the scriptures were written by humans, but God more or less "dictated" the content to the writers.

- Assuming the construction of the Bible was not under divine supervision, it's still good enough as a starting text into the faith. Look at it this way: you don't read a book on computer programming and call yourself a programmer. Even if it's the best possible book on programming in the world, even if the whole world agrees it is the best, you still have to /do programming/ to actually get anywhere.

Although, I'm a bit perturbed by the whole "revelations book." I never grew-up under Christianity so looking it up disturbed me. I'm not exactly sure what can be morally good about it or the prospect of Jewish people in hell.

If the Bible isn't openly interpretative then what about the parts of Adam and Eve or how God made the world?

************** Revelation is just *weird*, dude, and that's coming from someone on the inside (even if only for two years).

As far as Creation/Adam&Eve, there really are a lot of ways to take it, but my favorite theory (which is going to sound really silly, and I haven't done any actual theological research on it yet) was that God created the world in six days, but when he did so he made it look like it happened over billions of years. An analogy would be a video game developer using editor software to create a level, but inside the level he adds lore and environmental descriptors to teach the players about the game, etc.

Honestly I'll hesitate to believe in any creation theory which is supposing entropy existing before A&E, simply because it was their choice that mucked up God's perfect creation. Everyone always asks "If God made the world, then why is it so shitty?" and the answer is that God /did/ make the world perfect, and we're the ones who shat on it.

I have a forever-long backlog of fiction and non-fiction, and some other religious texts are on that too.

******* It's not like the miracles point you specifically to Christianity though - I hear the same sorts of miracles from friends and family members...except they are attributed to Hindu things. And it always seems specific to the beliefs of the teller...your mom got the "Holy Spirit" and learned Spanish, my family friend recalled a "past life" and suddenly somehow knew the geography and history of a place that they had never been. Lots of holy men preaching Hindu theology, healing people, making accurate prophecies, and more...

Many of the testimonies I hear directly contradict Christian theology (the past life one, for example)...would you disregard them on those grounds? Why do miracles seem to take on such a Hindu flavor when they happen within Hindu lands? If I trusted people's testimony the same way you do (and I have just as many testimonies as you do) then I'd certainly have to accept that something supernatural existed...but I would also have to eliminate Christianity from the hypothesis space, given the very un-Christian nature of some of the miracles I've gotten testimony about. (And they tell me all the same stuff about "faith" that you wrote)

So you're saying Step 1 = increasing the credence one gives to personal testimony. What is Step 2? Because if I /just/ go off personal testimony, then Christianity is wrong about a few important things... (past lives, idol worship, just to name a few...)

Some even have the idea that doing miracles is a "lower" thing that distracts from the higher purpose of enlightenment. People are the same everywhere and original ideas are rare.

But, when you really press people for evidence, they do tend to fall back on the miracles, as you did.

Sorry, being dramatic - I'm mostly just curious as to what occurred after our conversation, seeing as you are one of a very small set of people who might identify as both rationalist and religious.

It's educational to watch these sorts of updating processes happen in real time, especially in someone who is familiar with rationalist tropes.

Although, as someone who suffered from [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/e25/bayes_for_schizophrenics_reasoning_in_delusional/775y][Capgras Delusion and Reduplicative Paramnesia]] in childhood, I must say that a certain level of psychological meta awareness /does/ inoculate you to some extent.

More recently, after becoming aware of false memories as a phenomenon, U started identifying false memories as they happen - once my father and I thought we remembered accidentally leaving a suitcase on a public driveway and leaving...I remembered it, he remembered it, and we were about to drive all the way back. Then, I remembered the concept of false memory, so I mentally replayed the conversation we had in our heads. Upon replay, I realized that the conversation itself had planted the memory...the longer we spoke, the more convinced each of us became. So awareness of a phenomenon /does/ sometimes lead to escape from it...even though i hadn't meant to originally apply that in my post.

  The most blatant miracle was a faith healing of a woman with one leg shorter than the other by a pastor at a church I was visiting. The pastor sat her down in a chair, took her feet in his hands and called out "Anybody want to see a miracle?" as her ankles reshaped themselves. There must have been an inch and a half of difference before he healed her, and then it was gone.

Any pastor that says "Wanna see a miracle?" is a snake-oil salesman. Occam's Razor, my friend. Which is more likely, that a supernatural event occurred and the woman was healed, or that the woman had a rare condition (or, hell, a dislocated joint) and the pastor found a use for it to help solidify the faith (or his hold on, depending on how cynical you are.) his congregation?

Blood everywhere, and the wound was yellow with exposed body fat. They took her into the truck and drove her back to a doctor, who was kinda old, had poor eyesight and only gave about half as many stitches as the wound needed. Even so, the woman's injury healed perfectly, no infections, and no pain whatsoever. Even when her arm was first cut open, she felt no pain. She could feel it, but she couldn't feel the pain. She didn't start feeling pain until the wound started healing, and even then it was only itches.

This is rather silly. First off, how exactly does imagining something hard enough that you derive a concrete image that you then have trouble altering count as prophecy? And, why is it prophecy, rather then the simple act of making connections by thinking things through?

I have seen a bunch of theists and atheists debating a bunch of times, and I have never, ever seen a theist convince a atheist by reasoned argument over the 'net that their religion was correct and accurate and they should go get baptised or whatever. Similarly, I have never, ever seen an atheist convince a theist that their religion is wrong. The best you might achieve is to persuade people who are on the fence or are already doubting their beliefs - basically everyone I know who changed from whatever they were raised as, did so because of life experiences (e.g. especially traumatic experiences like deaths of close family members seem to make people doubt and choose again and either find or abandon god) and their own introspection/thinking within themselves.

I mean, even people who go door to door in multiyear missions who have carefully designed scripts and who keep lists of everyone who seems even slightly interested to try to persuade them again and who have the advantage of being in person and have cunning arguments apparantly have /reported/ success rates in multiple years of work of like [[http://www.cracked.com/article_21109_5-hardcore-realities-my-time-as-mormon-missionary_p2.html][5 conversions]], of which maybe 1 or 2 might be legitimate and successful enough that the person keeps going to church for a while after that and the others of which were more-or-less made up for status-among-other-missionaries reasons.

I'm not saying it's impossible to persuade someone to abandon their religious beliefs, or lack thereof, over a text interface which they can leave and cease paying attention to at any time, via cunning arguments. What I am saying, however, is that the feat seems to me to be similar to the AI Box Experiment escape in a lot of ways but like a *lot* harder and less likely to succeed - to the point where I have never even heard of it working, in spite of the numerous attempts I have observed.
