** That was quite possibly the weirdest piece of fiction I have ever read. And it was sort of perfect, in that. It managed to move me, atheist of atheist, materialist of materialist, to something of a religious exultation. Insofar as the context of fiction considered I can say:

"The LORD is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him"

**** In English, I was reading a book that referenced Kabbalah, and I started mumbling under my breath uncontrollably. After class I was asked what I was saying by the teacher, and went on a two minute rant about the kabbalistic connection between kings and fools until she gave me a rather pleading look to stop.

**** Rearranging Presley gets you PSER LEY. PSER is of course Latin /passer/ meaning sparrow. (Thanks Catullus!) LEY is the hard part, but the etymology of "lye" yields Old English leag. The Modern English "league" is phonetically similar. The archaic Japanese measurement sometimes called a "league", the ri, was 2.44 miles. 244 = 144 + 100. 100 = 10^{2.} 10 is the number of God's law, so 100 is God's Law multiplied by itself. 144 is a number that means a great multitude. Therefore the name "Presley," means a "sparrow who twists a great multitude of the Law back unto itself."

*** Yeah, this. It pretty strongly fails as a conclusion, in my opinion. It's /also/ not very strong as a chapter? Zips too fast past moments that ought to have some weight to them? Like, even if you want to show things happening very quickly, you can still linger on impact, emotion, inner monologue, etc.

Generally speaking, you want the climax to feel "worth" the words spent on it, and this was too little for me. I think it was nowhere near the high-quality-water-mark of the story overall.

The final proof of God's omnipotence is that he doesn't have to exist in order to save everyone. And in the end, it turned out that God wasn't really aware at all, 'he's' just the abstract principle that whatever is best, must exist. [[http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/uid=42/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067952_ss1-281][Also known as Axiarchism]]. [[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n02/derek-parfit/why-anything-why-this][It is actually a legitimate position in non-religious metaphysics]]. All the instances of 'God' speaking were Metatron, who is just a more good aspect of our particular universe.

If we call God a conscious being who created our universe by an act of will, in Unsong *there is no God*.

** Interesting effect of the morality in the story: You're morally fine with not doing anything good, since somewhere else someone would do that good for you in a different universe if you didn't. Universes only exist when they are morally good on the net; thus nothing you do can be a net bad, across the board, since you can never do something bad that has a net effect on the sum good in the universe.

Thus, striving towards whatever is best for you is morally ok, since none of your actions can produce a net moral good anyways.
