Suppose he has to keep it secret, so no selling of magical items or anything that would give away Narnia's existence.


** How about this:

Found a corporation inside Narnia selling books, technology, veterinary medicine, and so on. Use that revenue to buy up the land around the portal to Earth, and then start experimenting with monetizing the time dilation effect. Build a generator, run the wires through the portal, and and see if the time dilation results in electrical output thousands of times stronger on the Earth side. Build a server farm, and see if you get orders of magnitude faster calculations. Ideally, so long as you could fit more cables though the portal (and data cables in particular can be very thin), you'd be able to vastly outcompete anyone on Earth in those industries, and potentially make billions.

Of course, it might be tough to keep your Narnia-side corporation in business for the thousands of years necessary to make a major profit on Earth. And, if the Narnian economy developed to the point that the people there would be in the market for electricity or data, it might be more profitable to sell directly to them anyway.

That in mind, it might be a better idea to just get rich in Narnia by setting off an industrial revolution, then take a vacation on Earth for a while, come back when Narnia is more technologically advanced than Earth, and then use that new knowledge to get rich by setting off a new technological revolution on Earth.

Eventually, maybe Narnia goes post-scarcity, and then money wouldn't even matter.

*** The big problem with this is that if you're gone for hundreds of years, you might come back to a Narnia that's utterly fallen, or one that's annihilated itself with nuclear weapons, or some other such thing. This is what happens in the books - the children become kings and queens, start a Golden Age, leave, and when they come back the castle has been completely overgrown and their kingdom is in complete disarray.

You're also at a very high risk of giving away the secret.

**** Sure, but unless absolutely all intelligent life on Narnia were killed, which, though not impossible, seems somewhat unlikely to me, you'd have to wait, what- a few years at most for the radiation to disperse and civilization to rebuild, or for the dark age to end. Then, you could try again.

With regards to secrecy, once you had enough money, you could do a lot of things to hide the portal, the discovery of which would be the only thing that could expose such a strange and unguessable secret. You could divert a river to flood the area, bury it under an artificial hill, build a historically significant monument over it. Anything that could last a few thousand years unaltered would probably work to keep the secret no matter how many inexplicable things you did in either world.

** Trade. You have two completely segregated economies whose only point of contact is this rational person. Find something non-magical that you can bring into the real world from Narnia, find something in the real world that Narnia would value highly, and swap for profit. A fully-loaded MP3 player would cost you maybe $20, and in Narnia would probably fetch an enormous price from a local lord (though I forget how Narnia's society is really structured). Use the Narnian money to buy a fancy sword, which you can sell in the real world for /huge/ amounts of money - quality made swords are hellishly expensive, on the order of thousands of dollars. Tell people you forged it yourself. Or if the economics don't work for that, find something that they do work for. Is gold comparatively more common in Narnia? Is labor cheaper? At any rate, if you've got the only portal into Narnia, you can exploit the fact that you're the only way for them to engage in trade. No one in the real world needs to know where your stuff is coming from.

You can do a lot more if you don't care about keeping the portal secret, obviously.

*** I wouldn't give it a year before the secret is out. I'd imagine the sword-collecting community is small and thus tight ly knit, and if someone began selling high-quality blades without any prior reputation with smiths and dealers, that's going to cause questions, even if only from idle curiosity. You might be able claim that they are simply a family treasure you want to sell, which would get the attention of historians.

I feel like the only long-term method would use low-profile items, but that doesn't seem worth the bother.

**** The sword-collecting community is small, but they don't have any significant muscle or intelligence gathering. So even if they have questions, what the hell are they going to do about it? It /might/ be possible to test the swords for radiation and figure out that they weren't forged in a world where atomic weaponry has been used, but that seems somewhat unlikely. It would be one of those minor mysteries that I doubt would ever go anywhere.

It would also be possible to set yourself up as a smith-savant. And if you wanted to get into the business of selling swords, it would probably be wise to at least learn something about them in order to get the highest prices. If it were me, I would present myself as sort of an asshole that's highly secretive about his techniques - never giving tours of my workspace, never sharing tips with anyone, just taking from the community and never giving back.

**** With access to Narnian labor, you have the ability to take orders for highly specific hand-crafted items that would usually take hundreds, if not thousands of hours to produce, and ship them out the same day.

You could buy fresh wine and age it for decades or centuries in a day. Same with cheese (to a lesser extent).

If you could set up an electrical generator of any kind (including solar, hydro etc) with sufficiently smoothed output, you could run a 3D printer which finished jobs near-instantly from the perspective of the outer world.

You could set up cell-division/replication vats and have them churn out massive amounts of whatever hospitals wanted. 100% patient-compatible skin, for starters. And strides are being made in growing organs. Imagine being able to offer a medical research lab the ability to super-accelerate organ growth tests; they could run a thousand tests an hour instead of having to wait months on each one to see how it turned out.

** My first thought was to use it for cargo transport -- shift tons of stuff to Narnia, then you only have to move the wardrobe, not all of the tons of stuff. Could be a space launch technique if you can find a way to keep it secret what you're doing. That's not optimal, though.

Oh, how about nuclear waste disposal? Put it in Narnia, go back a few Earth days later to find that it's safely broken down into its final base state. (Tough on Narnia of course.)

Rich people who, for whatever reason, want to disappear from the face of the Earth now can -- for a very large fee.

As I recall, the wardrobe existed in both Narnia and Earth, right? When you went back to Earth, you climbed through the Narnia-side wardrobe? And the wardrobe could be moved in Narnia without affecting the one in Earth and vice versa?

If so, and if you had /two/ wardrobes then you're golden. It gives you:

- Effectively teleportation: set the two up one against the other in Narnia and widely separated on Earth. The time compression means that the pass through the Narnia segment takes effectively zero time.
- Effective space launch: put one wardrobe in space
- Power generation. Set the wardrobes up one above the other, facing up / down; you now have a potential energy difference that you can use to generate hydropower, and the water will automatically recycle back to the top.
- Claim the Randi prize by showing that you can do something faster than humanly possible -- they give you a giant box of Legos and some directions for how to build the Empire State Building or whatever. You step into the wardrobe and reappear a moment later with the completed assembly. Other methods are possible, of course.
- Aging wine, whiskey, whatever else benefits from sitting around for a while
- Make gemstones -- the recipe for (e.g.) diamonds is heat + pressure + time. Use the time compression to handle the time. We can already make fake gems so I don't know if this would be better / cheaper.
