** Hopefully it's obvious enough what's happening in this chapter - some exposition about Red's backstory and his relationship with his sister (sorry for people who were hoping for juicy vampire politics).

We're moving back to a slower release schedule, but with chapters long enough to sink your fangs into: I declare last chapter's experiment over.

Release schedule is hoping to be about 8 more updates this year, so 4 full chapters - [[http://www.beeminder.com/mad/chapters][www.beeminder.com/mad/chapters]] will more or less correspond to the release schedule.
