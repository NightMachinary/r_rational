**** Pirating free work hurts the author by reducing their public metrics, which lowers their chances of getting publishing deals for future works. It's like reducing someone's GPA on the resume, only without the author screwing around to earn that.

***** In this case, the work is posted to AO3, which features the ability to download natively as part of site functionality. The only thing stopping anyone from epub download is that the file size is so big that their converter doesn't work and the download fails.

I do generally agree with the premise, but this is just a case of a provided feature not working like it should, so circumventing it isn't a huge deal to me. (I still don't want people mirroring the story, because that likely means that fewer people are seeing or clicking Patreon/Paypal links, and I don't have control of those mirrors so can't make sure that they're what I want them to be, and some are bound to be leeches, but publication is basically assumed to never be happening for this story unless it's self-published.)

I don't think I've ever seen a resume with a GPA on it, other than fake practice resumes written in high school "how to get a job" classes...

***** How is that pirating? It's a /free/ book with download links right on the page. All the other formats are downloading without a problem, it's just that to read it on my iPad I needed an EPUB which didn't download because of the bug on the website.

  Online piracy is the practice of downloading and distributing copyrighted content digitally without permission,
#+end_quote

From wikipedia. Notice how charging for the original isn't part of it.

Nobody who matters actually gives a shit about the few cents per download, but if AW wants a future book deal, he can point at all his prior stories and say "I've got X downloads of this story and y unique views" which is the closest metric you'll ever have for free content. There's also the issue of if Rowling decides she wants to pull a Disney, AW can't take this copy down.

The only thing that makes the file /not/ be piracy is the fact that AW replied to my.comment after the fact to grant permission.
