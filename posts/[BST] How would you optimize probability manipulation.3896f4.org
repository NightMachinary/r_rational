Say that you had the ability to magically manipulate probability. Rules are as follows:

1) You can manipulate probability to result in whatever you would like. This takes place instantaneously (or as close as to make no difference), as soon as you will to do so. You can affect your surroundings, but not the world outside of roughly line of sight (no summoning meteors or an empty cab in the middle of NYC)

2) You can calculate approximate relative odds by seeing or imagining the scenario. Casinos and the stock market are traps for people having this ability, among other things.

3) Manipulating probability takes a physical toll in physical and mental exertion on an exponential scale. Making a 50% chance come out the way you want is trivial, anything over 20% requires a major expenditure of effort. Some users of this ability can reach 5 or 1% probability, but it risks serious injury or even death.

Within those limitations, what could you do with this power? What further limitations might be necessary to make a compelling narrative with characters that have this ability?

Given this, it seems like the best bet is to compound 50% chances. For example, the odds of a coin coming up heads are always ~50%, so I can do this as many times as I want in a row, even if the odds of flipping heads 50 times in a row are something like ~1/1,000,000,000,000,000.

So going binary seems like the way to go, until this loophole gets closed.

Simply seeing probabilities (without manipulating them) is almost more useful, because it would allow you a form of prescience. There probably needs to be some limitation on the time frame; if I'm looking at a television, can I see what the probabilities are for a poker game in the next room? Or better, the probability of an armed nuclear exchange, major terrorist attack, path of a hurricane, etc.?

I don't necessarily think that you need to add in limitations to make for a compelling narrative; you just need a big enough threat.

I imagine it as having an imaginary actuary calculating odds for you in the back of your head based on the information you know. If someone asked you about a theoretical poker hand, you'd /just know/ how probable that condition would be. If someone is coming at you with a gun you'd know the chances of being shot, how likely it is to be hit somewhere important, your chances of survival if you get shot, etc. In brainstorming about a hurricane, you could theorize a probability by looking at recent weather patterns. The limitation is what you know about the situation-You can estimate the odds of a terrorist attack, but without insider knowledge of terrorist groups your estimate is likely to be inaccurate. You can predict the odds of a poker hand coming up, but you don't inherently know if the dealer is stacking the deck unless you can look at the cards or try to manipulate them and see how much energy it takes. You don't know if another probability manipulator is changing the probability of an outcome until you try to change it yourself and it takes more (or less) effort to do so.

  actuary
#+end_quote

How smart is my imaginary actuary? Can he act like [[http://anydice.com/][AnyDice]] and calculate bell curves, or is it a matter of single outcomes? Does it have some social awareness, like, for example, telling me the odds that a woman would say yes to coming back to my place (even if my own personal understanding of women is virtually non-existent)?

In the case that my actuary is working on faulty information, am I still penalized based on the "true" odds for manipulating probability? /(ex. Let's say that I'm playing poker, and the deck has secretly been swapped, so that there are only three aces. I have pocket aces, and a third ace comes up on the flop. My actuary says that the probability of the fourth ace on the river is ~1/50, but since the deck is missing the fourth ace, the actual odds are ~0. Alternately, let's say that one of my opponents is holding the fourth ace.)/

Anyway, step one is to figure out exactly how the power works. Step two is to make gobs and gobs of money, probably by taking 50% bets repeatedly (betting all on red over and over again instead of all on 17). Step three is to use my new fortune to do more interesting things than getting rich; probably feeding myself with as much information as possible in pursuit of getting better and more accurate odds.

***** I imagine the actuary as doing bell curves and individual outcomes, based on the user's intent. If your actuary is acting on faulty information, you are still penalized for the higher "actual" cost of what you tried to do. I imagine an upper limit of some kind when you try to do something far beyond your limit-trying to draw the fourth ace in your example would hit you like trying to secure a fairly low probability event. It would hurt you, do nothing, and let you know you failed.

As for making money: Both sides in this conflict have certainly set up traps for any easy ways of making money. Excessive casino winnings, a series of short-term in the stock market or what have you beyond a certain point would probably attract attention and get you investigated (and attacked or killed).

** Probability is an abstraction, arguably even at the tiniest subatomic level that we can measure. Odds make sense in our heads - they tell stories in a satisfying way - but there isn't really a chance that a particular thing will happen. In a very real way, either it /will/ happen or it /won't/. The concept of probability manipulation is as absurd as Superman picking up a whole car by lifting its bumper.

It's one thing to change the wind or the speed of rotation and alter the result a coinflip. It's quite another to change the odds that a particular person knows your name, or that a particular product is available at a particular shop. In either of those cases even though you're /narratively/ changing the present, you're /physically/ changing the past.

If changing the past is possible, then assume the character was born female. The odds that she would have been born female are roughly 50%, so it ought to be effortless to change. The male individual she changes into will be almost 100% likely to have lived an strikingly different life than she did.

Alternately, the odds that she /was/ born female is 100%, because there she is... female. So it ought to be practically impossible to change.

Which one is easy and which one is hard?

This sounds like a freak case, but the same thing is true about relatively bland probabilities like "What are the odds that this closet has a broom in it?"

Speaking of which, developing perfects odds - whether you're a book maker or a meteorologist - is a matter of collecting enormous amounts of data and crunching the numbers. A magic ability could theoretically be doing exactly that, Asimov's psychohistory writ small, and it's a very powerful ability all by itself.

Even without manipulation knowing that the ability says 80% can help you know how to bet, but you'll still be betting wrong 20% of the time.

** I am having trouble understanding the mechanism by which this world works.

You say that if someone shot you you could manipulate the probability so he would not hit you\the hit would not be fatal. but also that if you were playing poker and that one of the other people has an ace you manipulation of the probability that you would get an ace would be changed.

But these dont make sense, i mean to demonstrate the point if you are told that a new employee is going to enter the door to your office you could in theory place the probability that who will enter your office will be a man at 50%, but that would be wrong, because the person was already hired before and actually the probability is 99.999999% that the person would still be the same person which was hired and you weren't aware of until now, so how could you manipulate the probability? In the same sense if there is a pack of cards in a theoretical situation the probability that you would get an ace is 4/52, but in reality while you don't know it yet the cards already have a certain order. unless the event is based on some quantum phenomena generally the world is fairly deterministic.

And once you go through this any kind of decision you will take with the power will by definition by arbitrary.

It IS, after all, fairly simple, and anyone who studied the simpler parts of statistics in middle school or high school will have been exposed to frequentist techniques.

A frequentist interpretation says that if you were to try something 1000 times, and it happens 10 times out of that, then the event's probability is 1%. People likewise intuit that something with a 10% probability ought to happen once out of every ten trials.

Enumerating the possible outcomes of an event, assigning a likelihood to each event based on your knowledge of how these kinds of events have played out in the past, and extrapolating forward from there is very much a frequentist line of reasoning. (Note that this is subtly distinct from the assignment of prior probabilities in Bayesian reasoning.)

Keep in mind that most readers on this subreddit are going to have substantial exposure to Bayesian reasoning, so their intuitions are going to be tuned differently than the average person.

I understand the limitation is on the percentange you go to influence but how many things you influence at the same time should matter too.

Otherwise you could do something like this :

Take a substance that has a really high chance to decay in a given time , accumulate it by manipulating his chance of decaying : you can freely produce dirty bombs.

Or assassinate people via radiation poisoning that for non-altered probability would be completly harmless. By the same metric you would be able to shield yourself from radiation if you're in the most skilled cathegory. Only really fast decaying isotopes would be a problem.

So i assume the limitation is not only in the probability altered but on the magnitue of how many things you alter too. Otherwise you could make the villans going nuclear-crazy , which is a possibility ;)

I could see a nuclear isotope attack at a high level of use (entropy is probably easier to provoke then artificial order), but not making quick and easy dirty bombs. Also, this takes concentration and time, so a dirty bomb attack anywhere where the media would pay attention would get more heat on you then you're able to handle.

Better chances in faking being hit probably, or convincing them you're not worth shooting for whatever reason. Not immortal by any means but direct human death rather than say a nuke or AC130 is a lot easier to avoid.

In the truck scenario, my question would be how reductionist can you make it?

IF you manipulate death to 0%, can you say "what is chance of injury on this part of arm", 0%, then move along until everywhere is zero.

Even if the odds of your whole arm being injured were 100%, of course, depending on how it works it might mean that by the time you get to your last section of arm it is 100% and so impossible to manipulate.

******* Exactly-you aren't immortal, but direct human death is hard enough to make a good story, and make things like gun battles an interesting conflict of magic and ability. You aren't Neo, but you can do a pretty damn good impression of Inspector Tequila, and even better the more you train.

As to how reductionist you can make it, the biggest problem you run into there is time. How many small changes can you make before you need to take the big cost for the aggretate? How fast can you think? You can toss a bunch of coins in the air, and probably focus on each one fast enough to make them all individually turn heads. How many parts of your arm could you secure before you got hit by a truck?

** The first abuse I could think of would be to step-stone my way up to better power. The instant-probability power could help you to find what factors would actually influence your power's limits. You could then slowly nudge your odds of successfully circumventing those limits, one decision at a time like the left/right step idea [[/u/RMcD94]] uses.

The power has to be prevented from working on itself and its own causes or else you can snowball your way into godhood fairly quickly.

** Sorry for the wall of text, I toyed with similar magic system and thought a lot about it. In my system you could change probability distribution of any random variable prior to sampling it, and the energy cost was proportional to integral of the squared difference between the original and desired probability distribution over the domain of the variable.

It is an elegant, general system, but the problem is - probabilities can be combined. It applies to your system as well, even more I think.

You can add irrelevant clauses to the random variable you want to tinker with to make it easier. For example "I will win this game" may have probability of 0.01, but "I will win this game or I will toss a coin and it will be tails" will have probability of a little over 50%.

So in your system I can do this to do ANYTHING for the cost of 2 trivial spells:

1. make the probability of "I will win this game OR that coin toss will be Tails" = 100% (original probability a little over 50%)
2. make the probability of "that coin toss will be Tails" = 0% (original probability = 50%)

I could skip the gaming altogether, and just do "10 kg of gold will materialise on the floor" instead of winning a game. Or 10 kg of antimatter if I want big boom and not the money. Or "the drug for cancer will materialise on the floor" if I'm benevolent that day. What's the difference between (1-0.50000000001) and (1-0.5000000000000000000000001) after all.

So yeah - it's OP.

You can forbid compound random variables, but it's a gray area - a roll dice is compound random variable too if you think about it.

You could also forbid casting 2 spells that manipulate the same random variable, but random variables in real world are rarely 100% independent, so you may find that changing that 1 coin toss in the past slightly changed probability of EVERYTHING after 1 year (see butterfly effect). So you basicaly made magic impossible for anybody because of that 1 small spell.

May be good for story, now that I think about it :) Wizards would make sure they isolate the things the manipulate from outside world, and magic defence would be basicaly ensuring that the thing you want to defend from tinkering influences as many things in outside world as possible. But it's inevitable someone had destroyed magic in such universe long before the story even begins IMHO.

I think the best way to deal with this is to make the magic energy cost work out the same no matter how many spells you cast to achieve the result - it should be "path invariant", so exponential cost won't work, it would need to be linear I think. But linear cost seems too cheap, stuff like "create arbitrary amount of matter custom tailored to your specification out of nowhere" would be at most 2 times more expansive than "change the result of a coin toss". I abandoned the project because of that.

Now that I think about it - maybe relativity equations could be made to work here? There's some analogy with changing velocity to c requiring infinite energy, and changing probability by 1 should be the same. And I think in relativity the equations are path invariant? I'm not good with relativity.

I like the "line of sight" limit - it makes it much less powerful, but still - it's OP as hell.

Your system has also effortless future prediction, even non-line-of-sight, because of this trick: you can promise to yourself that you will put a ball in one box if Obama wins election, and in other if he loses. Both boxes are in line of sight. And then you will take that ball from one box or the other. After making such a promise you predict probability of taking ball from the first and the second ball after the elections - voila - you know who will win.

In mine system you cannot predict probability, but you can try to change probability distribution "blind", and if you don't use enough mana - you will fail painfuly (the amount of pain proportional to the missing energy). So predicting future is possible, but painful and costs mana - you basicaly have to estimate the probability distribution by undershooting on purpose. And if you fail too much (more than 0.5) you go mad forever.

*** My thought was that in combining clauses, you suffered all of them cumulatively-your chance at making gold appear out of thin air (effectively impossible) would also have to be paid if you tacked that on to changing a coin toss as well, or perhaps causally linking things that were not causally linked before is impossible (a coin toss does not affect the outcome of an election).

The initial idea sounds elegant, but I'm not sure how to make it work. I might cheat and just declare that it only works on physical objects within sight of the mage, combining variables makes you pay the cost of the most unlikely variable in the equation at minimum, and that you can't materialize what wasn't there before, which might address your loopholes. Thoughts?

  combining variables makes you pay the cost of the most unlikely variable in the equation at minimum
#+end_quote

variable X = something effectively impossible DOES NOT happen (prob. almost 1)

variable Y = tossed coin lands tails (prob. 0.5)

Spell 1. make the probability of X AND Y = 0 (originaly a little less than 0.5)

Spell 2. make the probability of Y = 1 (originally 0.5)

Profit :)

I don't think you can make this non-OP. It's just too general. The best bet would be to design path-invariant way to calculate the cost of manipulations that works like relativity velocity change equations - the further you ultimately change the probability from original - the closer to infinity the energy cost gets. For changing the probability from 0 to 1 (or vice versa) the cost should be infinity no matter how you achieved that. But I've failed to design such equations (haven't spend much time on that).

My first idea was equation like:

#+begin_example
    energy cost of changing prob A to B = - constant / 4*(a-b)*(1-a-b)
#+end_example

For changing 0.5 to 0 or 1 it would make the cost = constant.

For changing 0 to 1 the cost would be +infinity.

But it's not path invariant. For changing 0.5 to 0.75 and then 0.75 to 1 it would be 8/3 * constant.

  2) You can calculate approximate relative odds by seeing or imagining the scenario. Casinos and the stock market are traps for people having this ability, among other things.

This alone would be extremely useful even without probability manipulation.

** I think a lot of the loopholes can be fixed more elegantly by fixing the math rather than by adding exceptions. Simply define your unit of cost as how difficult it is to double the odds of something (1:1 -> 2:1 would have the same cost as 1:1000->1:500), and then let that difficulty stack naturally. Getting to 100% or 0% odds becomes impossible, which I think makes more sense, and you can no longer short circuit costs just by making them part of compound probabilities.
