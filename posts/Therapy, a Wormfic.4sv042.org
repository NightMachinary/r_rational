** Starts out good.

The premise makes interesting conflict difficult. So it drifted into the "protagonist steadily progresses on every front" miasma that plagues so much fanfiction.

** Hmm. I'm up to 2.3 so far and it's an interesting take but, as someone else pointed out, it's sort of just Taylor foxing everything in sight that will let her. Barring the few people that turn her down. It's happy in a way that feels almost clich√© and unrealistic, and it takes too broad a stroke with what's classified as a mental disorder. Curing someone shouldn't automatically make them a happy go lucky, super nice person but that's what it's done to everyone she's fixed so far. So it comes off as more than a bit Cringy at times. The scene in particular with Amy felt plastic and fake to me. As if the author just needed an excuse to get Taylor some upgrades. Which is fine. It's just that the excuse in question feels unreal and transparent.

Overall, not a bad story so far but not one I'd personally recommend to someone that likes worm fanfiction. I'll keep reading though to see if my opinion changes

** A repost. A lot of the people here are probably already following it, but since discussion is mostly happening on SV I figured I'd give it an early repost for the people who missed it.

** It's interesting, and the author is keeping a pretty impressive schedule, but it's not rational anymore (debatably, it never was). Still a cool read to start the day with.
