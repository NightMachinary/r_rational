This has been posted here on a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uf68n/the_last_christmas/][couple]] of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1tl5m0/thedaythatsantastolechristmas/][occasions]]. But note the sidebar:

  Because of reddit's ranking algorithm, there's no way for users to bump old posts to the front page. For this reason, reposts are not only allowed but explicitly encouraged!

I think this story is worth posting again and it'd be really appreciated if no one complained about reposts.

The only fault in this story is that it's a bit too short. The ending felt quite anticlimatic because I was prepared for some longer and bigger story development. The whole thing with the elves maturing came out of nowhere and happened very suddenly.

*** TL;DR - Everyone, don't complain about reposts. They're fine here.

*** The ending definitely needs some work, and I need to go back and pepper in some foreshadowing. I've got a rewrite of the story sitting in a folder that's a few thousand words longer that makes up for some of the problems it has in the current version, but I'm sort of doing an idle re-edit every once and awhile instead of putting most of my writing effort into it.

It was originally started a week before Christmas and finished on Christmas Eve (I believe), and that accounts for a little bit of the rushed feeling to it.
