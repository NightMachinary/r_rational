** I didn't start reading yet - was waiting for the translation to finish. Am now glad that I did.

As for speculation that some rights-holders want it translated "on their terms" - bullshit. If they were going to do a higher quality translation, they wouldn't be concerned about competition from hobbyists. I don't expect there will be any translation from them anytime soon.

*** Original has 1500+ chapters, you're gonna wait a while if you want to read it when it's finished.

**** I dunno, at usual wuxia translation pace, that'd be a few years. At the pace this was getting translated it was going to be quite a bit longer, and I was hoping to see more translators join the project (one of the reasons for waiting - I prefer to binge and read everything over the course of a few weeks or at least in large chunks). I'm really disappointed that instead of more translators there's now zero. I can't imagine how people who've been reading it from the start feel.

*** u/Endovior:
#+begin_quote
  "on their terms"
#+end_quote

I figured I'd phrase things charitably. Unfortunately, there seem to be hints that the terms in question include paying their own translators next to nothing, and then releasing the results behind a subscription-based paywall.

*** I'm in the same boat. I wouldn't necessarily wait years to start reading it, but the longer I wait the more content will be readily available so I might as well prioritize other stories. I'm still pissed about this because the story sounds like something I'd /really/ like.

** There were updates to this being posted here regularly; then it got moved to Gravity Tales, and the update posts stopped. There were another six chapters added on the new site, and then nothing. Investigation led me to the linked post; it looks like the rights to the novel have been acquired by some company, and they want it translated on their own terms.

Thoughts?

*** I'm not sure how these sorts of things usually work. It's definitely a bummer that updates stopped now because of this, though.
