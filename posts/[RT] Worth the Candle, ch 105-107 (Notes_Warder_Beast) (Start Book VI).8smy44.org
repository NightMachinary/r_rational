** Okaaaay, I'm officially on edge. Congratulations, I guess, seeing Amaryllis react with utter terror and be absolutely confident that they will all die if he shows up really drove home how the joke has become a very very horrifying reality. The true final boss has revealed himself, though making him beatable may rob him of the mystique.

On to Grak, very good scene. Explains a lot, and seeing him break down crying at the memory of his dead home does a lot to let me empathize with a gruff no-nonsense character who I've never gotten attached to very much.

**** I don't think he ever speaks, he just shows up and kills everyone. There is nothing that can force him to do anything else.

My guess is that he is indeed killable, but only through specific circumstances. Remember, in the song in question, he was successfully killed. The MC of the song 1) escaped Shia's pursuit, 2) snuck up on him, 3) stabbed him in the kidney with /his/ knife, 4) left him assumed dead, 5) decapitated Shia with an axe. I think at least the last one will be the key to actually hurting him. This is, again, contingent on Shia actually being killable.

My first thought upon reading this was perhaps the reaction was one of jealousy on Junipers part but then there was no mention of a reaction from Juniper at the time Valencia actually mentioned her date with Jorge. Seeing as Juniper appears to be retrospectively narrating this story, i'm guessing in the future Jorge shows himself to be a creep of some sort.

- Make her outer walls immaterial for half an hour (Evanescent Armor), then expand them as far as possible (Anyblade). Hopefully a continuous, quantitative increase in her sensorium is less unpleasant than abrupt qualitative ones. If she can be a "house" containing all of Aerb, she can easily kill almost anyone she wants using her various other powers.
- If Aerbian physics is like ours, I don't think she could /quite/ split atoms with 5 pounds of force. Probably best not to try it though.
- Have a bone mage interrogate a prisoner by draining their skull of KNO through their teeth, then use the Wishes ability to undo the harm to the prisoner.
- Use the Everflask for secure communication. Bethel and a spy agree beforehand on a code mapping hypothetical drinks that the Everflask can't make yet to messages ("n parts dandelion wine to 1 part year-old whiskey means the prince is hiding in sector n"), and the spy communicates by mixing the appropriate drink and getting someone to "consume it for the purposes of pleasure, sustenance, or health". Whereupon Bethel brute-force tries to make all 32 agreed-upon drinks until one of them works.

  “Infohazards,” I said with a nod. Of course Aerb had infohazards, why would it not? One of the Thirteen Horrors I had a quest for was [REDACTED]; that was his name given in both the quest text and the description I'd read in The Exclusionary Principle, Seventh Edition, complete with brackets. It was heavily implied that he got more powerful the more you knew about him. To me, that hadn't implied an entire class of memetic threats, especially because he was in an exclusion zone, but apparently I should have just assumed that Aerb would contain every single thing I had ever thought of, so long as it was at least loosely within the genre.

*** The quest doesn't seem hard, since the known/outed dreamskewered are conveniently and inconveniently gathered in one location. Inconveniently, since the nature of the infohazard means it's most likely to be bandied between fellow dreamskewers. Conveniently, since Joon can easily draw on oblique references that any dreamskewer who's familiar with Shia LaBeouf can recognize (and if they're too old to recognize the name, all the better) and nip the bud on the likeliest ground zero.

One question is /how/ the infohazard triggers. Does the summoning occur only if you complete the entire name? Or is uttering just "Shia..." with the name in mind sufficient? Because it's way easier to explain to fellow dreamskewers if he can truncate the name.

So a blanket ban on any celebrity's name from Earth from any time (to hinder dictionary attacks)? That might be sufficiently wide to dissuade casual rebels and terrorists-to-be.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_of_Base][Ace of Base]] was a musical group popular in the 90s and early 00s. Anyone who remembers them, is also from recent enough period in Earth history to possibly know the name Shia LaBeouf (he got his acting start in the mid-90s). Ditto for people familiar with the internet.

You can't say or otherwise communicate the name, so to identify people who probably know it or are capable of knowing it, you have to use other cultural/historical mileposts. E.g. by asking about stuff from the same time period as Shia LaBeouf.

You could program the operating system to take a hash of every string passed to it and every string passed out, compare it to a list of variations of the Actual Cannibal's name, and stop anything that matches. If that's not sufficient and even having his name in memory can summon him, you can use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption][homomorphic encryption]] so that everything is encrypted during computation, and it deletes any mention of the Actual Cannibal before decrypting.

****** I kinda don't know if you're just fucking with us, but is there a way to sort of hint about it without actually causing the infohazard? Kinda like that earlier SCP link, where you can vaguely describe the thing without actually spreading the infohazard?

In actuality, I don't want to know it. But I can think of things that act like temporary infohazards that aren't bad, like knowing where your nose is in your vision or feeling yourself breathing or eye floaters. Is it like that? Or is it scary fiction I don't want to think about, like Cordycepts or any SCP?

Is there any chance I could come across it in the wild or by myself? What if I search for infohazards?

I'm curious especially about the 5% already infected. Where does that number come from?

Can I know how that negative response happens that's like torture without knowing the infohazard? I have no clue what could possibly cause that.

Yes, by all means. Its a "natural" thing. Though I doubt it would be considered infohazard anywhere except here. Its a 0.5 to 1 on the scale, maybe spiking to 2 due to "torture" response.

5% has gone up to 10% over today, based on three natural carriers (as opposed to one). Sample size still small.

The very negative response seems to be on the very far right side of the bellcurve, my response was a one time pain experience.

******** So no hints or descriptions remotely related to the topic?

I'm not withstanding my curiosity, but rather trying to get you to satisfy it without actually subjecting myself to the infohazard.

Come on, give me something here.

Is it sleep paralysis and the phantom thing I've heard people see? Is it knowledge of a super scary statistic that keeps you up at night? Is it the knowledge of the infohazard that you're telling us, causing to feel "pain" from the overwhelming curiosity?

Oftentimes it's possible to describe the infohazard without spreading it. There's an SCP that causes people to forget about it, but you can remember what it's not.

Also, that other one about breaking your thumb ligament is enough without seeing the picture to satisfy curiosity.

Can you describe it in any way without spreading it? If you really are worried, PM me the ideas around the infohazard, but not the infohazard itself. I'd really rather not get it.

I swear, it feels like you're priming us away from what it could be.

Uggggghhhh! I can't think of what could possibly be natural that could cause pain for a week. The only method would be if the pain was already there, but people just started to pay attention to it until they forget about it.

Can it be spread through text alone? Or a picture? Sound? Video?

I vaguely remember a real cognitohazard, that had something to do with red and green lines or something.

Please satisfy my curiosity slightly! I beg you!

I wasn't impressed with the hazard levels of Roko's Basilisk, either, but I found it a rather cute idea.

The hand-on-stove analogy is weak because the premise and results are mundane and well-known. The exotic mystery of it is appealing, like if someone discovered some basilisk-y sound you could listen to that would make you feel pain, but is still completely unknown to the layman.

******** Well, in that particular case it was quite likely that the infohazard wasn't lethal or very hazardous at all, since it was transmitted from one human to another, as well as because its current bearer was willing to transmit it to consenting people (as opposed to being terrified of the idea, or alternatively disseminating it as widely as possible for mass chaos purposes).

The rest is just estimating how harmful it could possibly be, how much potential harm you're willing to suffer in the name of your curiosity, and how likely you think it is that someone would try to weaponize it later on (i. e., whether you need to vaccinate yourself).

True infohazards are unheard-of, and existence of one would have massive implications. I wouldn't say that you can't fault rationalists for jumping at the chance to confirm it --- it was, in fact, unsafe --- but it's perfectly understandable.

1) A shitload of dead bodies. Dozens to hundreds.

2) Records about the word, and that saying it will summon an unbeatable murderer who will kill everyone who said the word, and the people who told them it, and the people who ordered them to say it, even without knowing the word. (I suppose this may have only happened with the very last group, but it seems like most would know about it by the nature of the experiments)

Then decided to commit suicide by researching it.

I guess Amaryllis did say

Which means there aren't weren't /that/ many experiments, but there were at least 6 different groups that had that little self preservation.

I suppose her kingdom has a lot of assholes with power running around, so it's possible they could blackmail people in killing themselves for science, but there's not a lot of incentive there. The assassination thing, sure, but just getting the success rate? Why bother?

In the case of some poor smuck saying it by accident, who would record what caused it? Or more importantly, how many times they said it /without/ dying horribly? All you get from that are positive reports.

I'm probably just overthinking this. Amaryllis probably gave out a random percent chance of death, knowing that the words didn't work every time. Anyone making up the estimation would err on the side of caution, even if they only said the word twice (one dud, one "success"), and say 60% chance of death, rather than 50%.

If "object" can be a person, she could push Joon up to absurd speeds within the confines of her house (providing enough space with Pikel's Gap). Transferring the muzzle velocity of a heavy cannonball (even easier if the momentum can be stacked) to Joon while creating a relative vacuum is more than enough for 600 mph.

** Something that other people have probably noticed before me, but I somewhat recently noticed on a read through: CRJ basically dropped health as a relevant stat as the story progressed. I actually like this, because it felt somewhat intrusive and took me out of the moment, but it is noticable when you compare latter fights with the early ones.

Would the Shia Labeouf thing be the way to kill Fel Stead or whatever the name is? Both are described as being unkillable killing machines, so setting one against the other seems like it would lead to profound breakthroughs in science.

I'm also wondering how Aerb first discovered that the words "Shia Labeouf" repeated three times killed everyone around. Like, how did anyone say those syllables those number of times, accidentally, and then manage to record the process in the only way that they can be recorded?

Edit: it's really lucky that Amaryllis didn't pull up, say, a list of the most popular movies of the 2000s in the months in the time chamber. Holes was fairly popular, and he's been in a number of big movies in addition to that.

I was assuming it was another dream skewed, or possibly more than one. Even if 60% of them got killed, you only need one survivor to pass on enough for a line of research.

Heck, it might even have been Arthur himself, if he found a way to cheat his way around the killing/communication restriction.

**** But, how would that work? 60% of the time, nothing happens, and no one knows that they were close to death. 40% of the time, the knowledge dies with them, if they even realize what they did wrong. All it would really result in is a warning that some guy randomly kills lots of people around dream skewered people, mostly from America.

The only way I could see it working is if someone had some form of danger sense, and was near the dream skewered person while they said his name, and knew to connect the name with the potential summoning, and that the 60% is in fact random and not just lack of information of hidden variables (i.e. saying his name with different inflections guarantees his summoning or makes it never happen if the name is only said once). But the only form of danger sense I can think of in WTC is elf luck, but that would just have the elf avoid the skewered person entirely, and wouldn't give them any information on what caused the slaughter that happened.

Edit: Maybe an elf who has luck strong enough to see an hour into the future happened to be near a dream skewered person, without their luck telling them to avoid the person (??? No idea how that would work) and then their luck tells them not how to avoid death, because death is inevitable, but how to convey the warning onto others? Luck gives elves information they have no way of knowing, so it's about as plausible as anything else.

Well, there a few possibilities I can think of, but the most likely that springs to mind is something fairly similar to what we just saw in the chapter. A dream skewed says the name out loud in front of an audience, but nothing happens.

One or more of those people then later repeats the name, where someone else could see the action, but not hear (or read, or...) the name being said, and this time it /did/ summon him. Now you have one slaughter, one witness of the summon, and one or more people who know the name, but haven't repeated it yet, for whatever reason. A slaughter, but the knowledge didn't die with the person who said the name (or wrote it down, or whatever).

Since infohazards are a thing in Aerb, it's not inconceivable for someone to connect the dots from that, or a surviving dream skewed who got the "joke", then someone set up a research project to see if it can be weaponized, before they realize just how dangerous it is.

It may have taken more than one cycle of failed summons, followed by slaughters with surviving name-knowers for someone somewhere to have worked this out. Possibly a steady drip of dream skewed making the same mistake, getting themselves and everyone around wiped out for some unknown reason, before someone somewhere got "lucky" enough for the events to line up.

  Long Stairs - One of the rare campaigns set on Earth.

Ran it twice, once as a meditation on American involvement in the Middle East, the second time post-Arthur as more of a “run friends through the thresher because of personal problems”.

In reference to Grak's Anglish ... it reads fine to me either way, but I have no strong opinions on changing it to something that parses better for other people. The intent with regard to him being able to read it was that he was capable of doing something more like a laborious word-by-word translation of Anglish into Groglir, rather than actually reading the Anglish itself; knowing a fair amount of Anglish means understanding some of the differences between their languages in terms of structure, having memorized a few key phrases, and knowing a small handful of words.

***** Sure, it's just to me it crosses the line from "heavy inspiration" to "blatant plagiarism" in terms of Terran cultural material. Pretty much everything else in Aerb introduced so far is either made solely by the DM, adapted from Joon's campaigns, or somewhat hidden easter eggs from Terran culture (the Kinsey book anagram).

Since it's said that Joon ran conventional campaigns, it would be like them coming across an enclave of Yog Sothoth cultists, assuming he played Call of Cthulhu at some point. If the DM is borrowing material that Joon didn't come up with, he at least makes a token effort to disguise it.

I wouldn't have any complaints if there was an inhuman monster that would kill all those who named it, known to few as the /Haal sou Beif/, that would be totally in line with what the DM's done so far. Not even trying to hide the connection to Terra, not so much.

#+begin_quote
  “I don't get how it's possible,” I said. “Is memory not part of the soul?”

  “It is,” said Fallatehr. “Though it's nearly inaccessible to attempts at manipulation.”
#+end_quote

Chapter 70:

#+begin_quote
  I suspected that Fallatehr wasn't telling the whole truth, [...] because it was possible to look at and presumably alter memories, even if the interface for that seemed lacking.
#+end_quote

Chapter 72

#+begin_quote
  “Memories are difficult to work with,” said Fallatehr. “Difficult, but not impossible. Your memories of what you have seen and felt of your own soul would suffice, for my purposes.” He held up a hand as I opened my mouth to offer the obvious objection. “I would not need to touch your soul. With your skill as it is, you would be able to transfer those memories into the soul of an intermediary, who would then go to visit me, on another continent, as Amaryllis suggested.”
#+end_quote

Chapter 73:

#+begin_quote
  "If you could reverse what you have done and erase our memories --”

  “No, memories are nigh-impossible to work with like that, even when freshly made, at least if attempting to manipulate them through the mechanism of the soul,”
#+end_quote

So putting this all together, memory reading and transfer is well within the domain of soul-magic. Memory editing is extremely difficult. Selective memory deletion is likely not possible, except /maybe/ with a repeat of that skill sacrifice trick.

Come to think of it, there are a few good reasons for something like this not to be true. (Also, I didn't do the least bit of checking for similar guesses) Still, I'll be damned if I call a plot point and without proof again, so I'm erring on the side of caution.

** Well, that explains the inclusion of a Medium Armor skill in the system, a bold move that I haven't seen anyone try to pull off since Morrowind (if you played Morrowind, you know why).

Retroactively funny that Amaryllis chided Joon for picking redundant armor skills. Turns out that Medium Armor exists solely and entirely for the purposes of making a mega-armor build with all three skills.

Possible further virtues: Medium armor usage also grants skill gains in heavy/light Use whichever armor skill is highest while wearing medium armor All Medium Armor virtues also work while wearing non-medium armor Add Unarmored to the pile, just for shits and giggles? Add the skill ratings together?

Well, that last one looks like it would be a trap. A sneaky way for the DM to modernize the system and get rid of the unfashionable Medium Armor skill while maintaining simulationist deniability by making some poor fool get the skill - and himself - Excluded.

** Let's talk about that magic:

#+begin_quote

  1. To become a velocity mage, you had to move, without magical assistance, faster than the benchmark, and then maintain it for a short period of time. It went up with every velocity mage that was inducted into the ranks. Due to somewhat short-sighted expansion of those ranks during the Second Empire, that meant going more than six hundred miles per hour, and there was presumably some secret to it, because that was really, really fast.
  2. Vibrational Magic was locked to a magic item, which was tightly controlled by the Athenaeum of Sound and Silence, and besides that, rate limited. It was frustrating, because all I needed was a tap on the head, but there was a long line of people waiting in front of me, all of whom had gone through the training necessary to actually utilize the magic.
  3. Revision Magic required being revised backward by a year, which was far more than enough to kill a person, since your body spent that year taking in and expelling matter. The Athenaeum of Claw and Clocks had a collection of entads that would keep you stable, including the Thousand Rings of Stability, but it still meant giving up a year of your life, the so-called “lost year” (as memories were lost too), and obviously it took a lot of time and power from an existing revision mage to do the revision.
  4. Still Magic required visiting a temple and meditating there for a week, which wouldn't have been too much of a problem, except that the temple was deep underground, and controlled by the Athenaeum of Sound and Silence.
  5. Water Magic was a bloodline magic, and all I really needed was a teacher, who we'd already contacted and was on her way to come see us. The strict combat utility wasn't all that promising, but the weather control aspects would help a lot on the Isle of Poran.
  6. Fire Magic we could do too, but hadn't. About 1% of the time someone was burned alive, they would awaken horribly scarred but otherwise fine, with the barest powers of a fire magus. If you had sufficient magical healing, you could take someone to the brink and then heal them back as many times as it took for the fire magic to trigger.
#+end_quote

So, numbers 1, 3, and 6 basically just require munchkinry, and numbers 2, 3, and 4 require politics.

--------------

Velocity magic seems like a problem for Amaryllis and technology, and possibly the house making itself a vacuum tube (think about it for a sec: complete knowledge of its internals and being able to arbitrarily apply 5 pounds of force means it could just use a Maxwell's Demon approach! Or a boring smelly tedious plebian old-fashioned compression system). Acceleration would be useful to have, because it would shorten the necessary length of the tube. Being able to cast the prince's-whatever 6-second invincibility spell would be useful for safely escaping afterward, but probably optional.

So, vacuum tube or just a giant rocket. /In fact/, if possible they should just invent an edible odd-tasting (so that it counts as recreation - give the recipe to some chef and say "make this exactly, and serve it as a drink", and voila!) rocket-fuel, if possible, and have Bethel generate it, to save costs. Or not, I don't know if that's a problem.

Revision magic requires /time/, which they have plenty of, stored in a chamber. If they could do the entire thing in there, then they lose basically nothing (soul mages are effectively immortal to aging, AIUI, so losing the lifespan isn't a problem for Joon, neither is the time, nor memories of spending a year in the chamber.

The question is: /are those entads portable/? If they are, then with politics they could just borrow them for a few hours (or however long an in-the-chamber year is, plus setup etc), accompanied by a revision mage to help do the thing.

Fire magic is... already sorted? Either way, consistent fire damage, consistent healing, hopefully not too much time, and they've got it.

#2 seems straightforward - find someone they can bribe/blackmail into handing over their place in the line. Finding 50 people who are willing to delay their ascension for 3 months might be easier than finding one person who's willing to go to the very back of the line.

#4 sounds like it's a matter of paying huge tuition fees.

--------------

*But*, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Do we even need to /traditionally/ unlock the magics? Perhaps a soul scaphism plus levelling would be enough to stay on level one, once the scaphism wears off. At that point, you simply need to find someone with one level, then peel off a level or two and then attempt to grind the shit out of that skill - perhaps live combat with the skill would make it level faster? Really, the biggest sacrifice would be finding souls of people with the relevant magics. If that's trivial, then (assuming June still retains the soul scaphism ability) there's basically no loss in attempting to unlock the skill the easy way.

Plus, with the twin souls etc, unlocking one for June /should/ make it possible for companions to easy-unlock them by roughly the same method.
