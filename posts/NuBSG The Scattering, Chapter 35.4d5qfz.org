*** nBSG is about a remnant fleet desperately trying to survive, which they ultimately failed(by sending their ships into the sun).

This fanfic is about a remnant fleet fighting a rearguard action and reforging a space-faring civilization on the fly while trying to find Earth. They reached Earth by chapter 36, and now they're trying to establish first contact without setting off WWIII and a nuclear apocalypse.
