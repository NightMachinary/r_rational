** "Hey, Choirs. That thing you do where you take away the Light from people that go against your wishes--can you do that a bit /more often/?" Or there's the enticingly exciting concept of a civil war /between/ Choirs that we haven't seen so far... though if the Choirs are unchanging, it could easily be that they started in a meshing-well state and will be like that forever.

On the one hand, reintroduction of the three spymasters was welcome as it's been quite a while since Fatalism II. On the other hand, the manner of it seemed completely as if they had never been introduced the first time, which made the experience feel less like reintroduction than déjà vu.

That said, it's gratifying to now hopefully see the issues depicted in Fatalism II (and thereafter) now being finally dealt with! Particularly as the main thrust last time, Laurence, is now out of the picture entirely...

I didn't remember them at all so no deja vu here. Now excuse me while I go listen to deja vu.

*** the extra chapters are meant to serve as "extra", not part of the main story, but interesting tidbits. As such they are designed so that reading them will enhance the story, but not reading them won't degrade the enjoyment of the story

**** I'm not sure the interludes count as "extra" chapters, just the bonus chapters are like that

***** Interludes are regular chapters, I was talking about his feeling of "deja vu" for the introduction of the three spymasters, which was done in the "Fatalism" series of "Extra Chapters" (not interludes).

I presume EE wants to keep extra chapters as a "bonus" so that they aren't strictly necessary for the enjoyment of the main story, but supplement it.

Hence, any introductions made in the extra chapters will be done again if the characters show up on the regular chapters.

*** Actively telling your followers what to do instead of just putting out general guidelines and then letting them figure it out seems to go against the entire point of Creation.

**** Hmm, good point. I wonder how the discussion/negotiation between Above and Below went about the Light and the Book of All Things (if that second one was even intentional).
