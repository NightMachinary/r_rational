** I've caught up to this point in the fiction. I am very impressed with the quality of the story and setting and can't wait to see how it goes forward into the great unknown.

** I feel the pacing really deserves praise, it's really well done. Most serials tend to be kind of slow and overly detailed, this one does pacing very well.

** Discovered this one last week; it's been an interesting read. Solid work and fun to read. Each chapter feels short but I think that's just because I've gotten used to things like PGtE and Ward. Definitely a lot to digest and it has been fun to put the pieces together so far. A few comments and a couple of theories:

1. It will be interesting to see how much the five races are actually distinct races and how much is shared between them. There was a line in one of the first chapters at the end... something like "it's not like it was human". It just stood out and I suspect that either one or more races are going to end up being human or the humanity of alien races will get explored in depth. Especially considering another line recently hinting that human death is at least involved in the process of creating Shabti if not central to it.
2. I strongly suspect the spirit in-swelling Ram is... not exactly the run of the mill spirit that most handmaidens or swords get. Some of the speech by the En/Enti seemed to imply that there was a significant power struggle happening. I suspect the spirit holding Ram is fairly highly-ranked, possibly the one that usually goes to the En, and they are using Ram (possibly for specific reasons, possibly just because he's there. We shall see) to smuggle it out for now.
3. This is a comment mostly to the author. The font changes sometimes between chapters; it's a little distracting when you're binging it. For consistency's sake, it might be best to stick to a single font.

*** Really? We had an early issue which I thought I'd fixed, due to how I copy-pasted from LibreOffice. As it is, each update should be in two fonts: the gloss before the hr should be in WP's default font, while the story proper is in Palatino Linotype. I did this mostly to set the content apart from the commentary more, though it's probably not necessary, and also because it was less of a PITA to fix that way. Do you happen to have any specific examples in mind?

**** I did, but apparently my office strips out a lot from wordpress; I don't see the font changes that confused me when I view it at home. I also see a lot more ads, including through the text as I scroll through the story. Maybe you're updating the font in javascript somewhere and my workplace is blocking the script? That would explain it.

***** Ah. As creator, I don't see ads or any such disparities. Thanks for bringing it to my attention, and let me know if you find the issue. I viewed the first few chapters in markup and manually stripped and reformatted them, so I might have to tear some hair out if it's one of those. This sheep does not like mucking around with HTML, no sir.
