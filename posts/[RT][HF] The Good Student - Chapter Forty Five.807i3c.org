** I'm thinking that the Librarian and Winnum Roke are working together somehow. Maybe they were in a similar partnership as Nic and his demon?

I'm wondering what their deal is because it doesn't seem like they want to invade at all. What would be the purpose of sending Nic over? They might have a different agenda but I can't really imagine what that would be.

Some other interesting tid-bits: the Librarian could hear Nic's story but not its conclusion, which leads me to believe that the demon already decided to trust him by that point. So far Nic doesn't seem to have any godly powers and I wonder how much of it is down to his cautiousness. Also, Simole is back! Best girl has finally returned.

*** Yeah, it's fairly confusing. I think the problem is that the demons have a hundred years of planning behind them and so everything the main characters do has been accounted for. Even Nic had that thought - it's like a maze, and every choice they make ultimately leads to the same outcome. Like with Dizzy; she throws the knife and it doesn't matter if it kills the Librarian or Nic, either way works out for their plan.

The thing is, we don't know what their end goal is, so it all seems random. I think once it's revealed what they want it will make a lot more sense because we'll be able to piece together how all the steps came together.

*** Lol. I just read this in its entirety. Its all fresh in my mind but I am still lost. I kind of understand that this may be intentional but it seems as if something should have been explained by now.

Unless the story of the green demon rejecting the questions after too many is supposed to a warning to readers or something?

Also shouldnt Nics demon have known about some of the stories about the green demon? since they were supposedly written down in the mythology book. she said she only heard about a bear that was green and a lover. she couldnt think of any other "green demons."

**** I think you make a fair point. I wasn't very clear in that section about the Green Demon. The idea is that the story in the book is very different to the one Nic tells, but the Librarian recognises the similarity and brings his attention to it by referring to it as the Green Demon, even though it isn't called that in the book, so he knows she heard his version. My mistake for not being clearer (or clear at all), I really need to give myself more time to work out small errors like that which I could easily avoid with an extra pass. I blame the fog of war.

***** I just assumed the Librarian Demon had a unique, uncorrupted version of the original book and everyone else was running off versions that had changes over time.

Still, thanks for clarifying.

** @[[/u/mooderino]], typos:

(something wrong with the sentence, maybe it needs 'in' twice?)

- There was a lot he agreed with her in what she said, but he didn't have the same kind of training she did.

*** I dunno, it seems okay to me. Perhaps a regional thing, or perhaps I'm a bit punch drunk from the endless writing and can't see what you mean.

**** I think [[/u/ashinator92]] is right. I think it should be "There was a lot he agreed with her on in what she said" or remove her and get "There was a lot he agreed with in what she said." It could possibly be a regional thing.
