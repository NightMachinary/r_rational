** That played out a little different than I expected. As soon as the croaking started I knew they were gonna be players (since wandering mobs haven't been a thing this stage) but I was thinking they would slaughter them all and Nathan would only figure it out afterwards from the Analyze Enemy profile.

It's too bad he had to use Snare, I'm guessing he didn't use analyze on the downed enemy (before realizing they were players) to save up for a possible First Aid.

For a first encounter they did pretty damn well given the range of possible outcomes. The frogs seemed to be better leveled for combat given almost all their members had either a defensive or concealment skill. Trying for a diplomatic route could have gotten them all killed by invisible ambush.

Now, if I had to guess I would think that the Languages skill will actually be pretty important in future stages if it's upgrade allows the player to speak all the /other species'/ most common language, not just their own. Every group will have a designated diplomat or something.

It'll be interesting if Nathan tries to rally the group and hunt down the runner. It's probably the best possible option that would even keep diplomacy in the future open, if none of the frogs know their first contact ended in a slaughter. Just one more hunting party overwhelmed by the wave...

That was what I thought the upgrade would be as well. Like the 5 most common language of each player species.

*** You know, it occurs to me that only Iliya's enemy died without Nathan's direct involvement. Nathan dealt the killing blow to the frogs who killed Alexander, and downed two others himself early in the ambush. The runner is Lilly's first opponent.

If Nathan kills the runner, /he'll have five PvP kills/. That may well give him a heck of a reward.

**** Speaking of PvP rewards, I can see a few directions to take them.

- A flat NP award per kill. This doesn't reflect variable enemy strength, so I doubt it's being used.

- A percentage of total lifetime NPs earned by the victim. This seems more sensible to me, but ignores skills and other rewards earned from the system.

- Gain one or more game reward (i.e. skills, affinity, armor, weapon) the victim was benefiting from. Armor and weapons pixelated on the victim would be resized.

- A ranked PvP ladder with periodic rewards for the top positions.

- Any of the above, and gain a copy of the victim's Wristband Interface log. This could make /Language II/ or higher far more important to pick up, especially if their log contains info from their victims.

This would lead to a /huge/ power imbalance in favor of early PVPers. Bad game design, I think.

****** There are a few mitigating factors.

- The percentage need not be that large. 25% of lifetime NPs might be huge, but 5% of Nathan's NPs would be close to the full NP award for defeating a mutant bear.

- PvP is far more dangerous than PvE. Enemies can ambush you, run away, fight dirty, and in general be far more versatile than the usual monsters. Higher NP rewards for this increased risk make sense.

- Healing is at a premium in the Arena. Maimed players might rapidly recover from trauma, but scarring or missing limbs will remain an issue (on human players, in any case).

Ultimately, things come down to the uncertain goals behind the Arena itself. Only one species from each starting region will survive, and the philosophy behind the game looks very similar to an MMO RPG. Big rewards for PvP look to be in line with what we've seen before.

Also, consider that early builders got a free rank in their prime elemental affinity. The game seems to be set up to greatly reward early innovation.

*** I was expecting the settlement to continue growing and simply fill up with nameless strangers who stay off-camera. From a narrative perspective, I agree that it makes sense to focus down to only the handful of people closest to Nathan.

Speaking of which, I'd love to see more Asahi. If that guy had been with Nathan's group, the PvP would have been a complete victory and Alexander would still be alive.

** Another new game facet unlocked, but one we all knew was coming.

Obviously, chasing down and ending their last enemy is a huge priority. Once this is done, Iliya needs to be helped.

Instant death seems to have a mechanism involving a connection between the brain and the heart. When this is broken, either by severing the head, or else by sufficient damage to the neck, heart, or brain, the creature immediately pixelates.

Depending on the award for PvP, healing Iliya by gaining a Physical stat will probably be possible, but will cause horrible scarring. /First Aid I/ could help with this, but would take some time and EPs that Nathan currently lacks.

Nathan is very close to being able to pick up /First Aid II/. NP awards for PvP have got to be substantial, and they've just defeated five, maybe six (the runner should count) enemy players.

- It's likely the game will give them 5+ NPs and a random reward for their first PvP encounter on top of this.

- On top of this, there is almost certainly a per-player NP award.

- /Wood Mastery I/ skill should grant Nathan 2+ additional NPs and bump his Mental stat to 124.

- /Camouflage I/ (pretty theoretical) skill will hopefully do the same, raising Mental to 125.

- Nathan would then be able to obtain /First Aid II/ skill, reducing the cost. If it scales down like /Attack Up II/, the cost would drop from 20 down to 16 EPs.

- Alternatively, Lilly could apply analgesic mush to Iliya's face, gain /First Aid I/ skill, and activate that on Iliya. She probably lacks the EPs as well, though, since she created the outhouse and used her defensive skills in the fight.

- Maybe both could activate /First Aid I/ together, allowing them to pool EPs?

There are eight long borders between species, so I'd also be surprised if this is the region's first PvP encounter.

******* I'm really not getting that vibe. The human population of the Arena is continuing to go through a collapse. There are two achievements we've seen, and only one - the Obelisk of Fire - goes to Team Human. We don't know about the other four implied obelisks, but we've seen at least one other species is aggressively exploring the region.

The frogmen themselves don't seem particularly impressive, but still appear to be physically superior to humans. Their strength is on-par with ours, and they have better natural weapons and armor.

******** Not only did they get the Obelisk of Fire, it was in the Human section to begin with, which seems like a huge bonus.

And they built the first building.

As I wrote in a previous thread, either the other races are getting achievements we haven't heard about or guessed, or humans are either very lucky or very awesome (fuck yeah! :/ )

********* The first building is only a benefit for those humans who participated in it, not the entire region's members of the species. (Side note: they really need to recruit more people to create their settlement. This will give more people the reward, give new people the one-time 5 NP bonus for contributing to a building, and finally, reduce the NP cost per person to make a settlement.)

Now that we have a better idea of what region 14's layout is from Ava's /Maps I/ skill, we know that there are eight racial starting areas arranged around a central area with the dungeon.

Naively, the odds are about 62.5% that a species' starting area would include an Obelisk. It's still incredible fortune that Nathan and his crew happened across one when they did, and that it was as close as it was to their camp.

*********** The human players we see don't know about any other 1st-time benefits obtained by anyone else of any species in the region. They only know about the first building and Obelisk of Fire. There isn't much there to inform an opinion about who is getting the most rewards.

Regarding /Buildings I/:

- Frogmen don't need shelter, especially if they sleep in or under water, or not at all. Other species may also simply not need buildings the way we soft-skinned humans do.

- Competitors could be hyper-aggressive, having the attitude that they will simply take what they need from others.

- Competitors of huge size may be so desperate for food that they must constantly hunt.

- Competitors could be faring even less well than humanity. Smaller, less physical beings could well have been eradicated by the first Horned Beaver to spawn on them.

Heck, the only reason humanity even tried building shelter in the first place is Harrison's desire to get himself a little love shack.

The game /is/ rigged to favor humanity. Tygerion is human, and may well know something about the competitors. This is part of the overall plot, much like Nathan's knowledge of game balance and design.

*********** As the author, I won't confirm anything one way or the other or even say if I'm misleading or not, but will put some ideas out there based on what the players know or don't know, so I won't spoil anything.

If there is a 12.5% chance of the humans gaining any one particular achievement (1 out of 8 competitors), that means there is a 87.5% chance that any other given achievement will go to a different alien species, all else being equal. Since there hasn't been a single notification regarding anything any other alien group has been doing, its very possible, statistically likely even, that humans just don't receive notifications about aliens and their achievements. Of course, until they receive confirmation either way, its up in the air. Tygerion's game design style tends to air on the side of making the players figure things out for themselves.

About the only theory crafting about achievements that happens in the text is by Maya, who suggests that the aliens are likely gaining their own achievements too since humans hadn't gotten a first reward for anything else before buying a building (not counting the Obelisk mini-game).

We've only seen one of the seven enemy species so far and they weren't pushovers. They had an array of combat skills which they didn't hesitate to use, two gladius style swords not seen yet, strong natural defenses, and some stealth abilities the humans don't have or had no idea even existed. That's all the human players, and by extension the readers, know yet in how they compare to their rivals.

****** I've been thinking over the frogmen. The crocodilian features - claws and teeth - suggest they're carnivores. A food foraging party makes sense - but they were not following the creek to get crayfish. The nearby forest is human starting territory.

The most sensible explanation I can come up with for the frogmen's activity is for them to be /hunting humans/. Securing their border might also be sensible, but they seemed fairly oblivious. Maybe their senses aren't as good as a human's?

Edit: Oh, whoops I forgot he used Snare, so he's only at 10 EP, meaning it will be ~15 minutes until he can use First Aid, unless the rewards were enough for him to level it up like you said.

**** Iliya herself may be able to learn and use /First Aid I/, but it would be incredibly traumatic, and she'd have to somehow avoid picking up a new physical skill (which the game may simply reward for winning a PvP encounter).

/<Element> Mastery I/ is looking like a big priority for pretty much everyone.

- In particular, /Equipment Fusion I/ skill will probably produce even higher quality weapons while reducing the skill's cost.

- /Buildings I/ may well see a reduction in EP cost for collapsing structures for movement as well as initial activation.

- /Advanced Healing I/ may see an increase in the healing rate acceleration.
