*** The protagonist is a 400-year-old necromancer who has survived for so long by keeping his head down. His body is failing him, and immortality is impossible without becoming a lich (which The Holy Kingdom™ would immediately detect and destroy), so his plan is to transfer his soul to the body of a prince of The Holy Kingdom™.

As for the plot, I enjoyed it.
