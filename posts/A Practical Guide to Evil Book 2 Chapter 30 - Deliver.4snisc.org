Do you know if the writer has a blog, or has written anything else?

**** I've written a few other things, but nothing worth public attention - and though I have another novel project I've been tinkering with for a few years, it's on the backburner until the Guide is done. Don't have a blog.

** I've just spent the past... bit over four? hours reading this from the start to current chapter. Recommend to the gills.

** Good chapter. Totally called that the big one wasn't the real target. Looks like Hakram came into his first aspect... which is worrisome, considering all the corruption being spread and what happened to Catherine's third aspect.

I may have forgotten if it was mentioned, but does the corruption continue even if the demon is killed? Presumably the answer is "yes," but is the corruption different from the demon itself, or will the demon "live" as long as the corruption exists, able to remanifest itself?

** <laughs> Called it! (Internally/Mentally correctly guessing the true reveal at the end from the moment they came to a flawed conclusion.)
