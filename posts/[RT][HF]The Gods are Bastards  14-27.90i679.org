** Gabriel is by far my favorite viewpoint character. Realistically flawed but aware of his own faults, has gone through quite a lot of personal growth over the course of the series, has an interesting and diverse fighting style, and is generally just funny/sassy. He was absolutely terrified last chapter, and managed to work up the courage here to confirm that his special scythe does not in fact kill gods.

Fross is second best, in large part because she complained about being stereotyped as an exposition fairy early on, claiming those aren't a real thing, before making it her full time job to be a fairy that spouts exposition.

I'm glad that the story has narrowed its focus onto a smaller cast of characters. I did find following Darling interesting, and the enforcer dude with the rest of Justinian's suicide squad was somewhat entertaining, but I don't think we needed to follow the new freshman group, and cutting down on side chapters makes the plot go much faster. The sophomore class should retain the spotlight, because they are the most interesting characters in the story, along with Tellwryn.

** A little closer to figuring out what Elilial's beef with the Pantheon is.

Izara also didn't contradict her regarding what Toby and Triss were likely to do once they found out the truth, which suggests that it was something fairly morally repugnant, albeit probably necessary from the Pantheon's perspective.

I only think it might not be that because, supposedly (I don't recall which character noted this, so I might be wrong), they set out to just take down the Infinite Order, and they ascended accidentally, even unwillingly in a some cases.

From context, I think whatever happened was after they became gods and the Elder Wars ended.

**** Leavign aside the retcons, like when they swapped the fundemental mechanics of magic from the whole "Mind interfacing with reality" (which I don't think was an bad move fromt he story perspective, since that was dumb, but is a very clear example of this)?

There's how much magical power constantly changes from scene to scene as the biggest offender imo. The story /cannot/ make up its mind on that; Tellwyrn is so strong the empire's strategy is to leave her alone! But she always backs down from conflicts with them because they're too strong from her! But we can't afford to piss her off! But let's do that!

Paladins are also a huge offender with this. Trissany is an incredibly powerful warrior, as long as it's not mid plot, at which point her skills vanish and she hasn't won a fight since, like book two or so. Toby is the reverse of this, in which he's a pacifist up until he's a martial artist that never loses in combat situations, and then reverses at a moments notice. Mostly this part is overshadowed by the narration lying, though, particularly since the two are usually entwined.

#+end_quote

If by that you mean the established characters do things that are in character? Most things they've been doing lately is either because of a bullshit quest (which has been hinted at for ages) or the power plays between established powers. I guess the robot snake could apply but that was really just an obstacle, not really important to what was happening.

#+begin_quote
  The characters do not solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources
#+end_quote

Not really true either, there are a lot of actions by non-POV characters though so I suppose it's a valid criticism but nowhere near as bad as you're portraying it.

#+begin_quote
  the fictional world has does not have consistent rules
#+end_quote

Uhm...what? The entire world follows very clearly defined rules to the point where there are classroom scenes explaining how the magic and various things work. Even the power structures are clearly defined and their resources are detailed. The only exception is literal divine intervention and even then there are a lot of consistent rules for them.

Could you provide some examples for what you're trying to say? I don't know if I've overlooked big things or if you're just making up stuff because you don't like the story.

**** While established characters follow their natures pretty well, TGAB often makes liberal use of the idiot ball. A lot of people we're repeatedly told are very smart do very dumb things, pretty much any time plotting or statecraft is involved people take massive risks for poor reasons, and a ton of powers are introduced that nobody ever uses in a remotely creative fashion. Also people monologue too much. It's still a good story though.

****** Shadow jumping is an obvious one. Basically nobody in TGAB uses combat teleportation, or takes advantage of the fact that shadow jumping obviates basically every common security measure the Tiraan empire uses and makes planting bombs trivial. Basically every plan Embras Mogul comes up with risks most of his organization and gains him nothing. We're constantly told that Tellwryn is a badass who can outgun basically everyone and we literally never see her do that. Also the fact that half the cast knows Justinian is supposedly some sort of big bad and nobody does anything about it. Plausible deniability doesn't work when every major power knows you're up to something, including half the Gods you supposedly represent.

Additionally, Tiraas has had some trouble in the past when cults declared war on each other and that's definitely what would happen if the king/a couple of paladins decided to take down the arch pope without proof.

It's also important to note that, basically, the only practitioners of shadow magic learn it so that they don't get magic demon cancer. It might have been in the story but I imagine it isn't easy to master.

******* I'm pretty sure all of those have been addressed though.

- The circles of interaction make shadow jumping in industrialized or militarized areas an unattractive option: What happens when the infernal energies at your destination get eaten by some nearby arcane automation or even just disrupted by a fairy lamp? If you're careful there won't be any issues but when you're dealing with the heat of combat on top of the inherent focus necessary to channel the infernal without getting a terminal illness or permanent debuff, you're just asking for trouble. We do see strategic shadow jumping used in combat though. The Rogue Shade and Chase use combat teleportation to some limited degree, though both of them were granted level infinity +1 Warlock powers by godlike forces.

- Embras Mogul's plans - we can't really know anything about his actual plans and goals until the story is wholly over. Everything he says is suspect and should be considered to have at least 3 layers of lies built into it - He's the high priest of the goddess of deception for crying out loud. We can't assume that we've seen any of his actual plans either, at least until his long cons come to fruition.

- Tellwyrn - First, She's the strongest individual, but all the other forces in the world work in groups. Second, her goal is to teach - the rational choice for attaining that goal is to let her students deal with it and only step in if they can't handle it. We also see her using 'evaluation' type spells and toys all the time, so it's pretty likely she knows the abilities of everyone involved at any given time to make a good judgement call on whether the matchup is acceptable or not. Third, her badassery is strictly limited to brute force. Most of the challenges we see her facing that can be solved by that particular hammer get solved within the space of a paragraph, but they're all over the place.

- Justinian - None of the main or secondary cast knows that, except Justinian himself and a few close followers. Some tertiary characters have mentioned it, but never in enough detail for the main cast to necessarily understand the weight of the implications there. Those tertiary characters who do know are shown treating him as their primary priority. As for the gods themselves, several chapters have been dedicated to how mortals can exploit their natures and blind spots (Look for it especially in the Basra chapters). The Gods literally can't know because he's exploiting the same flaws that Basra has been, at minimum, though he's likely made a much more in-depth study on the subject. Multiple gods whose aspects imply self-reflection or understanding have implied that they noticed something was off about Justinian, and Izara has even directly interfered with his schemes, at least to the extent that the built-in limitations of godessness allow.

*TLDR:*

Shadow Jumping - The most common type of magic is a hard counter to tactical uses, and anyone dumb enough to not realize it dies of hellcancer.

Embras - He's lying dude. Even his lies are designed to trick you into false conclusions if you see through them. His job description is "#1 best deceiver in the world"

Tellwyrn - Her weakness is when opponents use teamwork. Her motivations make "let my students gain experience" the most rational choice.

Justinian - For the mortals, it's called [[http://typesofirony.com/dramatic-irony/][dramatic irony]]. They know less than you seem to think. For the gods, turns out it's easy to manipulate them. See the Basra chapters for more detail on one method to do so.

******** First off, shadow Jumping isn't an infernal magic. That's explicitly mentioned, in fact; they're shadow magiic, which is a catch all term for the minor magical fields not of the main four.

Tellwyrn almost never solves problems with brute force, even the ones that she could easily do so. There's also the fact that every non brute force solution proposed by anyone, including her, is either idiotic or the result of reading off the script rather than based on info they have.

Or for the really bad ones, trapping them on an island that can't be reached/escaped through normal means.

Take book 12, for instance; she even comments how she can't kill one of the villains because, oh no, she'd get in trouble with the empire. The Empire. The empire that's so scared of her that it's policy is to leave her alone. She never* once actually does anything meaningful to the plot with that power.

********* I think you are confusing 'brute force' with 'lethal force', using brute force to solve a problem doesn't equal killing it dead, it means using hard power to solve the problem, like walking into a temple and threatening to destroy one of their most sacred artifacts, or threatening to behead a priest and teleporting their holy place across the continent, or by sending someone inconvenient for you to an island that is so completely cut off from the rest of the world that they definitely won't bother you for awhile. Telwyrn solves /most/ of her problems like this, she rarely takes the path of explaining something or doing something circumspect when her awesome magical powers work just fine.

Trissiny is in a similar situation, she may not have killed anyone... except like 50+ centaurs sentient enough to use magic in volume 1, and a group of off duty guards trying to kidnap a child in loranaris, and a whole /bunch/ of the white riders in sarasio, and a certain priestess of /her own faith/ dumb enough to kill her friend in front of her... Oh wait, she has killed people, like a lot. She often downright ignores the circumspect root in favour of charging straight ahead, she goes to the guild to learn how to see the circumspect root at all, because she has divine compulsion in the back of her head roaring at her to chase and kill the evil she sees, and she succeeds, she learns that brute force and Lethal force aren't the same, and that understanding the correct application of brute force means less of a chance to require lethal force.

Toby, the only time we have seen Toby use Lethal force (not brute force) is when he has absolutely no other option, or when his god literally gives him no choice, and every time he does it he is broken up about it for /ages/ afterwords. Toby is one of the least developed characters in the series, but in almost all of his chapters he is full of self doubt and conflicted that he often has to resort to violence, he is shown to almost never consider his own well being above another's, he is compassionate to a fault, so much so that I'm surprised he hasn't gotten himself in more trouble yet.

The fact that Teal is a shit bard has been /directly called out/ by the god of bards himself, the story acknowledges and punishes her for this flaw (she was warned that if she didn't get her protagonist hat off then those closest to her would suffer...), and if she continues to act this way I imagine it will only get worse for her.

Most of your objections to the characters are either blatantly incorrect or are in ignorance of their character development/progression and it's effect on the story.

********** As I allude to above, the issue isn't that Tellwyrn never uses brute force. She manifestly does. It's that she never actually does anything plot relevant with it, ever*. I think book 12 is the biggest example there but tellwyrn just has a habit of... letting things happen, for no ic reason, despite her aforementioned brute force.

I don't remember it ever saying that trissany killed the centaurs. If so, it was definitely a case of telling, though; On screen, trissany just doesn't do any of that. Take a look at the trissany centric chapter in book 11; in there, her attempts to be clever and her attempts to straight fight both fail embarrassingly.

No way does that describe Toby. I challenge you to stop reading the narration, and start reading what the characters /actually do/. Look at toby in the pirate city idr what it's called, puja dara iirc? Kid spends basically the entire trip on his holier than thou, judgmental high horse.

The idea that there will be consequences is a joke. No one in TGaB ever has permanent consequences unless they're a minor character.

*********** *you need to read something properly if you intend to criticize it properly.

You are simply ignoring plot points and events because you don't want to acknowledge them, Trissiny kills a lot of people as the series goes ( 2-18 [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/11/19/2-18/]] Trissiny killing centaurs on screen) she is shown to be an skilled fighter in many scenes and she is doing her best to progress from just a skilled combatant to an intelligent one.

Telwyrn has a habit of dealing with things her way, and sometimes that is letting them play out, she does things the forceful way otherwise, such as inviting the Kitsune to be clever so she doesn't have too, or by blowing up an air ship while falling from a dragon, or by ignoring a threat until shows it's face so she can /punch/ it ( 12-32 [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/12-32/]] Telwyrn using brute force to solve a relevant problem)

Toby acts like Toby in Puna Dara, he does his best to follow his friends, then when he sees things going in a different way than he would like he changes things, by casting incredibly powerful holy magic and healing everyone. He acts Holier than thou because he *is* holier than them, he is a fucking paladin, he is holy by definition, do you consider any of his specific actions to be /wrong/?

Is her lover falling into a perpetual, basically incurable slumber for months not a consequence? Or your only idea of lasting consequences death?

You accuse me of not reading the same books as you in one comment and then blatantly admit to skipping bits in the another, I have read the series up to the last chapter of volume 13, and unless you can give me a chapter number for your criticisms than you just aren't making an argument.

************ No I don't. I read 10 books straight up, then another 2 or so on and off. That's more than enough for me to tell you that no, this series isn't rational; not just with pattern recognition, but with almost complete certainty. That's like trying to tell me I can't say harry potter isn't rational without reading the deathly hollows, or that a fanfic isn't rational by the time I drop it a few chapters in for stupidity; whether or not a work is rational or not should be (and is) completely obvious by that point.

A perpetual sleep that lasts for months is not what I would call a permanent consequence, no. You said yourself that it was temporary, and if I recall the scene in question from my skimming (that was the one they had to get hellhound breath to cure, tight?) it lasted less than a book.

Death isn't the only permanent consequence, but the lack of it is a /huge/ issue since it happens to absolutely no one despite them being described as entering risky and life threatening situations all the time. Whenever one of the charachters talks bout how dangerous a situation is, I rolled my eyes and skipped over there speech because it's just hot air. The cast is in the dozens of characters. With one important person, it's acceptable that they manage to defy the odds because of the anthropic principle of stories. With this, however, its simply ludicrous. Even goddamn dragonball has larger, longer lasting consequences to major charachters, it it has a literal problem-fixing deus-ex-machina in its /name/.

***** Of note, characters don't follow their natures.

You know trissany, miss headstrong elite combatant "I use fighting to solve my problems, and need character growth to start using my intelligence instead?" If you reread the books, that's all lies. Trissany hasn't killed any sentient in all the books so far, she's always shown onscreen trying to solve her problems via diplomacy, and she's overall shown to be quite caring and second guessing herself /in the same scenes that the narratoris calling her headstrong and thrill seeking/.

Tellwyrn is supposedly powerful - effectively unstoppable, in fact - with basically every arcane wizard power, from plane shifting to evocation to teleportation. She has never once done something plot relevant with that power*, and always lets villains just taunt her, leave, and get away with it.

Teal is a "bard." A bard that plays no music, tells no stories, and does no other bardic activities on screen except once during the dungeon crawl, which accomplishes little and is promptly forgotten by her. But, as the narration will constantly remind you, she's an excellent bard, she's in the music program, she's really into it honest.

Toby, unlike his narrative description, is an incredibly militant and judgmental douche who's everything narrative!trissany is accused of being, except he never acknowledges it or changes it and is praised for his compassion.

Essentially every character has this.

They make a point of claimign that intelligent action is needed, but this is completely undercut by the fact that a) essentially every successful character is an idiot, and b, when characters like Trissany do try intelligent solutions it just fails. The only "cleverness" that gives results is the "cleverness" of the villains reading off the script.

Aside from all the retcons, you mean? And the fourth wall breaking (jenny everywhere?)? Yeah, everyone acts within their IC abilities, because their limitations are never defined except as the plot demands.
