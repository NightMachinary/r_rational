Probably the most common superpower in fiction is super strength (along with super durability, stamina, reflexes, etc.) but it's also one of the most boring. Other than sticking a superhuman in a hamster cage to generate perpetual power, how can super strength be used rationally?


** The funniest thing about super strength to me is that, with invulnerability, you actually shouldn't bother punching things if you want to cause more damage... you should poke them.

If you focus more of the energy of your hit into a much smaller area, like a poke, you would cause far more damage. The reason average people don't do it is because their fingers would break or bend.

*** Imagine Superman facing down General Zod so that the human race doesn't become enslaved.

The dramatic music starts playing, the lights dim, Supes and Zod square up and raise their arms. Then they each extend their index finger.

The next scene is entirely in slow-mo, to illustrate their superspeed as they feint, parry, riposte, and try to secure a lethal poke. Eyes are blazing red as they circle around, testing each other's footwork and even taking to the skies as fingers come from all directions.

Finally, a brief moment of distraction has Supes' finger pressed against Zod's throat. A small moment of hesitation, then Superman steels himself, and yells (in superspeed, there's no way he can make the speech in normal time):

In pretty much everything the superman and the pals just knock everyone and their heads don't just explode like they should.

But maybe a guy with super strenght should use a throwing weapon instead? Especially if he does not have super speed to go with it so he can't close the gap? But on the other hand they could just use a gun. The great equalizer.

****** Because their strength isn't universally increased; those we consider the "strongest" are typically bodybuilders or others focused on lifting strength. But running is ALSO dependent on muscle strength, just different muscles. There's an element of technique too, of course, but if the maximum force your muscles are capable of outputting is uniformly increased, that should include the muscles used to run, allowing much greater top speeds.

I don't see any sensible interpretation that allows for super strength kicks but does not allow for greater maximum running speed.

******* Thing is, super strength often does not actually increase muscle mass in relation to strength. Otherwise supers would be way too buff, instead of just chiseled like superman.

My interpretation is that super strength and speed is basically magic, as in not really related to physics. If it was physics, super speed would be too fast for the body and would need other magics like Flash's speedforce bubble to protect him.

And a magic to increase lifting and punching power doesn't have to have same effects as a magic to increase movespeed.

But as far as I know, people have two types of muscles, fast and slow. And it could be that speed works on fast ones and strength on slow ones, so that could work too. At least on technobabble level.

******** Thing is, fast twitch muscles are also used for punching and kicking. So unless you want your superhero to have normal human punches but be really good at lifting stuff, that excuse doesn't fly. The inverse excuse COULD help explain a superhero who's fast (but probably not to speedforce levels) and can hit hard, but can't lift heavy stuff, which works a little better.

I don't see the need to try and figure out a way for super strength to work without implying some degree of super speed. It's not like it makes purely speed focused supers useless; the levels of super speed that super strength implies are far below those of someone like the Flash, and it doesn't necessarily come with the requisite super-reflexes required to make full use of that speed. But if all you need to do is close the distance really quickly or cover a long distance in a relatively straight path, max speeds should definitely be higher than peak human.

As for the "It's magic, don't question it" approach, well, I don't like it. Even when it's literally magic I analyze it and try to find hard rules. It's sanderson's first law of magic; an author's ability to satisfyingly solve a problem with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic. So even if we say that super strength is magic and can in some ways violate the known laws of physics, for this to be able to be used to satisfyingly resolve a plot, it at least must do so in specific and predictable ways, not just do whatever the plot requires with no way of saying it definitely can or cannot do something. Moreover, we're on [[/r/rational]], a community I think is probably much less inclined to accept the "it's just magic, don't question it" explanation than most.

They wouldn't be normal. It would be like getting hit by an unmovable object. A normal fist is pretty much fast enough to kill a person already. With super strength the fist wouldn't slow down much when hitting something if hitter has a good stance. And important thing with hitting things with your fist is to try hitting through it, not stopping to hit when you touch the target. Then again, if your hand can't handle it, you shouldn't hit that hard anyway.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Just a bit above peak human is very barely superspeed. Lets remember that peak human speed has been rising all the time. Speed would have to be pretty quick to be considered super, and probably multiple times human to be useful as a main power.

And still a normal body wouldn't be able to handle that stress.

#+begin_quote

I never intended to go there. Clearly Superman and Flash has some magic going on. Otherwise Supes would not keep his muscles when he loses his powers if his power came from the muscles. Flash has clearly supernatural speedforce too and is not always very muscular. Other people like Lana Lang has also gotten Superman's strength without gaining any visible muscularity.

I never meant to say not to analyze them, just that it's often clearly magic and not admitting that would probably give a bad analysis.

** The thing about super strength is that it's a power that machines already have - strong engines and motors can lift and move things even elephants wouldn't be able to. A person with super strength might still have an advantage in applying that strength with precision, though; a human hand is extremely dexterous when compared to a backhoe or a crane. Ironically, one of the best things to do with super strength in the modern world might be to become an artist and work with materials and at scales a normal person couldn't.

If an mc can replace a hoist or crane with her bare hands that's a huge advantage and a few of these can have huge impacts on their region's macroeconomics. I'm just not sure it's an interesting enough focus for a story.

**** You can't actually lift that much weight even with unlimited strength because you'll destroy the ground you are standing on when all of that weight settles on your feet, plus it would be impossible to actually maintain your balance long enough to center it over your head. Same thing for pushing, hitting, throwing heavy things etc. Someone with super strength doesn't really have the mass or surface area to use their strength effectively even with the invulnerability caveat due to the limitations of friction, inertia, the strength of materials, etc. They're essentially limited by physics to only using their strength to a fairly low level. They'd have one hell of a firm handshake though. Honestly I think the artistic take is really the most actual practical use you'd get. I mean, there are certain things they could do well in manufacturing but unless you have an army of them it isn't worth the additional overhead and headaches a couple special cases will cause rather than just doing everything the same way in all of your plants.

** Another avenue for making super strength more interesting for a rational, creative protagonist is making certain that there are multiple forms of super strength with different mechanisms and limitations ala the Parahumans series. Like a forcefield that can take any hit once before breaking and reforming after a momentary delay, or having the ability to massively expand your muscles while regenerating in the process, or having a field of vastly slowed time permeating your entire body that you can somehow move normally within. There are a lot of ways to make strength more interesting.

Get some engineers to design a human-powered aircraft for you. Your power output should simplify things.

Fighting crime is riskier, not only in a risk of dying way, but also in the fact that you'd depend on other factors like public perception and the heavy punishments to your popularity if you failed even once.

** A very significant problem with exerting super strength is leverage and inertia. For instance, you're limited in how fast you could run or jump by friction with the ground, and material strength of the surfaces and objects you interact with. In some ways it bears similarities to a normal human in zero G, in that you primarily have your own mass, inertia, and leverage via grip to work with.

For combat don't punch or kick, grapple. Then you can hold on with one hand and kick or punch with another limb, or just use both hands and twist or tear. Additionally, thowing small heavy dense objects like large ball bearings or dense stones may be useful.

For fast movement, dig your fingers into the ground or other surface and throw yourself in the desired direction, or pick up dense heavy objects like stones and throw them in the opposite of your desired vector.

To move heavy or dense things, employ cables, straps, and levers. Think of yourself as a crane or a forklift.

** Hmm... in terms of combat applications, specially made bows and crossbows might be useful. After all, in real life, draw weight is limited by the limits of human strength. Someone with super strength would be able to draw bows and crossbows that a normal person could not. Then again, I have to assume there's a limit to how effective this would be, considering that as far as I can tell you could accomplish the same thing by adding a powerful motor, and as far as I know that's not a widespread weapon. If the issues making its use limited are based on the weight or fuel costs of the motor though, or if the super strength is great enough to exceed what is practical with motors (and there are materials that can support that) then it might still be viable here where no motor is required. But it's also possible that we simply don't have materials with the right properties to make this worth using over firearms. I don't know enough about the topic to say one way or another.

Despite the fact that the weight is less of a concern for you, I think that heavy armor may still be inadvisable even if there are materials strong enough to take your super strength. Throwing around as much force as someone with super strength can is going to generate a lot of heat, and assuming you're not especially resistant to heat, that means cooling needs to be a priority. Depending on the degree of super strength (and degree of resistance to the heat generated by it, as well as the efficiency of the strength itself), this may mean as little as wearing clothes that breathe well, or it may require active cooling solutions to facilitate safe use of greater degrees of strength.

** Tungsten ball bearings in a big mittful with a full-power throw delivered by someone with enhanced strength is probably at least as damaging as a shotgun blast, if not more. In a pinch just stomp the ground and throw small bits of rock. There's a reason bombs are deadly and shrapnel is a lot of it.

If you're fighting a lot of not superhumanly though opponents, this scene from [Citadel] showing a fight between a guy with super strength and a guy who can create fully autonomous clones of himself connected by a Hive mind. It underlines the ridiculous amount of damage you can do with super strength, durable cables with weights on the end, and momentum:

  ... Achala stopped running when he reached the center of the room but he didn't stop moving.

  He gave a little flick of his wrists, then Achala was holding a pair of... jump ropes? The Hectors outside were too far to see in detail and the ones inside had their vision obscured by their gas masks. Each had a small handle with a thin cord attaching it to a weight about the size of a gumball.

  Achala spun them, one in each hand, in circles that never quite intersected but covered all of the area around him. The cords stretched out about fifteen feet. Every Hector within that area died in seconds, cut limb from limb as the cord or the weight passed through their bodies without resistance.

Take something flat and wide, like a shovel or just plank of wood and depending on the strength you have and the size of the tool, you can create walls of wind. With enough strength you could create tornado- and hurricane-force winds.

Similarly, water. With the right size of tool and enough strength, you could generate gigantic waves similar to tidal waves or the ones generated in tropical storms.

Actually, because water doesn't compress very well, I wonder if possibly you can run on water just by taking heavy enough steps with super strength. Someone call a physicist!

Speaking of water, purse your lips super tight and leave the tiniest gap you possibly can, now blow water out of that in a jet and if you're strong enough and durable enough to widthstand it yourself, you'll create a waterjet like they use to cut through multiple-inch-thick pieces of metal.

Never enter a room with hostiles via the door. Go around to an adjacent room and walk/run/bust through the wall to enter from an area they aren't considering. Or the floor, floor's always good. No matter where you come from, works better when there aren't hostages.
