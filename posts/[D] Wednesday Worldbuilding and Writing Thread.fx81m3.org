Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I've been trying to write this fight scene, but I've gotten kind of stuck, and I think it's due to my lack of knowledge about how fighting actually works. Maybe somebody here will have advice.

== Short question ==

If you have an injured leg, and your opponent has an injured leg, how does that impact your tactics? This in the context of unarmed, hand-to-hand combat.

More meta, does anybody know a good resource for these sorts of questions?

== Long question ==

Okay, so what I'm trying to write is the following: my MC and her friend both have an injured leg. They are both skilled combatants who enjoy testing themselves against each other (with the friend being more skilled) and they decide to test their skills against each other in their injured states. This is meant to accomplish:

- Demonstrate how my MC thinks about the efficiency of her movement when she can't walk on one leg
- Illustrate how both characters have little regard for their own safety, recklessly jumping into a fight when they ought to be letting their legs heal
- Illustrate how both characters have little regard for the others' safety, ruthlessly trying to win, capitalizing on the other's injury even if it would risk hurting them, even though it's just a practice match.
- Show that my MC really just wants to just beaten up because she's a masochist.

Anyway, I think I can do most of that headspace stuff. What I /can't/ do is write 2 sentences about how the circumstances affect my characters' tactics in the match. Really, I'd be pretty happy with 2 non-sucky sentences on this. I could write,

#+begin_quote
  I shifted my stance to account for my bad leg
#+end_quote

but that's vague and says basically nothing. I presume that I could write something along the lines of,

#+begin_quote
  His right leg was broken, so it would beneficial to approach from the right/left, and he knew that and would be defending against it [mind games ensue]
#+end_quote

But which is it, right or left? Or neither, and the considerations are actually just much deeper than anything I, an inexperienced person, could conceive of while sitting on my couch? (Probably that last one.)

I've tried googling around various issues, but I've gotten absolutely nothing, probably because sensible people don't actually fight with injured legs. I know this sort of question isn't the usual for this thread, but does anybody have any advice, either on this specific question, or general comments about writing a scene of this nature?

*** One answer is that they could kick at each other's injured legs. But attacking an injury like that seems sort of dickish; I'm screwing up my opponent's recovery and not practicing anything that will be super effective against a normal opponent.

Instead, I'd have them circle each other, and play with distance.

Consider an exchange that's as trivial as: I step diagonally towards you, putting me outside of your guard. I kick at your side with my injured leg. You block, step back (bringing us back to starting distance) and then do the same to me.

There's a sense in which this is a no-op; neither of us is gaining or losing ground.

But, underneath that, we're trading pain. I step (ouch!) and kick (ouch!). And then rather than try to catch my leg or close, you're showing me that you can endure an exactly equal amount of pain.

Anything other than mirroring me would be merciful since, regardless of who wins the spar, a tap means that we can both stop walking around on injured legs.

MMA is a good place to go for this sort of thing. Generally speaking, hand-to-hand fights end up on the ground and then the person who is the best at fighting on the ground will win, and it's usually not close once it gets to the ground assuming one person has skill/experience on the ground and the other doesn't.

Assuming two unskilled people, I'd see one getting on top of the other and beating the shit out of their head.

#+begin_quote
  They are both skilled combatants
#+end_quote

What are they skilled in? Is it the same discipline or different? This will inform it. I'd recommend watching clips from UFC 1, 2, 3, 4 and you can see a karate guy fighting a sumo wrestler, etc, to see how different disciplines might match up IRL.

How ethical are they? Head butts are very effective in combat but very likely to injure your opponent permanently, so they're illegal in MMA. Ditto eye poking, sticking fingers in mouths, hitting the kidneys, dropping people on their head, etc.

You're saying broken legs. That's.... hideously reckless. Like, almost unrealistically so. There's a scene in one of the Jurassic Park novels where Malcolm says that a black belt in karate can kill someone with his bare hands but the karate training gives you the experience / knowledge / empathy / etc to not to want to kill someone with your bare hands. Obviously this isn't actually true but it is in a purely illustrative sense: high level fighting training gives you an appreciation of how fragile the body is and how long injuries take to heal and how debilitating they can be. If it's possible for the injury to not literally be a broken leg, that'd be a good idea.

--------------

If you want two sentences, here's my attempt at writing it. If they're both Present Day people who are learning to fight in mainstream gyms, MMA is a very popular "discipline" to learn, so you can probably work with this.

I'm not an expert and I hate writing fighting too so this is a writing exercise for me as much as anything else

--------------

My right leg was killing me: I couldn't believe I'd done this again, let myself be so stubborn and reckless as to do something like this. And the worst thing was, she was as stubborn as me, and even more skilled. I watched her front leg: I knew she'd be aiming to strike my weak leg, just as I was fixing to strike hers. But I had a plan: she was the more skilled at stand-up, but she didn't know I'd been seeing a new coach for my ground game. I thought I might have a chance. I attempted a few leg kicks, one of them striking her swollen red thigh. Her face contorted into a satisfying wince. I feinted a few more kicks, and, when she was too focused on me pushing my advantage on her injured leg - and when she'd given me another two big shots in my own leg and a punch that was dangerously close to my liver - I shot in for the takedown. My time on the high school wrestling team paid off: I had her legs, pulled myself onto her, and was in half guard before she knew what had happened. I laughed, a combination of relief and bloodlust as I started punching her face in furious volleys. She grabbed one of my hands, trying to redirect my might, before pulling me close so I couldn't get enough space to land a big punch. Her face was bleeding, and I kept going. If we had a ref, they would have stopped us by now: but we didn't, and she lay there, not reacting as I kept punching.

Finally, I realised what I was doing: stupid pride. I sat there on top of her, trying to catch my breath. She looked up at me, her nose crooked in the nest of her bloodied face. I gave her a smile. She smiled back, as we both knew how insane this whole thing was. I helped her sit up, and she blew her nose. As bloodied mucus flew out of her, her eye swelled shut.

We started laughing again: we both knew that the last thing you did was blow your nose if you had the slightest suspicion it was broken.

We were idiots, through and through.

*** Here are my notes on your comment. I'm including them so that you can correct me where I've misunderstood you.

#+begin_quote
  Fight scene.

  2 combatants (POV and PART (for partner)), each with an injured leg.

  Each is maximizing for the best outcome in this fight.

  Unarmed combat.

  Constraints:

  1.) How does POV respond to injured leg in internal monolog?

  2.) How do combatants act when they aren't concerned with long term consequences of leg injury, but are both optimizing for winning the fight?

  3.) How do combatants act when they aren't concerned with long term consequences of the other's injury, but are instead optimizing for winning this fight?

  4.) How does POV act when they are a 'masochist.'

  [[/u/tjhance][u/tjhance]] is confident in 'headspace stuff,' but isn't confident in how that headspace stuff will affect the behaviors of the combatants.

  It seems to be that the main issue is in 'simulating' what an experienced fighter would do under the circumstances.

  Q: How to best write an engaging fight scene under the listed circumstances.
#+end_quote

Shit, yeah. That's tough, lol. It's a theme in HPMOR that playwrights must in a sense encompass their characters, such that you will be able to predict what they will do in any situation. So, it seems that you're asking the right questions, which is a great start.

It seems to me that in order to how a character would respond in Situation X, one must know how a character would respond in any given situation, which I think that we can break down into two separate parts.

1.) How would an experienced hand-to-hand combatant react in any given situation?

2.) How would a masochist react in any given situation?

For 1.) My best guess is to start studying a couple of MMA fights. * If you can internalize a few general principles of the field, then you've won. If you know, for instance (I'm not trained in MMA so this is only a hypothetical), that all fighters seek to drain their opponents stamina faster than their own, then you already have the 'win condition' for both your combatants. From the generalized 'win condition,' simplify that into the steps that each combatant would take while getting there. Once you're able to imagine what you would need to do to win a fight, you then add the fact that both you and an opponent have an injured leg. Remember, you're still trying to reach that win-condition. How must you change your approach with this new complication?

To generalize, the goal here is to take one big problem (how to simulate what a trained unarmed combatant would do in Situation X) and break it down into a series of slightly smaller problems (how to simulate what a trained fighter thinks will win any given match). Keep simplifying the problem over and over, and when you can isolate the core algorithm that the fighters use to make decisions, you've won.

For 2.) Second verse same as the first. What does a masochist do in any given situation? For this question, I would probably brush up on the evolutionary psychology of masochism (which I have n. Remember, the goal is to find that root algorithm. If you know the why behind why a masochist behaves; if you know the core goal in their behavior, then you'll know how to write your story such that a masochist must act in a particular way in order to satisfy their values.

Your question was super interesting and detailed, and so I couldn't help but interrupt my day in order to externalize these ideas. I hope that you're able to get something out of this, lol.

*[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FYgoHwzTIA]], is a video I found. I haven't watched it, but I imagine it might be a good conceptual starting point on research.

* Also, Miyamoto Musashi's The Book of Five Rings seems to be a popular (if somewhat esoteric) primer on how the field of swordplay can be translated to find a winning strategy on every field. It may or may not be helpful.

*** A lot of this, assuming skilled combatants will come down to style. Legs are a driving force for kinetic strikes be they with the hands or the feet (look at a few basic instructions in boxing or karate style punches if this isn't intuitive). In "soft" throw/grapple options legs are needed for maintining center of gravity (throws), or obtaining/maintaining purchase on the scrum of the ground.

To write this well you probably need to pick a final move used and move backwards to the injury that was overcome, make sure you understand both the physics of what was pulled off and why it /hurt/ (and potentially what long term injury was invited), so much to pull it off. From there you can back off to what the antagonist pulled off and what your MC did.

I don't hate to tell you to look at a Gray's anatomy and a few instructional videos on how to hit and where to hit and why, because the old adage write what you know. It sounds like you have a MC and foil who are skilled at mayhem, and no offence, you don't seem to be; the reasources I'd look at (in addition too the various suggestion for watching experts work) is the simple concepts so you can get a feel for why.

On a more visceral level getting your leg knee or ankle SNAFU in a fight, speaking as a tall wiry type who wants to capitalize on those items with the more robust sort, in sporting rules is game, they won, in the scrum it's take them to ground and fight dirty time, before you'd have a chance to screw up the other person's leg. If you can't stand on it: you aren't kicking with it or the other leg; throwing them is generally asking to fail a throw and be at a disadvantage when they grapple; and punching without footwork, just from core and arms, eh it's not good but maybe you have a bigger biceps/calves ratio.

TLDR: I'd suggest discarding the double leg injury, no is really going to go for a leg when down one against someone, (being down a leg isn't being down a rook or bishop, it's being down a queen knight/bishop and rook on a side) it's a call for calling the match as a concession or immediate escalation to impolite/debilitating/fatal dissassembly techniques

Disclaimer:I'm a enthusiastic amateur in the field of unarmed combat; my school required 3 classes I took the forth; I only know enough to keep out of or get out of trouble. Hand to hand is an odd duck when training people, reflexes happen a lot more than escalated purportional violence when in the ring, so the little trading I've given trends towards killing as the objective.

*** Answering this from personal and witnessed experience.

During stand-up fights, pretty much all power starts at the legs. If you can't plant your legs, your punches (especially female punches) aren't going to have any weight behind them.

With one good leg, you can plant it and throw a hard cross or hook, but your weight is going to end up on your bad leg so you better connect. Depending on the severity of the injury that could mean a slower recovery leaving room for a counterattack, or falling over altogether.

If your MC is markedly larger than her opponent or way better at grappling she'd probably want to lunge off her good foot and then tackle her opponent to the ground where she can leverage her size and the injured leg means less (not nothing, but less).

Forget about kicking, unless your MC is big into jumping kicks (a la karate kid) because you are either using the bad leg to kick or to plant and both are important. I had a match years ago where I broke my toe early on, which isn't even that crippling of an injury, and it basically ruined my kicks. Something more serious would've made a /meaningfully strong/ kick inpossible.

As a final aside, people can take more punishment than you'd expect and keep fighting. I watched a guy I knew break his collar bone in a wrestling match and continue for 5 long minutes, and that wasn't even life or death. That's one of the more painful bone breaks, too.

*** So the biggest issue I see with this is that under known physics, an FTL machine is necessarily a time machine as well. You could play with that, or just handwave it away, "our previous models of physics were wrong."

The two technologies that you mentioned seem very well suited to facilitating space travel. I could see a good story focusing on expansion into space, especially with an eye toward acquiring the classified material that enables anti-gravity (which I would make strangelets, 'cause those are neat).

Other generic sci-fi technologies which could be worth exploring include power generation (I would personally use zero-point energy rather than fusion), and force fields as you mentioned, as well as a teleporter.

*** A few possibilities come to mind:

- The ruler is expecting a battle against overwhelming odds, and lots of siege weaponry, so the castle would be a deathtrap for anyone who stays in it rather than helpful. The ruler abandons the castle to fall back and regroup with more allied forces.

- The ruler has very limited forces and is embarking on a mission to attack (or defend against an attack) on a crucially important person, place, or resource, and cannot spare even a token defense force to hold the castle (or the objective is of so much greater importance that the castle is negligible in comparison).

- The castle has been left as a deathtrap for the enemy. The water and/or food reserves have been poisoned, maybe intentionally as a baited trap. Or perhaps there is a secret entrance that the ruler will use to access the castle at night and butcher any enemy forces who try to occupy it.

*** This happened regularly in the crusades. Lords would take their men and go to the middle east, leaving their castle with their wives and a handful of guards.

There's also the "Empty Fort Strategy" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_Fort_Strategy]] where you try to fake out your opponent.

A related ruse would be to tell the castle garrison to make it look like there are a ton of guards still in the castle. Maybe they run around maintaining a bunch of distinct fires, so that the enemy sees the smoke of 20 cooking fires and assumes there are 100+ men inside the castle walls. Or the inside guards could get clever with their patrols to make it look like there are a lot of people.

This would make the enemy deploy their forces so they're able to respond to an big attack coming from inside the castle. Meanwhile, the actual army is somewhere else

*** In addition to Norseman's suggestions, rather than facing overwhelming odds the ruler could believe they are the one with an overwhelming advantage. If you think it very unlikely that anyone could sneak around your army or attack from some other direction, and you expect a quick, clean victory against whomever you are attacking, then it makes sense. Why leave 10% of your army behind if you are facing a seemingly easy battle and bigger advantage = statistically smaller losses? Generally speaking, if you bring 1000 men to attack 500, you will lose fewer soldiers than if you brought only 900.

That said, the ruler would probably be a bit arrogant if they did this, or at least a gambler. You never know when the enemy has an ace up their sleeve or someone else decides to backstab you.

Either give the lord a clear reason for bringing his entire force either give him an decisive advantage, make him a risk taker, or a clear disadvantage that he couldn't afford to leave many troops behind. 2.

** I'm trying to identify a pile of details for a setting where the people are notably better off than in the present, but can still be recognized as being a future iteration of present-day society. (I may not know how any of these would actually be accomplished, but I can still write Star Trek fanfiction even without knowing how to build a warp drive.) Not a paradise, but somewhere a good number of people from today's first-world societies might consider immigrating to.

Given the general shape of the points I've jotted down so far, can you think of any important aspects I'm forgetting?

- Some bad things happened. People fought back, and tried various ways to keep them from happening again, with varying levels of success and side-effects. The more successful approaches led to those groups becoming wealthier and more militarily effective, thus gaining international prestige, thus leading less-successful groups to try to emulate them.
- Standard economies include:

  - a Basic Universal Income (plus whatever further tweaks are needed to avoid any rampant inflation or other problems therefrom);
  - single-payer health-care (including dentistry, prescriptions, psych, etc);
  - effectively free tuition;
  - widespread unionization;

    - ? Possibly: Lots of worker-owned businesses;

  - national ministries of ombudsmen, embedded into the other ministries and able to accept complaints about them, without those complaints getting lost in internal processes that never find any fault by the bureaucrats;

    - police held accountable for their actions by non-police-dominated investigations;

  - significant surveillance of the finances of politicians and elected officials;
  - political tweaks to prevent regulatory capture, gerrymandering, capturing of courts by political parties;
  - strong anti-trust legislation;
  - rules against vulture capitalism;
  - externality costs that are currently offloaded onto the general public by capitalist corporations reloaded right back onto them, so that they can't extract private profit by making the world worse for the public as a whole;
  - actually-effective money-laundering prevention, even when dealing with international shenanigans (such as corporations claiming to be headquartered in Ireland when nearly-to-all of their business is conducted elsewhere);
  - a fairly low number of people earning more than, say, ten times the average salary of skilled professional engineers, doctors, or generals, and a near-total lack of billionaires;
  - personal privacy protections for average citizens at least as good as Europe's current GDPR, including effective anti-tracking regulations on the ad insdustry;
  - better understanding of how brains work, more widespread acceptance of neurodiversity (including diversenesses that we of the present-day are unaware of);
  - architecture generally including the principles of handicap/disability-focused design (much like how subtitles and wheelchair ramps have improved the lives of more than people with deafness and paraplegia);
  - To a much better extent than in present, improvements made to the lives of various marginalized groups, to the extent that they're effectively not really marginalized anymore. (Eg, in Canada, getting around the political problems and finally coming to generally-mutually-acceptable solutions for First Nations reconciliation, treaties, and other disagreements.)
  - copyrights lasting no more than 15 years (as has been mathematically demonstrated to be the longest term that can provide more good than harm);
  - penal systems focused on rehabilitation and recompense to the harmed rather than gratuitious punishment or corporate-owned-prison profiteering;
  - ? Possibly: Widespread application of future-prediction market techniques to improve various proposed plans
