So, it's clear that the vast majority of the focus of this subreddit is on individual characters gaining rationality. But what I'm wondering is, what stories have you seen where the society the characters live in is at least as intelligent as the general populace of the real world? Worlds where elements outside of our norm exist, but there is little to no authorial fiat limiting how people interact with and utilize such elements.

** They're going to be rare. It takes a tremendous amount of work for a writer to make something like that work in a believable manner.
