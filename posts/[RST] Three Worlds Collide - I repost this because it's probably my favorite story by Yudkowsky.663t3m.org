What rational reason is there to refuse the Superhappies' compromise?

Which seems irrational as all hell to me, and inconsistent with the rest of EY's work. Since when do rationalists value suffering for its own sake?

I mean, in the epilogue the Confessor--the guy whose entire role is to be the story's purest rationalist--straight up says that he thinks murdering fifteen billion people accomplished something so valuable that it made up for him raping and killing an underage girl. And I don't see anything in the "facts" of the story to justify that.

The Superhappies' compromise reminds me of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xu/failed_utopia_42/][Failed Utopia #4-2]], in that in each there has been an attempt to satisfy human values, but in each there have been other factors at play. I think on the sliding scale of utopias, while the Superhappies' offer is much better than #4-2, in each there have been controlling influences very clearly orthogonal to human values affecting how people live their lives and how, which of, and to what extent their values are satisfied.

Like the Gandhi that doesn't want to eat the pill that will turn him into an unstoppable murderer, I think it is not unnatural to front resistance to changing your core values. Is it not possible that humanity, if unaided by Superhappies, may bring to fruition a future more closely aligned with human values than the literally compromised utopia offered unto them? If so I think it's possible to make an argument that the 12 billion people is an insignificant number compared to the unimaginably significantly larger number to come in the far future.

The question I think is how well have the superhappies captured human values. If you think they've basically done enough, and the value in both fast-tracking and securing their version of utopia is worth the compromise necessary, then I think that's fair. But I think it's also fairly reasonable to suggest that humanity could eventually produce a future for themselves that better and more purely satisfies human values without capitulating to alien influence.

**** I'm certainly not arguing that it's unnatural to resist changes to one's core values; my objection is that the story frames that resistance as rational.

An argument could certainly be made that murdering the 15 billion is the only path to the "golden ending" where humanity optimally satisfies its existing values, and therefore the actions of the characters were rational. However, I have a couple of objections to that interpretation.

First, this is a lot more of a gray area than the characters imply. If it were a straight trade-off of 15 billion lives for an optimized human utopia, their absolute certainty that it was the right choice would make sense. But in reality the cost is (15 billion humans die + our opportunity for alliance and cultural/technology exchange with two advanced alien species is lost + we continue to satisfy our core values less optimally than the Superhappy compromise would have for god knows how long), and the reward is (perfect human utopia for some unknown length of time x the probability that we ever achieve such a utopia). The story treats this dilemma as a hell of a lot more black-and-white than it is.

Second, the particular human value that the characters most emphasize is our capacity for suffering. In the "bad ending," the last thing Akon does before being re-engineered is to pinch himself and regret that that's the last time he will feel pain. In the true ending, the Pilot's "triumphant" final words are "To live, and occasionally be unhappy!"

I argue that the story portrays it as rational to hold suffering as a core value, and I also argue that it's /not/ rational to do so. I've never seen any other rationalist work endorse the unfortunately common human habit of fetishizing unhappiness.

I'm pretty sympathetic to the basic gist of what you're saying, but I do think that it's not unreasonable to take the view that human values are often more complex than pure hedonism, and within that complexity there is space for things that are not necessarily easily or precisely mapped to happiness. Like, not too many people think of the lotus eater lifestyle as necessarily being the ideal - there are features and possible experiences of existence and consciousness that it is possible to value over maximally efficient pleasure, and to what extent it is possible to want to retain those values instead of converting to a lotus eater there is also an argument for the desirability of attempting a first and foremost human-value based utopia without superhappy values crowding them out.

Maybe you thought that the story didn't make any such arguments effectively enough, but I guess as someone unsure I can say I found it sufficiently plausible and perhaps correct. For what it's worth, if I can remember right, the first time I read the story I think I was more or less on board with the superhappy solution, and although I haven't read it in a while I think I would probably still take it.

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/28/wirehead-gods-on-lotus-thrones/][Relevant SSC post]]. Like Scott, I'm pretty okay with this future, but many people (like in the comments) aren't, and I am sympathetic to their point of view and do think I have some understanding as to why.

I keep going back to this line, but the Pilot says "To live, and occasionally be unhappy" -- not, for example, "To live, and retain the capacity to fulfill values that don't necessarily directly yield pleasure."

***** I don't know of Nabokov, but I'm betting it's some form of violent rape...?

I've been studying, thinking, and discussing a lot about consent recently (a group I'm part of has grown to sufficient size that it's necessary). One thing that's becoming apparent is there's something like three categories: consensual sex, nonconsensual sex, rape.

It's the middle category that's interesting. The classic example is a girlfriend giving into their boyfriend's pressure for sex before they're ready; classically, the boyfriend has no idea. I met someone once that had this happen to them (as the guy), and it fucked them up royally.

This seems pretty clearly of a different category of thing than the classic violent rape.

What is actually, directly described in the story is also not that. It seems much closer to the first situation.

The confessor - meant to represent us, as the modern human - does not treat it neutrally because /we/ do not treat it neutrally. They remain a solid viewpoint character for the audience.

****** Lol I was going to give you grief for not even googling nabokov but if you thought it was some class of unsavory act I suppose it can be forgiven. 😁

Vladimir nabokov was a Russian American author, best known for his novel Lolita, which dealt with a predatory wealthy englishmans "relationship" with his adoptive preteen daughter. It was highly controversial at the time, but is now widely regarded as one of the great works of English literature.

I brought it up merely to indicate that I am not opposed to the use of taboo topics in art categorically. I merely think it was done poorly here - and EY himself has admitted it was shoehorned in from an entirely different story.

On the other point, I never once associated myself with the confessor or his perspective. If that was the goal, it failed as well. I would also object artistically to your interpretation that he "represents" the modern human. I don't find it so blandly allegorical as to demand a Everyman who represents anything.

***** But if it's only a shift in the meaning of the word, what's the point? If there's just some other word for what we now call rape in the future, and the word "rape" changes to mean something else, then legalized rape is basically pointless as an example of shifting societal morality. It might as well be the same culture, just one that uses a different combination of mouth-sounds to represent a specific abhorrent concept.

Plus, it wouldn't be at all difficult to explain to Akon, since the Confessor could just say "in our time the word 'rape' meant what we now call 'someotherthing.'"

The only way this works as an example of shifting morality is if somehow what we now call rape just /never happens/ in the future, and that's hard to believe without a good explanation.

Edit: I've been going through the story again, and Akon does actually use the word "rape" to mean nonconsensual sex in his internal monologue. When he realizes that the Superhappies communicate through sex, and that therefore their end of the interspecies communication involves one of them having sex with an avatar representing Akon, he thinks: "I'm being cyber-raped." This seems to contradict the interpretation that the meaning of the word "rape" has changed very much.

Edit 2: In fact, when discussing legal rape, Akon specifically uses the phrase "nonconsensual sex." The Confessor is the one who calls it rape. It seems pretty clear here that it is, in fact, nonconsensual sex that was legalized, and not some alternative definition of the word "rape."

******* Yes, I think that's a more plausible reading than the "it's only a change in the meaning of the word" interpretation that I was arguing against.

So let's say we conclude that in this futuristic society, which is described as extraordinarily progressive and utopian by our standards, "rape" has the same literal meaning as it does in 2017, but is no longer considered abhorrent. And we also see that the Confessor, the story's purest rationalist who is framed as the wisest and most "correct" character, uses the fact that he once opposed legalizing rape as an example of why really old people are too inflexible/too caught up in the morality of the past to lead.

How exactly are we supposed to interpret this, with respect to its potential function as social commentary? I don't know for sure what the intention was, but the scene sure seems to imply that finding rape abhorrent is some kind of backwards, irrational characteristic of our society that will fade out as we become more enlightened, and that those who cling to the idea that it's /bad/ to violate someone's bodily autonomy for sexual gratification are on the wrong side of history. It's not a pretty implication.

The obvious counterargument is that EY wasn't rendering a value judgment here, and was merely presenting a characteristic of this fictional society that is unpalatable to us. However, that whole scene really /does/ seem to be framed with a built-in value judgment, for the reasons I've described. It's a sour note for me in a story that I otherwise enjoy (except for the ending).

If being waved at somehow became deeply traumatizing, it would of course (and rightly so) be utterly illegal to wave at you without your consent.

If it stopped being traumatizing, then waving-at-people-without-their-consent would again lose its automatic illegality status. You'd then need a court injuction to say that no-I'm-disallowing-these-people-to-phone-me-without-my-consent-or-to-wave-at-me.

In their future society, nobody can possibly be traumatized by unsolicited sex, and it's hard for the Confessor to explain why it was ever different, the same way it'd be hard for us to imagine someone who is deeply traumatized by unsolicited being-waved-at.

********* Thank you for this interpretation; it got me thinking.

It seems plausible, but it requires a lot of reading between the lines. There isn't much in the text to establish why rape should no longer be traumatic. There's also no explanation in the text for why, for example, it's apparently legal to hold someone down and imprison them against their will (in the process of raping them). This is an area in which the "waving" comparison doesn't match up well--when you wave at someone, you aren't /detaining/ them. Even doing my absolute best to look at it from this hypothetical future society's perspective, I can't imagine that there are no cases in which it would be seriously upsetting for someone to be raped, even if not because of the actual sex.

Akon seems to imply some kind of mutually sexy "consensual non-consent" scenario, but what's the logic in not allowing people to opt out of that? Legalizing rape might mean it's legal to act out that kind of scenario--which is /already/ legal anyway--but would it not also mean it's legal to hold someone down and rape them while they're thrashing and screaming "no, I am absolutely serious, I don't want to have sex"? For this society to permit such breaches of bodily autonomy implies a value shift that goes far, far beyond a mere change in attitudes toward sex, and makes it a lot harder for me to buy their visceral opposition to having their autonomy violated by the Superhappies.

And of course, if people in this enlightened utopian rationalist society are no longer traumatized by rape, then that carries the unsettling implication that enlightened people /should/ not be traumatized by rape--that the experience of being traumatized by rape is a silly overreaction that we'll eventually move past. If that wasn't EY's intention, then I think he could have handled this passage a lot more carefully to avoid giving that impression.

But "holding down someone, or restraining their movements, against their expressed wishes" could indeed be a crime that's unrelated to whether rape itself was a crime. Hell, even /touching/ people who aren't your friends might be a crime, and it'd be consistent with rape itself not being one.

Let's use the example of hugging rather than waving. In our current world hugging someone without their consent is not a crime, but hugging someone /against/ their consent is (probably, I'm guessing) a crime. But the crime description probably doesn't include the words "hugging-without-consent" at all, because hugging-without-consent is not by itself a crime.

Akon is told by the Confessor the equivalent of: "It used to be illegal to hug someone, even your friends, or your spouse, if they didn't explicitly clearly and soberly agree to it in advance. If your friends were drunk they couldn't consent to being hugged and even if they initiated the hug, you should try to stop them from hugging you. Even if they were okay with being hugged in the past, you should always clearly get consent first every time you moved to hug them."

Currently, in the real world we don't treat unsolicited-hugs like we do rape, and that makes perfect sense. But it only makes perfect sense because of our current context and culture, where rape is much more traumatizing than unsolicited hugs.

#+begin_quote

What does it mean to say that someone "should" not be traumatized by X, for any X? Hopefully, in an ideal world, nobody would be traumatized by /anything/, no matter what, because being traumatized is a bad thing that we don't want to happen to anyone. (Greek sidenote: trauma is the Greek word for 'injury')

This most definitely doesn't make it a "silly overreaction" for someone to be traumatized by things in the actual world. It doesn't make it their fault. It doesn't mean they can stop being traumatized by an effort of will. I don't think the phrase 'should not be traumatized' is meaningful in the way you mean it. It's like saying "should not be injured". When one is injured they don't get a say in it, and neither do they get a say when they're traumatized.

But there's nothing in the story to suggest a legal distinction between "sex without consent" and "sex against consent." If it were made clear in the story that unsolicited initiation of sex is permissible but you still have to stop immediately if the person says "no," I would read it differently.

There are two possible meanings of "You should not be traumatized by X." One is the meaning I intended: "X doesn't warrant feeling traumatized." The other is the meaning you gave: "People would suffer less if they could not experience trauma as a result of X, so this is desirable." The same words can be used to express both concepts, but that doesn't make them interchangeable. My argument is that if we interpret the future-human society as being incapable of being traumatized by rape, then the story seems to imply that being raped doesn't /warrant/ feeling traumatized.

******* If so, this should have been made clearer in the story. But even then, now that I think about it more, is that really an example of shifting morality? In this interpretation, the society hasn't actually changed their perception that what-we-call-rape is abhorrent; they've just succeeded in eliminating it.

In order for the legalization of rape to serve its apparent intended story function--which I believe is to drive home that this future human society in the story has morals alien to us--it really would need to be the case that future-humans no longer think it's abhorrent to force sex on someone. Which would honestly be a pretty off-putting characteristic for EY to write into a futuristic society, regardless of his intentions.

I don't mean in the sense that it merely makes the fictional society off-putting, but in the sense that it would make me side-eye EY. When an author makes a point of describing a society that is largely utopian by our standards, then immediately has a character from our near-future use /the fact that he once opposed legalizing rape/ as an example of why he's too old and inflexible to lead, it comes across less like an effort to portray this society as alien to ours and more like an endorsement of legalizing rape. Even though the Confessor implies that rape in their society--for whatever reason--doesn't cause the immense distress it causes now, it's difficult to interpret this passage charitably.

On that note, if future people radically altered themselves psychologically, I could imagine they might view rape as less bad, but it seems like any reasonable set of legally-enforced personal boundaries would make rape illegal to at least some extent (grabbing and holding someone down, or pressuring them to do something they don't want would be illegal even if this bizaro future culture doesn't think the sex itself is a big deal).

Maybe if Eliezer had the person from the 21st century try to explain to the captain how he is completely removed from not only historical context but the very psychology of baseline humans, the point would carry through better, but even then a lot of potential audience for the story is going to be lost.

** This is a bit of a cop out when it comes to the moral dilemma in this story, and I'm not sure if Yudkowsky did it intentionally, but to me both endings were really awful and unrealistic. Actually, I find it difficult to understand how the Super Happy People and the Baby Eaters could be the result of normal evolution. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/ThreeWorldsCollide][When it comes to the Baby Eaters, someone in TV Tropes explained it well:]]

#+begin_quote
  How come the Baby Eaters' life cycle didn't turn them into the ultimate backstabbers? The story claims that "cheaters" which tried to spare their own babies would be found out and ruthlessly eliminated, thus selecting for compliance with social dictates at one's own expense. But that sort of selection happens at the very end of the life cycle, among breeding adults. Selection pressure is always much, much stronger when it's applied to the early stages of life: if you don't survive your infancy, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference what survival-strategy you might've pursued as an adult. And the Baby Eaters' method of preying upon their own offspring - chasing groups of them down in pens, where only the fastest and most elusive escape their parents' maws - would tend to encourage betrayal as a way of life, i.e. babies tripping up other babies so their siblings will get eaten in their stead. If anything, the Baby Eaters that survive should be the ones who are quickest to shove their fellows into the path of danger; by rights, they should all be "cheaters", and should be pouncing on and killing each other, not their own young, when resources are limited.

What do you define as "easily?" There exist people who jump on grenades spur of the moment to save their comrades. There exist people who willingly choose to undertake suicide missions to stop nuclear reactor meltdowns after careful consideration. Extreme circumstances often bring out not just the selfishness, but the altruism in people.

With the fate of humanity at stake, I think it's sufficiently extreme for pseudo-military leaders to make choices like those in the story. Not everyone in the crew had to choose "suicide," but in a sufficiently advanced society (socially speaking) their leaders are in positions of power for a reason.

You might as well jump it up to the category 'dieing' and say 'the average person isn't killed by supernovas' as an argument against it.

basically another example of this [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/]] though rather than an emotional reaction to the central member, you are simply taking a quality of the center member and assuming it applies to the edges.

But to answer your question, idk if its necessarily answerable. If you agree that terminal values are terminal then its impossible to say that one set of terminal values are better than another, only that you wouldn't change your terminal values under most circumstances (i.e. wireheading is bad) .

What we call valueing X is really just us describing that if feels like our utility function increases when you get more X. It doesn't describe how it increases (logarithmically, linearly,...etc) or how it interacts with other things. A better way to look at it is if every person is going to get 1% less utility under the superhappy compromise (1% less in terms of their pre compromise values) then the question you should be asking is 'will hummanity ever be numerous to wipe out that finite loss of utility from the death of X people at Y utility' Well that number is pretty easy to calculate, its just 1.5 trillion under some basic assumptions.

Further, more generally, if the compromise would result it a loss of 1/L utility per person, and avoiding it requires killing Z people, you just need to have avoided converting Z*L people for it to be worth it. This doesn't seem hard with a spacefaring civilization.

Let's also not forget that humanity didn't /only/ sacrifice 15 billion lives. You're framing it like people lose utility compared to their pre-compromise selves, but I disagree; they gain utility compared to their pre-compromise selves, and lose it compared to some hypothetical far-future version of humanity that optimizes human values. The Superhappies were going out of their way to make the deal beneficial to everyone, remember.

The Superhappy compromise might not have optimally fulfilled all human values, but it would have fulfilled them /better/ than pre-compromise humans did. So by rejecting the compromise you not only lose the 15 billion lives, you also lose out on that gain in utility between now and whenever humanity reaches that level of utility on its own. And who knows when that will be? Will that /ever/ happen? The problem is a /lot/ more complex than you're describing it.
