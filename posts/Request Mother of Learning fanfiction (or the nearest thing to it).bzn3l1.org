What I /really/ want is a story set in the MoL universe from the perspective of a dragon, preferably one too young to know any great magic but too old to seek help as a hatchling from other dragons. It'd follow the dragon as they run around the only land unclaimed by other powerful magical creatures: human areas. But yeah any MoL fanfics would be good.


** It's certainly not what you described, but it is MoL fanfiction and it is good. If you don't mind a multicross with Homestuck, Worm, and Naruto (it's written such that you don't need to be familiar with all the source material, I'm not Naruto familiar and I enjoy it), there's [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/conference-call-multicross.50109/][Conference Call]].

**** It's about exploring the ramifications and potential of the node. That's something that appeals to a lot of folks around here, me included.
