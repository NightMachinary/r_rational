Hi, [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Some of you might remember me from previous attempt at web fiction, which I posted my two attempts at on this subreddit back in 2017 and 2018 respectively. I ended up abandoning that project (at least, for now) because it wasn't very popular and, frankly, was kind of a huge mess as a result of me having over-written it for a long period of time and being burdened with too many conflicting ideas. Oh, and also because someone stole my laptop with all the files on and I hadn't backed it up properly, but that's neither here nor there.

Anyway, I started different project recently, but felt a little uncertain about posting it here right away because repeatedly getting people to read stuff you're not committed to yet and then ending up ditching it feels like kind of lame behavior. However, I now have about 60k words submitted, so I probably won't end up walking away from it unless it ends up being spectacularly disliked.

This is largely a completely new project, though it shares a couple character concepts and world-building conceits from the first. It's a more traditional fantasy story with a slow, introspective pace that I thought people here might like because the magic system is very mechanical and it focuses heavily on the topics of death and the pursuit of immortality, which seems like a popular idea in ratfic. It's also features (although not super prominently yet, since it's still half in setup) characters using their intellects and an understanding of the magic system to try to solve problems. I also indulge in a very small amount of gamelit-style framing.

It's on royalroad right now. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere]] Up to 13 chapters. Please let me know what you think if you read any of it; feedback is invaluable, especially on the first chapter if you find yourself unable to get into it.

If anyone is wondering what the title is in reference to, it'll become clear in chapter 15.


** Feedback (written as I read through the first chapter, my impressions entirely subjective):

In the synopsis, the phrase 'time loop mystery' is a nice hook, snagging my interest/curiosity and ensuring that I start the text itself. If anything, I might even recommend that line to go at the start of the synopsis, to snag attention first and then start delivering the premise which then feeds into the context of it being a time loop mystery, rather than the mind going back and reevaluating the premise in the context of the new framing.

Starting impression, evidently intentional: /So bewildered./ No meaningful hypothesis possible yet, moving on.

'aside from window' -> 'aside from the window'\\
'two doors, one on' -> 'two doors, one each on'\\
' more negotiable concepts then they are' -> ' more negotiable concepts than they are'\\
' A simple way to put would' -> ' A simple way to put it would'

Maybe because I'm thinking closely about what's going on, but I'm finding myself bogged down in the descriptions. Maybe it can't be helped if there are clues hidden in the room details, but I might prefer more meat (content) and less descriptions-of-the-participants initially, then filling in some details later (maybe one by one, at different times, at times of individual focus?) once we know and care more about these individuals (and become more curious about their characteristics?), spaced/spread out enough that they don't become burdensome. As it is, I find myself trying to visualise and memorise these appearances with nothing associative to connect them to, rather than filling in or otherwise-updating mental images which have already formed for remembered minds.

For the old/new metaphor, just a single detail for each might have been enough, which is also easier to keep in mind as a starting anchor to associate with them.

'the fact that the fact' -> 'the fact that', probably. The comma after 'culture' in that paragraph also feels wrong, though I'm less clear about what could be satisfyingly done about it.

Though easier to process now, I'm still getting an impression of the writing being abnormally slanted towards /descriptions/--here, as though the character is mentally describing the sensations they are feeling, or even making an effort to describe them eloquently to the reader with simile, as though a poet were writing down their memoirs after the fact. Different, for example, from an impression of watching over an individual's shoulder and actually seeing what they're thinking in the moment. Hmm, or like a brought-into-custody person thinking back to and recounting everything they felt--with simile--to a police officer in an interrogation room who's writing down everything.

Hmm, 'ugly beast' as an example, I feel as though the character is using more thought to have fun with visualising their own fears than they are on the fears themselves.

I feel curious about the 'AM(N)', looking forward to when that will become understood.

Continuing, a deepening impression of this-is-being-calmly-recited-after-the-fact, leaving me detached from the goings-on. I'm starting to expect the view to switch, as the person this is being described to says something and we see (even for a moment) what's happening in the present instead.

I find myself rather curious about whether the bookmark is in the same place or not...

'open it's insipid' -> 'open its insipid'

'My mind felt was wracked with uncertainty' -> 'felt' or 'was', not both.

The last paragraph is similarly dispassionate. I've put my finger on another way that this 'fits'--this whole first-person section sounds much more normal to me if I imagine it all in third-person, narrated about the emotional character rather than the character emotionlessly narrating in the first-person past how emotional the character was.

Deliberately pausing at the end of the first chapter--besides which, I'm out of time for today--I mainly feel exasperation and some frustration. There is mystery/questions, but while I was drawn in by curiosity, all I've found is (more) ignorance.

For the moment, I have to go. I hope this feedback offers food for thought!

*** Hmm, yeah. I wish your feedback was better, but obviously it's good to get a perspective on how it looks to someone outside-context. I have a tendency to get too tied up in overarching ideas to be able to conceptualize the first impression for a new reader, so I feel like the introductions I write can be tiring and confusing, even if they seem relatively elegant from my position.

I'll see what I can do?

*** Alright, I thought about your feedback a little more. I hope you don't mind me replying twice here - I thought it might slip by you if I just made an edit.

First of all, thanks a lot for catching those typos. I said this before already, but I don't have an editor, and a fair few end up slipping me. It feels very embarrassing when I finally spot them months after I've already published.

I think you absolutely have a point about the start being bewildering, and the early descriptive work being a bit too heavy. To tip my hand a bit, the reason for the intense description of the room is because, when the location comes up again much later, certain details are different and this is important to the story. It's also meant to evoke a stage-directiony quality, which is kind of a motif for the narrative; every arc opens in a similar fashion. Though that's just the creative justification for it. If it's off-putting to a lot of people, it might be better to do away with it anyway?

However, if you dislike the density and level of characterization from the first-person perspective, that might be a bigger problem. It's especially prominent in the first 3 chapters - which are kind of the "prologue arc" - but remains present throughout, and is kind of a stylistic choice on my part. I like first person narration with a lot of character, where it feels like someone is telling about something that happened rather than just being a vehicle for the audience perspective. So it might just be a question of taste in that respect, though if anyone else is reading this, please share your opinion.

That being said, I didn't want it to come come across as being narrated /dispassionately,/ so that's a bit of a letdown, and I'm not quite sure how to fix it? I'd tried to keep some parts sharp enough for people to get caught up in the moment.

Finally, was there any reason you left the chapter feeling frustrated? I recognize that a lot of stuff is unclear, but I also try to slowly drip out context and it /is/ just the first chapter. Is the amount of what-is-going-on feelings just too much? Because the whole first 3 chapters are kind of like that before it drops to a something simpler and less mysterious; they originally didn't exist, but I got feedback from friends that the story was too dull to engage them if they started at that point. If you like, you can try skipping a bit to Chapter 4 to see the disparity.

**** Thank you for your thoughts and reply!

The frustration can probably be safely treated as a measurement artifact--I happened to be in a coincidental situation of "Hmm, I have just enough time to read one chapter, and as it happens feedback is particularly desired for the first chapter. Let's do an in-depth feedback giving for this one chapter. Ooo, and there are immediately interesting questions I'd like to learn more about. [...] ...And now I have to stop, and I'm only more confused and with only more questions and having learned nothing! Nooo!" The time-constraint 'have to stop (for now)' is atypical and hypothesisable as the main source of the frustration at that point.

In terms of narration style, indeed I feel it's reasonable to treat it as a matter of taste. As long as it's a way that you're aware you're writing rather than done unintentionally (/without wanting to), I'm happy for you to able to write as you prefer!

Jumping around (following my thoughts) a bit, do the details of the man and woman also change? If so, then no helping it, and I'm surprised and curious. If not, then my preference for how we get used to them as people may still apply.

From my perspective the dispassionate nature could be inextricable from your preferred writing style, but I can try to think of how it could be done differently.

When reviewing, something I think I missed earlier (grammar)--'like ugly beast from a vulgar and foreboding crevice of my mind' -> 'like an ugly beast from a vulgar and foreboding crevice of my mind'.

Using that phrase as an example, the impression I got was that the speaker was having fun with the imagery of a beast coming out of a crevice, rather than focusing on or reliving any of the fear or horror of the moment itself.

Hm. I hesitate to try to write alternative-style versions of anything you've written, but perhaps I can portray taken-to-extremes different versions of an imagined scene, contrasted different ways it could be written.

Ver1:

'"No! Don't leave me!" I yelled as his breathing grew fainter, my alabaster hands wet with his blood which was the colour of the 'Nonstop Rose' begonia cultivar, while my tears dripped down like perfect crystal diamonds cut by a master craftsmen.'

Ver2:

'I can't remember what I said. I begged, I pleaded, I yelled at him to stop, to stay with me, and I tried to keep pressure on the wound but it kept coming, more blood, too much blood, more and more and more horrible red blood no matter what I did and he just-- I couldn't--

It was about 9 o'clock when I left the room and began the daily check of the barricades, some time later. Maybe I threw up at some point, but all those memories blur together and hurt to even think about. I didn't see, later, because after I'd checked and re-barricaded all the night's damage the last door I barricaded was his. I think I had thrown up, in there, because before I could do it I stood against the door for a long time, forehead against the cool wood, trying to make myself turn the handle and dry-heaving over and over again. I'd--we'd both had a large breakfast, so it had to have come out of me already sometime in there. In the end, I just left it closed and sealed it up with him inside.'

** I already have it in my read later list haha, I must have come across it while browsing and tagged it instead of reading cause it was too short, I try not to read much that has less than 200-300 pages, for the same reason as you said, starting serving and enjoying it only for it to never really begin is painful.

I'll give your story a read soon! The only feedback I can give immediately is to wonder if the Anti-hero Lead tag is accurate, it is incredibly overused, being used on any lead character that is perfectly heroic or just mildly amoral, which just isn't what an Anti-hero is in my head.

*** Pfft, I actually wasn't totally sure about it either.

To be honest, I was a bit indulgent with the tags in wanting to attract readers. A lot of the royalroad tags seem to assume you're writing a very trope-y type of story, and aren't really built for things that stray from that. Like, this story is centered around a college-age class. Should that be school life? Is strategy just fighting battles, or trying to navigate complex situations against opponents...?

The main character is kind of a byronic hero in that she's a selfish, depressed screw-up with a questionable value system, and a lot of the story is going to ponder the question of if she's legitimately a bad person, but she can also be heroic and kind, too. There's no real tag to represent that, so I guess I just used it to kind of mean "not a conventionally good protagonist".

** Here goes.

1. Narration: I really like the narrative style. Both of them, actually. The introduction is a self-aware pastiche of pretentious narration, and, as such, it only gets better when the narrators call each other out on it. I'm not sure the style fits in with the rest of the story (the FP-POV sections are a lot more serious than what I'd expect given the introductory tone), but, given the protagonist's compulsion to joke about serious subjects, that may be intentional. And the first-person narration really sells the character's depression and anxiety.
2. Format: You almost lost me after Chapter 3. I'm all for time loops as a narrative device, but there's something almost cruel about introducing us to a POV character and then - this is the impression I got, which reading to the current endpoint has only slightly lessened - killing off that character and rolling back to an earlier version. It makes the prologue feel inconsequential, and made me feel like I shouldn't get invested into how events affect characters, because they might not end up having happened. There's a feeling of /deja vu/ later at the end of Chapter 6 that makes me feel like the first few chapters /might/ not end up being inconsequential, but that's a very short moment.
3. Characters: I like the characters. They seem to have decently distinctive voices and personalities from each other. The only thing that bugs me is that there are a whole lot of them introduced in a fairly short span. And a trading card's worth of stats doesn't really suffice to help me get to know them enough that I'm not trying to remember who they are when they show up next. Especially when most of the stats on that card are either incomprehensible at this place in the story (Resistances: AMN) or irrelevant to forming an impression of the character (Blood Type: B-).
4. Plot: Too early to form a coherent impression.
5. Themes: I have high hopes for this, based on how you explored a variety of different answers to the "What do you think about immortality?" question. It looks like you've really thought the question through, which bodes well for how that is going to come through in the conflicts of the plot.
6. Setting: I like the world-building thus far. And I agree, in principle, with what you're doing here, to let the details of the world-building show themselves through the characters interacting with the world. For my personal taste, though, I'm coming across too many moments where it sounds like a term is important, but it's not mentioned after that (for instance: all characters are named "of [something]," which I assume to be a place-name, and given a Party of Origin, which seems to be a culture, as if these are important to understanding them as a character, but it's usually dropped without explaining what Ikkuret is, or why it's important that someone originates from the Mekhian Party). And, yes, I know it's early for all of that, but the ratio of unexplained novel terms to explained ones is just uncomfortably high for my liking.

But overall, I enjoyed it, after I got past that hurdle at the start of Chapter 4.

Hmm, it's unfortunate that you went away with that impression. My intention with the first three chapters narratively speaking, alongside the goal of just giving the story a running start and having a platform on which to introduce some basic world-building concepts, is to leave the reader with a question of, "how did we get to this point?" and then to have beats in the story that follows which lead to moments of "/oh,/ now I get it", where it pays off satisfyingly. As well as giving them meat on which to speculate on the mechanics of the time loop itself, since that's part of the hook. I'd hoped the intrigue would be sufficient that it wouldn't come across as pointless for the reader and the beat at the end of Chapter 6 would serve to sufficiently signal that it wasn't meaningless in-universe, either - but I guess not?

You're the third person to have a distinct complaint about the intro chapters just in this thread, now. It's really starting to make me wonder if their inclusion was a bad idea and I ought to cut them.

Introducing the characters in a short span of time is unavoidable for the type of story it is (a closed circle mystery), unfortunately. My only hope has been to try and make it as painless as possible, though if you had specific ideas on how I could do that better, I'm open to suggestions.

The "trading card" profile sheets are partially an attempt to reach out to the gamelit crowd who likes information presented in a direct way, although you're not the first person to question their inclusion - my hope was that people would see them as fun bits of trivia that would become more relevant later. To tip my hand a bit, I also wanted them to be something that exist in-universe, although that hasn't been brought up yet. They're going to be explained as part of the paperwork that it's mentioned the conclave requires everyone to submit. So the information is specifically the kind of you might give to a resort you're staying at; basic medical information, food tastes and allergies, etc.

Hmm, this might just have been something I should have explained clearer. The "of <something>" names aren't meant to be super significant to the setting - they're basically just last names in function. You've probably noticed to some extent that the setting has a contrast between ultra ancient, bronze age aesthetics and ultra modern, futuristic ones, and this formatting is meant to evoke that. Last names as we understand them today didn't really come to exist until the Roman era for the vast majority of cultures. I thought a way to reveal this directly would be to have the class director use Utsushikome's functionally as a last name in chapters 8 and 9, but I guess not.

As for Parties of Origin, they actually refer primarily to ethnicity before culture, (for example, Ptolema has a Greek/Inotian name despite her party not being that) although this is a simplified explanation and it will be discussed more comprehensively in a few chapters from now. I tried to convey some of this with the discussion in Chapter 7, when they talk about how the different parties are groups that migrated together from the old world together and established the original societies, although I guess that must also have been too vague.

Do you have a suggestion on how either of these could be improved to help people get it sooner?

#+end_quote

And that worked pretty well, right up until the reset. Starting a story /in media res/ is pretty difficult to pull off under the best of circumstances, and you were doing it pretty well, but having your prologue take place both before /and/ after the events of the rewound chapter might be too much of an ask, if you want it to have weight.

Or it might be that you could entirely fix it by putting something near the top of Chapter 4 (Waking from a nightmare? An unexplained feeling of horror, quickly quashed? A moment of disorientation, as if she had thought she was somewhere else?) to indicate that the prologue wasn't all inconsequential. Even what you had at the end of Chapter 6 might be fine; the problem is, a reader, turned off by the sudden erasure of the events they'd just experienced with a character, might not make it that far.

I don't take issue with the directly-presented information, really; it gives the first-person portion of the narrative almost a comic-book feel, to contrast the very formal descriptions of the setting that lead off Chapters 1 and 4. My only issue with them is that none of the information on the card is immediately memorable and/or useful to distinguish the characters, with one notable exception: Ptolema's dietary notes.

"Extra meat, please" gives a sense of character that none of the rest of items on the cards do. Enough so that I remembered specifically that was on Ptolema's card, whereas I have no memory of who has the nut allergy or the lactose intolerance.

I suppose it's just weird to me that there's only one naming tradition. Just in English, surnames can be based on the name of an ancestor (Johnson), or their profession (Smith), or where they lived (Milton), or some other distinguishing characteristic (Strong). They carry information about family, ethnic heritage, and social standing. And you can infer all sorts of things about Anglophone culture by those details.

Likewise, what I can infer from /everyone/, of multiple ethnicities and presumably cultures, having the /same/ naming convention of "[Person] of [City]," is that the city someone is from carries some social importance. And yet what importance that carries hasn't come up yet.

Especially in a first person narrative, things that come across as unimportant to your protagonist come across as unimportant to the reader. I'm not saying to make Su horribly racist in stereotyping her friends, but stereotypes do exist for a reason: they're a convenient starting place for getting to know people. So, for Ptolema, for example: what would you expect the stereotypical Viraki girl of her age to be like? How is she different from that stereotype, and why? Ditto for the stereotypical girl from Rheeds. That will allow you to bring your world-building notes across in a way that both informs us about how your protagonist sees the world and its various peoples, as well as telling us about how your secondary characters were shaped by the cultures they came from (which would also help make them more distinct and memorable as well).

Remember that this is all just based on my personal impression. I'm only offering advice because you asked for it; if the stuff I've suggested doesn't fit with the story you want to write, or your style of writing, certainly ignore it. Don't write to anyone's expectations but your own.

I'll give this some thought. I do think it's a matter of taste to some extent, but so many people seem put off by either the content of the "prologue chapters" or their relation to the rest of the story, that I do feel kind of skeptical about them and how I can make them work now.

I guess I didn't intend for the cards to be instantly explanatory, so much as something people would later reference back to as context built over the course of the story. Though I did try to slip a bit of character building in there: with Ptolema, I wanted the joke to be that she didn't quite get what they were asking for when filling out her dietary requirement. I tried for something similar with Lilith, where she has a ridiculously long list of things she won't eat.

Hmm, this is actually a creative decision I regret a little bit - originally I was going to have different last name themes for each of the different cultures based on the bronze age civilization counterpart upon with they were loosely based. Mekhians were going to have title-nicknames, Rhunbardic characters patronymics, Inotian characters "of" titles, Ysarans complex forenames that integrated their last name and titles into one word in the vein of Sumerian cultures, and Saoic and Viraaki characters more conventional last names. I eventually did away with this because the result ended up being a lot of ancient-y sounding stuff that I figured would be indistinguishable to the average reader anyway, in favor of something more universal and evocative of the disparity in setting, but you have me doubting it now.

To be clear about one thing, the "of" titles don't even per-se represent where the characters are from anymore - like what happened in real history, their meaning has degraded over time to the point that children often just inherit them from their parents, like with Lilith. With the exception of Ophelia, they're basically just last names, though I could probably stand to make that clearer.

I do agree that I could be doing more to emphasize the characters cultures and make them distinct. I've been trying to drip that in rather than just have it be really blunt, but it's ended up barely coming up at all, probably because it's difficult to digress to the main character talking about how a character relates to the qualities of their home culture and ethnicity - especially in the case of someone like Ptolema, who is Viraaki only in regard to her ethnicity and has little connection to it other than skin colour.

But then, the setting /is/ meant to be really cosmopolitan and enlightened, so maybe it's appropriate? I dunno.

I appreciate your feedback, anyway.

** Ideally the first chapter could do with an edit (sentence structure more than anything) but it seems promising.

The plots got a hook (or two), the protagonist has plenty of personality and voice and the world building is integrated smoothly.

I'll dive deeper in tomorrow.

Tell me more, if you feel like it! I worry about my sentence structure a lot, and for the first chapter it's very important.

**** I caught up on the story and it was really enjoyable so far. I think the first three chapters, when in Su's perspective, try a little too hard to emphasise how she's feeling (felt like some adjective overload at points) and over-describes the surroundings, sometimes at junctures where Su would be realistically more focused on other things (and the reader's attention wants to be focused on other things).

Chapter 4 onwards though it feels like this completely disappears and the writing really shines; far more than your average popular web serial imo. The characters have distinct and interesting voices, the dialogue flows, the introspection, observation and philosophising is all quality and well integrated, as is the world building which is really interesting in its own right.

Thanks for writing this, I'll definitely be following along.

***** Ah, thank you so much for the compliments! I'm really glad you've been enjoying it.

Yeah, I'm really uncertain about the first 3 chapters. I mentioned this in the post to the other guy, but I wrote them primarily because my friends thought the first draft, which lacked that opener, was too slow and didn't give a good taste of the kind of drama and action the main story will eventually build toward, which would subsequently put off the majority of web serial readers who like those things. However, instead, it seems like most of the complaints I get are about them being confusing and overwhelming.

I think the reason the writing is probably bloated in the way that you describe is that I have trouble nailing pacing for first person narration when there isn't any dialogue between characters, and end up overcompensating. Do you think it's something that could be fixed by just cutting out some lines, or does the whole thing need a rework to make it less strange and intimidating?

****** I think the fact the opener throws you right in the mix and doesn't spoon-feed the reader is a valid stylistic choice. It's going to polarise readers but I personally tend to enjoy such openings. Given the general progression of the story, it's density and the more traditional published fantasy pacing, I think an opening that asks for some patience and implies later rather than immediate pay-off is selecting for the right sort of readers.

I think the first three chapters can be “fixed” through the removal of lines and superfluous words and adjectives on the sentence level to tighten it up. I don't want to imply the opening is a mess or anything, for the record, it was certainly readable :)

** This is pretty interesting and I look forward to seeing where it goes. I'm really interested in the protagonist who, if I'm reading it right, is a depressed person in a society where people live a long time and may eventually attain immortality. This is an interesting concept to me.

Regarding your comment on the latest chapter,

#+begin_quote
  What do you think of the first three chapters, in the context of the rest of the story? I'm considering cutting them and sprinkling the exposition through other currents, instead, since I get so much negative feedback abou them relative to the rest.
#+end_quote

Generally, I - personally - am not a big fan of "action prologues." I wasn't nearly as engaged through the first 3 chapters as I was starting in the fourth, but I wouldn't say I got nothing out of them. These 3 chapters suggest something bizarre and metaphysical is going on that makes me want to know more. I probably would have enjoyed the section more if it had been shorter.

BTW, I really liked this line:

#+begin_quote
  I didn't recognize any of the faces, so they must have been wealthy
#+end_quote

It seems backwards and really makes you do a double-take and wonder, /what could that possibly mean?/ It's a great way to hint at a unique setting concept that you'll develop further later.

Also a couple of typos:

- You say "me and Ran" rather than "Ran and I" a few times (e.g., chapter 6). I noticed the construct pop up a few times.

- "the Ptolema's of the world" (chapter 8) There doesn't need to be an apostrophe. It's not possessive.

Keep up the good work!

*** Thanks for catching those typos! I'll fix them in a little bit.

I'm glad you're enjoying the story - and yeah, you do seem to have grasped the premise of Su's character, though it's a bit more complex than that. And it good to hear some positive feedback on the first three chapters, regardless of what I end up doing.

** Was your earlier attempt "Where only names grow?" There was a bit much going on there, but I was very curious about all the foreshadowing. Particularly the parallels between the multiple lines of narrative. (Though the first chapter felt.. like an unnecessary extra layer of framing. )

*** That's correct, it was! Yeah, the opening was way too busy, but I couldn't really figure out how to cut it, which was one of the reasons I lost faith in the project. The whole story was designed in a way that was probably overcomplicated, even by my standards.

**** Okay typos and thoughts on the first chapter. (I'm in a grumpy mood so this will be fairly harsh, probably. Take it with a large grain of salt.)

s/House or Resurrection/House of Resurrection/

Hmm. We seem to be reusing some of the outermost framing devices from the other story, not the exact characters, but the premise is definitely related. I note a sense of disappointment on my part. That layer was the least interesting to me in the last work. Though it was also the least developed, so I am hopeful.

Lots of world-building terms thrown at us. I like it. I get a strong vibe of an elegant sort of steampunk without the steam or the punk. >.< That's maybe not the best description. It's intriguing. As is the info we get on the MC, both the information and the format. Occasionally I get these strong gender impressions for odd reasons, and I got a sense of male from her internal narration. This is almost certainly just idiosyncratic prejudices on my part and not something you should worry about, but it did throw me.

The MC sounds a lot like who I unconsciously wish/think I am. When I am in actuality a bit different. But that's neither here or there. Still, I like the strong sense I get of their personality from their self-description.

Knowing your writing "It was a pretty trashy adventure novel I'd picked up a few days ago, about a military ship overtaken in a mutiny." immediately stands out to me as foreshadowing, it also seems somewhat at odds with the MC's personality so far, not jarringly so but enough that it feels noteworthy, so I think I would remember it even if I hadn't read your previous work.

**** "Like me, he wore glasses, but he was short rather than far-sighted, so right now they were tucked away in one of his front pockets."

I think you have short and farsighted backwards here? People that only sometimes wear their glasses usually are usually far-sighted, that is they have trouble seeing close up, like when reading. Where as most people who are nearsighted wear their glasses almost all the time.

(This is basicly because the two conditions are not actually symmetric. Myopia is a systematic distortion of the eye relative to the focal point of the lense+cornea system. Where as people who have trouble seeing close up usually have lenses too stiff for their eye muscles to adjust. So the first is treated with a continual treatment, and the second with a 'as needed')

And you probably know all this and just made a typo.

***** Oh, sorry, I didn't see your two replies! I haven't been on Reddit for a couple days.

I'll just reply to both here. I didn't think your commentary was grumpy - it's interesting. I'm sorry you don't find that layer of the story interesting, but it won't be the focus for the majority of the time or anything, so hopefully it won't you too much.

I can understand Su's character voice coming across as a bit masculine, since I feel like people don't tend to write women characters with her specific kind of analytical, dour tone, and I'm glad you're paying close attention to the details! I always try to reward stuff like that, or at least I would if I didn't end up writing unpopular stuff and now being able to hold people's interest. This one seems different so far, at least!

Regarding the glasses thing, I think I might've got muddled there, I'm not certain. I'll check my notes later.
