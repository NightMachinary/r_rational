Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** [[https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/][The Real Reason Fans Hate the Last Season of Game of Thrones]] is that we don't really know how to tell *sociological stories*. I recommend reading the whole article but it's quite long, so I paste some quotes below. "Sociological writing" has a lot in common with rational writing.

#+begin_quote
  George R. R. Martin (...) specialize in having characters evolve in response to the broader institutional settings, incentives and norms that surround them.

  Benioff and Weiss steer the narrative lane away from the sociological and shifted to the psychological. That's the main, and often only, way Hollywood and most television writers tell stories.

  In sociological storytelling, the characters have personal stories and agency, of course, but those are also greatly shaped by institutions and events around them. The incentives for characters' behavior come noticeably from these external forces, too, and even strongly influence their inner life.

  People then fit their internal narrative to align with their incentives, justifying and rationalizing their behavior along the way.

  The overly personal mode of storytelling or analysis leaves us bereft of deeper comprehension of events and history.

  We also have a bias for the individual as the locus of agency in interpreting our own everyday life and the behavior of others. We tend to seek internal, psychological explanations for the behavior of those around us while making situational excuses for our own (...) - the fundamental attribution error.

  That tension between internal stories and desires, psychology and external pressures, institutions, norms and events was exactly what Game of Thrones showed us for many of its characters, creating rich tapestries of psychology but also behavior that was neither saintly nor fully evil at any one point. It was something more than that: *you could understand why even the characters undertaking evil acts were doing what they did, how their good intentions got subverted, and how incentives structured behavior*.

  The hallmark of sociological storytelling is if it can encourage us to put ourselves in the place of any character, not just the main hero/heroine, and imagine ourselves making similar choices.

  Well-run societies don't need heroes, and the way to keep terrible impulses in check isn't to dethrone antiheros and replace them with good people. Unfortunately, most of our storytelling---in fiction and also in mass media nonfiction---remains stuck in the hero/antihero narrative.

*** This is partly the reason why, but there's a host of other reasons too. The rushed pacing of the last two seasons, the inconsistency of character actions and motivations, the sacrifice of sense for spectacle.

Not to mention the fact that various interviews have shown that D&D just wanted to end the show despite being given a blank check and an offer of however many seasons they needed to finish the show. It's just incredibly insulting to the fans how this was all done. MauLer has some great video essays explaining all the shortcomings of the current season.

*** Yeah, it is a good read and if they wanted to keep the season 1-4 quality they would have had to do that. I would also say that it is really difficult to do while simultaneously moving the story where you want it to be. It poses additional constraints on the characters (same as our rationality requirement here) and that makes all other aspects of storytelling harder.

We'll see if GRRM will be able to solve that optimization problem to a satisfying degree in the remaining time he has available.

I would have been happy with them playing it safe (playing tropes straight) if they really wanted to finish it within the few episodes. I.e. the night king remains the big bad till the end of the season, e.g. Jon kills him with a flaming sword in a final big battle. Dany gets the throne (and then burns it symbolically) or dies heroically against the white walkers. Bran uses his time warping powers to buy off the golden company or something from Cercei and perhaps tries to control the night kings dragon. Arya or Jaime kill Cersei (Arya also gets a last minute save by Nymeria and her pack). A bit underwhelming and not clever, but servicable and entertaining (like Marvel movies).

But somehow they tried to emulate the storytelling of earlier seasons, just infinitely more rushed and ... failed. Maybe they tried to follow what GRRM told them would happen? Idk.

Imagine: You start in a seemingly-infinite 3D world similar to Minecraft. You can travel Up, Down, North, or South with only the normal gameplay happening. If you travel East, however, you start to notice something: the boundaries between North and South are closing in, and you eventually reach a point where you are in a seemingly-infinite /2D/ world.

Again, you can explore Up and Down with only the (new) normal gameplay, but traveling East begins to restrict your options as the floor and ceiling converge. Once they reach each other, you are in a 1D world.

Finally, you can travel East far enough and reach a singular room at the end of the universe. It contains everything in one point, and is a truly 0D experience.

--------------

If you travel West from 3Dland, you don't reach 4Dland, instead you find an infinite expanse of non-euclidean space like [[https://zenorogue.itch.io/hyperrogue][Hyperrogue]]. "East" and "West" are now inadequate descriptors, but you can escape from reality by going West far enough (don't get turned around!) and return to 3Dland by going East (/exactly/ East. Don't miss.).

** I almost never have nightmares, but when I do, they're always "physical dreams." Like, if a "vivid dream" is an accurate experience of your visual sense, a "physical dream" is an accurate experience of your vestibular sense (equilibrioception) and your kinesthetic sense (proprioception) and is usually also vivid. As far as I understand it, a "lucid dream" is usually both vivid and physical, so basically what I'm calling a "physical dream" except with the addition of also being aware that you're dreaming. I never break through into awareness during a physical dream, even when it's not a nightmare. And when the physical dream /is/ a nightmare, it's never about fear or any other emotion, it's just /pain/.

The worst one in terms of pain was the first one. I was standing in a room, and then my body went stiffly rigid and I rose about a foot off the floor. My head stayed where it was in space (maybe 7ish feet off the ground) and pointed forwards and upright, y'know, maintaining its normal spatial orientation... but the rest of my body slowly curled up backwards until my feet were in front of my face. Then "I" turned around (by that point I "knew" with dream logic that my body had been possessed by a demon) and then "I" floated out the door then turned and floated towards another door, and then I woke up. I could physically feel my body being contorted the whole time, and it fucking /HURT/, but the whole thing probably lasted less than 90 seconds.

I had another nightmare a few months later. I was standing in front of a door, and it started to open and I "knew" with dream logic that some sort of malevolent entity was on the other side, so I grabbed the doorknob with both hands and squeezed/gripped as hard as I could and pulled backwards as hard as I could, and I was fighting to keep it shut and it kept pulling open just a little bit and I had to keep pulling backwards like playing tug of war with the door, and I could FEEL my forearms just /burning/ with strain. It probably only lasted less than a minute.

I went a while without having another nightmare, and this one was comparatively mild. I was sitting in the backseat of a car that was driving through a graveyard that was very large with lots of hills, and then I felt myself being pulled down through the car into the ground. I "knew" with dream logic that it was the dead people trying to drag me down to hell. It was really short. The thing that makes me classify these things as nightmares isn't the content, it's the physical sensation. There's not even an emotional response, these things never make me feel afraid, it's just physical pain and then waking up soaked in adrenaline.

The last one was several months ago. Maybe January? Anyways, I dreamt that I was lying in bed in my bedroom from the house that I lived in from ages 3 to 19. My eyes were closed, but I knew where I was. I felt a presence. There was a door to the outside next to the window, which dream logic just accepted as normal because brains are stupid globs of jelly-flesh. The door opened. I "knew" with dream logic that whatever had opened the door intended to kill me. I kept my eyes closed and immediately started "believing" that it was my younger brother because "sneaking in through /my/ door" was a thing he would do sometimes so my parents wouldn't catch him (which is absolutely false and has zero basis in reality, but I was intentionally "believing" it because I "knew" that the entity could hear my thoughts and would attack immediately if It knew that I knew It was there; think HPMOR's description of an Occlumency barrier or the thing Mrs. Coulter does near the end of The Amber Spyglass). I laid there with my eyes closed pretending to believe that it was my younger brother, while the entity walked over to the side of my bed. I jerked up and swung to the left to try to start hitting/pushing/fighting the entity. The dream ended probably literally less than 2 seconds later, but in that brief window of time, I vividly saw a full-on skeleton with glowing eyes and sharp teeth, and it started *biting* my hands and my forearms, and I could physically feel the teeth penetrating my flesh. I woke up and I could feel the adrenaline soaking into my muscles, especially in the forearm area. I just so happened to be facing left with my arms outstretched, in almost the exact same position I had been in during the biting. I got up to pee, then looked at the clock and it was like 4:30am. I'd only been asleep for like 4 or 5 hours, but idk if you've ever tried to go sleep immediately after a surge of adrenaline but it just doesn't work so I just stayed up.

I have vivid dreams severals of times a week, sometimes 3 or 4 times in a single night and always at least twice a week, if not 3 or 4 times a week, and once every three to five weeks I'll have a "physical dream" where I can feel my body, and the content of those is almost always, like, I've discovered a new way of jumping. Usually it's something like either jumping straight up 10 feet, then when I land jump immediately and it's like 20 feet straight up, and repeat that until I'm 50+ feet in the air, or alternatively I'll "discover" how to jump while running and each bound get between 10 and 30 feet vertical but go forwards like 50 feet every time I jump and it feels like flying, and those ones are just radical. The jumping is always weird and different (though usually it falls into one of those two broad categories of jumping high or jumping long) and I can feel my hamstrings actually doing the jumping, and I can feel the same type of sense of acceleration as if the little hairs in my inner ear were wibbling around IRL. If the tradeoff for that is that once every 7 to 15 months I have to experience the sensation of a demon ripping my body apart, and a genie told me he could permanently poof away the "physical dream" nightmares but the rest of the dream stuff would go away too, I don't think I'd take him up on it.

That's freaking terrifying. I'm sorry you have nightmares like that; most of my nightmares tend to be boring "I Won't Make the Rent in Time" sorts of dreams.

The ability to fly and throw Ki blasts makes my fantastic dreams less nightmarish, almost no matter what happens in them. Being able to fly is my lucid dream indicator. It is not as mundane as light switches or as dangerous as checking mirrors, but I find it convenient. As far as I can tell most people in my day to day life never notice me checking if I can fly with a thought.

*** The only time I ever experienced pain in a dream was a similar situations, demons and all that. In my case it was related to sleep paralysis.

Normally I can maintain a pretty good separation between my real body and my imagined body, that time I found I couldn't move either. After warning me about the dangers of "exploring the dreaming realm" the creature decided to "teach me a lesson". Eventually I managed to get around those restrictions by influencing the environment, having an employee of the building we were in sneak up behind it and hit it.

At that point I was able to move again and quickly woke myself up.

If you find yourself lucid enough you might try just occupying another body, after all you're already disembodies, right? You could also try moving an imaginary body while you're awake, to help you find that line between your real body and what you're imagining in a dream. Ideally you'd be able to feel both.

I hear video games can help people with nightmares, I suspect that's because it's getting you used to controlling a body that isn't tied to your real body, although in your case I worry that kind of thing might affect the physicality of your dreams.

When I was 3 and 4, I was /really good at dreaming/. Like, I could just decide before bed to dream and I'd do so, and it was even more like real life than the dreams I have nowadays. At some point around 4, I started having sleep paralysis, though I didn't know that's what it was or that other people experienced it until more than a decade later. I never saw humanoid shapes or felt something sitting on my chest or any of that common sleep paralysis stuff. I'd be lying in bed and feel like I hadn't gone to sleep yet, and dozens and dozens of what my 4-year-old brain decided to label as "pirates" would enter the room through the door. The "pirates" were circles - not spheres, circles - with staticky writhing outlines, and they moved along 2-D surfaces like the walls and the dresser/mirror and the ceiling. If I had to guess I'd say they were between 9 and 15 inches wide, and they mostly stayed towards the far end of the room. Of course I was very afraid of them.

At some point all that stopped and I didn't really dream particularly often for the next 15ish years, maybe once every month or two, and they weren't that vivid when I had them. However, for at least 5 years after the "pirates," I would hear voices that sounded like the living room TV was on, but it wasn't. I felt uneasy dread while listening the voices. Apparently hearing voices is another symptom of sleep paralysis.

#+begin_quote
  after all you're already disembodied, right?
#+end_quote

Nope, I definitely feel like I'm physically embodied in these dreams, that's what makes it feel so disturbing. It doesn't feel like sleep paralysis at all, it's not like I can feel my body lying in bed but it's paralyzed, I can feel my "dream body" exactly like IRL and everything that it does (or that is done to it).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Definitely. I've had plenty of dreams that /could/ have been nightmares, but I don't count them as such. They're like "action dreams." Situations that ought to be scary and ought to make me run away, I just play along with it and fight. Like, it's been about a year since the last time I had one of these dreams, probably because I sold my xbox like a year and a half ago, but I used to occasionally have CoD Nazi Zombies dreams where I was running around weird Escherian buildings and not even shooting the zombies, just running away from and jumping over them. I had a dream once where I was in a pizza place sitting at the table and the waiter started trying to assault me with a gun, and I ran away into the kitchen and he was chasing me, but then I turned around and started fighting him and grabbed him and started doing that "jumping over and over and getting higher and higher each time" thing and just slamming the guy into the ground every time I touched down. There was one that started off kinda scary that involved being underwater and being repeatedly charged head-on by a shark, but every time I'd just put out my hands and grab it by the nose and bounce backwards off it, and after a short time there was a "scene change" and I was suddenly just sitting on a populated beach and the dream continued like a normal dream. Situations still occasionally happen in dreams, but it's rare, and when it happens I don't really feel fear because I'm never not in control of the situation.

I have a theory that the "occasionally feeling my body get ripped apart by a demon in my sleep" thing is due to the "mind-muscle connection" thing (focusing 100% of your attention on /feeling the muscle/ as you expand/contract it). I started lifting weights just about exactly 4 years ago. The first weird "physical dream" happened a little over a year later, a few months after I started "getting it" and really working out properly instead of flailing around like a noob. I recentlyish went about 15 months (maybe?) without lifting weights due to physical/health issues and moving into an inconvenient living situation, but I started back up again about 5 months ago around the end of December or beginning of January, and the latest one with the skeleton biting me happened within six weeks of starting to lift again, in like February. So idk. It's not like I'm gonna stop lifting, even if I had a /severe/ injury that sidelined me for like 5 years, I'd still start up again when I eventually recovered, I'm gonna lift until I'm in my fukin 80s (assuming I make it that long).

*** I've been informed that the knowledge that you can feel pain in dreams is a minor infohazard, so you may want to add something to the effect of that at the top of your comment. Knowing this community, it won't do anything, but I think it may be best to have a warning up anyway.

If you want to stop the nightmares, I believe the techniques for lucid dreaming will help. They helped me, at any rate. Keep a dream journal, make it a habit to write in it immediately upon waking up, note down comment elements of a dream, make it a habit to pause and do a reality check every so often or upon seeing one of these elements---all that good stuff. By making reality checks a habit, you increase the chances that you'll do one in a dream as well. And then you'll be in control. When facing nightmares with full awareness, I tend to subvert them instead of just blasting them away or something. For example, I might make the ogre with knives for hands have a slightly dumb but caring personality, and give him a backstory, and alter his appearance a bit to match. Do these changes often enough and they'll stick eventually even when you're not aware you're dreaming.

Hope that helps.

******* Unfortunately I know of no widespread study done on it. It is indeed rare, enough so that it's hard to gather a significant amount of people for more than a case study. Still, experiences do tell us something, and I am not the only one to have experiences with the phenomenon. Someone I know has experienced it after hearing the information, and while that's not ironclad proof it does square with what else we know of how dreams work.

Lucid Dreaming, by Stephen LaBerge, is a great book if you want to know more about the subject in general.

**** I read a few things before posting that comment.

Dream pain is /exceptionally/ uncommon. It's even more uncommon than being able to taste or smell during a dream, which is something like less than 1%. Loads of people know that /that/ is physically possible, yet none of them spontaneously start being able to smell or taste as a result of that knowledge.

Given that people don't start experiencing dream pain just by having been exposed to the knowledge that it's within the realm of possibility, I don't agree that it qualifies as an infohazard. Who informed you that it's an infohazard and what qualifies them to make such an assertion? Because the people who research this stuff for a living say that dream pain is a result of things like getting a cramp while you're asleep or having pins and needles from lying in such a way that you cut off circulation to a limb, or a result of chronic pain. The conditions necessary to produce dream pain (somatosensory stimulation like pressure or pain) /will/ produce dream pain regardless of whether or not the person exposed to those conditions is aware of that possibility, and it doesn't happen in the absence of somatosensory stimulation unless you've been targeted by .

EDIT:

Um, /targeted by/ .

EDIT:

Hmm...

I was just trying to be creepy there at the end, the pain dreams really did happen exactly as described.

***** Hey, I am Lightwavers source, thanks to Noumero for paging me.

I did get the first and only pain dreams in my life after being told that dream pain knowledge can be contagious by a friend, duration about a week, mild pain. Since then I've sent out word to 80 people here on [[/r/rational]] and asked them to please report back to me either positive and negative status. One third of people reported back, mostly negative.

3 were already naturally experiencing the phenomenon, so we have ridiculously high baserate here on the sub or rolled REALLY well with the small survey size. Two reported having started pain dreams.

One of these described their experience as "extreme pain, one week of pure torture".

Ergo: low infection rate (lower than naturally occuring), shortness of experienced period seems pretty safe, but the one outlier of "extreme pain" makes me wary to go parade this around.

I'm sure I could find dozens and dozens more, but I think I've made my point.

This seems to be a "prominent" lucid dreaming website:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/can-you-feel-pain-in-lucid-dreams.html]]
#+end_quote

They don't seem to have any problem propagating that information.

According to this...

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298430929_The_Nature_and_Prevalence_of_Pain_in_Dreams]]
#+end_quote

... close to 50% of people report having experienced dream pain at least once, which is much more in line with the abundance of self-reporting across reddit than whatever other thing I read that implanted the "rarer than 1%" idea in my head, probably this:

[[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d277/b3611b5dc060b219fc8f9d1bc1a47c949a19.pdf]]

Another article citing 1%:

  [[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4c1a/47dd3d548d872c96cd0bfa80788088117b40.pdf][Although some theorists have suggested that pain sensations cannot be part of the dreaming world, research has shown that pain sensations occur in about 1% of the dreams in healthy persons and in about 30% of patients with acute, severe pain.]]
#+end_quote

They /could/ be compatible, if 50 out of 100 people reported having had at least one pain dream but 5000 total dreams were recorded (ie 50 dreams recorded per person).

**************** Wow. You really /are/ dense. Lemme try rewording that since you seem to be having a hard time with it.

#+begin_quote
  At the beginning of the study, 185 people were told that it is possible to feel pain in a dream.

  91 of those people reported that they had had a pain dream at some point in their life before the study began.

  16 people had a pain dream over the course of the study.

  16 is 17.6% of 91.
#+end_quote

All 16 of those people could've been from the group that hadn't had a pain dream before. I doubt it, because I suspect that people prone to it are prone to it and people not prone to it aren't prone to it, but I'll grant that to you for the sake of argument. That would've meant that 17.6% of the newly-informed people experienced a pain dream after having been exposed to the information that it is possible to experience a pain dream. /But 50% of people experience pain dreams at some point in their lives./ Do you see the problem there? Hint: 17 is less than 50.

You latched onto something you thought was a "gotcha!" quote, and utterly failed to acknowledge the most important part.

Within the group of "people with severe burns or chronic pain," roughly 30% of their dreams are pain dreams. That's about the same as experimentally induced pain dreams caused by purposefully cutting off a subject's circulation with a blood pressure cuff.

Within the group of "people who experience pain dreams not caused by somatosensory stimulation," like 1% of their dreams are pain dreams. [My own original thinking, not part of any studies mentioned: Any given dream has a 1% or lower chance of being a pain dream. Most people don't have very good dream recall. It's entirely possible that literally every human has pain dreams, and the 50% who report having had pain dreams are just people who have better dream recall than average.]

Within the group of "people who experienced a pain dream over the course of the study we're discussing," 1 out of 16 of their dreams was a pain dream. 1 dream is the minimum. You can't have half a dream. Therefore, 6% is the lowest it would've been physically possible to record. You'd have to have 96 or 104 recorded dreams to get down to one dream being 1%. If they were having an average of 8 dreams a week, that would've required running the study for 12 or 13 weeks. They ran it for two weeks. Feel free to approach a scientist and ask them to try to replicate the study but run it for 3 months instead of 2 weeks, but they're going to give you an emphatic and resounding "NO," so for now this study is the best you're going to get, and there's still the fact that only 8.6% of the participants had a pain dream even though 50% of the participants had had one before in their lives and all of them were primed with the knowledge that it's possible to experience a pain dream.

At this point you're just being willfully ignorant.

******* A) Its of course only a infohazard here under [[/r/rational]] type folks. Most people aren't even familiar with the concept of an infohazard, let alone do they register the strong emotional response that for some of us are intuitive.

I suspect that the strong emotional response to this type of information is also responsible for it; you react in your sleep to this distressing event by dreaming about it, similar to other stressful events in ones life.

B) Its also an incredibly light hazard. Infection rates are rather low, length of acute infection is short (1 week or so), inflicted pain is pretty low. The one outlier does warrant a bit more caution in my opinion. But then I am very pain averse, and people who cheat on their partners in monogamous relationships or pig factory farmers inflict much more pain than a successful transmission every single day without a care in the world.

3) It is a psychological phenomenon, and self-reporting is the main and only practical route for detecting these in the first place. I get that you are sceptical and of course I'd love to see a goldstandard study with large N done on it.

I have experienced this, as has my friend who told me about it >10 years ago. I have no written record of my dream back then, and could have fabricated that too. Some others who I do not know personally have reported these experiences back to me. Still, epistemic and evidence status from outside view: questionable.

***** I do have evidence that this qualifies as an infohazard (a minor one, for the reasons you mentioned, but still). Someone I know did not experience pain in his dreams before learning about it. Now, he was able to lucid dream, so it may not be as easy to transfer the hazard as simply telling someone the information. It is still a risk, though.

Now as to being able to taste or smell, is that figure reported by people or examined more directly? What I know says it's the former, since every human on Earth dreams, even if they forget them easily, and the experiences tend to feel more real under certain circumstances. Everyone should be able to learn to experience with every sense during dreams. It takes practice and effort, but someone would need to have an exceptionally alien brain to not even be /able/ to.

That has nothing to do with how many people can smell or feel in a dream, it's the percent of all dreams with that sort of content. 50% of people have had at least one dream where they experienced real pain.

So they told like 200 people "hey, it's possible to have pain in your dreams" and like 100 of them had had dream pain at least once before in their lives, and even with that priming, fewer than 20 people had /one single pain dream/ out of 17 dreams over a period of two weeks. Only 17.6 percent of the number of people who had experienced a pain dream before in their lives had another one after being told it was possible.

18 out of 3045 is 0.6%. Why did the number of pain dreams recorded in this study resemble the number of pain dreams recorded in the general population? If your assertion were correct, we would expect the number of pain dreams in this study to be higher because this was a population of people who were /explicitly/ informed that it's possible to have a pain dream.

EDIT:

There are two things I'd like to head off preemptively.

#+begin_quote
  "Two females had /two pain dreams each/"
#+end_quote

Yeah I left out some stuff about how females are statistically more likely to experience pain dreams than are males, the study is seven pages long, can't include literally /everything/.

#+begin_quote
  1 pain dream out of 16 recorded dreams is 6%. 6% is /WAY HIGHER/ than 1%.
#+end_quote

One dream is the minimum. You can't have half a dream. Therefore, 6% is the lowest it would've been physically possible to record. You'd have to have 96 or 104 recorded dreams to get down to one dream being 1%. If they were having an average of 8 dreams a week, that would've required running the study for 12 or 13 weeks. They ran it for two weeks. Feel free to approach a scientist and ask them to try to replicate the study but run it for 3 months instead of 2 weeks, but they're going to give you an emphatic and resounding "NO," so for now this study is the best you're going to get, and there's still the fact that only 8.6% of the participants had a pain dream even though 50% of the participants had had one before in their lives and all of them were primed with the knowledge that it's possible to experience a pain dream.

** Does anyone know of good resources for ornate fonts? I don't mean fancy fonts or calligraphy, but rather the very elaborate letters you sometimes see at the beginning of a chapter which are as big as the following paragraph. Those are called drop caps and I was hoping to find examples of them for research.

*** The greatest example I know of are in the original language Never Ending Story. Every chapter starts with the next letter of the alphabet, takes a whole page, and is incorporated in beautiful chapter-relevant artwork.

** Has anyone seen the new Aladdin movie? I watched it yesterday and kept thinking how ripe for munchkinry that simple premise can be. The movie itself exploits that potential a bit more as for example, Jafar being turned into a genie is the result of Genie interpreting the wish in a clever way, rather than his exact wording. Well, the movie isn't great or anything, but it made me wish there was a rational Aladdin or generally One Thousand and One Nights kind of setting story.
