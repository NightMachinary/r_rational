** Hmm. I notice that it's not following the canon rule of morphs not being able to be acquired from other morphs, which makes me wonder if there are other rules which don't apply in this story (Visser Three thinks about bacterial morphs, for example, which aren't supposed to be available in canon).

I /really/ like the self-morph hack. It's even supported by canon (ignoring the acquire-from-morph rule)!

*** No, Visser Three explicitly mentioned the no acquiring while in morph rule during the previous chapter, so I'm pretty sure the acquiring just happened when they weren't morphed as each other.

***** But in canon you can't acquire while you are morphed either. Remember all the trouble Tobias went through to acquire the dolphin? It would have been so much easier if he could just morph a human and acquire it like the others.

****** That doesn't apply here. When Jake acquires his long nailed form from Marco, Jake is not morphed, Marco is. The equivalent in your scenario would be if one of the other group members morphed into a dolphin, and then Tobias acquired the morph from them

** Well I just bombed through all 7 chapters in one afternoon and oh holy crap yes. And yet also several points where I want to metaphorically slap the characters about a bit for being stupid (in entirely believable/realistic ways, but /still/)

Especially Rachel in Ch3, revealing way too much to the enemy - you do /not/ just casually give up the element of surprise, put the entire opposing faction on high alert against morphing opponents and then not even mention it to the others... not if you have any intentions of winning the war. Also got the Chapman's killed, so yeah, /great job Rach/.

Personal sympathies currently situated with Marco, who seems to be the only one who /really/ "gets" the idea of being serious about the situation because you are fighting a goddamn war against bodysnatching aliens. Tobias seems to think he gets it, but for my money he's too far deep into his distrust of everyone to realise that splintering the group, even if the group is suboptimal, is not improving the situation.

Honestly not sure how far regular-grade humans can be expected to get against actually-competent yeerks. Seems like they're already reeling from what amounts to a causal backhand from a couple of yeerks who didn't even know what they were doing; if Visser 3 is full-on /intelligent/ I do not see an outcome where they are anything less than flattened.

***** I mean, Jake to an extent already got an Ellimist upgrade in the form of his "automatically subconsciously integrate all data available to him and spit out valid seeming conclusions".

It's not unreasonable for a person to be able to do, but as presented, it's still an extremely high improbability. Remember though that the Ellimist hand picked each member of the team (at least in canon) for some special ability they have, making each person (save Rachel) a low probability character, so I'm willing to let it slide, and am in fact curious to see what abilities the others gain.

It's possible Marco will still have his Visser One mother, but I'm hoping Cassie being an Estreen will come with some more power upgrades (such as more interesting hybrid morph hacks).

Great chapter though, I enjoyed Jake's thinking, and how you depicted why he was the leader, and capable of remaining the leader, as opposed to him just slotting into it by default, or transferring it to Marco, who's more rationally minded.

  Marco was silent for a moment. ‹Just make me one promise,› he said finally. ‹If it turns out you are right, don't go nuts and start thinking you have some kind of spider sense, okay? Because right for the wrong reasons is only a tiny bit better than flat-out wrong.›
#+end_quote

But remember, Marco - the signature of a "right reason" is that it works consistently. /Anything/ that works consistently, even if only statistically, is structurally based on a /right reason/.

I guess what I'm saying is, don't throw out a working tool just because you don't understand how it works.

***** I mean, the animorphs canon really didn't leave much unexplored - as far as exploring the idea space and munchkin goes, they did it quite well - on the heroes side, at least, the aliens could likely have done far better with a bit of creativity and common sense. The divergences are all going to be plot or a result of different rules in this world , I doubt there's much in the way of unexplored hacks.

If there really were rogue +andilites+ Andalites then wouldn't they not have too much trouble going to a zoo a few cities over? Seems like an ineffective measure against them.

Come to think of it, isn't it +Andilite+ Andalite policy to just torch infected planets, Protoss style?
