Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** The main character of my serial can convert heat into kinetic energy and vice versa, and is able to store a lot of heat inside of himself (he's gotten up to 3k degrees Celsius).

In reality his power is actually absorbing vibrational energy of all kinds but for his current level of understanding he absorbs Heat and Kinetic, and can change them into each other.

What are some cool tricks he could pull as he figures his power out down the line?

*** *Flight*: Not just any flight, but almost perfect flight. No need to turn gradually. No need to accelerate gradually. No need to worry about momentum. Assuming he can convert kinetic to heat and back very quickly, he can do all kinds of crazy stunts like instantly stopping, instantly changing directions, and staying perfectly still without any need to generate lift.

*Superspeed*: Just apply your flight ability while staying on the ground.

*Physical and Temperature Invulnerability*: Any kind of attack that deals damage using physical force, heat, or cold can be nullified just by converting its energy away. The only limiting factor is how fast your MC can convert one energy type into another. The amount of energy he can store isn't much of an issue since he can funnel the excess energy into firing stuff away from him at super speeds.

*Ridiculously Maneuverable Vehicles*: One reason we don't have super fast vehicles is the squishiness of the driver. If the vehicle accelerates or turns too fast, the driver will be crushed by the forces exerted on the human body to change its speed and direction. The reason this kills the driver is that the particles that make up his body will have different amounts of kinetic energy, causing them to squish together or tear apart. Your MC will have no such issues if he can distribute the kinetic energy equally to every part of his body (he can't just convert it all to heat, or he blast out of the vehicle). Then again, your MC probably doesn't need the vehicle other than as a nice way to carry things with him.

*Super-strength*: Sort of? You can give objects kinetic energy to make them move upwards or throw them really hard. You can absorb their downwards kinetic energy to make them float in midair. It isn't quite the same as having super-strength, but you will be able to act as if you do have super-strength.

**** Thanks for your awesome breakdown. Some of these I've planned and considered, outside of the car idea (he's still figuring things out right now: he's learning the physical and temperature invulnerability, some super speed, loves to launch himself around but hasn't quite figured out flight yet, and uses the "sort-of" super strength as his main go-to), but the super crazy body horror ones I had NO FUCKING CLUE WOW WHAT THE FUCK.

**** If his fine control is good enough he should be able to survive without breathing for some fairly absurd periods of time (eventually he would need oxygen for collagen production type of time scales) by selectively exciting atoms sufficient to break their bonds and positioning them via vibration/motion in such a way that they fall into a shape that supports the chemical chain he wants.

Given sufficient finesse and scope of awareness he should be able to do transmutation of materials short of actually making atoms. Although if you consider 'temperature' to be a vibration it should also be possible for him to also instigate fission and fusion reactions by 'shaking' neutrons and atomic nuculi into each other.

What I'm saying is that with enough control he should be able to make a sun happen.

****** So, the basic conceit is he's a clone of a superhero who had total energy conversion/absorption/immunity, but only ended up with the vibrational energy conversion (So heat, force, etc) but didn't get electromagnetic energy at all. He can't manipulate gravitational forces (though the actual kinetic energy of falling he can use) or electricity.

I've limited how fine his control over his power is by his book smarts: he doesn't understand enough fundamental physics to make full use of a lot of his powers (Yet!) but the more he learns, the finer his control gets. He can't fly yet because it hasn't clicked that he could just constantly reconvert the kinetic energy of falling into energy that would propel him in flight.

*** I would like to comment that it's not heat itself per se that provides work, but rather temperature differences. For example, if there was magic that could instantly cool an area down, then it would be able to power a steam engine just as well as a magic that could heat up an area. It's just that it's normally a lot easier/faster to heat up something than cooling it down. I got the idea from a comment someone mentioned on the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] discord.

He recently figured out how to absorb kinetic energy (so when something hits him, instead of taking the force he can now turn that into heat) and re-purpose it.

With the ability to absorb kinetic energy (on touch?) you can block any weapon, then release the energy to send it springing back into it's owner. However this violates conservation of momentum.

Use your massive genius to get very rich online using many different clones (with altered appearances) of yourself (all altered to the limit of intelligence which includes social intelligence), for obvious reasons these clones would also differ from you in having fanatical devotion to the cause and spending all their energy on that. Then start creating as many fake identities for your clones as possible while also having many clones pose as people without legal records such as refugees, homeless children, etc and then use their incredible skills to get special citizenships (or just buy them). In addition we will adopt the identities of many missing people as well as just bodysnatch some extremely morally despicable people. Plus in many parts of the world where people don't all have good government records I can probably ratchet up the number of created clones.

Anyway pretty soon you will have hundreds of thousands of versions of yourself across the globe rapidly using their intelligence to accumulate trillions of dollars collectively. All communication will be done using anonymous means in a novel security focused conlang of your creation and the language used will change on occasion.\\
We will use this money to build complexes where we have giant brain like masses which will experience say 10x thinking speed and have effectively thousands of minds making them up. These minds will be hooked up to the internet with very fast interfaces and will rapidly become experts in basically every single potentially useful topic. The mobile clones of myself will then be able to gain expertise in any useful topics by physically merging their brains with these larger masses for a time, or incorporating "brain pieces" into themselves. Plus of course once the brain masses rapidly learned all of human knowledge they would begin working on doing new work in those areas, using my money to fund (likely secret) experiments if necessary.

By now you might be able to start seeing how this is going.. I will begin be rapidly possessing tech decades or centuries ahead of the rest of the world. I will also start body snatching many people in positions of power, copying their memories and keeping the original bodiless in the brain-masses. We will be researching AI pretty early on so we can change our mind design and get access to an order of magnitude or more thinking speed thus speeding up to near singularity levels. Within a decade we will be able to manage a nearly bloodless global cou using lot's of extremely advanced tech and mass surveillance.\\
With all the tech we have we should be able to create a post-scarcity post-singularity utopia immediately and well at that point you (and all of humanity that shares your values) has won.

If you start out being able to perfectly control genetics things happen faster: You rapidly speed up your cognition drastically upgrading your neurons to a biological fiber optic equivalent. Your brain masses are thus able to develop stuff like advance nanotech pretty quickly using your own cells and molecular machinery as a basis. You can then spread this pathogen/nanite swarms across the globe infecting everybody with it. Then use this as a form of mind control (though preferably stopping them from making their body perform crimes rather than just brainwashing them) and suddenly you can skip right ahead to the post-singularity utopia step at the end of the previous plan. Though of course it's possible with the right genetic engineering these plan might look the same with one only taking a few years longer than the other.

Other of your race have the same abilities like you. You can also modify your own body horns, fur, more muscle, different height or colour is save. Tails or claws can get tricky. Organ fuctions should be tested on a clone. And of course someone else already figured out, how not to age.

Knowledge limitation:

*You can basically give your creations anything animals have. (like electric eels, poision, venom, lizards throwaway tails) if you have the blueprints. (lets say for this exercise you have them)

*your race can analyse and copy unknown DNA, but you would need research time (weeks or months) to know which part does what.

*Everything a machine can do, your creations can probably duplicate less efficient. don't forget, real physics (biological guns couldn't shoot as fast and big projectiles as ones made of steel, also ammunition/gun powder would be external or need time and energy to grow.) You could give your creations the ability to communicated via wifi/radio, but only over short distances. (still needs calories)

Which means it's very likely that the first person to get started on this undergoes a sort of biological foom, rapidly reaching insane levels of eldritch intelligence and producing complex cells which can construct the first generation of self replicating nanobots after all there's no reason you can't use your control of biology to create something better than biology.\\
If no one eldritch horror gets a decisive edge early on one may win out over time or likely there will be many superintelligences vying for power, however that may not be ideal for obvious Moloch related reasons.

Anyway since the first people to increase their own intelligence rapidly probably won't be doing it slowly and carefully, one can imagine the superintelligences that arise immediately will be extremely alien due to extreme value drift in the improvement of their own mind.

*TLDR*: A bunch of people turn themselves into eldritch horrors and overtake the planet within the week of this power becoming available.

**** well time line is way off (years), rapid changes to the brain isn't a smart move (they will die) and since it is in a world with real world physics, they wouldn`t develop supernatural powers (or do you mean something different with eldritch horror?)

but other than that, how would they take over the planet (and why)?

***** Given you already mention fixing aging and other complex traits I was imagining they start with some good knowledge.

However even if they don't they can still get started pretty quickly by copying the neurology of geniuses until they find a way to reliably produce it. Then once most everyone in the world is a genius you expect that research would go extremely quickly. After many people likely realize the incredible stakes here so some people would be killing hundreds of clones in order to test out neurological improvements (for instance birds have vastly denser and more efficient brains than us) and every time they found something that works they could immediately use that to speed up their research speed with their new enhanced intelligence.\\
It's hard to say exactly how long that process would take compared to if they started with a lot of genetic/neurological knowledge however it might reasonably happen in a few years. Plus it might be highly exponential so once the first group made enough progress (and enhanced their intelligence enough) it's possible it might speed up from there into something resembling a foom, after all relatively small neurological changes can be pretty dramatic in their effects.

****** still just a way to make yourself smarter.

okay you do that and i research how to make a minion (maybe dogs or kamikaze birds) obey and mass produce them as fast as possible and order them to kill everyone who does something similar.

then or maybe as soon as I find them, i kill everyone who tries to improve themself

of course who wins would depend who has more calories and how long each approach would take. (also at what point will someone kill everything with a virus, so better to assassinate everyone secretly)

another problem is, that testing a new Idea will always take the same time (the clone becoming an adult). so even if you got lucky with your brain modification, and could come up with new ideas every day, you wouldn`t be able to see if they are really save for a long time

sorry i don't want to be mean, but I think the promises of the singularity highly unlikely. More brainpower will not solve all problems and doesn`t mean you will be in a position, to leverage your brainpower.

also I doubt what society calls a genius is really visible in the DNA. Of course there are some factors that work at least negatively, maybe even a few that would give more brainpower, but it is mostly training which someone makes good.

honestly I expected more of the kind of: make microorganism that make sugar with electricity instead of light -> cheap calories

or put spider silk under your skin ( some claim that would make you bullet resistant)

or find out how to move information directly into the brain (no more schools and easy propaganda tool if it is not direct mind control)

Given any intelligence improvements will probably be done in secret (you don't want other people to get your research) that plan doesn't remotely work. Also that plan couldn't remotely work for quite a while anyway, since you would need a super long time to make swarms of weaponized animals that obeyed you, since you have to figure out all the genetics the hard way.

See I thought the incubator could create full grown clones of you. If it can only function as an artificial womb then this setting is starting to sound basically like real life except with slightly better gene editing and artificial wombs.

See that seems like it has nothing to do with genetics here since no other animals transfer memories like that so there's no genes to copy and creating something like that from scratch is likely to be harder than something like intelligence enhancement.

Given IQ is 80% heritable you don't need to know what you're doing at first, just copy genetics from existing geniuses. Then you can figure out more advanced stuff later once you're already a genius.
