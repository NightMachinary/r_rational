Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Alternate universe ratfic for real life: instead of inventing basic and syllogistic symbolic logic by focusing on rhetoric, the Ancient Greek philosophers invented focused on gambling, divination, oracles, and prediction as the foundation of logic. They invent logic as prediction, probability, and statistics /from the ground up/.

Basically, what Neal Stephenson novel comes out of this?

** So, my partner is finally beta-reading my supernatural romance novel, and he reads /very/ analytically, so he's been a god-send for levelling up the rationality of the story, and I don't feel guilty about making someone read 50k of gay supernatural romance because, you know, he's my partner and humoring me with this sort of thing is his job.

Here's some examples of the things he's caught that will improve the rationality of this story:

- Human Love Interest acts too intelligent, both IQ-wise and socially: turns out it's kind of hard for two millennial women to write a 1940s steel mill worker? Subject to revision.

- Vampire seems to be lacking some very obvious insight, e.g. being easily able to interpret human body language and mental states, finding out the Human's Big Secret because of his resources and connections, consenting to ultimatums made by weaker people that are obviously to his detriment. Fortunately, fairly easy to fix.

- He thought one chapter was hitting the reader over the head with an analogy/metaphor that I didn't get from it when writing it, but in retrospect is a pretty cool metaphor. Turns out sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but hey, maybe in this case the cigar isn't just a cigar.

- Vampire gives Human a silver dagger in one scene, saying it's to defend himself from a rival vampire. There's no situation in which Human attacking the rival vampire with a silver dagger is /in any way/ remotely helpful. So why would Vampire give Human the dagger? I like the dagger scene so I kind of don't want to have to remove it, but you know, kill your darlings and all that...

- Human, who is on the run from the law, after briefly using an alias, uses his real name in public for the rest of the story. Now updated to have him continue using the alias.

- Human's Special Talent is being very good at vampire, uh, coded communication (do your tie a certain way and it means something, wear a certain colour of shirt and it means something, etc). Vampire's first assumption seems to be that Human has a Special Talent rather than Human has been coached/dressed/etc by a rival vampire. This needs to be addressed.

I don't know why I'm sharing this, but here you go. I guess it's a testament to the power of beta reading by analytical readers.

EDIT: turns out writing the above gave me plot bunnies that [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAzhlM60MqHzWzpG9wCxAhv2sQaSnwWQXHBVTqxUq6g/edit?usp=sharing][made me write an interlude]] that does quite a lot to enhance the early part of my story, so thank you, general rationality thread for existing!

Does the person giving the silver dagger have an incentive to lie, even if non maliciously? This could be security theater - "Don't worry dear, your blanket will totally protect you from the storm."

**** Thanks for your thoughts! The problem is, if the human (Red) uses the silver dagger on the dangerous vampire (Elodia), it's going to cause a hell of a lot of problems for the vampire who gave him the dagger (William).

Like, in other words, let's say Elodia tries to kill Red. If Red draws the silver dagger on her, it makes things worse: not only has Red done whatever made Elodia want to kill him, but now he's trying to kill her with a silver dagger (which he doesn't know is harmless to a vampire). So he's in more trouble than before. The best course of action for him in this situation is to shut up and let William handle it.

And why would William give Red a dagger, tell him it was harmful to vampires, when it really isn't? It means William is telling a lie that could very well lead to Red being killed.

My partner suggested that it be part of a vampire ritual (they like their rituals), to give a human a silver dagger as a gesture of trust, for the dual purposes of making the human feel trusted and for also perpetrating the myth that silver hurts vampires. It's less a "use this on other vampires" and more of a "I trust you so much I am going to tell you My One Weakness and give you a way to exploit it".

In the end, whatever way you twist it, it seems you really have to /twist/ it to make it fit, so I think it's going to have to go.

****** 1) Tension: William is telling Red Elodia's upcoming visit is harmless, but then he gives Red a dagger to defend himself. This suggests it's maybe not so harmless, and, well, it isn't - Red very nearly gets killed due to what occurs. (This logic doesn't really work from William's PoV since the dagger is useless)

2) Worldbuilding/TWIST: I want readers to ask themselves, "why would a vampire give a vampire-deadly weapon to a human, no matter how much they like smooching that particular human?" so the eventual reveal that silver is harmless and that vampires decided to perpetrate the myth that it wasn't so their real weakness wasn't discovered makes people smile and nod and go "ah-ha! Now that dagger scene makes sense"

Like, I'm pretty sure that the scene isn't good enough to be worth trying to rescue. Any rescue job I did would probably make things worse since it would need twisting to get Rational'd.

I'm considering having Red worried, begging for a security blanket, and William finally just giving him a damn silver dagger and telling him under no circumstances to use it because he'll take better care of Red than a silver dagger could - but then I don't think it's right for William to lie that the beast of gevaudan was a vampire who was weak to silver. And Red is very, very trusting so he would probably accept William's repeated assurances that no weapon was necessary if that conversation were to occur.

--------------

The scene in question since it's short (optional):

--------------

Although his knowledge was far from perfect, he did feel prepared [for the other vampire to visit]. William had assured him that nothing bad would come of him, though the fact he felt a need to reassure Red was itself rather unnerving. More unnerving still was the dagger that William had given him: not the dainty stiletto that was meant to fend off pickpockets, no. This dagger had a strong, thick handle made of dark wood and a blade whose edge seemed to be as thin as a hair. More surprising still was the caution with which William stored it. It was not only in a small scabbard but in a secondary sheath, too. The sheath had an extra bit of fabric that looped around the quillons, preventing the weapon from being easily drawn. When William handed it to Red, he gently released the dagger from its sheath, revealing the shining silver blade.

“Though I doubt it will be necessary, I feel that it is only fair to provide you with a means to defend yourself from Duchess Elodia, should you require it.”

Red looked at the four inch blade and wondered what harm it could possibly do to a vampire. “Is it... magic?”

“No.” William gave an amused smile; it amazed him that to this starry-eyed human, everything seemed supernatural.

Red's mouth fell ever so slightly open as he made the connection. “It's not silver, surely?”

“It is, indeed.”

“But... I thought that was for werewolves?” Red asked, somewhat worried that William might somehow be offended by the comparison. He hadn't thought to ask William about other supernatural creatures; on some level, given vampires were real, he guessed that there must be griffins, mermaids, and werewolves lurking in the shadows. On another level, he knew that they had nothing to do with each other.

“The legend comes from The Beast of Gévaudan. That creature was one of us. Your legends turned him into a wolf.”

Red nodded; he would have to look up werewolves in his encyclopedia. “That makes sense.”

“I doubt you will require it,” William continued. “But one should always be cautious.”

Red nodded. He certainly would feel safer, with the now unsheathed dagger in a scabbard hidden in his clothing. But at the end of the day, this was just one of William's colleagues coming to visit. She would surely be patient and understanding, especially considering it was his first time appearing at such an event.

******* I actually like the scene and dialogue well enough: the safety blanket idea works for me, unless you think it's just too counter to his character to lie like that.

When you say you don't think it's "right," do you mean morally, or for his character? Because a little immorality can make characters more three dimensional and realistic :)

******** You're right, thank you. That said, making William /more/ immoral when, well, um, he's a vampire and regularly murders people and doesn't see any problem with slavery and is actually spending much of the story manipulating Red's feelings as his own feelings grow more genuine... it's a tough one. But I suppose the reader doesn't know Red's being lied to until far later on, it actually makes him look kind and trusting if you don't know any better.

Red feeling vulnerable and asking for a security blanket --> William gives him a silver knife because Vampires have a policy of Giving Trusted Humans Silver Weapons to Perpetrate the Myth, and to make him feel better --> William tells him not to use it, but explains the Gevaudan thing anyway.

Then in a later volume, Red can mention having the silver dagger as a way to protect him/them from a vampire, and William can apologise and tell him it's useless, but there is no way he can have power over a vampire and which would he honestly prefer (again, another lie: My Vampires are weak to gold, but like they'd tell a /soul/ about that!). Actually... we need something to happen to Red to have him consent to being turned into a Super Power Human From Vampire Blood, and a scare involving another vampire, and an impotent silver knife, could very well work.

I might try and rework the scene. A lot of Red's actions are motivated by fear of death, so begging for a weapon of sorts should be doable.

Thanks again!

Steelworker isn't meant to be particularly smart, and isn't except for a few places, so editing the problematic parts of dialogue (only a few lines here or there) isn't going to be a huge task.

*** I suspect the main thing is not to try to make it sound witty. If I was in the market for a partner I'd be looking for someone who actually likes rationality and optimisation and knows what that means, and while I may be in a minority there, I think it's the minority you're looking for interest from. Also I'd suggest toning down what you claim to be able to do and making it clear you know you make mistakes - so something more like 'I try to be less wrong' than, 'I prefer world optimization'.

** LW is said to be lower traffic now than it used to be. People talk about the Rationality Diaspora because lots of the community is on different sites (facebook, tumblr, ssc, like 5 different discords, several IRC channels, and some even still post on LW). A post about this:

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/n0l/lesswrong_20/]]

More recently and highly relevant:

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5z/on_the_importance_of_less_wrong_or_another_single/]]

Some say that it would be valuable for the rationalist communities to have a hub or a hinge, a more centralized site where they all intersect. Where a newcomer can find a well-organized set of introductory texts, but also see links to the latest and greatest of blog posts and articles. Some argue the that LW is the right place for this. Does this have value? Is it worth doing? What do you think?
