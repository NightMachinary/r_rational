  ‚Äú- we should run'. But then this guy was all like ‚ÄòYeah, you better run'. So, you know, I shot him in the eye. And I'm going to be honest with you here, Catherine, they didn't take well to that. At all.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWhat happened to your spirit of adventure?‚Äù I replied.

  ‚ÄúThat's a myth,‚Äù he said disdainfully, slapping away my hand. ‚ÄúFather's dissected several heroes and never found any trace of it.‚Äù

Masego has to be doing that on purpose, there's no way he's this funny by accident.

*** I think it was hinted before he has this compulsion to be overly precise, and just can't help himself. It just makes it even more funny, in my opinion

  I turned without needing to be hailed, and discomfort flickered across her face.

  I clapped his shoulder, and even being careful nearly sent him tumbling to the ground.

It's the little things like these that make this story for me. Casual lines that have no plot relevance but their absence would make the reading so much less interesting and the setting so much less defined. I should be taking notes, really.

  ‚ÄúYou know I despise surprises,‚Äù Masego said, glaring at me.

  Impressive, considering he had no eyes.

***** Cat talked to Zombie, and it reacted on its own, without Cat making it react. She's obviously freaking out about this, since undead aren't supposed to have free will.
