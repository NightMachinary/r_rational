** Delcroix ....do we read his surname like the del and french croix ? because thats the way i had been doing this...

and i am glad we are getting the perspective of multiple characters. All of them are really interesting and the plot starts to ramp up!

I am currently liking the portreyal of elitism and aristocracy. The propaganda within the country is done really well too. The only thing that really bugs me is the level of studies the main character had to do to get to the school. It seems almost impossible to have such self control and determination to do such a thing + what is the real level of knowledge he had to absorb and all the kids in this elite school? And he is only in the low level class that is supposed to be expelled anyways ? I get that they are high born people and they are destined to do many nice jobs like running this god damn country and all of that but i find it hard to suspend my desbelieve over it.

Another thing could someone tell me the age of these kids. I cant recall it but i think they werent that old which in another way kinda bugs me with the whole how do they learn that much and how intelligent they are.

but as the story stands those are my only complaints tho.

- the characters seem really intelligent but i dont remember their exact age

- the amount of work in studies they have to do to be that good etc

  the story is really good and i recommend it for anyone

*** Yes, some things don't seem to make sense.

Getting the also-rans into the school makes sense. Find the smartest and most driven people who aren't already part of the aristocracy and getting them incorporated into the aristocracy so they are less likely to try violent revolution. But then trying to get them thrown out of the school doesn't make sense with that. That makes the plan into 'find all the most intelligent and driven people who aren't part of the aristocracy and make sure they now have an axe to grind with the aristocracy'.

We'd also expect the regular ransom students to be more normal in their achievements. The aristocracy probably isn't so large that it's just the smartest and most driven members that attend Ransom. And we assume the average aristocrat is only slightly better off the the average non-aristocrat because of how readily available schooling is to everyone.

**** One of the better rules I follow in the real world is that, when either malicious intent or incompetence are both possible reasons for a thing, assume incompetence. In this case, its likely a system enacted by a well-intentioned powerful government official, that fell prey to rampant classism. It continues because it makes no political sense to end the system, but no one really cares to fix it.

**** so fun fact. I have known that croix means cross but the whole surname is a classic french surname meaning "of the cross"

quite nice

and yes the part where they try to drive also rans students away doesnt make much sense but i guess nepotism and the elitism in the society kinda does explain that ? idk. I dont feel like it is that much weird. the system was decided with it in mind ,aristocracy is just against associating with commoners i guess

Nah; I think this is easily explained by the difference in level of expectations in schooling (for Ransom specifically), school environment, and the level of education offered in each school. There would also naturally be a level of culture shock/playing catch-up when the Also-Rans come in (hence the opportunity for remedial classes in Chapter 4) - but if the school doesn't offer to help the Also-Rans automatically, the gap widens and it increases the chance that the Also-Ran would drop out. In that case, the Also-Ran would be more likely to say "I dropped out because I couldn't keep up," rather than "I dropped out because I was thrown out the system was stacked against me".

For a real-world example, see [[https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/12/the-added-pressure-faced-by-first-generation-students/384139/][this article about American college drop outs]].

Chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  The Ranvar school system required every child to be educated to the age of fifteen, after which they would sit the most important exams of their young lives. The results would determine their future, what kind of work they would be eligible for, the kind of people willing to employ them.

This doesn't break my suspension of disbelief - Nic is supposed to be extremely self-motivated, and for the other Ransom students - it reminds me a little of Japanese cram schools.

***** Yes, after Grundschule (elementary school), students are split into several tracks: Hauptschule, Realschule, und Gymnasium (In some Bundesl√§nder instead of Hauptschule and Realschule there is Gesamtschule). These different tracks take the place of middle school and high school.

If you're in Gymnasium, the advanced track, you take your Abitur at the end, which are a large series of final exams. Going through the Abitur is similar to an IB program in that it's a wider range of studies than a typical American high school. Lots of required arts, political and language courses.

I've been reading it as Delacroix since the beginning, hadn't noticed that a 'a' was missing.
