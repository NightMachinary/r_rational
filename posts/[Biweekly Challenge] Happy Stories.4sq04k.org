[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4qie80/biweekly_challenge_reverse_portal_fantasy/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Reverse Portal Fantasy". The winner was [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]] with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4qie80/biweekly_challenge_reverse_portal_fantasy/d4vvzq6][5000 PE]]. Go read it now! Congratulations to [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]]!

This time, we'll be doing "Happy Stories". Any genre, any subject, so long as it's happy (and, obviously, rational). I'm issuing this challenge partly because a lot of rational fiction deals with darker themes and subjects, and partly because I'm personally incapable of writing anything optimistic or light. (I try my best to make sure that multiple ideas can be easily generated for these challenges, and my immediate thought for this one was the existential horror of wireheading. Please don't write something like that.) Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, July 27th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

Next time, we'll be doing "Superheroes". Pick your favorite universe or franchise to riff on, or make up a hero of your own. This is a great time to write some fanfic.

***** (You're welcome!)

Rather than the aliens, I was referring to the horses and mice and dogs and cats and the many other non-humans on planet Earth (other than fish and lower) which we can see undergoing REM sleep and pawing at the air as though chasing illusory rats and the like while they're asleep. That--the suggestion that humans are the only organisms on the planet that dream, despite our observations of non-human animals, especially domestic ones--was what I felt conflicted with suspension of disbelief.

Good fortune with your writing!

****** Oh, haha yeah. I can see that. I definitely know animals can dream, I just didn't really think about the implications in context. It'd be really easy for me to go back and fix that. Something along the line of the Alien making sweeping changes to the more complex animals to test the effect it would have (and then releasing them to see how well the technology would be transferred into subsequent generations)

So essentially he'd work his way up to working on humans. That's viable.

**** My guess was that our dreams were very different, so even saying we dreamed would be misleading. Animals do something vaguely similar to dreams, but I think we can say they're pretty different from ours.

**** /Before beginning to integrate our Simulation technology with human biological networks, I chose to first attempt to integrate it with other, less neurologically complex (although still quite advanced, by most standards) creatures. Cats were but one of the several species chosen for such testing for reasons I shan't discuss./

  Why are there nightmares?
#+end_quote

There's a brief paragraph explaining it; basically it's because the trauma inflicted on your brain when you experience negative emotions, such as fear, follow you into the dreamscape. It's the same mechanic that allows you to dream about regular things that make you happy.

It's not so much that we have the ability to think thousands of times faster; it's that we have a largely unused portion of our brain that can be somewhat favorably married to the Simulation technology the narrator speaks about. That part of the brain itself can't do much on its own; it's just a tool, a port if you will, that the narrator then plugs in his tech.

Yes. I can see why the system as made could have that happen. But why would they allow it? Someone can spend a lifetime being tormented just because they watched a scary movie before they went to bed. Why aren't the protections against that?

So, he's just uploading us and the uploaded brain dreams? Then why even bother connecting them to us? Why not just upload everyone and let them live in heaven for a certain amount of time?

****** No; the implication is that dreaming isn't Dreaming. Yet. Dreaming is going to be the lifetime thing; the mental simulation in which we're as in control of it as we want to be. The narrator is still working on the technology. Nightmares are a current side effect but one he plans to resolve. He plans to take centuries, if not millennia, more to get to the Dreaming he mentions he wants for us in the end. We're still firmly in developer mode.

Uploading us...where? I'm confused. The technology itself is interfacing with our brain. The eventual goal is to allow you to, while asleep, utilize it to have your own simulated world to do with as you please. There's no actual mental transference going on; you are not being uploaded anywhere. If you like, you could almost think of it as a very specific, directed hallucination.

Yeah, but that's just because I suck at tracking time while I'm asleep. It's not the same as actually experiencing more time. It's the biological equivalent of changing the time on your computer.

Isn't that to be expected? You're not dreaming the whole time you're asleep.

********** I'll be honest. I'm not sure why you're nitpicking the mechanics of a fictional technology. Especially since I could really just handwave it by blaming it all on the Alien.

I'm not sitting here and trying to tell you my concept is flawless; I'm just saying that, based on the ground I've laid down and the capabilities of our mysterious helper, you shouldn't be this concerned with the inconsistencies in my obviously made up technology.
