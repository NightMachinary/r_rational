"The moon blew up without warning and for no apparent reason."

I just finished this book, and thought that it would be right up [[/r/rational]]'s alley. From that opening line, pretty much everything else follows, and Stephenson deals with all of the consequences with a large amount of thought and detail. I really enjoyed it, primarily because of the real cognitive effort that it shows, and think that you might too.


** I am roughly halfway through it (getting to the part Escapement mentions about politics/politicians, though it was foreseeable a lot earlier), and I am mostly enjoying it, but it doesn't really feel like vintage Stephenson to me (I'd include Diamond Age, the Baroque Cycle, and Anathem in that category). Compared to Anathem, it feels intentionally dumbed-down (directed to a broader audience?); compared to the Baroque Cycle it feels criminally under-researched. There is presumably a TVTrope for suspension of disbelief being much harder for stories that claim to be set in the present day, and it was in full force for me.

Two examples:

1) Stephenson seems to want the story to be set in the present day (with Skype and Facebook and Twitter and Python), but it's obviously set 10-20 years in the future (with asteroid mining actually a thing and a much-expanded ISS and better-developed swarm AI). Given the latter, I found the repeated references to present-day stuff *by name* /extremely/ annoying and immersion-breaking. You can't treat 20 years from now like the present, and I expect better from Stephenson.

2) Similarly, given how much research Stephenson put into the Baroque Cycle, it astonishes me how little effort he seems to have put into researching some parts of the real world. I am a physics grad student, so the inaccuracies in how he depicts the culture of astrophysicists (especially the Neil deGrasse Tyson expy) were always going to bother me. But even beyond those minutiae, which probably won't bother anyone else, there's just a bunch of sloppiness and mixed opportunites. One example: for reasons which I won't spoil, a passage in the book takes place in Bhutan. I was really excited, because I was sure he was going to talk about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness][Gross National Happiness]], which would have meshed brilliantly with what was going on at that point in the book--but then he just treated Bhutan as a generic Buddhist country for no reason.

3) (This is the point where I think the book strays furthest from rationalist.) In this book, for whatever reason, Stephenson seems totally wedded to the Great Man theory of history, in the sense that only his protagonists get to come up with ideas. There's a point very early on in the book where one of his characters realizes, a week after the moon blows up, that it will have particularly bad effects for the viability of life on earth in the near future. Set aside that it takes him a week to do this; the unbelievable part is that /literally no one else in the world/ seems to figure this out until a similar period of time has passed. This is something that would be e.g. posted on Reddit within /minutes/ of the moon blowing up.

#+begin_quote
  The phrase "Gross National Happiness" (GNH); [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration][Wylie]]: /gyal-yong ga'a-kyid pal-'dzoms/) was coined in 1972 by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan][Bhutan]]'s fourth [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Bhutan][Dragon King]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigme_Singye_Wangchuck][Jigme Singye Wangchuck]]. The phrase was coined as a signal of commitment to building an economy that would serve Bhutan's culture based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist][Buddhist]] spiritual values instead of the western material development that was represented by gross national product (GNP).

#+end_quote

Would love to hear a bit more. I found the book vague on this front.

Otherwise: like The Martian, it gets pretty deep into the intricacies of various engineering challenges. The situation in The Martian wasn't as inherently interesting, but the basics of maintaining food, air, power were still well conveyed. In Seveneves, I found some of topics engaging (bolide fragmentation) and sometimes too familiar (orbital mechanics, covered better in Anathem and elsewhere), and sometimes inefficiently realized in prose (tedious descriptions of spacecraft).

Also, I am finding supposedly smart characters making very dumb decisions too much of the time, to an infuriating degree. The bad ideas are quite disproportionately assigned to the female characters.

**** Have now finished Part Two, the last few pages of which lead me to suspect that the last third of the book is really going to piss me off. That is possibly the laziest discussion of the moral implications of transhumanism I have ever read. I /am/ going to continue, but I have adjusted my expectations accordingly.

*** I just wish to note that reading LWian stuff and /The Diamond Age/ around the same time was kinda painful, what with Stephenson saying in TDA that AI can't ever work, and the Platonism of /Anathem/ was also quite discouraging.

Oh, and God knows his material on language and the mind in /Snow Crash/ was a bunch of fucking bullshit that contradicts his whole "AI can't work" thing in /The Diamond Age/ to boot.

You know, normally I like Stephenson, though I don't like his politics. But I guess at some point these kvetches about the science have to come out.

**** I took the platonism in /Anathem/ as the speculative conceit (and also potentially as an homage to Godel's own platonism), rather than indicative of Stephenson's actual beliefs. I think you can make the same excuse for /Diamond Age/--he wanted to write a particular kind of story and AI (except the Primer) didn't really fit in it. But I agree that his science is not always the best. That's what Greg Egan is for!

***** I don't really know or care much what Stephenson actually believes about mathematics, but I generally find Platonism irritating, since almost all Platonists fail to justify how abstract universals Out There get connected to our understanding of them In Here, so they seem to me to be proposing something that makes functioning minds impossible.

*** The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextSundayAD][Next Sunday AD]] thing bothered me a little bit. It wasn't so much the inclusion of real-world names (since Python has been around for 25 years already and it's reasonable to expect that it will be around another 25), so much as the fact that this imprecision causes the book to lose a little bit of its grounding. Does the book take place in 2020 or 2040? There might be enough clues to peg it correctly, it's not at all obvious to the reader.

There's a similar thing with JBF; you don't actually know whether she's a Democrat or Republican. This is a cheeky bit of slight-of-hand (and ultimately, it's not important), but it makes the world feel a little bit less real. It's a bit of cheekiness that I didn't really want to be there.

Well, the conversation on Reddit would go something like, "The moon blew up, we're all going to die!" and someone else would say, "No, the moon is still gravitationally bound, it's keeping the same orbit, it's just going to continue on its course with no appreciable changes to life on Earth". Which is just basic physics. The real issue is not that the moon exploded into seven pieces, it's the grinding down process, which isn't immediately obvious (at least, not within minutes of it happening).

It's also cheekiness that hasn't really made sense since 2008, or even 2006. It's /been a while now/ since the Democrats and the Republicans were /actually/ indistinguishable from each-other, partly because the Republicans have steadily realized what the fuck the DNC is doing with this triangulation thing and /gone batshit insane/ to keep their own base under their own wing, but also partly because Labor has been waking up a bit more recently.

I don't think this is true (that it's not immediately obvious). The very fact that Neal Stephenson can come up with it at all indicates to me that it would be immediately obvious to a sufficiently large group of people that it would hit Reddit, etc. immediately (and sure, it might take some time to pass from "some people are saying this" -> "more people are believing it" -> "the mainstream media is talking about it" but I think we're talking hours not days). Even if you don't believe that logic, we've been doing simulations of the moon's formation for at least a decade now; I don't want to look up the papers but I therefore have at least 3 sigma confidence that there are at least some papers on e.g. arXiv that mention precisely this issue.

** Currently listening to it. Niggles in the order they hit me:

1: The plan is to build a closed ecosystem and industrial infrastructure in a place secure against the hard rain. Digging into bedrock would be /far/ easier, in particular because a much greater part of the work force would have applicable skills towards the problem of "Dig the mines of moria" This is even mentioned early on, then so far mostly utterly ignored. WTF?

2: "you can't use iron for rocket fuel".. Wrong. You totally can. They have an iron-nickel asteroid on hand, and can obviously find as much rock as they care to due to moon fragmentation. So the obvious answer to all propulsion problems is "Mass drivers".

** I finished it last night; I think it's a really good story, and probably takes my 'favorite Stephenson work' from The Diamond Age. I liked it a lot. However, Seveneves doesn't really depart from Stephenson's tendency towards disappointing endings.

I honestly felt that Stephenson's attitude towards politics/politicians strongly approached the 'evil' (as contrasted with virtuous technology-proficient nerds) in the good and evil of this sidebar. Certain characters fell flat.

That said, the story is extremely well researched and described and thought out; I really liked it overall, and you can tell a lot of effort was spent on technical details.

I agree with this. It wasn't a huge problem for me given that the bulk of the conflict was Man vs. Nature instead of Man vs. Man; if the primary focus had been the political aspects instead of the engineering aspects, it would have been a major weakness instead of a minor one.
