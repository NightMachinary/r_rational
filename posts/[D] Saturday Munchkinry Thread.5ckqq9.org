Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You are in a Lovecraftian universe and in a human society from the early 1900s. The Necronomicon has drifted into your possession and you desire to learn everything from it without going insane.

The Necronomicon has the special property that the very act of reading it causes malevolent entities to become aware of you and attempt to kill you or drive you insane via supernatural means. The entities will them attempt to erase every trace of the individual's existence from memory, although they are sloppy and will unintentionally let some details remain. Afterwards the entities will quickly ignore the existence of the Necronomicon until another individual reads from it. If no one reads it and simply holds on it, then the book can remain in one's possession for as long as desired.

You have no protection against the supernatural (that's why you want to learn from the Necronomicon), but you believe that the Necronomicon's lethal trait is tied to the book itself and not to the knowledge or words in the book. But you are not certain of this yet and would like to have a way to test this part. How can you make copies of it during the early 1900s?

- Entities will kill any readers within a few days to minutes depending on how hard it is to arrange a seemingly natural death.

- Entities will slowly wipe the memory of the person in question from everyone's mind and any physical evidence of the individual's existence will disappear over time. But anything which is not obviously 'connected' to the person in question will go unnoticed. This is how fragments of writings of the Necronomicon has managed to pass on along with hints of what happened to the previous owners. 'Ownership' will be left vague since you don't know yet how the entities define such things, only that they miss things which would seem obvious to a human.

- After the reader's death/disappearance, if arrangements to move the Necronomicon has not been made or it hasn't been sent away yet, then it will be considered as if it was a book discarded by some stranger and probably sold to someone in a yard sale or given to a library/bookstore.

- Note that casual attempts to read it will be prevented, since people will receive an ominous feeling of unease from the book and stop themselves from reading it. They'll make up some reason to not read it. It requires an determined individual to force themself to read it. However, if one becomes aware of what the book is, it then gives off an feeling of curiosity calling to be read. The feelings are not very strong and can be resisted, but if you are not careful, you can find yourself reading it before you catch yourself.

- Reading the cover and back of the book does not count which is why people have easily managed to pass on the title and appearance of the book without issue.

*** I'd use a piece of frosted glass to trace where words occur on each page, and copy those patterns to pieces of cardstock. I would make many copies of the word-pattern for each page. Then, I'd use some reliable way of generating random numbers to punch some small number (say, 10) spaces out of each page, so that I could read ten separated words from each page, somewhat like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(cryptography)][Grille cipher]]. I'd shuffle my deck of grilles and proceed in random order, transcribing the words into another notebook.

Hopefully reading random pages, 10 random words at a time, doesn't count as 'reading' for the purposes of the malevolent entites. To check this I would have someone else read through some grille, and then observe them for a period of time afterward. Due to the information decay effect, I'd have to set up some sort of dead-man's switch, like making a chalk mark every day the person was still alive.

Unfortunately, the entities consider reading even a single word from the book sufficient to murder the person. However, just tracing the words through the frosted glass is enough to prevent the killing effect since you can't read the words perfectly through the glass.

***** I imagine that my trial, getting another person to do it at the individual word level, gave me the information contained in your reply, i.e. my assistant mysteriously dies after reading several words through the grille. I wake up one day and realize that the number of chalk marks I would expect to see is fewer than what are actually there, so I recognize that my experiment was a failure.

So, I painstakingly repeat the process, but at the individual glyph level instead of the word level. I have my assistant's assistant read several individual letters which are randomly spaced across a page. What happens to her?

****** Ah, I forgot to write about the chalk marks and you do end up with more chalk marks than you'd expect like you just correctly guessed.

If you try the process again for individual glyphs, it works. However, I'm going to assume that you had the same assistant do a second session. When the assistant 'reads' a few glyphs from each sessions that can be combined to make a word, the entities kill the assistant.

You do have the words and glyphs from the first assistant. Since there are ~200 words per page and you had the assistant read 10 words per page, that's 5% of the Nerconomicon decoded. I rolled some dice and you got to keep it without it fading away.

I rolled dice again and your second assistant lasted 2 sessions, but you only get the notes from the first session. Using the frosted glass idea to know the positioning of the words, the assistant can retrieve a glyph from nearly every word in the best case scenario. You have 30% more of the Necronomicon, but that's all in individual glyphs and therefore difficult to understand.

What will you do next?

PS You can figure a way out to preserve the notes without relying on luck, but you need a way to fool the entities constantly to keep them from noticing and erasing the notes 'owned' by the assistant. You never need to worry about a setback though. If the entities don't catch it (aka you get lucky on a dice roll), then they won't erase notes from earlier sessions.

******* Well, assuming that I haven't built a reputation for running a /very/ dangerous laboratory (who am I kidding - this is the 1900s, labor is still cheap), I'd hire N+1 assistants, where N is the length of the shortest word in the book (estimated by me by looking at the outlines of words I can see. The ith assistant gets grilles in which exactly all of the glyphs occurring at positions which are i (modulo N+1). Therefore I know that no one assistant will be able to put together an entire word. See, my original use of RNGs was based on the premise that 'meaning' was the smallest unit of information from the book that could be dangerous - thus, since 'word' is my new threshold of danger, I just have to be careful to never let any assistant read an entire word - and you don't need randomness for that.

I have this set of assistants proceed page-by page. When they have finished one page, I transcribe it in its entirety by hand. These notes are then 'mine' in case of mishap, i.e. my assistants succumbing to the desire to actually read the book. If mishap occurs, then I'll notice that suddenly, for some j, I'm not receiving the jth page for me to transcribe from, and can hire new assistants accordingly.

I've established that partial portions of the text aren't dangerous once copied, but just to be safe I'd do something like flip seven coins each time I receive a set of pages, and if they are all heads, burn the pages and make a note in my copy of the book that I'm not going to transcribe them. Although nothing in your description thus far has stated such, I can't rule out the possibility that once the entire book is assembled, it will suddenly gain the dangerous properties of the original.

** You have exclusive access to a new computing technology. In every way except for its unique properties, it's only about as good as traditional computers circa 1980, but you expect that with further research it could follow a progression similar to Moore's Law.

The thing that makes this computing technology unique is that you may select a physical region of the computer's electronics and freeze time for it, so that it will make a series of calculations instantaneously that would otherwise have taken any finite amount of time. The computing will still likely require power, but you can account for this by including certain types of battery in the instant-calculation zone. Trying to include generic matter, like living things, in the instant-calculation zone will flash-freeze it, most likely destroying it.

What neat tricks can you accomplish with this technology?

******* I think for this to actually work you'd need to quantify things. For example, you don't mention how expensive an operation the time stop is. Unless it's quite expensive the way to go might to be using a very paired down computer inside the time stop that doesn't require much power, but because it can run until it's batteries or capacitors run out it's better. Basically here the thing of importance is watt per floating point opp.

On the other hand if you up the expensive of doing a time stop other trade offs start to come into play. Assuming the expensive varies based on the internal time stop time not external you have to optimize power use with the amount of time it will take.

If we want to only apply this tech to a small part of computer you'd start with the RAM in a modern machine at least. Getting ram to respond in a similar time frame to cache would be huge.

Fundamentally once you've answered these questions the question resolves to basically what can you do with X flops per second. If X is close to what we currently have than the example is exactly what we currently do with computers. If it's much higher than we can do things like solve NP hard problems for non trivial sized inputs.

**** "Trying to include generic matter, like living things, in the instant-calculation zone will flash-freeze it, most likely destroying it."

I'm not sure if this was intended, but it sounds to me like the time stop is actually dropping the temperature of the region. This might be destroying the waste heat, although it might be conserved and dumped in a shell surrounding the frozen region.

Either way, this ability could be used as either a weapon or a power source, as it violates thermodynamics.

If you could nest time-stopped regions you could provide infinite power and infinite time to your computer, allowing you to compute anything instantly.

In the second case however you would be limited by the waste heat being dumped into the environment (where you are) and possibly super-heating it to arbitrary temperatures.

** Maybe a bit late, but a superpower that, when consciously activated, allows your cognition and awareness to accelerate to superhuman levels - if you went into a professional boxing match, then activated this ability as you closed with your opponent, their thrown punch would seem to travel in slow motion, allowing you to react perfectly rather than be surprised by it (and get knocked out).

Your body, however, moves at regular human-possible speeds, despite your super-cognition speeds. Something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology][the flow state]] but /super/flow.

*** The [[http://superhotgame.com/][Superhot]] power is basically that, but also limited by the fact that cognition speed decreases as you move.

It sort of depends on whether you expend "mental energy" when you're in that state. For example, I can write code for maybe 4-6 hours at the most before my brain starts to get sluggish and I fall out of the (non-parahuman) flow state. If I could activate this superflow state, would I be able to continue computer programming at a rate determined by processing power, screen refresh rates, and physically being able to move my fingers fast enough over the keyboard? Or would I use up my brain chemicals and basically be burnt for the day?

If I can do productive information work while in that state mostly without limit, then I become a super computer programmer. In the Wormverse, I become a Thinker who mostly serves as an analyst, not capable of making the /best/ analysis, but capable of making the /fastest/ analysis, which is good in crisis situations. Alternately, I can serve as dispatch or information, given that I can look up answers as fast as my browser can load a page from Google (and obviously I pay for ridiculously fast internet). Plus, that allows me to stay out of the way of all the things that want to kill me.

If I /can't/ do that kind of thinking for much longer than a normal person before getting mentally fried, maybe I still do those things but as secondary function, because I'll mostly be in the field. I'd make a good scout, because I can fully analyze any scene after seeing it for only a fraction of a second ... but other parahumans completely outclass me.

For weapons, it's sort of an awkward thing, because the power is amazing at close range but only /good/ with guns. Being able to hit precisely with a knife is much more feasible given combat speeds relative to muscle action. But with guns, the question is much more about how good your aim is and how well you account for variables. I've gone to the gun range and failed to hit targets with all the time in the world, and with sandbags to not require steady hands. Yes, it's harder to hit a moving target, so there's some benefit there, but I think you'd be sitting there in frozen time trying to track how fast your target was moving, how fast the bullets move, space between them ... and it would all be very hard, giving not all that much benefit. Whereas with knives, you can much better take advantage of openings and weaknesses. Except that knives have a lot less practical applicability than guns, as a general rule.

** I finished A Night Without Stars a little bit ago and while enjoyable fiction I couldn't help that think that some of the main characters in this were doing a shockingly bad job of their stated goal.

I don't know how much I should spoil for people, but two bits of information should be fairly safe. First the principle good guys in this have the following resources. Access to most of the information of Tech II verging on Tech III civilization. Personal force fields capable of withstanding everything up to a moderately distant nuclear blast, enhanced mental capacities, medical facilities capable of bring somebody back from anything up to what we would call dead and maybe a bit more (basically as long as the brain is in decent shape), fabrication faculties capable of producing any small object that we could construct today and then some (it isn't quite capable of self duplication though), you also have a group of general sympathetic people with the same mental enhancements you have though which you have perfectly secure communication with.

Your up against two factors, first you are isolated from your main civilization with no hope of contact with your current resources, the local civ is pre-industrialist and there are intelligent aliens able to perfectly disguise themselves as humans trying to slowly take over the planet, but without any extra usable technology, just better coordination and supper human intelligence and physique. They can be detected but with a test that's too expensive to be applied with current technology except when really needed. You can mostly keep infiltration down but nothing more. I actually never understood in the actual book why they didn't apply the test on scale, because according to the book it's just looking at the color of the blood. Red for human green for alien, but regardless it doesn't mater for this purposes. If you can get the humans up to something approaching a type I civilization they win. Tests suitable for mass testing can be developed, but not with current tech and the main Civ can be signaled and come to the rescue, but again not with the current tech and industrial base, the problem in the books is that there is a repressive government trying to cling on to power which rightly feels that this would unseat them and as such is working against both you and the enhanced fraction of the population.

In the books the most that is managed in the order of a thousand years is an elevation to a mid 20th century tech level with an emphasis on a rocket and nuke program taking out the aliens in orbit.

I think that somebody in this situation should be able to do much better. Step one is that you take over the government, sure they don't want it, but do you really care? You make it known to those you have perfect communication with that you will be the one to give out technology and your basically their only hope then you assassinate the high up political apparatus until what's left falls in line, also bribe those who are needed if necessary with advanced technology and medicine. This will cause instability and allow the aliens to accelerate there take over, but because of the exponential nature of their take over doing this early is basically your only choice. At this point you focus on two things, first elevating the technology base of the civilization as quickly as possible including education to give the general population as much of your knowledge base as they would be safe knowing (basically all of it, but if there's something in there that allows for mass destruction without a viable counter at current tech levels you might want to keep it close to the chest), in parallel, relax your control and transition to some form of democracy. At the same time you'll need to devote a huge percent of the GDP to fighting the alien's, but you should have truly astounding growth never the less. You have the blueprints for every step along the way up the tech ladder. Given the technology to signal main civ probably existed by around 2100, I think you should be able to achieve that tech level within about 100 to 200 years and signal for help.

Does anyone see holes in this. Normally the problem with trying to take over a society like this is that you're vulnerable, but in this you're basically indestructible to tech on that level.

The last thing you'd do is give them nukes while the repressive government is still in charge.
