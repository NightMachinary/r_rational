** Looks like the apocalypse is imminent.

Chapter 1 began: "The apocalypse began in a cubicle". Somehow, the apocalypse began with Aaron's learning of the Vital Name. Also, we learnt in the last chapter it is no more than a few years until the divine machinery runs out of energy. That event is a very good candidate for the apocalypse. If the apocalypse is something else entirely then unless it is so thorough that there is no longer a drain on the divine energy, the divine machinery is still going to run out of energy and we will have both The Apocalypse and something sort-of-like-an-apocalypse-but-not-actually-the-apocalypse.

Aaron used the Vital Name once and was unable to get it to work a second time. The Vital Name is "a greater Name than any ever discovered". It is likely that the Vital Name was spoken at most twice -- for Adam and Eve -- until Aaron discovered it. This is consistent with the theory that Aaron's use of the Vital Name consumed enough divine energy that there was not enough remaining for it to be used a second time. In "Interlude ד: N-Grammata" we learnt that the Tetragrammaton, being among the simplest of Names, continued to function for a period after Uriel moved the world to "a substrate of mathematics", so we have a precedent for depletion of the divine light causing only some Names to no longer function.

However, this explanation doesn't seem entirely consistent with the "apocalypse [beginning] in a cubicle" -- the apocalypse would still be inevitable and at most Aaron caused it to occur on a somewhat accelerated timetable.

Aaron does not know that the divine energy is running out and does not seem to consider -- or at least has no way to test -- whether only that particular Name was no longer working, however he considers several alternate hypotheses. In particular, that there was some sort of divine intervention and/or he simply forgot the Name.

It is exceedingly unlikely for a mnemonist such as Aaron to forget the Name without some external cause, his reaction suggests this would be almost entirely unprecedented. For an external cause -- divine intervention -- Uriel would be the obvious candidate. However, for Uriel to do this would be uncharacteristically subtle: "He'd smitten people who were using up too many system resources. Or who were trying to go into areas he hadn't finished simulating at the necessary level of fidelity. And of course people who were boiling goats in their mothers' milk. Or who were planning to boil goats in their mothers' milk. Or who looked like the sort of people who might do that." Uriel smiting Aaron for consuming too much of the divine energy is /exactly/ what I would expect from him, which obviously didn't happen. Perhaps Sohu's influence could have made him less disposed to killing unnecessarily, but Uriel simply causing Aaron to forget the Name seems very unlikely.

The lesser angels do not appear to have the agency to interfere in such a direct way. Thamiel does not appear to have a motive for stopping Aaron, and, like Uriel, simply causing Aaron to forget the name does not appear to be his style. Similarly, the Right Hand of God does not seem disposed to interfering in such a way, and Uriel's belief that "God's role [is] entirely ontological" would preclude God taking direct action.

#+begin_quote
  I tell you this story as an apology. So that when we get to the part in the next chapter where I had to decide between dooming the world and dooming Ana, you understand why it was such a tough choice.
#+end_quote

"dooming the world" seems to refer to the apocalypse, but I cannot see how that would be consistent with the apocalypse being the exhaustion of divine energy. It is apparently inevitable, and in chapter 16 we learn that Uriel has considered the problem for "subjective aeons" and considers solving it "impossible". Aaron's quote implies a choice, that there was some way for him to forestall the end of the world -- presumably some source of divine light -- and that he had to choose between it and Ana.

Aaron is currently spatially separated from Ana by a considerable distance, so anything involving Ana probably involves their kabbalistic marriage.

"I tell you this story as an apology" seems to imply Aaron chose Ana over the world -- saving the world would be the obvious choice for most people who are not Aaron, and he is attempting to justify his decision. On the other hand, taken as a whole I think the entire statement is more consistent with Aaron having chosen to save the world -- he is apologising for even seriously considering choosing Ana over the world. Things do not look good for Ana, I fear.

I suspect we'll also be seing Sarah again soon, and there's a good chance she'll play a significant role in what's about to happen. Sarah's investment with the Divine Spark, like Adam and Eve, required the use of the Vital Name, but people reproduce just fine without the Vital Name. Sarah should be able to reproduce -- asexually or otherwise -- without needing enough divine energy to power the Vital Name. Also Sarah should now has a body, and probably worships Aaron as her creator, or something along those lines.

I had posted the following possibility way back when we first learned of The Broadcast:

#+begin_quote
  For all we know the reveal at the end is that Uriel and Sohu figured out how to fix the divine light, all they needed was a Name that gave souls to inanimate objects, UNSONG was recruited to help find it, they built a hell-proof facility with security measures that create an ineffable sense of wrongness as an unfortunate byproduct, Jane and her seven dragons are a failsafe plan implemented by the Comet King, Aaron manages to single-handedly foil every plan intended to keep the ensouling Name from Thamiel, and he's writing Unsong in a villa in Brimstone Acres reserved for him as reward for ensuring Thamiel's ultimate victory.
#+end_quote

So... here's a possibility: we know that the /Not A Metaphor/ was just serviced by the Drug Lord, who is (possibly) in league with The Other King. Maybe the Drug Lord tips off TOK, who sends his navy to corner and captures the ship, and learns of both Ana's knowledge of The Name via <Kabbalbabble> and of Aaron + Jane's location via SCABMOM and <more Kabbalbabble>. Then TOK's agents in Las Vegas capture Aaron and threaten to murder Ana unless he helps them recover The Name? And again, Aaron's failure to deliver The Name to Unsong and the Cometspawn prevents Uriel and Sohu from repairing the machinery of the universe.

**** Your theory is plausible, conditional on the Vital Name being the solution to the problem with the divine light. Perhaps the Vital Name could be used on the universe itself, making the divine machinery -- or the klipot, or something -- sentient and ensouled. I think that on prior evidence it is much more likely that the Most Holy Name is the solution to the problem, but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence for the Vital Name playing that role.

Aaron ending up in Brimstone Acres would be a huge downer ending (if it were an ending), and I don't /think/ Scott would do that to us.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is a very interesting point. UNSONG and Jane are both pursuing goals presumably aligned with those of the Comet King. Aaron foiling the Comet King's plans /inadvertently/ seems incredibly unlikely. For that matter, his discovery of the Vital Name was also incredibly unlikely. Influence by some external agent seems likely, even though there doesn't seem to be an obvious candidate -- perhaps God has stopped being strictly ontological and everything is going according to some overly complex divine plan?

Aye, but there's the rub -- Aaron isn't foiling UNSONG and Jane by /accident/, but rather he's gone out of his way to make sure that Malia Ngo doesn't hear the Vital Name and that Jane can't use her seven dragons.

#+begin_quote
  I don't /think/ Scott would do that to us.
#+end_quote

On the one hand, you're right. On the other hand, "The apocalypse began in a cubicle." And given how this interlude ended, I'm assuming the worst.

Well, we can say that it's someone who knows the Vital Name, and needs AST, a Kabbalist/Unitarian Universalist/Nerd/??? to find it. Maybe one of those lovecraftian entities Simeon hinted at a few updates ago?

*** I cannot imagine Aaron choosing to save Ana over the world, provided that he was fully aware of the ramifications of his choice. Ana exists /in the world/; surely dooming the world would doom her by extension, so a reasonable conclusion would be that Ana is unsavable (salvageable?) in this problem.

**** Aaron Teller has two skills: Kabbalistic analysis, and shooting himself in the foot. A few updates ago he managed to rationalize sabotaging Jane's seven-dragons plan by blindly assuming she wants to do evil; it's very much possible that he manages to rationalize choosing Ana over the world (perhaps he was guaranteed his and Ana's safety by someone?)
