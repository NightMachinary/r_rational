I've been wanting to right a rational Batman fan fiction that is a sequel to The Metropolitan Man By: Alexander Wales. Before I rush into writing, are there any cues that I should note or any ideas that y'all can suggest for me if anything? Thanks for hearing me üëçüèΩ.


** My view of Batman, and DC in general, is that there is a heavily mythological element to them; that is to say, there are lots of different Batman stories, and Batman gets written through many different and conflicting lenses by authors who are trying to make different points about either the character, or their culture, or the role of the character within their culture.

Here are the ideas that I think are interesting about Batman:

1. Batman is at least partly responsible for the criminality problem in Gotham, in the same way that the American justice system's focus on prison-as-punishment and the militarization of police are partly responsible for the degradation of communities and the perpetuation of crime.
2. Batman is psychologically crippled by the deaths of his parents and channels that psychological dysfunction into his work /as/ Batman. You can go several different ways with this; he does it unknowingly but it's apparent to the people who know him, he does it knowingly because he thinks that the good he does as Batman means working on his problems would be to the detriment of society (in the same way an artist might want to stay an alcoholic because they think it allows them to produce better art), etc.
3. Batman is paranoid to a fault, unwilling to trust anyone, unwilling to put confidence in anyone that he does trust, with a penchant for surveillance and violations of privacy, and without a real respect for the rule of law. The parallels to post-9/11 America practically write themselves!
4. Batman inherently represents a class struggle. He's a billionaire with lots of fancy equipment and all the benefits of privilege, and his rogue's gallery consists largely of those who are trodden-down and/or mentally impaired.
5. Batman (usually) doesn't kill, but where Superman doesn't kill because he's an eternal optimist, Batman doesn't kill because ... well, you can fabricate your own answer. Maybe he thinks that death is the ultimate tragedy, and the idea of sending one more person into the abyss produces such a revulsion in him that he can't bring himself to do it. More commonly he thinks it would put him on the other side of the line of acceptable vigilantism. My personal take would be that he /really, really/ wants to kill, and the reason he doesn't kill is that he thinks his first murder would send him over the edge, in the same way that some people can look at heroin and know in their heart that they would be addicted from the first moment, because they understand their own personality that well.

There have been a /lot/ of Batman stories, and a lot of these things have been explored in depth, but I think there's plenty of room for doing a rational take on them.

*** This means so much to me as your Superman story was absolutely amazing.

The thing is I might have his parents die during the Metropolis bombings that happened in Metropolitan Man. But if I set the story up like that then the story would take place sometime after or maybe during WWII because I could always age Bruce up and have him be a 14-15 year old spoiled brat that ends up being deeply scarred by his parents deaths.

The thing that I might do when portraying Bruce is to have him resemble a somewhat more well-minded Rorschach. But I'd love to make it as close and well fitted to the world that you made for Metropolitan Man.

I'd also like to tell that I have, in my own head cannon, Metropolis in Delaware, Gotham City in New Jersey, Bl√ºdhaven is also in New Jersey. Fawcett City is in Wisconsin, Central City is in Missouri, Keystone City and Smallville are in Kansas, Coast City is in California. This is the geography I wanted to set up and I'd like to know if it's rational.

**** Frank Miller said that Metropolis is New York City during the day, and Gotham City is New York City during the night. I think this makes a lot of symbolic sense, but doesn't make any /literal/ sense whatsoever.

Canonically, Metropolis is (usually) New York City, and Gotham City is (usually) across the river in New Jersey ... which doesn't actually make that much sense, but that's what /Batman v Superman/ went with.

For /Metropolitan Man/, I think that I had Gotham City as replacing Chicago, but if it was mentioned at all, it was only in passing, and I'm not sure enough information was given to infer that.

I think your geographical layout works. The thing you have to keep in mind if you're monkeying around with geography is that cities exist for a reason, and that reason is usually dictated by 1) distance from other cities and 2) access to transportation or 3) access to valuable raw materials. I'm one of those geographical determinist people who think that given a height map of a continent and a rough tracing of riverways, you could predict where all the most major cities would end up with good accuracy. The big thing is not having big cities too close together, unless they're twin cities (e.g. Minneapolis and St. Paul), or there's a good reason.

What origin you want Batman to have probably depends on what themes and ideas you want to write about for him, e.g. if you want to tackle systemic issues that give rise to crime, then you can have his parents be the victims of said systemic crime. If you want to examine organized crime, game theory, defection from society, etc., then you can tie their death into that (as the comics occasionally do). If you want a focus on moral philosophy, then having them be the victims of someone's answer to the trolley problem might work best. (Though I don't think, as a general writing thing, that it's always best to tie everything back to your central thesis.)

***** Well with the geography I had in mind that Metropolis was built upon a gold mine many years back and as time passed the city expanded into what it is today.

Metropolis in my eyes is still relatively old-fashioned compared to other cities in other states, so transportation is slowly integrating into society but not as quickly as other states have done in their cities.

For Gotham, I'll be honest I just figured that it being called Gotham City gave way for me to put it in some state rather than making it it's own state.

*** Uh, that's interesting. The take on Batman you're describing is the exact opposite of the take on Batman that I follow.

I think [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27397][Shamus Young put it best]]. Batman as a premise is fundamentally bent for purely editorial reasons, and trying to fit him into of the above categories either doesn't fit the categories, or breaks the Batman premise.

I'm not sure quite how to put it. It's like, I like rational fiction, and fiction on general, to be meaningful. I like it to have a consistent logic, and for that logic to be based on real-world logic. I feel the best works of fiction are the ones that "bend" narrative causality, ideas like "the hero should win" or "interesting dramatic things should happen" and other demands of fiction, until the story is roughly shaped like real life.

I feel that ideas like "Batman doesn't kill because it would be addictive" or "Batman represents the rich crushing the poor under their strength" do the opposite. They take real world concepts, and bend them until more or less fit story demands. I don't like this, because I feel this is the opposite of useful.

I really don't like this type of thinking in general; I think it uses / stimulates the same brain gears that make people go "9/11 was an inside job" or "Idiocracy is so real". Or, for a completely different fandom, "the Prequels actually have a deep philosophical message about how the Jedi order is too static and outdated to cope with the reality of their world".

On the other hand, these themes are all good, and probably make for interesting stories. I just... feel like they're the opposite of rational, somehow? They're not what I'd want from the "official" rational Batman story.

EDIT: Actually, Shamus Young put it way better than I do in the article I linked:

#+begin_quote
  But what's most interesting to me is how people continually try to impose order on the chaos. There are two ways you can look at the bent nature of Batman:

  - This is stupid. I'm done.

  - This doesn't make total sense, but I'm on board because I really dig this detective-and-brawling stuff.

  But some people try to forge a third way: They try to say the inherent nonsense is saying something. They look for a message in the madness. A reason for the eternal struggle.

** Speaking as possibly the only person on this sub who doesn't like Metropolitan Man, I think it's very important that you decide whether you are writing a deconstruction of Batman before you start. MM isn't a bad story, but I can't see it as a Superman story. Thematically, the superhero genre is about people with power using that power to fight injustice. It's escapism, but it's the kind of escapism people need in order to inspire them to follow the same ideals by example. That's the purpose of heroic characters in storytelling, while anti-heroes are defined by their contrast with heroes.

[[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] brings up interesting ideas for exploring Batman's character, but most seem to lead in the direction of preying on his faults instead of simply using them to generate complications on the way to a satisfying conclusion. It's not that I think deconstructing heroic characters is a bad thing to do, I just don't find it satisfying to read. I want to see Batman succeed at being Batman because of the virtues that he represents and flaws he overcomes on the way there. That's why I love the interpretation of him as wanting to kill, but ultimately resisting it.

I want to see him get called out for being an asshole with a martyr complex, but only when he overcomes those fault A over the course of the story with support from others. I don't want to see Batman be symbolic of a class struggle because what he's supposed to represent how much we want people with power to use their power to help others however they can. The debate over his methods is meant to make the audience what lengths /we will go to/, and seeing Batman choose to never compromise his principles inspires us to do the same.

*** I partly agree and partly disagree.

Superman within /Metropolitan Man/ is mostly there as a tragic figure, who contains the seeds of his own self-destruction in the form of both his overly-rigid and incompatible-with-the-real-world moral code, and in his inability to deal with his empathic side and attempts to retain some scraps of humanity (though I will say that I have four years of experience under my belt since writing it, and probably would have been able to do the whole thing better now - it's not a story without flaws). He doesn't follow the path of the traditional hero's story, which normally ends with the hero having grappled with their problems and become the stronger for it.

I think that if you /do/ want a traditional hero's story, then you /should/ figure out what the compelling flaws of the character are, because /that's/ the thing that's at the center of your story; it's what the character is forced to confront, and is the (occasionally metaphorical) source of their triumph at the end.

I'm pretty sure that a skilled writer could do this for almost any of the troubling aspects of Batman. Nolan already did "Batman as paranoid surveillance state" in /The Dark Knight/. The plot of /The Lego Batman Movie/ was basically that Batman was too much of a loner.

Heck, if you wanted to do an inspirational/affirmational "Batman as class struggle" story, one where, at the end, Batman is still ideal-driven and inspirational, all you'd really need is a good villain, like Lex Luthor, who can do a "Not So Different" speech at the end which Batman then refutes. Depending on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go, you then structure the plot so that it touches on things like the relationship between capital and labor, the necessity of an organizing force within society, maybe something about the inevitability of the rich given their incentives, etc. Or, somewhat more classically, you have Batman brought down to the level of the common man /but still be Batman/ and learn some lessons about crime as a systemic issue, or how to identify with people who commit crimes, before he (somehow) returns to power (again, still Batman) with a new perspective on what the city and people of Gotham actually need of him.

(And if you wanted Batman to be a tragic figure, he would be undone by his flaws rather than learning from them and eventually overcoming them.)

**** I'd forgotten about the trope of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero][Tragic Hero]], though it's hard not to view such a reimagining of an established character as a commentary on the original. Maybe it doesn't count as a deconstruction and I just hate tragedies.

I can't think of any tragedy that I've ever been glad I read. I don't even like episodes of The Twilight Zone with sad endings, though I have loved /some/ of Black Mirror's horrific social satire. With the possible exception of Walter White, I've never enjoyed the story of a tragic hero.

I love the original Frankenstein but that's more of a horror story, respect for Of Mice and Men was drilled into me so hard I have no idea if I actually if I actually like it, and Old English writing was incomprehensible to me as a kid so I grew up hating Shakespeare.

** One of the strengths of /good/ rational fics is that they enhance elements in the original even if making fun of them. Illogical wand movements in HPMOR, Superman being genuinely heroic in Metro Man, the vampires' characterizations in Luminosity - you don't write fanfic by removing core elements, although you can go into more detail about or twist them.

So the core of Batman is that he's crazy, that he's rich, that he's fighting a one-man war on crime. Have him do things smart people would do in that situation, and then think of an in-universe reason it /doesn't work/.

Why doesn't he just fund poverty reduction programs? Have Bruce try that, and then realize Gotham's corrupt as shit, murderous weirdos in costumes are still around, and in a world where supervillains are around superheroes are /actually/ useful.

Why doesn't he kill? Well, his Rogue's Gallery keeps coming back, right? Or maybe because he knows that if he goes unhinged, he'll stay unhinged. Explore that.

Why doesn't he use superpowers? Well... Maybe he decides to, after all? Maybe he seeks out magic or super-tech to be prepared, but wants to avoid escalation with supervillains?

Okay, I want to address that one criticism, because I see it every time someone talks about Batman, and it's empirically false.

In basically every single long-running Batman story, he does fund poverty reduction programs. He's both a vigilante /and/ a playboy philanthropist. You have stories with Bruce Wayne funding scholarships, museums, Gotham City police, shelters, Arkham Asylum, etc.

The idea that "Batman tries to solve crime through punching people in the face because he / the writers / the readers are too dumb to realize that it would make more sense to fund charities instead" strikes me as baseless smugness. There is no need to justify Batman not funding charities, because Batman does fund charities.

** Based on your post, my impression is that you don't have a lot of experience writing. This is nothing to be ashamed of; experience is something you gather over time, with practice. Accordingly, my suggestion is; don't hesitate, just rush into writing. Practice is something you get by doing, after all.

That said, Rational Fiction is a bit of a high bar, and requires a bit of preparation and forethought that you are probably not accustomed to, given that you're asking for basic advice and ideas here. That's not to say that you shouldn't try... but you might want to consider something a little less ambitious, as early practice writing.

Note that November is coming up, and that means [[https://nanowrimo.org][NaNoWriMo]] is just around the corner. I'd strongly suggest that you start there. Don't set yourself up against your favorite author in writing something exceptional; just write something, and write a lot of it. NaNoWriMo isn't about /good/ writing; it's about getting into a habit of writing /anything/, which is a necessary precondition to writing anything good.

However, you should have some practice doing non-serious writing before you sit down to attempt serious writing... in much the same sense that you should have some practice running before you attempt a marathon.

Having ambitious goals is a /good/ thing, but if you want to achieve those goals, it's probably best to start with more modest goals and work up from there. That's not to say that NaNoWriMo is easy (50,000 words is a lot, and /will/ kick your ass if you take it lightly), but it's a more concrete goal than most writing goals tend to be, which makes it excellent as a practice target.

Maybe you can explore that, and maybe at some point have him wield both rings at once?

I'd also make Superman a Blue Lantern if the Blue Lanterns weren't useless on their own.

****** Well I am curious as to how the Justice League movie handles Lanterns cuz we haven't seen any Lanterns yet but we know they exist due to a line in one of the trailers. Usually GL is one of the founding members so his absence is interesting, and it can't solely be due to the unpopularity of his movie from 6 years ago. They've already done interesting and different stuff with Kryptonians and Amazons in the DCEU, so I wonder what of the Lanterns?

How do you tie the Justice Society into all this? I find it a bit of a challenge incorporating them in, although since this is the 30s, you can probably just have the first iteration of the League be the Justice Society, and introduce all the Golden Age heroes like Mr. Terrific, Hourman, Hawkman, Dr. Fate, etc. (or you can just relegate them to Earth-2 if you don't wanna use them of course). Interestingly enough, I think that Sandman (Wesley Dodds) is sorta like the JSA counterpart of Batman, since he's a masked vigilante who doesn't kill and instead knocks out his opponents with sleeping gas. That kind of ability and the fact he wears a gas mask would kinda make him a bit of a loner unless he expects all his teammates to wear gas masks too. Anyway off-topic.

My own DC fanfic is gonna try and incorporate as much obscure DC lore as I can, from the JSA to the Doom Patrol to the Legion of Super-Heroes to the Challengers of the Unknown. You don't have to, but there's interesting lore nuggets in there. For example, Hourman's pill which gave him super strength for an hour, Miraclo, is the chemical precursor to the Venom serum that Bane uses.

However, Raven's mom was contacted by the people of Azerath, a realm of mostly women who purged all negative emotions from themselves and lived in peace together (Trigon being the embodiment of all negative emotions of Azerath, and possibly the entire Multiverse iirc).

Functionally, Azerath and Themyscira are pretty similar. Main different being that Trigon usually destroys Azerath (where Raven grows up), which is why Raven lives on Earth with the Teen Titans anyway. And all the important Wonder Woman stuff you can witness in the movie. And the Olympian God stuff kinda ties into the New God stuff with Apokolips and New Genesis.

************ I think DC things fit best in the DC Multiverse personally, but a standalone story for a single hero isn't out of the ordinary. You're basically talking Earth-5. I cite [[https://m.imgur.com/gallery/CGJGF][this]].

************* It'll be somewhat like earth 5 but certain characters from the DC Universe will be appearing such as super girl aka Shazam's love interest.

Superman and a few others will exist as well but in my continuity.

Like I said, I'm challenging myself (for my own fan fic) to include as many elements of the DC Multiverse in some form. Even Krypto, haha. It'll be a lot.

**************** It's an ambitious project since I actually need to do research into a lot of comics for certain characters. By favorite DC hero is Superman so I want to make not a deconstruction like MM, but more of a quintessential Superman. Kinda like the All-Star Superman, but slightly more modernized and with some inspiration from Smallville. (I was a huge fan of Man of Steel for a couple years, then I watched Smallville and I see that as the definitive Clark Kent, though he is unfortunately isolated from the rest of the DC world since the show couldn't get the rights to Batman or Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern probably would've been too "weird" or expensive back then.) I want to make a version of Superman a bit more like the Reeve one in terms of personality, but rationalized a bit more so the camp isn't there. It can be done, just look at how the Marvel movies did Captain America! Hell, arguably the Supergirl show version of Superman is more in line with the original spirit of the character than in postmodern deconstructions that don't quite do the character /right/.

****************** Yes, basically. And I haven't decided on whether or not to have Earth-2 at all. I like the idea of a historical JSA in the same continuity, but I'd also prefer having Superman be the "first" hero of the modern age, and all other heroes are inspired by him. Except, would Batman exist before (just in the shadows) or after? And I don't really want Superman's story to be a 30s period piece because I specifically want Superman's arc to near its end when he basically changes the world forever for the better, and humanity moves towards a more advanced age (kind like how the people of Star Trek have kinda eliminated racism, poverty and war), and the Legion of Super-Heroes is on the horizon.

I also grapple with if I should have a Smallville-esque mini version of the Justice League before Superman ever goes public, or if I should have a more epic gathering of the Justice League when the world needs it most (on the cusp of an invasion either by White Martians or Starro the Conqueror).

Also the show Young Justice serves as great inspiration because of how shockingly well it handles and integrates the DC lore, from having characters like Guardian and Sportsmaster appear, to even doing plot arcs revolving around Dr. Fate, Red Tornado, Adam Strange on the planet Rann, etc.

Also yes, I wanna make a grand unified DC universe, but the Multiverse is still an important part of DC lore, especially when dealing with the Flash and the various Crises, but that's for later on in the overall progression of the story. I've had to carefully look at how each hero's journey ends. For instance, I kinda like the Dark Knight Trilogy's end for Batman, being that being Batman is good for the city but ultimately self-destructive to the point where all his loved ones have left him, even Alfred. Basically I think it's Batman's destiny to retire and have a family, but leave behind a legacy (be it to John Blake, Terry McGuinnes, or whoever else). The Batman timeline will be confusing to figure out, since even the New 52 kinda flubbed up with how Batman has a 12 year old son even though his journeys as the Batman has only been some 5 years up to that point. But I like how huge the Batman Family is.

The Superman Family is actually a tad less difficult, cuz it's usually just Kara, Connor and maybe a Jon Kent the second. But then there's also the Superman Dynasty which is immense, and the Superman Dynasty's genealogies are all over the place. Also there are like 6 different Supergirls in the same continuity. There's the Matrix Supergirl, there's Kara Zor-El, there's a couple other weirder ones...

Now Superman and Batman I can at least understand. But Wonder Woman goes down a rabbit hole of Greek Mythology which kinda has to be modernized to an extent a tie into the New Gods. And there's the Green Lantern stuff which I would like to change up a bit, either to make the colors correspond to the actual spectrum of light (red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta) which is more rational than the tradition-stuck ROYGBIV model. I'd make the Blue Lanterns not useless, the Indigo Tribe less dumb, and the White Lanterns not have the same powers as the Indigo Tribe. There's also the Phantom Lantern, and a better explanation for what the hell Alan Scott was since he isn't technically a member of the actual Lantern Corps...

Wonder Woman's invisible jet will be fun to figure out. The jet being a weird alien life form in some continuities seems fun but also reminds me of a TARDIS from Doctor Who.

My favorite villain is Reverse-Flash so imma have some interesting stories with him I'm sure. He's so fascinating to me. And weird ones like Composite Man, Mr. Mxyzptlk, Dabney Donovan... it'll all be neat.

******************* I'd suggest you have it take place in the present where the Justice League are the old and established heroes. Yes they'll be a bit old but their experience puts them at the top of the line in terms of crime fighting. I'd prefer to have Batman as the first superhero, interestingly enough, with him as the first symbol to strike fear into the hearts of criminals, Superman will be inspired to do the exact opposite of that and be a symbol of hope.

I'd also have Superman crash land on earth in the mid to possibly late 70s maybe the 60s. Batman would be at his peak at forty three maybe 39 years old.

Wonder Woman can be reconstructed in a lot of ways. But those were just my ideas on what you could to do.

******************** That can work. That sounds a lot like the Young Justice show, too: the League is well established, so the focus is on the younger heroes. However, I really really like origin stories which is why I love things like Batman Begins and Smallville. To me, there's something epic about seeing an icon's beginning. Had the same feeling with Casino Royale, X-Men: First Class and even Straight Outta Compton. And Smallville season 10 (which I'm still watching by the way, but very slowly due to the demands of college) is absolutely beautiful, since it's the culmination of Clark's 10-year journey in discovering who he really is and becoming the world's greatest (or at least most iconic) flagship hero.

I might do a thing where Superman and Batman (and Wonder Woman, to complete out the Trinity) are the first heroes of the modern age, but that there were some covert heroics in the 30s to the 80s. Coincidentally it's all very similar to Watchmen, and the Incredibles to an extent. Before the Justice League is created, the flagship heroes learn about the Justice Society and whatever covert things they were up to, and they want to revive that organization (in the form of the League) to combat some impending threat. There will be a "status quo" of normalcy in the world, with coverups abound due to the work of Amanda Waller and the DEO, up until Superman reveals himself to the world. The Batman vigilante will have been around, sure, but street-scale urban legends are less likely to attract worldwide attention than a man in bright colors flying around and saving people in broad daylight.

Batman has to get involved with Superman because of something in Bruce's life that is hugely affected by the "Coming of the Superman" or of some threat that he knows is coming (kinda like the Justice League animated series where they meet up investigating an impending Martian invasion). Except of course I'll have Batman focused more or less on Gotham crime until some catalyst leads him to pay more attention to global threats (maybe some Gotham criminals lead him to some other places in the world, and I can have an international espionage type story). I'd like my Batman to slowly increase his focus range, and this will coincide with him realizing he can't do things alone, and this leads into the creation of the Batman Family. This is how he gets used to the idea of working with other people, which is super important when the League founding arc comes into play.

I want the Superman/Batman pre-League arc to be a major chapter in both of their lives, and it affects Dick Grayson's life too. Little known fact: the Nightwing is the name of a Kryptonian vigilante before Krypton's destruction. Nightwing and Flamebird was the duo, and I think there was a story arc during which Superman and Jimmy Olsen went to the shrunken bottle city of Kandor, Supes taking on the role of Nightwing and Jimmy being Flamebird, and I think Superman's acting as the Nightwing and his interactions with Jimmy's Flamebird was inspired by Batman and Robin. So however I have Superman mention to Batman and Robin the vigilantes Nightwing and Flamebird, this is what inspires Dick Grayson's Robin to take on the mantle of Nightwing, because that was the closest thing Krypton had to Batman himself (which he wants his Nightwing persona to be similar to, but distinct from enough at the same time). And then later on when Dick Grayson becomes the Nightwing, his relationship with Starfire leads to her calling herself the Flamebird. All these connections will truly remind the reader (or audience, if I decide to make this into an indie animated thing which I might do since that's my major) that there is a larger world here, and characters will be affected by the characters and events at the different "levels" of the DC Multiverse (whether it be the street level, international level, space level, myth level, etc.).

Also Composite Man is very similar to (the Dark Knight version of) Two-Face in a lot of ways. Guy named Joseph Meach, Superman trusted him enough to have him work for him at the Fortress of Solitude, so he probably starts out as a really good guy but he somehow turns evil when he gets the powers of the Legion of Super-Heroes' main Legionnaires, and he has that split-face appearance. Due to that design of looking half-Superman and half-Batman, he should first appear as a villain to both of them, probably because he knows or is a huge fan of the two heroes (the green skin will just be an effect of the lightning bolt that gave him his powers, and/or I can relate him to Brainiac in some way since I want Brainiac to be an immense villain in the story at some point). It'll be unconventional but Composite Man's appearance alone means he ought to be a villain for a Superman/Batman "World's Finest" teamup story.

Red Tornado will be the hardest one to explore, cuz I have to connect like 4 different characters into (his) story. There will be the first, Ma Hunkel Red Tornado on the JSA, who inspires TO Morrow's construction of the Red Tornado android, except that'll somehow also have to tie into Adam Strange's adventures on the Planet Rann and the Rannian "Red Tornado" wind elemental creature called Ulthoon. Hard to figure out which comes first in that regard, but at least maybe the android is a combination of Morrow's tech (possibly also funded by the military and oversaw by Sam Lane) and the Rannian wind spirit, which is how it has seemingly magical control over wind.

I also want to use characters made up for the DC movies and shows that didn't originate in the comics. Popularly known characters and concepts are Kryptonite (originated in the radio show rather than the comics), Harley Quinn (Batman TAS), Mercy Graves (Superman TAS), but I also wanna use characters and concepts made up in Smallville (Chloe Sullivan, Virgil Swann, the Teagues, the Veritas group, 33.1, Vordigan, Milton Fine, Lionel Luthor, Lillian Luthor, Lucas Luthor, Julian Luthor, Grant Gabriel, etc.), the CW shows (Harrison Wells, Tess Morgan, Eddie Thawne, Joe West, Alex Danvers, Time Wraiths, the way they did Savitar, etc.), the DCEU (June Finch, Calvin Swanwick, etc.), the Nolanverse (Rachel Dawes, John Robin Blake, etc.), even the Donnerverse (Richard and Jason White, Eve Teschmacher, Non, Ursa, Leonard Luthor, etc.).

A lot of research going into this. I just love the idea of creating a quintessential, [D]efinitive [C]hronicle of these characters and adventures.
