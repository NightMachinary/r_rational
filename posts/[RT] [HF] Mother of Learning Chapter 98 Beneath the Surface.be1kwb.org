** What I love about this story so much is that anytime Zorian takes a break to unwind, It carries over to the reader. Nobody103 develops tension extremely well, and when it is about to be too much we get a bit of cuteness and tranquility inserted to keep it from being too much. There is no character who I have ever empathized with as much as Zorian.

​

On a more story related note, there is clear room for maneuvering in the contract, it is just that every form of it involved deceiving Zach. I have a consistent worry that this story is going to end with either a battle with multiple deaths, and Zach or Zorian dying, or something clever yet bittersweet.

​

Finally and most importantly, Novelty continues to be adorable, and so does Kirielle.

**** Despite Tinami's love of spiders, I foresee two significant obstacles to shipping. Firstly, Novelty is too naive and innocent to be dealing with a politically ambitious House, and secondly, they're apparently keen on bloodline powers, and aranea can't pass those on to humans. (Except perhaps by the humans ritually sacrificing them to steal their powers using blood magic. Enough said.)

**** Well, they might still have analogues of romance (likely with the "mother" of the drone male). If you grant that the evolutionary foundation of romance is that you pick a high quality mate and thereafter your offspring-in-which-you-must-both-invest are related to both of you so your interests are sort of merged now, there is still mate choice involved regarding whose genes you're taking.

(Also note it's not clear if the drone males are produced asexually. Drone males in bees are haploid, they're really almost more akin to glorified flying gamates than full organisms, by human reckoning. If they are produced asexually the identity of the drone-mother would be even more important, since she would be a genetic half rather than a quarter of the resulting offspring)

Although it's not clear that Areana require parental investment, they do seem to hoard territory and resources and have colonies and clans and wars, so there is some resource investment and allocation involved. It's not obvious that who reproduces with whom is a matter with no emotional weight.

Although I guess the efficient thing to do from an out-breeding standpoint if you're going so far as to make walking sperm would be to send the drone males far away to other clans. That's probably what a non-sentient insect would do. And from that you might form socially form alliances between clans via genetic closeness...but even that requires some degree of emotional weight to the matter of who is related to whom. So it's /possible/ that they don't really think about sex except insofar as pumping out drones to send elsewhere and selecting drones who seem like they have good genes. But unless they are like bees with only one reproductive unit, you'd think that Areana who cared about relatives that they're related to via a drone in other colonies would be under a selective advantage.

Yeah my guess is that the most interesting and plausible way to arrange it is they wouldn't have romance per se, but they might solidify inter-clan alliances via sending drones to each other, and that would lead to a sort of pseudo romance between the reproductive units of different clans. And within clans it might be a point of contention, who exactly got to be a reproductive unit and how exactly they distributed genetic material to their offspring.

Real-life social spiders don't actually have clan conflict, but they are sometimes very inbred, so it may be that the whole thing is unrealistic from the start and that the spider society shown in MoL wouldn't ever make sense, which would require a rethinking of the whole thing

That's mostly limited to Hymenoptera. There are no spiders like that. It's possible that Aranea are since they're not from our world, but I don't think it's likely.

They might have something vaguely like romance, but if Novelty's feelings for Zorian are only vaguely like Zorian's feelings for Novelty, it seems like it would cause a lot of problems. It's like if person A is in love with person B, but person B is friends with person A.

***** Well, Worm's epilogue's job was setting up some stuff for the sequel.

If we want to look at a well-done epilogue for a web serial that most likely won't ever see a sequel, I'd point to Twig's. There, significant parts of the story are actually told via the epilogue chapters. They don't only give closure on side characters, but also actually wrap up several plot threads that were pertinent to the main story.

Of course, the reason that the POV shifts away from the Lambs and Sylvester in particular is that they're undergoing the process of becoming Lords, finalizing their "growing up". Their story isn't finished, but their /childhood/ is. Thus, we only see them again after they've fully taken over their new forms, and are meeting the "Endboss".

** I wonder how/if Damien's sacrifice in chapter 91, will change how Zorian interacts with Damien next chapter.

I imagine it was something he was profoundly moved by. But, showing (positive) emotional behaviour towards his older brother is out of character for pre time loop Zorian and could contribute to Damien's suspicions that Zorian really isn't his younger brother. Which may make Zorian consciously reign in his emotions. I'm just saying, a heart warming (one sided) reunion with a confused Damien after all that happened would be great. I could only really see something like that happening with an impulsive simulacrum though.

I'm surprised Zorian has the strength to consider going through seeing Taiven die again, this time he knows it would permanent too.

I'm expecting at least a few thoughts on it though - maybe knowing that Daimen isn't as bad, and in fact, Daimen loves Zorian enough to sacrifice his life for him.. Could lead to some realizations about his parents as well.

While Zorian needs to be more circumspect with Daimen, I'll be expecting Zorian's thoughts at the very least to address Daimen's sacrifice. I wouldn't expect a massive conversation though - we got a that in the loop.

*** Or it could be a fake Chekov's gun. We know it is a contingency in case Zorian dies. Maybe Zach also knows this.

Thus when Zach sees Haslush opening the letter and finding something, it finally dawns on him that Zorian is ACTUALLY dead, with all the implications. Otherwise Zach might simply consider that a mind illusion by Zorian. Thus, seeing Haslush opening the letter allows the contract to accept that no time loopers have spilled out and survived, thus allowing Zach to live.

Once the contract dissolves, the final illusion dissolves as well. Since the last part would not be an illusion at all, it can be done without mind magic as well.

I like how author always including something new in the recent chapter, like that detection web ability. When mental enchantment come into play Zorian can become closer to super human at calculating and precision, normal artificer would spent a day at recalculated and adjusted the blueprint but Zorian can do it almost instantly and there's also weponized mini golem Kojenska. Sometime I forgot how young Zorian was, and it's not normal for young mage like him to be extremely capable.

** Is Zach planning to make the youth potion for the original Silverlake? She has plenty of motive to oppose the time loop Silverlake, and isn't much weaker than her since she was already an ancient archmage pre-time loop.

Plus if she also gets the youth potion, she can infiltrate the enemy side with simulacrums that are pretending to be the time loop Silverlake. No one would be able to tell the difference since their souls are practically identical.

  the contract had an expiration date. At the end of the month, it would dissolve and Zach would no longer be bound by it. That meant that after the month went by, Zach would be free to make his experiences as public as possible as he wanted to make them.

  Were the angels really fine with that? The contract strong suggested they weren't, but there was really nothing stopping Zach from doing just that. Maybe not immediately after the month ended, but as years and decades went by? A person might get tempted to write a book or something before he died...

  It would be probably very convenient for the angels if Zach and Zorian stopped Panaxeth's release, but perished some time afterwards...

** Hmm. Something about the contract doesn't seem right.

IIUC, it requires that no one knows about the time loop except Zach. Even if he didn't tell them. After all, Zorian found out all on his own, so if the contract only requires that Zach neutralize anyone he's told, then Zorian ought to be safe, and anyone Zorian's told - like the aranea - should also be exempt.

If they're not, if the contract applies to anyone at all with time loop knowledge, then that means the contract requires Zach to hunt down and kill, for example, the Ghost Serpent, and quite possibly other ancient elementals like Stonechild.
