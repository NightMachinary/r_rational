something positive

rational or rationalist, any genre it's good

can you link something really good that can be listened to (on youtube etc) or read right now?

1. positive

2. short (or a passage / chapter within something longer)

cant think of anything else, no other requirements besides these two

mainly want to see if something really good is fully logical, and how the style is


** You could try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][A Bluer Shade of White]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]] (both by Alexander Wales). They're each less than a 2-hour read.

** How about [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/130698.Ted_Chiang][Ted Chiang]]? He writes only short stories and the [[https://freesfonline.de/authors/Ted_Chiang.html][stories]] he has written tend to be a good fit for this subreddit. I recommend [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/][Exhalation]] as the best story for this community.

Note that I just linked to a collection of some of his stories, but not all of his works are included.

If you want to get all of them, he has two collections on Amazon: [[https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang-ebook/dp/B0048EKOP0/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ted+chiang&qid=1555647513&s=digital-text&sr=1-3][Stories of Your Life and Others]] and [[https://www.amazon.com/Exhalation-Stories-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B07GD46PQZ/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ted+chiang&qid=1555647513&s=digital-text&sr=1-2][Exhalation: Stories]].

I did note that you specified "something positive" though it is unclear to me whether that means you want to read something uplifting/optimistic, in which case maybe this doesn't satisfy that criterion.

** From K J Parker "A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong" ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20130527092350/http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter_2011/fiction_a_small_price_to_pay_for_birdsong_by_k._j._parker/]] )

can recommend his other works as well (The Folding Knife is short and really well done). Former Discussion about K J Parker : [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/92mv36/k_j_parker/]]

Also "The Dark Wizard of Donkerk" by Alexander Wales is often recommended and fairly short : [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html]]

*** On a more reasonable note, if you can devote just two hours a day to reading HPMOR then you can get through the whole thing in right around three weeks, which is really not that bad. If you can spare three hours a day, then you're looking at about two weeks, which is even more not that bad than three weeks.

**** had someone linked an audio version of HPMOR or something from the sounds of it? [[/u/wizzwizz4]]

im a slow reader, but listen on 2x or more speed, but listening on fast speed is unlikely to be good for stories

***** They said something to the effect of "if you listen to the HPMOR audiobook a few hours a week, you can get through it in under a year." People downvoted it, like a lot. I think it's silly that people downvoted it.
