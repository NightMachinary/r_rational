Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You are a magical girl. You have a pool of power which you can draw from to evoke various effects. This pool has no maximum amount, but does not replenish on its own; the only way to gain more power is by killing another magical girl and absorbing theirs or by defeating scary monsters.

The main powers of a magical girl are transformation, conjuration, manipulation, and enhancement. All of these are limited by the girl's domain, which is some class of manmade things. The domain also modifies the base power costs of various effects, making some more or less efficient. Your domain is *cleaning supplies.*

*Transformation*:

- All magical girls have the ability to transform, replacing their body with a facsimile, and detransform, reversing the process. Transformation costs only a token amount of power, and detransformation is costless. Staying transformed imposes an ongoing power cost; an hour transformed would cost a moderate amount of power. The transformed body appears similar to the original apart from its costume and sometimes minor cosmetic differences such as strange eyes or hair. All powers are more potent and efficient in this form. A transformed body performs slightly beyond the peak of what is humanly possible in most respects, apart from strength, which is massively enhanced. It is not much more durable than a peak human body, but it is much more robust, like a Hollywood zombie. This form does not retain damage or alteration between transformations; a magical girl who loses an arm, detransforms, and then transforms will be good as new.

- Detransformation is instantaneous, while transformation initially takes a few seconds, though the time can be reduced with practice. You are able to transform in half a second, and your costume is a maid outfit with perpetually sudsy hems.

- Like all powers, transformation and detransformation can be invoked at will, but this will can be involuntary. Magical girls who experience sufficient pain or shock will reflexively detransform. This reflex can be trained out to an extent with practice. You can grit your teeth and maintain your form through anything less painful than dismemberment.

*Conjuration*:

- All magical girls have the ability to conjure items from their domain. Power cost scales with distance, mass, volume, and material displaced; displacing anything denser than air is very costly. Cost also grows exponentially with a new conjuration's proximity to another magical girl relative to its proximity to yourself. There is a moderate ongoing cost to maintaining conjurations as well which is based on only mass and volume. Dismissing conjurations is costless.

- You can conjure all sorts of cleanings supplies: brooms, trash picks, dustpans, cleaning agents of all kinds, and so on. Magical girls differ in the strictness of their domains; unfortunately, you can only create things which actually exist or have existed. You could attempt to game this by making novel cleaning supplies yourself, but your magic is unlikely to recognize their legitimacy unless you manage to get them widely used (even though it is perfectly happy to let you conjure replicas of singleton items that were created without your influence.)

*Manipulation*:

- All magical girls can manipulate items within their domain in various ways, most commonly telekinetically. You can exert forces on cleaning supplies. Power cost seems to scale with magnitude of acceleration in addition to magnitude of force, such that you can have brooms sweep at low cost but accelerating a tiny mass to ballistic velocities would be a great expenditure.

*Enhancement*:

- All magical girls have some ability to enhance certain properties of items within their domain. You have a vague ability to eliminate contaminants and germs from cleaning supplies. You could use this to mop up blood and continuously delete the blood soaked up by the mop, for example. This has a very low power cost.

*Special*:

- Most magical girls have one or more specific abilities in addition to the standard ones. You and your clothes are perfectly clean at all times. Your body passively and involuntarily repels contaminants, and you never have to use the bathroom.

How do you use these powers, particularly in combat? (You can use them for other things, but assume that you are trying to keep them secret from non magi.)

*** A "cleaning products" domain is very well suited for chemical attacks. The traditional, don't-try-this-at-home, example is mixing bleach with an acidic cleaning product to form chlorine gas, but the domain of cleaning can also include industrial-strength products which can be extremely caustic or acidic, particularly when combined properly. For example, think about the chemicals that are poured into commercial pools or the stuff that's used in industrial applications to clean machinery--it can get extremely nasty to the point where you need to wear an ABC grade hazmat suit to handle the stuff.

Even better, if the gas formed by mixing cleaning products still counts as "in the domain", applying telekinesis to it would be an extremely effective attack against anything that needs to breathe and is also well suited for assassination (and to prevent killing yourself in a gas attack obviously). Specifically, you can whip up an odorless gas that's so deadly that only people who've been trained to recognize hypoxia, have quick reflexes, and have an o2 mask within arm's reach would survive.

*** As others have pointed out you're functionally the chemical weapon domain, but people don't realize how far this can go. Household chemicals are cute, but they don't hold a candle to industrial hygiene and cleaners. Probably the nastiest cleaners for us would be those used for oil. They use chemicals that are nightmarishly toxic even aside from their real function: to break down the highly resistant organic sludges left over from everything. You're made of much less resistant organics than the things those cleaners eat through.

Depending on the powers definition of "widely used" these could also be very cheap. Is it widely used by person popularity, by tons a year, or by societal impact?

Another area for exploitation is your immunity to contaminants, with a bit of "manual" work you can also be the bioweapon magical girl.

Conjuration in proximity to other magic girls has an easy work around also: just carry your chemicals. Put "safer" ones in whatever works, and get ampules of the more dangerous ones. Bad accidents wouldn't be dangerous to you, and you can probably mitigate them with your power.

Also you can survive off of rotten/diseased/poisonous food and water. And act as a limited intake black hole for water.

*** I'm not sure how scary the scary monsters are, but my first thought is that while on a surface level you may appear to be Magical Girl Cleaning Supplies, in reality you could be considered as Magical Girl Chemical Weaponry. To give an example, think of how many human-hostile chemicals are used in laboratories to clean equipment. Even with more mundane supplies (though take this with a grain of salt, given my lack of explicit knowledge) you could cause some pretty nasty chemical reactions to occur. Especially given one notable hole in the limits on conjuration - what stops me summoning something really quite dangerous /juuuuust/ above someone's skin? Or, alternatively, once the rival magical girl begins their monologue, from summoning just a little bit of something poisonous inside their open mouth?

There's also something to consider regarding what counts as 'influence' when it comes to replicas of singleton cleaning items. Could I ask a friend to ask a friend to ask a friend to clean up their house using a broom that also works a firearm? What if the last person in the chain had no idea why the previous friend wanted it? Would that still be influence? Because if you game the system to summon almost anything, that could be big.

I don't know how I would research this, but I would be legitimately surprised if some combination of cleaning equipment couldn't combine explosively.

I'm also thinking of radiation, since that's occasionally used to sterilise medical equipment and such. Perhaps you could conjure the radiation itself? Seems potentially useful for ambush, especially since each individually chunk of radiation conjured wouldn't need to be maintained for very long.

You could conjure 'ropes' of steel wool, perhaps, to tangle and restrain foes. Even if someone could have the strength to break through, they might get bogged down by it. Similar to dangerous chemicals, you could also just conjure it very close to sensitive areas like the eyes and face. Enhance the scrubbing ability of the wool and oof, ouch, owie.

Speaking of enhancement, a great deal of cleaning equipment works by killing unwanted organisms. Bug spray or rat poison might be considered an aspect of this, if your power is feeling generous. What if you were to enhance the toxicity of these substances? That could be very effective at causing... accidents.

Oh, and clothes perfectly clean at all times? Sounds like they'd make decent bandages. If not for you, then for other people. Cleaning wounds is a form of cleaning, so that's also enhanced.

Alcohol is a pretty common cleaning supply. It's also present in a lot of drinks. Would be a shame if an enemy magical girl didn't know their limits when you 'enhance' the cleaning powers of the alcohol in their drink.

Last thing I can think of that might be useful for combat at the moment (and this is a stretch) is that some cleaning supplies might have been... made out of humans. Or monsters, if a company gets on that! So while I understand that there's probably a hidden limit here, is there anything stopping you from manipulating the relevant human parts?

Hope this helped!

I probably should have gone into greater detail on this one, but the argument to make here is that it's very difficult to not have an influence on the world, butterfly effect style. The example I gave was bad for showcasing this since it was deliberate action, but there's a bunch of edge cases here. What if the magical girl accidentally and unknowingly inspired some onlooker to create a new cleaning product? What if someone was inspired by the aftereffects of a combat she was involved in without even realising it was the cause of a magical girl? What if she had an interaction with someone that resulted in them creating a cleaning product they wouldn't have made, even if that interaction had nothing to do with it, and simply influenced the events by random chance?

To take this and condense it a little, does this aspect of the powers care about the intent of the magical girl, the intent of the person creating the product, how a layperson would look at the situation, or something else entirely?

****** The powers care about whether whether the product was in any way created for the sake of gaming the powers. In ambiguous situations they err on the side of stinginess. They have some abstract sense of "legitness;" they would be unlikely to accept a singleton firearm broom created even without your influence if for example that broom's purpose was primarily as a concealed firearm and it wasn't used much for cleaning. They are fickle and don't follow any simple algorithm. You can think of them as a low superintelligence with an alien passion for cleaning supplies.

*** If you had the completely unrestricted ability to create /any/ substance that has ever been made, from carbon nanotubes to iridium alloys to white phosphorus to botulinum toxin, probably the most reliable go-to for general purpose ludicrous overkill in direct combat would probably be Chlorine trifluoride. It's already been used in several ratfics, my favorite appearance being Dungeon Keeper Ami, where it taught gods what it's like to feel very small and very terrified.

This chemical is actually produced and used regularly IRL, for one single application: to /clean/ chemical vapour deposition chambers.

*** Sorry I'm late. I have some ideas, and I'll try not to rehash what the others have said.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Important goal: conjure things here, get them over there.

#+begin_quote
  Dismissing conjurations is costless.
#+end_quote

Ahah: this is going to be very useful. Suppose I conjure spill absorber powder and use it to blot a stain, then dismiss the absorber. Does the liquid it has absorbed go away with it?

If yes, then a stream of oven cleaner (lye) becomes a disintegration ray--the dilution of its potency is negated by dismissing that which has already reacted. Like pressure washing, but the pressure washer fluid disappears and takes whatever it is touching with it. Actually, I'll literally shoot it out of a pressure washer. Might void the warranty on my conjured item.

If no, then mixing chlorine bleach and ammonia becomes a devastating triple punch. First I get chloramines--toxic gas. After they are inhaled I can dismiss the bleach. That leaves my opponent's lungs full of amino radicals, which explode. Then I dismiss the amino radicals (through the ammonia), and all the explosion products explode again.

Any can of spray cleaner becomes a weak grenade. I'll dismiss the can that contains the cleaner, and the contents are splashed everywhere. Conjuring other materials within a can could also make it explode. For example, I could carry a canister of propane and conjure lye in it to make it go boom.

There is another way I can dismiss things to great effect: vinegar and baking soda in a trash bag. It will inflate to some volume. Then I dismiss the contents and the implosion will be a deadly thunderclap.

How about this: I use hollow mop handles as gun barrels. Ideally, I conjure one made of steel or aluminum with a plastic cap at one end. I use baking soda and vinegar to fill it with gas, then conjure a lye pellet embedded in abrasive glass polish at the open end. I dismiss the gas, the blob and pellet shoot out through the plastic cap like a bullet. Hopefully my opponents misjudge the deadliness of the mops I send swiffering across the battlefield.

Other than that...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I could set things on fire. Smoke is a contaminant; it will hinder my strong but otherwise mostly human opponents but leave me alone. In a pinch I could set dumpsters on fire and let the toxic gas diffuse. If my own summoned chlorine gas (bleach+acid) counts as a contaminant, even better. It's critical I keep opponents from getting too close--so I should walk in a cloud of chlorine gas.

Elephant's toothpaste is a mixture of soap, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium iodide. The last is a catalyst, so although it isn't a cleaning agent I can carry it around. I add additional cleaning agents for different foams; in particular, a large quantity of isopropyl alcohol or nail polish remover could make it a good way to cover the battlefield in fire. Maybe I get my mops to help spread it, if direct telekinesis isn't enough. I try to summon the peroxide in the gas tanks of parked cars, which will rupture and allow the foam to escape for 'free' fuel.

Speaking of free things in the city, why not rip open fire hydrants to get water for soap. Sudsing up the battlefield not only makes the terrain amenable to my powers, but it gives me a cover for more deadly substances. If the foam matches my outfit's suds, all the better: I can hide in it.

I coat windows in cleaner and break them, to try and move the glass with telekinesis.

Anyone who tries to physically attack me will find a metal broom handle or trash can lid in the way. Projectiles are a bigger problem--but I'm a magical girl, so a few punctures might be bearable. I summon paper towels to stuff in wounds, and plastic bags to tie things shut. Clouds of (light) sponges give me a second to dodge; plumes of heated air make aiming a challenge. A smokescreen of floating sponges might be worth it.

I hold most of these tricks in reserve. Hunting monsters for power is (probably) easier, and certainly more moral. Surfactants spread to cover still water. If I can lure the monster into a lake, I can coat them in soapy poison and keep track of them through a cloud of toxic smoke, while I implode lawn bags to disorient them and shoot them from every direction with my mop guns.

For a day job, I work at a drive-through car wash. That is a place where everyone is too impatient to notice my powers, and where many cleaning agents are on hand should I need them in a hurry. Foaming engine degreaser is a nice mix of flammable, toxic, corrosive, explosive, and inconspicuous at a car wash.

Are there slime/ooze/dirt monsters? They seem in-genre, and weak to cleaning supplies. So you could grind for power by seeking them out and mopping them up. Same applies to bug monsters if pesticides count as cleaners (even if they don't, I assume bleach kills insects).

*** Different point from the cleaning-specific munchkining, but the notes on transformation speed and consumption rate on transformation versus while transformed means you could have more efficient power usage by improving your speed here. Grab something long and sharp or with a weight on the end and transform when you swing, put some distance between the two of you, and then untransform until approached or until your next attack if the enemy needs to approach you (or is a mindless monster). The chemicals other people mentioned will have their damage ramp up over time, so attacking, then jumping backwards and untransforming while your enemy writhes in pain could work.

Probably want to work out how outfit transformation rules work, since being able to hide it all across transformations under a large trenchcoat would help with being stealthy, or at least not immediately recognised when you attack.

You mention conjuration gets harder with proximity to another magical girl being greater than to yourself, could you still pull your am back while holding a knife, coat or modify the blade, then lunge forward to stab? The knife is just a simple example, here rather than only application of tempprarily keeping something close to you before launching or moving it somehow.

Also, I assume conjured items last past the detransformation? This would be important to know where hazmat suits and not wasting power staying transformed is concerned.

Oh, and you mention transforming/detransforming/transforming returning you to functional health, can others use it to "scrub" off any chemicals? Can you use it yourself to make excess flesh/blood/ even limbs, since your shtick is chemicals anyway being able to have some additional resources on hand couldn't hurt? Even outside of that being your thing, faking severe injuries with a puddle of blood you quickly replace via transformation could work to turn the tables on someone.

Edit: oh, does detransforming and retransforming restore stamina and how rested you feel? Being able to find space in a fight for less than a second to be back to top shape seems abusable.

*** For more mundane use, I'd probably start an incredibe maid service. I'm the best maid basically ever, and as long as I am not too quick I can finish faster than anyone without drawing suspicion. Furthermore, while I don't really know enough about this type of stuff, don't people messing around with bacteria and viruses and other similar stuff need incredibly sterilized environments? I'd be good for that as well.

Speaking of sterilization, could I clean wounds well? That'd be helpful for when I or others become injured. I could conjure a broom and use it as a splint or crutch in emergency situations.

Since I can manipulate cleaning supplies, and chemical agents have been mentioned, I could do some pretty nasty stuff via attacking with some of the stronger stuff, especially if I manage to get/have incredibly fine control over the supplies. Less quantity means less power expended, and with fine control I can do more with less so.

*** Does ordinary water count as cleaning supplies? Someone already mentioned pressure cleaners. I would like to further add that the ability to manipulate existing water is quite versatile - depending on how far you can stretch the definition of "cleaning supplies", you might be able to get the entire powerset of a waterbender. The clean water that comes out of a tap should definitely count as cleaning supplies, because that is its primary purpose. Historically, people bathed and washed their clothes in rivers and lakes, so bodies of freshwater might count too. Also, wet ice blasting and steam cleaning exist, meaning that you can manipulate water in different states of matter.

And why stop at *water*? Self-cleaning ovens use heat, or *fire*, to clean things. Compressed air cans clean away dust with *air*. Sandblasting uses sand, glass beads, and other forms of *earth* to clean surfaces. +Be the Avatar, master of all four elements.+

** Meant to post this on Sat but got too busy, hoping it gets some interest. If not there's always next week. The scenario is ripped from Stephen King's /Under The Dome/, which I highly recommend as a pseudo-rational and very good novel. Minor spoilers follow, but scenario #3 is fully made up and does not constitute one.

A 50km radius sphere, centered on a small town in rural Maine, becomes encapsulated by a transparent dome of force. The dome is impermeable to anything larger than a water molecule, and is 1% as permeable to smaller particles as normal air. Light travels normally through the dome, and sound is a bit muffled but perfectly audible. The dome is a fully immovable object--there is no amount of force that can damage, deform, or otherwise alter its perfectly spherical shape. It has as much friction as standard window glass.

A few scenarios for munchkinry:

1. You are the mayor of the small town trapped inside the dome. Unlike the tyrannical character who ends up in charge in the novel, you are an upstanding and rational civil servant with the best interests of your constituents at heart. With no indication that the dome will ever come down, how do you go about shepherding resources and realigning the town's society and economy to last for as long as possible cut off from all outside resources? (Hint: you'll want to seriously cut down on any kind of particulate emissions, since they can't escape and will accumulate.) Also consider how you would set up a dome-washing process, as otherwise dust, dirt and smoke will adhere to the inside surface and eventually blot out the sun.

2. You are the CEO of an advanced technology R&D corporation with deep ties to world governments and commensurately deep pockets, as well as a team of the world's best scientists and engineers at your disposal. How do you exploit the physics-defying nature of the dome to advance Earth science? Bonus points for doing this in a way that preserves (or, better, helps) the poor residents of Domesville.

3. You are an aspiring supervillain whose latest scheme went better than you could possibly have imagined. You now have the ability to create one invulnerable 50km sphere at a time, given six months of complex calculations and one goat sacrifice. How do you use your newfound power to achieve world domination, with the understanding that if you become Public Enemy #1 as soon as anyone finds out you're responsible for the dome? Domes you create are anchored to the Earth's frame of reference, and their rules apply to you the same as any other matter.

First would be gathering the representatives of each household in one building to set up some rules and prevent panic. The only people exempt from this eetign are emergency services (especially firefighters, even amateur ones, since a fire under the dome means doom).

1. First of all, we assume strict water rationing and recycling / filtering, as best we can. Even though the dome allows rain in and ground water out, most of it is not drinkable.

2. Strict fire control: use of open fires will be limited to communal kitchens, and any use of fire outside of it must be first reported and consulted with t he Emergency Services.

3. Rationing of food. All foods not currently in people's households are reclaimed and rationed by the Town Council, and the citizens are also encouraged to go on a minimal diet and share with their neoghbours.

*** For point 2, its arguably small potatoes, but setting up some sort of contest using your clout as an R&D corporation for "give us ideas for how to crack the dome and win $X money if it works" (circulated among media streams low in general dumbassery), or a more professionally-orientated version of "present us a reasonably planned but only theoretical way to crack the dome and win $X money if it works," or the corporate "show us a functional version of whatever destructive tool your organisation has come up with an we'll help with transport/organisation/personnel costs and win $X money/funding/contract if you succeed" (while gathering as much information as possible even if they take a straight pay out). If you have money available, nothing says you have to be the one to solve the problem yourself.

Regardless, the best by the standards of the current world of possibilities that you have on payroll at the start, and the best at dealing with something completely new and novel are likely two different groups, so the more minds you can get on board the merrier).

For point 2, you might want to clarify the nature of the calculations. Like if the 6 months has to be constant and the result used immediately (otherwise you just stack up calculations to drop a bunch of spheres at once). Regardless, world domination seems like you take action on days with religious significance, so as soon as anyone gets an idea who you are, all you have to do is scream there's some sort of deity on your side and you've at least got some level of a base of diehard supporters backing you up. Or if you think you can get a few off before getting caught, crippling a bunch of powerhouse countries/organisations and declaring allegiance to whatever is left keeps you hopefully useful and alive, much more easily if you can stick a door into a sphere and suddenly you have a nuke-proof city. I don't know if these calculations or skills are transferable though, which would dramatically lower your value, unless you can convince people you could also discover other tools too (in which case its a matter of using the spheres to get funding to research tools better suited to world domination instead).

** A SCP inspired munchkinry... (inspired by [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo][TABOO]]).

You can swap the names of “things” (people, places, and things) in your line of sight. Once the name is swapped, then for information processing purposes, the conceptual identifiers of those things are swapped. Identifying sub-portions of the swapped things still work, but looking at the the things as a whole results in the swapped identification.

- For a simple example I name a Red Delicious Apple “Apple_1” and the soft blue pillow I use in my bed as “scruiser's pillow”. I then swap their names. People would now see the pillow as Red Delicious Apple and the apple as a soft blue pillow. Breaking things down or looking at sub parts can penetrate the swapping effect, for instance looking at a tiny portion of the apple people could correctly identify it as red or feeling they shape of the apple in the dark they could identify it as apple shaped, but seeing too much information and they will go back to seeing the apple as a pillow.

Other quirks:

- Users of this power can overcome the effect with enough analysis, introspective thought, experimentation, or by seeing the process as it happens.

- Users of this power can quickly name things that lack Proper noun names with a few minutes concentration (for instance naming a pillow or an apple). Non-users need to regularly use that name both in their head and out loud for a few hours to a few days to make it count as a name.

- Renaming things can partially or completely undo this power's effects. A non-user of this power could repeatedly refer to the blue pillow as the inedible-apple until that sticks as a name, and this name would have more correct conceptual identifiers (soft, blue, non-edible) with maybe one or two incorrect ones stuck on it (thinking of the pillow as apple-shaped even when it isn't).

- people tend to rationalize the inconsistencies... if you swapped a person's name with a tree's name other people might reason that the tree is a person standing very still and that the person is mobile and sapient tree while the person with a tree name might rationalize that they are a tree that recently gained sentience and human motor skills, and with repeated renamings might eventually recognize that they are actually person shaped and sized.

- You can spread this power to other people by swapping their names and letting them struggle with an epistemic breakdown. If the manage not to go completely insane or accidentally kill themselves or get killed they develop the name swapping power after a few weeks (typically renaming themselves in the process).

Munchkin Challenges:

A Fey Creature operating under the names of “a clever scholar” and Dr. Japers is loose in the world.

- What things can this Being of Faerie do to maximize harm and/or maximize the chance of breaking the secrecy of magic? What things might this Fey Being do to make money and keep a low profile?

- Conversely how might you catch the Clever Fey Scholar as member of a magic secrecy preserving organization with the full might of the US government behind you (but little magic yourself).

- how might you use this power as a person who has just gained it and become aware of said Fey Entity and a sketchy secret organization?

**** It needs to be specific material things you can see. A particular Bible and a particular printout of the Lesswrong Sequences could be name-swapped, but not all Bibles with the Sequences as a whole. Likewise the Economy as a whole lacks a physical material existence to be seen and swapped with.

Still swapping a prized family Bible that someone used frequently with the Sequences printout would probably work for the purposes of brainwashing them into a Rationalist. They wouldn't forget parts of the Bible they already memorized from other editions of the Bible, but unless they memorized the entire Bible they would rationalize the Sequences as parts of the Bible they missed or overlooked or forgot about.

The Moon would work... if you swapped it with a location, everyone would be convinced that location had no atmosphere and was unreachable without spaceships. Big Locations work kind of weird... if you swapped a house or a neighborhood people would believe that the Moon's properties applied to it, but if you swapped the Moon with an entire city, people might be able to rationalize how individual subportions/buildings/neighborhoods/streets have breathable air despite the city of Moon as whole being a barren airless isolated environment.

** Given the ability to travel back in time, you have the ability to make small changes. What is the smallest change you can make that wouldn't have a long noticeable effect until you return?

This was going to be a part of a story I was attempting to write, but I've hit writer's block. I want an incentive to have a normal person join a dangerous job, and not cause a disturbance in the past. The idea is that any changes you make if they are big enough butterfly effect away the person making them, but something small doesn't mess up time enough. The job would be stealing information from the past (so it doesn't change too much).

I don't have hard limits on the time travel, other than I'm thinking of within the lifetime of the individual time traveling. The idea originally seemed novel, but after thinking about it, it seems more like some bastard child of Terminator 2 and Timecop...

Edit: the incentive I was looking for is for the recruits. I was thinking something like depositing money into a savings account they wouldn't know about until they return, thus giving them the principle, plus interest, but that is both more messy than I wanted and not interesting enough.

***** You could steal from other thieves (or make a duplicate to further minimise problems). If someone is already breaking into a place or system anyway, you gaining that information won't change the public/police perception of what occurred, and whoever originally committed the crime will be prioritising escape and/or hiding from established forcea, rather than a sudden time traveller appearing. And even if you get noticed somehow in your own theft, the original thief/s is still going to be the one on the hook to everyone else and need to prioritise hiding still, rather than prioritising tracking you down.

Oh, and depending on the type and methods of theft, maybe you just follow in their footsteps instead. Investigations will look for one theft, rather than two sequential independent thefts, because how would two thefts even happen without your advantage of literal foreknowledge?

Edit:

Also, stealing from a thief who gets caught before they could use/sell the information originally just means people affected are wary and cautious, since you won't use the information until your own time anyway, and they wouldn't trust the "a guy I never saw before took it from me" defense of the thief.

Encryption from way back is now easy to crack. (So hack into databases/servers. Extract encrypted data. Store it safely. Decrypt it in the future.)

You could get to crimes before they happen and film them.

Or just look up someones deleted Facebook page.

Then when you come back, blackmail someone with that information.

Or sell the information to historians. Maybe write fake letters/documents. And hide them were it is plausible but nobody finds them.

That said, if I were the recruit, as soon as I am back in time, I would only do the stuff that gives me money. You shouldn't let your employees do the whole work and show them how much money they made you.
