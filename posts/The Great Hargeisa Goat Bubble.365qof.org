I laughed, but I don't know enough economics to see why this wouldn't work.

*** Goats are worth X price today. Planescraping a goat makes it worth 2X. Thus, the new market value of the goat tomorrow is 2X. Where does that extra X come from? From the Goat Compensation Fund.

The Goat Compensation Fund, meanwhile, needs to avoid running out of Xs.

But wait.

If (goat price) = 2 ^ (days since day one) * X , then you can make much money by buying a goat today and selling it tomorrow. If you can make money by doing that, you can make money by selling that capability to make money.

Which is what the goat fund did. They bet their money, which is where the goat-money comes from, on the price of goats going up in the future, but instead of getting that return in the future, they got it /now/ by selling the future returns at future profits, maybe at a markdown.

And so they made enough money for the next round of payouts.

Repeat.

Of course, it's a little ridiculous. Like Ouroboros eating it's own tail and growing /larger/ from it. But that's the point. It's all false value.

Source: I got nothin', it just made sense to me. I'm a highschool student that doesn't take Economics for chrissakes, don't trust my word.

EDIT: Spelling and more on why not to trust me.

**** Planescrape: Torment, the story of a man who cannot die and is repeatedly run over by a jet. Played as a farce.

That said: what the Goat Fund did was replace itself, to where previously the Fund was the main source of dollars, now it's entirely speculators that fund the system. Instead of being backed by the UN, the price goes up because the price will go up. The self-fuelling nature is what truly made it a bubble. (Before, it was merely irresponsible fiscal policy from the UN.)

  "Alternatively, the slaughter and personal consumption of the goat, while keeping one alive in the short term, would lead in the medium term to having no goat, and no money. In the long term, with neither assets nor capital nor cashflow, death would inevitably ensue. Luckily, my PhD had been devoted to aspects of arbitrage; the exploitation of price discrepancies in imperfect markets. I thus resolved to apply my knowledge of temporary market inefficiencies to my Goat.".

  Soon the shortage of actual goats led to a booming market in goat futures, goat options and increasingly arcane goat derivative products.

  True, the UNICEF budget for Somalia was paying out increasingly large compensation fees to the owners of dead goats, but one of the first moves by the UNICEF Official with Special Responsibility For Goats was to make the goat compensation fund self-funding by hedging much of it in goat futures.
