So are there any fics that explore in realistic detail how a society like the Draka might succeed or fail, and what effect it might have on global politics? I know there's stuff like Decades of Darkness, Separated at Birth: America and Drakia and to a lesser extent Red Son Rising as illustrated in this post here.

** Eh I think a rational or steelmanning of the Draka is probably like rationalizing defection; one of those things you just don't do because you don't want anyone else doing it. On a secondary basis there's the economical argument, to wit slaves don't innovate, and a free society will outperform a slave one.
