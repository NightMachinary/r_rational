Alright, a bit short, but--oh.


** Not related to this chapter in particular, but I just read up through chapter 2 and the detailed and systematic isolation/dehumanisation/abuse of children seems a bit too grim for me. For the sake of my emotions, does their situation improve significantly? And does Allison ever reunite with her parents? Well written though.

*** Thank you. And yes, Allison reunites with her mother in this very chapter. The kids also end up building their own semi-utopian city state in the bush. There's a... lot of shit inbetween, though.
