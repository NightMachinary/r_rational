** I suspect Willow/Secretly Awesome has serious problems with Giles' attitude towards vampires and souls...

The Culture is from a materialistic universe. The strong Church-Turing hypothesis is true, to "laws of physics" levels. There are no "philosophical zombies".

So it doesn't matter if a vampire has a soul or not, by the Culture's standards it's still a person.

They aren't in the same universe and ideas which are silly in their universe may turn out to actually be true. Which is more likely to be more accurate; their preconceived notions from a universe which never existed in reality or the natives' interpretation of gathered evidence which implies the existence of a soul?

**** It doesn't matter whether the culture's expectations are /correct/ or not, they are still going to treat a vampire as a person. Because that's what their /very thoroughly tested and culturally critical/ assumptions will make them do.

If something without a "soul" is not a person, then what about culture drones? What about Minds? Even if a soul is real, "not having a soul" doesn't mean you're not a person, it just means you don't have this backup option when your primary substrate is no longer viable.

** I forgot this was also a Stargate crossover until I went back to read the edits. I'm really curious to see how that comes into play. Story continues to be awesome!

*** I'm pretty sure it's there to give some actual meaningful enemies to fight and new worlds to +conquer+optimise. If it was just a vanilla earth this would be a very short story along the lines of "And then the Culture expanded outwards from one world all over again, almost exactly like last time".

**** I'm worried this won't happen, and we'll have a "higher powers driven" character show up to maintain status quo. Something like the Angel TV show had going on with godly intervention via end of the world as well as personal threats.

***** Well there's already the Ascended, the Ancients and the Ori. The Replicators might count as well depending. I'm kinda expecting the Goa'uld to fold fairly simply. Not quickly and easily because of their numbers, but yeah.

It is a little bit of a worry though. Overpowered characters are fun for a while but you can't really do lasting tension with them.

** A very fun and interesting to read story.

I have been meaning to read the culture novels for a while. Never got around to it. I was never really sure of them. They're absurdly powerful so I doubted there would be much conflict, and I wasn't sure about how much I cared about the character development of alien minds, and even for the books I hear they heavily focused on the fringe's of society.

Shall be interesting to see how this develops.

That's how Bank's maintained his conflict. Most of the books have secret agents plots around civilians or citizens of the Culture becoming agents of the Culture and interacting with other cultures or agents of the Culture interacting with other cultures.

If you want a good anti-death book though, then I don't think you can do better than *Surface Detail*, aside from one rather spectacularly parallel-killer soldier/warship, that is. If you do read it, the weird ending may force you into reading a few other books or spoilers to understand the big reveal.
