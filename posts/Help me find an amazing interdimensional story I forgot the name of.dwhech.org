** You can also ask [[/r/tipofmytongue]] for this kind of thing.

*** I could, yes, but I wanted to ask where I assumed a higher concentration of people knowing the answer. The story is quite niche and I got 2 correct answers within 20 min, which is a great result even without knowing how [[/r/tipofmytongue][r/tipofmytongue]] would fare in comparison; but if such questions are unwelcome here I won't repeat my transgression.

**** It's not necessarily that they're unwelcome /per se/, they're just really low value for everyone else on the subreddit. I've removed it, since you've gotten your answer, which is usually what I do in this situation so that the post doesn't just linger in the subreddit. In the future, it would probably be better to ask on either the Monday thread or the Friday thread, or better, in the Discord linked in the sidebar.

***** Thank you, I'll keep that in mind. I'm not one to be called an avid poster, it's really awkward for me, and I didn't even think of joining the discord, which is kind of obvious in retrospect
