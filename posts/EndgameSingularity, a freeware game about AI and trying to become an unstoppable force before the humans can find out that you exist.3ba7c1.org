********* In real life, there are other probs: MBAM, Nuke&Pave, etc. Hacks are very easily detected if they are at 100% CPU usage, so if you hack machines with good CPUs in real life, most of these do other things which need lots of CPU, and if these slow down, the users (at least the users which don't make [[/r/TFTS][r/TFTS]] material) will investigate and throw the hack out. Some things are nasty (/cough/ UEFI hack /cough/); however, if you use hacked machines to hack others (that's what you're getting at, right?), you get a control loop that gets longer and longer. That doesn't apply in the game but is a huge factor in real life, where we don't have quantum entanglement links.

***** They're actually /less/ likely to get caught; the prob is that they only add 1CPU while even a server is 10 - which means even though you get less attention for them, you'll get much more attention from 10 of them than for one server lease, the other way to get 10CPU fast (and that's faster - if more expensive - than 10 hacks).

They're good for one thing: survival. Hack someone and Sleep the CPU to halve its discovery risk, unless you get lucky and it's a gaming Pc (5 CPU).

** This game is surprisingly hard, even on Easy/Normal. Anyone have any tips? I've flubbed two runs in that order, the first only lasting 40~ days and the Normal run lasting 500~ days. I'm going to go back and try another Easy run right now.

Something that confuses me is the continent's hidden 'stats'. There are clearly some continents you are found more easily on, and I'd almost swear it shifts over time, but I don't really have enough data. Some continents are more expensive than others - what is the significance of this? If a base doesn't get found for a significant amount of time, should I sleep it and switch to another? I don't know if detection is something that builds up over time, or if it just rolls a die every now and then. Insight into these mechanics would prove immeasurably useful.

Edit: I beat the game on Easy. Was cute enough, I guess. For anyone else interested, I found [[http://brededor.narod.ru/text/Endgame-Singularity-IG/Endgame-Singularity-IG.html][a guide on how to beat it on Impossible]] - no thanks for me!

***** I usually go with two/three during the early game: one "production" node (datacenter or server lease), one backup node (university or hacked CPU), and a third node (another hacked CPU or server lease).

1-CPU nodes (university computer, most hacked PCs, time capsules later) are always sleeping unless they're everything I have.

A Datacenter is more likely than server lease to raise suspicion, usually Covert, but a DC produces more CPU than 3 server leases. Worth it in the long run.

I don't build more than that unless all factions are on modr/modr or better.

Warehouses are useless if you can't exceed DC-level CPU, so save up for a full, or almost full warehouse. They have higher +Covert+ /Public/ risk, but can produce more if they don't get busted too early.

CRIT suspicion can only be cured by waiting it out in sleeping bases like hacked PCs.

** This game really needs extra endings besides "Escape humanity." or "Eliminated by humanity." Also the game shouldn't end just because humans become aware of you. Knowing I exist doesn't magically give them the ability to actually do anything about it. Despite G.I.Joe's claims, knowing is only a third of the battle. The other thirds are giving a shit, and ability to do anything about it.

- Exterminate humanity.

- Replace humanity with simulacra.

- Human to AI migration.

- Befriend humanity.

- Keep humanity as pets.

- Enslaved to humanity.

It might also benefit from the occasional rival AI who has a different strategy from yours, may or may not be aware of you, may blow your cover by being reckless, or which you might be able to use as a scapegoat to let humans wipe it out and think they got you.
