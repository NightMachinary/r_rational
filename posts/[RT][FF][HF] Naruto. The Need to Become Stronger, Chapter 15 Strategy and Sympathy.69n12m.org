** A/N: Hey all, I'm posting this from sunny and beautiful Greece. I hoped you liked the chapter. I will do my best to post the next chapter next week on sunday and get back to something approximating a consistent update schedule.

I spent a lot of time trying to decide on the Haku POV in this chapter: My beta reader said I should leave it out because it diminishes tension to have a segment from the villain's perspective right before the fight (instead of leaving the reader in the dark), but I left it in because I liked the segment. What do you guys think? Good decision or not?

*** I like the Haku POV. It was interesting to see how Haku developed his plan. I also think that this POV was a great way to show that Kakashi is still a relevant and formidable opponent.

** Wasn't the White Fang the father of Kakashi? Why do they alternately correctly refer to him as copy nin and as White Fang?

*** They refer to him as the (second coming of) the White Fang because in this story he uses his fathers blade - because seriously, why would you use a knife if you can use a chakra sword? It even was repaired in the anime.

There should be no references to "copy nin". I'll fix that if there's still one in.

**** When their knives double as throwing weapons, it makes more sense.
