** Amusingly, in D&D 3rd edition, the general cost of scribing spells was supposed to be 100 gp per page for materials for spells copied into spellbooks in general, thus making the cost of parchment at 2 sp / sheet a tiny minority of the cost. However, a wizard who could cast Secret Page (third level spell) could cut the costs - the spell Secret Page is used to disguise text or writing as something else, and explicitly lets the caster put spells on the 'fake' pages it creates. So you could take some worthless writings that are cheap to write down, and 'hide' those cheap writing beneath 'fake' spells, and then just memorize your spells per day off of those 'fake' pages displayed by the Secret Page spell. Makes making backup spellbooks much more affordable if you have some downtime during a campaign.

"Yay, easy karma. Oh, wait--didn't some moderator [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ud46u/d_the_rationality_of_different_litrpg_premises/ddtabkm/?context=1][say]] that these abstract posts now were considered unwelcome?"

(checks the sidebar)

"Well, it isn't on the sidebar, and I /know/ that no /reasonable/ moderator would be arbitrary enough to remove posts on the basis of a rule that hasn't been made easily visible to the subreddit's users. This subreddit's moderators /are/ reasonable... /right?/"

*** Rule #1: "Post links to or discussion of rational fiction only." This is neither a rat!fic nor a discussion of a rat!fic, so it probably belongs in Worldbuilding Wednesday.

**** The author describes several fictional scenarios containing rational characters, though in somewhat abstract terms (and abstraction is what the pseudo-rule forbade). How does any one of those scenarios not constitute a piece of "rational fiction"?

***** Are you really proposing that a Wednesday Worldbuilding post would count as fiction if only there were enough of a focus on describing the world and not asking other people for their thoughts?

A description of a fictional scenario is not, in itself, fiction.

Your initial post makes it abundantly clear that you're looking for a fight. The subreddit rules are plain and simple; please do not require the mods to include a five-page dissertation on what is and is not actually a story.

*** We are.

But enough other users reported this to have it automatically removed before I noticed, so I agree with [[/u/callmebrotherg]] on this.

**** Posts get automatically removed if enough people report it?

Couldn't that be abused by somebody with multiple accounts?

***** Potentially, which is why it goes immediately to human review (and we don't talk about it much).

I've never seen something that looked like abuse of the system, so until that happens it's just making sure that spam can be dealt with while the human mods are sleeping. /[[/u/AutoModerator]] never sleeps./
