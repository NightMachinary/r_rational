** Question. As a mobile user, is there an easier way to view the story? It's fairly unreadable for me (I am using Google Chrome on an iPhone 5S)

*** It looks fine in my iPhone 5S in Safari. What's the problem you're having?

**** Its just that the font appears really small. Other sites will automatically scale to adjust to a larger font, or allow you to choose your own font size. like fanfiction.net for instance. I just am not sure if this site has the same functionality.

***** My eyes aren't great but, again, it seems fine in Safari. Still, to help you out I've created a new folder called 'giant', where the files all have significantly jacked up font sizes.

****** Oh wow, thanks! You really didn't have to, but I appreciate it. This looks a lot more readable.

And yea, my eyes kinda suck. I could've read it at its previois size if pressed, like if it was an urgent message, but reading several pages of text that size would've been a lot of not-fun
