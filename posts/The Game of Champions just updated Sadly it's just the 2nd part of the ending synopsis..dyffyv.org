**** It's a Pok√©mon fanfiction by a user named L. Lamora. It borrows elements from the manga, the games and even the anime, and it has really engaging writing and world building. It was possibly the best Pokemon fanfiction out there, before the writer abandoned it. They still give small synopses of future plot, to give some sense of closure, as an alternative to writing it all in proper story format.

*** Are we gonna keep getting these all the way end of the plot?

Because for me, it's still good. With Lamora's fluff it'd be godlike, but just the plot details are good
