EVEN NOW THERE IS HOPE FOR MANKIND!

Almost everyday I would check the page and almost every day I would leave a bit weaker and bit sadder.

But today is not such a day! Today is a great day! Today we get proof Saga of Soul is not dead! Today we get our dreams back! Today we are blessed! [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/ch22]]


** Ok so I read the chapter, not bad, not very long, lots of soft recaps for all of us who may have forgotten the story so far (please have mercy for this heresy Ouri Sama!) and reminders of who is who. One great thing about this I love: The part where they discuss business and law changes that come about from free matter/object replication. Not too detailed, but absolutely great showing what happens in real life if you introduce superpowers. And of course this is not even the first time this story did it.

Void bless us all! Happy days indeed! New year gift came early! huzzah! etc etc!

*** How did you calculate this? It is *way* too low

Even 22! is around 1.1E21

22!!!! (assuming four factorials) is more like 10^{10^{10^{10^{22}}}}

(22!!)!! (two double factorials) is still 9.6E428294002724

**** Just continue the concept of the double factorial for triple and quadruple factorials.

If 10!! = 10*8*6*4*2, then something like 10!!! = 10*7*4*3 and 10!!!! = 10*6*2.

With four exclamation marks, you multiply the given number by every other fourth number down to the smallest number before reaching 1.

22!!!! = 22*18*14*10*6*2 = 665280.

***** Ah, for some reason it never occured to me that there were triple and quadruple factorials, despite knowing about double. Feeling silly.

** Damn, one of the OG rational fics is back in action! I loved SoS dearly for how comparatively fun it was and its ambitious premise, its great to see it back. Does the author frequent the subreddit?

** While it's kind of cool to come back to this story old enough to recognize names like Northrop Gunman and De Beers, I'm just not invested in the story any more, especially with a such a weak and exposition-heavy returning chapter. Even if the author sticks to the premise, the story is never going to be what it would have been because the author is a very different person now (unless something odd happened to them). I'd rather have them start a new story under the same premise, so we can get a proper introduction (First Chapter) to what the story will be.

*** That's an interesting point. The story does feel .. dated to me. Not sure why.
