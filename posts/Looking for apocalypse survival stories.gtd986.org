I'm really interested in reading stories about how the protagonist plans out and prepares for the apocalypse, as in the pre-apocalypse preparation, mid apocalypse reaction, and post-apocalypse survival. I would really enjoy a natural disaster (aka 2012, the day after tomorrow) but ill take anything. It has to have at least a smart protagonist who knows that things aren't gonna magically get better and has to think of ways to survive. I haven't found anything really that interesting, so I would appreciate it if anyone has any recs.


** Honestly, *Hatchet* by Gary Paulsen is fairly rational. You have an inexperienced teenager whom learns, via trial and error and pain, the rules of their survival environment, and prevails through determination and learning. The protagonist is not perfectly rational, but their thought processes and decisions are reasonable and realistic.

** A former top post on here was about a rational (sane) individual during a zombie apocalypse.

As far as prepared post apocalyptic types... James Wesley, Rawles has some decent stuff, if you like his writing (I prefer his nonfiction myself, but you may enjoy).

Seveneves by Neal Stephenson is about the moon blowing up and humanity trying to survive (great read).

I'll try to think of some more stuff later though, and I'll definitely check back because I like the genre too.

** I read it years ago (before I knew what rational fiction was), but I recall Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle being a pretty good post-apoc rational novel. Complete with comet strike, salvaging books from libraries for info on how to make stuff, and maintaining a nuclear power plant for long-term use.

** /Alas, Babylon/ by Pat Frank (1959) is a classic. The main character, Randy Bragg, is not a rationalist, but he is a reasonably competent Reserve Army officer who takes charge of his small Florida town after they get cut off from the outside world by a nuclear war between America and the Soviet Union. [[https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20160905][You can read it online or download the book for free]] (although, technically, that is only legal if you live in Canada).

/1632/ by Eric Flint (2000) is not technically an apocalyptic novel; it's an alternate history novel where the point of departure is that a small mining town in West Virginia gets randomly transported from the present back to Germany during the Thirty Years' War. But I'm including it anyway because defense analyst Stuart Slade (of /The Salvation War/ fame) [[http://web.archive.org/web/20031120165443/http://homepage.mac.com/msb/163x/faqs/nuclear_warfare_103.html][realized]] that the novel's scenario was isomorphic to that of a small town surviving in the aftermath of a nuclear war, and judged the actions of the main character, Mike Stearns, approvingly. Again, [[http://baencd.freedoors.org/Books/1632/index.htm][it is available for free online to read or download]].

/Dies the Fire/ by S. M. Stirling (2004) received [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160710143417/http://www.raikoth.net/ficrecommend.html][a very positive review]] from Scott Alexander, although I have not read it yet.

/World War Z/ (the book, /not/ the movie) by Max Brooks (2006) deserves a mention just for the way it handles [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/01/industry-era-action-stories.html#comment-1818568070][the scale of the conflict]]. The Zombie War is fought and won not by a small team of survivors who retrieve a miracle cure or something stupid like that, but by a global coordinated effort the likes of which has not been seen since World War II. Each chapter focuses on a different character whose story is representative of a much larger number of people in a similar situation, all of which add up to tell the tale of humanity's victory over the living dead.

** Strongly recommend The Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. It's about a teenage girl living in a crumbling U. S., and preparing in case things get worse. They do, she has to flee her home and survive on the road. I loooove this book, it's by far the best post-apocalyptic literature I've read.

** I would very strongly recommend the Lady Astronaut books by Mary Robinette Kowal, first book /The Calculating Stars/. I think it stands head and shoulders over the rest of the genre, both in terms of the science and engineering and in terms of the writing itself.

It starts with the disaster and it doesn't hold its punches on the emotional freight of it, but it's fundamentally optimistic in that very engineer-y way: this is awful, let's build/science our way out of it.

** Sounds like you may want prepper fiction.

Also, I've heard (but not yet read) Day by Day Armageddon is like this as well, so maybe see the goodreads page for that one.

** A good but a little less traditional example is Last of the Lamplight. A narrative let's play of the game Frostpunk. Which itself is a strategy game about surviving a rapid ice age in a steampunk version of the mid-late 19th century.

[[https://youtu.be/dgGynjZs8mg]]

The big good points of it is the really characterful, cynical and not entirely reliable narration, paying attention to the work, suffering it takes to survive, and the scary places society might be taken in the process. And OfficialyDevin puts in a lot of work to rationalize a lot of the wacky science and tech in the game.

Also, robots. Lots of robots.

The game is execellent too, and Id reccomend playing it first. But its narrative elements are more intertwined with gameplay and doesnt really have much story or dialogue outside of it.

** The ongoing manga Dr. Stone, though while the characters are smart and real science is used, the world they live in is very convenient/inconvenient, though the convenience is used to drive the plot forward (eg. having all the people revived be the absolute pinnacle of their fields) instead of as deux ex machina. Its the story of how due to an unexplained incident, everyone on earth turns to stone, but then 3700 years later a genius is revived, and works out that he was revived due to bat guano dripping on him over the years, so he begins making nitric acid to try to revive more people, and restart civilization within his lifetime. Unfortunately, one of the first people he revives is a violent but not dumb anarcho primitivist, who wants to stop civilization from returning using his own revived society. This conflict only spans the first third of the current chapters, and I won't spoil the rest.

**** Thank you. I don't understand why people love it so much. I guess the descriptive writing is nice? But that's hardly a unique trait among writers. And the science makes no sense. In the book, it is stated that ALL plants are dead. How??? What kind of apocalypse kills all plants but not all humans? They are waaaay more resilient than us.

**** Agreed. I don't understand why it has a following when it has no internal logic. Are graphically intense scenes really all you need for a book sometimes? I have never gotten the appeal of The Road.

***** There are so many internet arguments I've got into over the years that were frustrated by stuff like geoengineering to ameliorate global warming, people respond "didn't you watch Snowpiercer?" Like it's a bloody documentary.

Movies and books and whatnot need to tell a gripping story to "survive" in the market. Often they paper over plausibility to do so. One must be ever mindful that the cool and popular latest film is not meant to /educate/.

****** Oh man snowpiercer. Yeah it's not like temperature can get below absolute zero. So even if the surface was 0.001 Kelvin it would be a way better idea to have a large insulated bunker (or, better, a set of independent bunkers with connecting passages) than that stupid train.

** Check out The Bastards of the Apocalypse series. Only book 1 out for now, The Earth Died Screaming. I listened to it on Graphic Audio.

The premis is that a solar flare, or something, it's still unsure blew up the moon and made everyone who looked at the event go blind. The protagonist is ex-military and definitely makes rational decisions throughout the book.

** I don't think I've seen anyone here reccomend /The Postman/. The book, not so much the Costner movie. Its earlier sections have some good stuff about individual survival after a societal collapse (wars and plague, mostly) and overall, the story pushes back against the idea of violent, belligerant survivalism and "rugged individualism" as the "logical" response to apocalyptic scernarios. I've never liked how a lot of post apocalyptic fiction treats human cooperation and mutual aid as some artifact of modern industrial comfort.
