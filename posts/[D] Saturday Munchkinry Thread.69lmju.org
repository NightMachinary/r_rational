Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4xzmpe/wp_everyone_is_born_with_the_ability_to_skip/d6jsqc2/][(._.)]]

You have the ability to “skip time”. During a “skipping period” you're still experiencing everything yourself and with a fully conscious mind, but once you reach the pre-defined end point all that remains from the “autopilot” period is the dry knowledge. What doesn't remain is all the other changes that would've also otherwise happened to your brain and mind.

So, for instance, if you were to overwork yourself using this skipping technique you would not gradually become tired and depressed because of the lack of rest. And if you were to be tortured during a skipping, you would later have a normal recollection of everything that has happened to you during that period but you wouldn't develop PTSD because of the torture experience. The integration of the knowledge from a skipped period could be dangerous, but only as much as would've been watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j98QsMJXJEc][a perfectly realistic first-person VR film,]] or just watching someone else's memories.

1) How could this ability be used for maximal fun and profit if you were the only person who had it?

2) [..] if everybody had it?

3) In what ways would the society be different if everybody had it?

*** First off, I'd try switching models (without changing effects), to see if anything becomes clearer:

- You can make a certain stretch of emotions "temporary". They are experienced fully as they are happening, but at the designated end-point, all temporary emotions are deleted, leaving only their external effects (for a certain definition of "external").
- You can erase emotional experiences, but only by setting up the start/end points in advance.
- You can pass control of yourself to a perfect copy for a stretch of time, and get a report back of what happened at the end, though it is lacking in emotional detail.

Number 3 doesn't seem very useful to me, due to my philosophy on identity. #2 is better, but the perspective it takes on time is a bit wonky and unintuitive. #1 seems as useful as the "time skip" one IMO.

So, with that in mind:

- skip over work days (coming back for lunch, coffee, etc.) to avoid burnout, at the cost of having less connection to your coworkers and losing out on useful emotional warnings like frustration and jealousy.
- Be an impartial judge by skipping once per minute, and making yourself immune to appeals to emotion. This comes at the cost of being jaded, and also missing legitimate emotional arguments.

** I was thinking of Worm CYOAs and the way they had to balance the sudden, extreme leap in power levels late in the series.

[[http://imgur.com/a/ZmWe6][This]] is the latest Worm CYOA. It's pretty polished well balanced ..for the street level.

My question is twofold: how efficiently (i.e. lowest points count, ignoring obvious things like PtV) can this be munchkined to take out Scion and how useful would your build be if you got to bring it to our vanilla Earth?

*** Rule-lawyer answer:

- 7 pts: Ace (with the power of Ace(with the power of Ace(with the power of Ace(with the power...))))

Other rule-lawyer answer:

- 10pts: Replication
- 10pts: Paramount

Create a clone, and have it use Paramount to choose Ace, (with Power Fluctuation to boost you by 250%, and Copycat, to copy your clone). This is the infinite Ace Recursion again, but with more powers.

Without that specific hack: Create two clones (in two weeks), have them use Paramount->Power Fluctuation to boost by 250% each. Use Paramount (which can now choose a power up to 7 * 5 = 35 points worth) to choose Path To Victory for a bit, then follow its instructions.

Real answer, assuming that they all synergize:

- 1pt: Phantom Punches
- 10pts: Combo
- 2pts: Vampiric Regeneration

Start punching Scion (at range), and keep punching him. Get help from a mover when he runs away. Moderately useful on Earth, but not much better than a gun, or possibly some artillery.

**** Yup. I assumed that any real craziness would involve replication, though I honestly hadn't seen Paramount->Power Fluctuation until after I posted this. At this point it does seem to be the way to create an augmentation loop, since you can buff you(r clone's) buffing power even if you make generous assumptions like no infinite Aces or the buff in the case of Paramount is tied to the *time *to switch, not power cost. It hardly matters, at a certain point.

Funny,the CYOA right before this one,which was far more broken and didn't really care about balancing as much as this guy's, had the exact same problem.

Scion would splat the Phantom Punches combo in quick time though.

*** My initial build isn't very efficient and is probably overkill, but it was fun to come up with.

Path:

Conspirator: I'd prefer Rogue, to avoid any obligations, but the synergy with Iscariot is too good to pass up on.

Power:

Kingmaker: 10 points, but this allows me to earn a very lucrative income in two different ways. Firstly, I can detect potential parahumans. I'd probably offer this diagnosis at a reasonable price so that I can have a constant stream of people walking past me to detect if any have potential. It also seems like a good way to earn a positive reputation, and in the long run, having more capes seems like it should increase the odds of coming across a combination that can harm Scion. Interlude 13 gives a 1 in 8000 ratio for urban areas, so assuming I work 12-hour days, 6 days a week, and take 30 seconds to diagnose, I should find 1 potential parahuman every week, on average.

This would probably have to be affiliated with the PRT, so they can immediately offer their pitch to the prospective parahumans. Depending on the range and visibility of the power, it would be nice to be able to hide myself, so my clients can't see if anyone is doing the diagnostic.

Secondly, I can also offer a significantly more expensive power rental service, on the condition that the PRT is informed of the person and their chosen power (to avoid clients with villainous intent). I imagine rich people would be willing to pay a significant amount for up to 3x7 points worth of powers.

Replication: 10 points, but this allows my effectiveness to grow with time. Assuming each clone has its own set of limits for Kingmaker, I can eventually impart vast numbers of powers.

Followers:

Iscariot: To start with, having an insider in the PRT will be a great boon in getting my diagnostics and rental business approved, as well as giving me advance warning of any inbound threats. However, it also allows me to massively accelerate my diagnosis services. Each day, I'll ask my clients to assemble in separate batches, each of which will be at the upper limit of how many people I can diagnose in a day. I visit a different one in each of Iscariot's timelines, and pass on the list of potentials to her, so that even the ones I don't visit still get a diagnosis. This is the key feature of the build - depending on the logistics, there should be a very high upper limit on the number of people I can diagnose in a day, and my parahuman diagnostic rate should increase by at least an order of magnitude once this system gets established.

Taylor Herbert: I wanted to avoid taking her, but it just works far too well. Besides, I'm quite happy being a sidekick. I'm no tactician, and I'd be awful in a fight. However, Taylor plus Iscariot's simulations seems like a pretty powerful combination, and it opens up the best gift option.

Shard:

The outsider: 2 points, but that seems like a small price to avoid subconscious influence, start with a higher level and higher ceiling, and lack the limitations of the thinker.

Perks: Buying time gives me another 3 months of cape identification, and lets me give Taylor a head start on her development too. Carefree lets me ignore most of the setting and focus on replicating, earning a fortune discovering new parahumans and renting powers, and training. These cost 3 points in total.

Flaws: Identity Revealed, Kidnapping, and We Know all seem certain to come up for this concept, so they make sense to take. Wanted (ABB, E88, and the Merchants) can largely be mitigated by simply relocating elsewhere, I'll be travelling a lot anyway. Lastly, psychic nosebleed shouldn't cause me too much of a problem, as my abilities are largely passive, and I won't be the one doing the fighting when I push my powers to their limits. This gives me the additional 15 points to spend that I need.

Gifts: The Key. I'm assuming this doesn't include followers. Taylor's life is going to be even more miserable, with flaws of Identity revealed, Kidnapping, Bad reputation, Wanted (ABB, E88, and the Merchants), and Trouble magnet, for 16 points. Eh, she can probably handle it. In exchange, she gets Kingmaker, Replication, the outsider shard, and Manson Effect Bypass. One Taylor is powerful enough, but a growing number, able to impart 3x7 points of powers to themselves thanks to the bypass, each of which would also have no Manson effect either? That seems a little more powerful than the original.

To wrap up, I start on the day of Taylor's locker incident. Each week, I and Taylor will both replicate ourselves. The clones are sent out across the planet to identify latent parahumans at a rate of approximately 1 per week per clone, multiplied by 10 to account for Iscariot's simulations. Taylor prime will focus on training, with plenty of opportunities for life-or-death struggles thanks to her flaws. By the end of the 130-week period between Taylor's trigger event and the canon apocalypse, we should have identified about ((130 x 131)/2) x 2 x 10 = 170000 latent parahumans. Additionally, I'll have up to 130 x 3 x 7 x 5 = 13650 points of powers imparted to the 130 x 5 = 650 most skilled unpowered people I can find. There will be 130 copies of Taylor, each of which will have a flexible array of 3 powers of up to 7 points each, all of which can bypass the Manson effect.

*** Here's my second take, Inherit the Stars:

Path: Hero

Powers:

Quality assurance: 3 points, render an item unbreakable for a few hours

Power fluctuation: 5 points, modify nearby powers by 50-250%

Power hub: 3 points, benefit from nearby powers

Followers:

Satellite: A space tinker is awesome

Watchmaker: Reversing time for objects in an area sounds pretty useful for rocketry. Depending on how it works, this could either allow rockets that leave the area to be duplicated, or it could make repairing items much faster to allow rapid prototyping

Marduk: No gravity means rocketry becomes a lot more efficient

Outsider shard: 2 points, same reasoning as before

Perks:

Allies (Vista): 2 points, use spatial manipulation to get rockets to orbit even more efficiently

Flaws:

Identity revealed, Bad reputation, We know: 5 additional points

Gift:

The coin: Quality assurance 3, Warrior shard, Godslayer 5, Manton effect bypass 4, Blind spot 3, Identity revealed -1, Bad reputation -2, We know -2

How it works:

Use quality assurance to make Satellite's rockets unbreakable and so capable of being constructed far more efficiently. Use power fluctuation to boost the powers of Satellite, Marduk, Watchmaker, and Vista by 250%, and use power hub to assist with each of their powers. Use Marduk and Vista to get the biggest kinetic kill satellites into space as possible.

Once Earth's orbit is littered with these weapon platforms, toss the coin. Go to space with Satellite, use quality assurance on myself to become invulnerable. Use quality assurance on the kinetic kill projectiles to make them unbreakable and able to bypass immunity. Take advantage of the blind spot to surprise Scion with these projectiles.

Only Quality assurance and Godslayer are obligatory, the rest make sense to get everything set up. The vanilla Earth utility of vastly cheapened space travel should be obvious.

*** Other fun tricks:

Unlimited shard works + adaptation + paramount + Manson bypass: cycle through every power of 7 points or less, use them on yourself once each, then use them constantly, in order to become immune to all of them and have every one available at once

Experience exchange can be used to transfer Alecto's abilities to a more competent parahuman

Abilities like remote teleportation and ace that depend on your size might become a lot more powerful with final form

Do you even lift is based on the mass you are carrying, not its weight. Have Marduk touch the biggest container ship you can find in the bay, "carry" it, and benefit from being 2^{ship's mass in tons} times tougher.

Counter + glimpse + farseer gives you a good chance at detecting and reflecting almost any power, only subtle ones or mundane attacks should get through.

Instant acceleration + mountain allows you to always resume mountain's benefits as soon as the force on you is removed

Hindsight is a budget Path to Victory, as long as you can precommit to actions, see the consequences, then change your mind. It might need Protocols to work properly, though

Temporal leap + temporal bubble lets you leap back 5 minutes, activate the bubble, wait 10 subjective minutes inside the bubble that last only 1 minute outside, and repeat, in order to travel back in time an unlimited distance at a rate of -4 objective minutes per +15 subjective minutes. Might want immunity to aging, depending on how far you want to go. If you can take carried objects, you can duplicate single-use tinker items - pick up the item, leap back 5 minutes, pick up the item from 5 minutes ago, wait in the bubble for 10 subjective minutes, leap back again, and double the item once for every ~6 minutes you have access to it

Temperature immunity + temperature immunity + power fluctuation + Manson bypass allows you to modify temperatures by 125 degrees with no direct damage to yourself.

**** u/Tsegen:
#+begin_quote

Ooh, a real fan of this one. It's probably the cheapest heavy-hitter here too. Not sure what it means by "you will be completely unaffected by it" though? That might be a bit of a nerf, if it means that you go back to what you were doing at the time you jumped back to.

Maybe it just means that you remain safe (if you rewind past a fire you don't burn), I dunno.

*** This is my last one, I promise!

Worm: Pacifist Run

Path doesn't matter, followers don't matter. The Outsider shard fits thematically. Identity, kidnapping, wanted by everyone, and we know give the points needed and are soon rendered irrelevant by the powers. Take the book.

Take temporal leap and temporal bubble to go back in time 5 minutes, wait 1 minute in the bubble to recharge, and repeat. Go back in time to before Kevin Norton can have his chat with Scion. Wait for Scion to appear, and persuade him that the best way to get over Eden would be to go explore the universe outside the light cone of Earth. After the heat death of the universe, he can try something else.

*** I can't believe I missed this loophole: Pick "Candle" as a Gift and "Mirror World" as an Extra, and also whatever else you want.

Scion is dead due to the AU, so you can light the candle and return to the real world (with all your powers) on day one.

How would you benefit from this?

**** It would only be that temperature for a single Planck-moment, as energy migration from everything else began vibrating the atoms in the object.

That said, this is a source of infinite negentropy, given that you can use the power on an object of arbitrary size. Use it on, say, an asteroid in Earth orbit, and you could set up some kind of sterling engine to produce free energy. Even if this just moves energy elsewhere instead of removing it from the universe, you have essentially become a Maxwell's Demon and can, therefore, still produce negentropy.

***** This is why all powers need to contain a caveat that they consume energy to use in an amount greater than or equal to the minimum amount of work they represent. This power should consume energy proportional to the size and amount of heat exchanged, telekinesis should consume energy proportional to the force output, telepathy and future predictions should require energy for the information, teleportation should require energy for kinetic and potential energy differences, etc...

Any power used by a person could draw energy from their metabolism, which provides both economic and practical limitations to how much they can use the power. Any power with a technological explanation could just use electricity.

Not only do these modifications make powers strain the laws of physics less and thus require less suspension of disbelief, but they make munchkinry threads more interesting than "Here's a power which accomplishes some task with no cost" -> "Here's free energy"
