**** By my count, 297 chapters. None of them are particularly short, and as it goes on they get noticeably longer than in the opening arcs.

I can't remember the wordcount offhand, but I remember it being on the scale of approximately 1 to 1.5 million.

It's pretty long. I'm not a slow reader; I would also probably expect a re-read of HPMoR to take me on the order of a week, but not Worm.

** You might like Greg Egan's fiction if you're okay with lots of science-wanking (I like it myself, but I calls 'em like I sees 'em). Incandescence probably being the most munchkiney.

You've read Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson, right? His other stuff is also excellent.

The Discworld books by Terry Pratchett. I predict you'd enjoy starting with one or two of the following: Going Postal, Jingo, the Wee Free Men, Thief of Time. You can worry about going back and reading the longer storylines once hooked :P

*** I honestly hated worm. I read the first three chapters, and it really put me off from reading anything beyond. It felt like it was the universe itself that was holding the idiot ball. Most of the villains are villians because they're evil, and little else (rather counter to the claim that it's rational at all), and the main character's personality is completely inconsistent and all over the place. She does these enormously stupid things, but the universe itself caters to her, preventing any real harm. Plus, she (and several other characters) do some of the most immoral things without thinking twice. If I was in her situation, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night over the guilt.

And the part about real harm made me laugh out so loud I almost woke up the people around me.

**** It obviously wasn't rationalist, and it wasn't even terribly rational. It was fairly munckinly, although the protagonist was the only one who was allowed to munchkin her powers. Doormaker alone should have been able to be hugely more powerful than he was. Don't even get me started on the tinkers, or on Dragon. And, as soobtoob says, there was no reason for most of the villains to be evil -- they could have just [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck][marketed their powers legally]], made WAY more money than crime at lower risk, and called it a day.

All that aside, I enjoyed the beginning quite a bit. At some point (/when/ is arguable) it ramped the power level of the villains too high and just became bloody annoying. Fights against demigods are only interesting for so long, at least when the demigods are onstage. IMO you can get away with more when they are the (Wo)man Behind The Curtain, but these were straight up brawls.

****** Yeah, I knew those things but was trying to keep it simple and avoid spoilers.

I knew that about Doormaker but the people he worked for could still have used his powers to make a mint, control huge amounts of political and economic power, eliminated transportation costs for anyone they wanted something from...instead they used him to visit their vacation homes, basically. (They had wealth and power, true, but that seemed to derive from their business, not from use of Doormaker et al.)

And yes, the "whole driver for conflict" thing, but that's a complete f'ing copout. Really? If that's the only way the story you want to write can be justified, you need to back up and try something else, because that is a literary cheat of the highest order. Basically that's saying "all conflict in the story, and the fact that literally everyone except the protagonist is either using their powers non-optimally or outright carrying the idiot ball is because plot."

I also include the Endbringers in the "demigod" category. And no, that's not a spoiler. They get mentioned as "thing that periodically destroys cities" within a chapter or two, and it is instantly obvious that there is, at some point, going to be a fight with them.

I had that problem too. Worm was pretty obviously trying to do its deconstruction/reconstruction of the superhero genre, but I think that particular plot point was, if not poorly thought out, then at least not to my tastes. If the promise is that you're going to explain how the world ends up looking like it does in the comics (which I thought was the promise of the work), then what was done was, as you said, a cheat.

I guess I don't see what would have been so bad about having the world actually change in response to people having superpowers. If you've got a guy with lightning powers, you need a really good reason for him to be out fighting crime instead of just working safely in a power plant.
