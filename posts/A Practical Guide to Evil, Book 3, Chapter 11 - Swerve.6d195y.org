** Boy, there are a lot of layers to that discussion. So the Prince of Nightfall is trying to escape his role (seems like the fae don't capitalize the word) and is using Cat to do it, because if there's one thing Cat can be relied on to do it's spit in the eyes of destiny. Subverting the script of the ball will presumably result in ~something~ unusual happening, but I don't really understand what.

** Cat is absolutely gorgeous. She's definitely going to catch Archer for her crew.
