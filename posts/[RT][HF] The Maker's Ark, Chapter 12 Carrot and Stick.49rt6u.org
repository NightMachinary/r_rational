** Sam and DASI walk the tightrope--how fast can you change things, even for the better, without a disastrous response?

Here's a bit of non-spoilery puzzle: DASI had to tell Black Swan about the board meeting discussion. Why didn't Black Swan already know? She has both ability and motive to monitor it herself.

I'll post the answer in a couple of days, to give time for speculation.
