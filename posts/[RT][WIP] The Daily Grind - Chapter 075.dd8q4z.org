*** I mostly just took a break to try to be less stressed about writing all the time.

Turns out I can be stressed all the time about anything, anyway. So, may as well get some words down.

**** Is there any chance of Draw of the Unkown continuing? It's one of my favourites out of all Royal Road.

**** Sounds like me for sure. Eventually, we realize it's our thoughts stressing us out, not the things themselves. Which doesn't help much since it's hardwired :p The best way to hack that hardwiring is meditation via this seculr book [[/r/TheMindIlluminated/]].

That book is a bit of a favourite on lesswrong, starslatecodex, and here but other people probably have other methods like stoicism or lifestyle changes.

Ignore this advice if it will result in you getting less words down please. I'm selfish, and I want more daily grind :p Who ever heard of a happy fiction writer?
