** Beginning to close in on the doorway to what my new book calls 'Act III'. Yes, I've bought a book on plot and structure. I'll mention the name of the book, and the author, but no linkies. It's on Amazon.

'Write Great Fiction - Plot and Structure' James Scott Bell

I highly suggest it. He avoids using strange literary terms, and uses plenty of examples of solid writing.

He also gives a name to two classes of fiction that I now recognize that I have been struggling to differentiate.

Commercial fiction vs. literary fiction. Just understanding those two terms helped me understand what I was doing, a whole lot more.

*** Good book.

One thing I noticed: your tense tends to whiffle about.

#+begin_quote
  I only wanted it on the west side of the road was because I was planning to own the land on the west side of the road.

  Having a cistern close to the road could have allowed me to establish a little roadside market where carriages and wagons could water their animals, and people could buy seeds, produce, eggs, or perhaps even swine culls.

  Somehow, I managed to put them in my own pouch and not throw them back at her before I turned away and stalked back into camp.

**** Thanks!

The first sentence had an extra 'was' and was a bit repetitive with the word 'west' so I adjusted the wording.

I also poked around in the sentences around the other two sentences above, and found one questionable verb which was changed. It's been over 25 years since my last English class - did I find the problems?

***** Sorry, was a bit busy yesterday. Don't worry too much about the grammar. I'm just going to highlight some things that pop up and some light googling should sort you out. You only need to brush up on three tenses and one mood for your story.

First sentence requires *past progressive tense* use. Use this if the action directly ocurs. I was planning the meeting in her office when Brian entered. (The planning is occurring when the second action takes place). Here the planning action occurred in the past and led to the suggestion. That's *past perfect tense* (or possibly *past perfect progressive tense* )

#+begin_quote
  I suggested (placing the pit) on the western edge of the road only because I had planned to scoop up the land on that side.
#+end_quote

Second sentence highlight your second common tense problem, counterfactuals, and requires you to use *subjunctive mood*.

#+begin_quote
  Had there been a cistern close to the road I would have established a little roadside market where wagons could have watered their animals and people could have bought seeds, produce, eggs or swine culls.
#+end_quote

The third sentence requires you to use past perfect tense to improve your timeline's order. Also consider switching away from your use of 'turning away and stalking back to camp'as a *Verbal* . That can confuse readers who mistake if for present progressive tense and believe he's still stalking back to camp.

#+begin_quote
  My preference: Somehow I had managed to not throw them back at her but had placed them in my own pouch before I had turned and stalked back to camp.

  Also correct: Somehow I had managed to not throw them back at her bu had placed them im my own pouch before turning and stalking back to camp.

One, last note. Try a book by Virginia Tufte: Artful Sentences. She's probably the best person to read to improve your writing style. I think it'd be a good match.

****** Ooh, I haven't even heard those tenses in years :) I generally write it how I would say it, which appears to be failing me to some degree here. I'll take a look at the book you mention.

******* Don't worry about it. Grammar mistakes tend to be more noticeable when you read in editing/critiquing mode as oppozed to simply enjoying the story, reading in your normal manner. They also tend to vary from context to context, formal grammar is probably less suitable for two 12 year olds cracking jokes than it would be in an office scene. Playing it by ear, as you are doing, is generally okay.

Still, 'proper' grammar forms the bedrock of the everyday material we read in the news, in books and most formal communications. It'll be what your readers are most comfortable with across regions and fields with different language variants so brushing up and ensuring a consistent and familiar grammatic style helps you deliver your story better.

Just don't go worrying about every little old rule.

******** I agree. Plot, structure, and dialog are my biggest concerns right now. Grammar is on the horizon, but I know my writing is coherent enough that grammar isn't a major distraction to most readers. That's not going to stop me from poking at that book you suggested, but it's not at the top of my list.

Right now I'm writing a fanfic to explore what I learned from a book about plot and structure, and reading a book about how to write clear, hard-hitting dialog, which I also plan to begin implementing.
