** I binged this story over the weekend and really liked it.

I do have to qualify that while the setting seemed fairly consistent, the character's motivations and actions were somewhat all over the place, and impossible plot-relevant things happened a lot. (I'm posting this since OP [[/u/madwhitesnake]] is the author, and I mean to offer constructive criticism, please let me know if it sounds otherwise)

Some examples:

- As this this chapter shows and stated earlier, Clementine is someone with experience in old school military, which is all "check your blind spots" and "confirm your kills". If my whole platoon was killed by some practitioner in my first encounter with magic, I wouldn't keep Pith-people as servants without nudging them to catalog exactly what wildcards they have in play. Sounds excessive, except the story emphasizes that Magic fighting is all widcards.

- A little earlier in the series, Anabelle learns to change people's Pith sense, at a time in her life where she has nobody to practice/test it on, and no clear reason to focus on this instead of anything else(say, sense of touch). She also regularly illusions around obstacles, into other people's fields of view, for sounds she might not hear herself, for an obscene amount of graphic detail, and for sights she cannot directly see. Partitioned down, you can see how that ability would be so much more broken if it wasn't just used to fool people and hide. Flashbangs, screeching noises, Sense of balance, etc etc.

- It's shown that practitioners can totally swap bodies with normies. Yet nobody is offering to swap old Gandhis into death row prisoners for free, or for cash. Annabelle essentially spends the whole series working on getting a body, when she could totes keep a backup from one of the droolers off the ship incident, ask her "I'm literally killing myself now" friend for a friendly body donation, caught murderers off the street, or asked her Praxis friend to research "how to craft wooden dolls we can occupy" ( these last things wouldn't have worked, but in-world, she should have been wrestling with trying for them :-( ).

*** Hi! Constructive feedback is always welcome! I can't always respond, but I do generally read it.

I can address some of these without spoilers. As always, it's up to y'all whether they're satisfactory. The answers may get clearer in later chapters.

1. Clementine is *really* old-school military, from the era before projection was known to the public. She barely viewed Ana as a person, much less a threat.

2. Ana is practicing her Vocation off-screen. While she can blind people and create noises, she can't create the sort of lasting pain and stunning effect of a flashbang.

3. Executed prisoners often get their bodies confiscated by the state. There were logistical reasons Ana couldn't take Kaplen's body, and she has a lot of negative feelings about taking other people's bodies. Creating fabricated bodies and mind-spheres are projection techniques, and as such are blocked from Praxis vocations by Rashi's Third Law.

Thanks for reading!

**** Correct me if I'm wrong about this, but in addition to what you said, I get the impression that she doesn't blind people because it would immediately alert the target (and, maybe more importantly, their teammates!) to the fact that there's a Whisper vocation projector influencing them, and most trained projectors seem to have ways to deal with that. So her goal is generally to use illusions in such a way that someone doesn't recognize that they're illusions.

**** I'm expecting a bunch of fighting in future chapters, and I know you've probably done a ton of research already, but my conclusions were based off stuff like this from "old school military": [[https://youtu.be/NgWdv081oqQ]]

As an aside, if there are explanations for things that an outside observer would want happening but can't, it would be useful to have the characters deliberate them, even in their own flawed ways. Even if something is impossible, we still spend our mind pining for it, and the more desperate people are, the more they would lend themselves to those flights. I know it might make the pacing different from what you might like, but it really helps sell that these are characters fumbling their way through an unforgiving universe as best they can. The practical guide, for example, is a great reference to look into.

Ultimately, I love the style that's uniquely yours, and I hope my suggestion can help shape the story to bring out more of that uniqueness :)

** Not relevant to this chapter, but I found the description of the empty book to be a lot like how I got over my own stuttering
