** It looks like there's a dearth of activity on the past few Friday updates, but Tuesday updates are more lively. Might be weird noise, but if Friday's are really inconvenient for someone then let me know.

(I'd also like to confirm that the past couple of updates, including this one, have been easy to make sense of, since it was recently mentioned that this was an issue.)

(Also: Everyone still enjoying the ride? We're not really at the point where the roller coaster is falling down yet, but I'm trying to make sure that there's a sense of acceleration and "things happening" all the same.)

*** Definitely easy to understand what's been going on.

Also loved the revelations in the last couple of chapters, particularly the full names of the mistery magic characters. (They do give a sense of things being set into actual motion after a period of setup)

** Hey [[/u/callmebrotherg]], just wanted to say I'm a fan of the story, but I stopped reading because I was having trouble keeping track of all the characters across updates. This isn't a criticism, I just am waiting until I can read it in a bigger chunk. Keep up the good work, and don't let low viewership stats slow you down.

*** Thanks for letting me know. I can definitely understand how the large number of characters can be problematic.

HSTW is an experiment meant to push me out of my comfort zone but, in hindsight, it might have been better to run an experiment that isn't going to last so long. >:]

(Except, that was /also/ part of the comfort zone thing. My thinking was, if I push myself to write something /this/ big, with /this/ many characters, and so on and so forth, then everything that I write thereafter will feel less daunting.)

While you wait for that, though, you might be interested in knowing that I also write worldbuilding resources and other nifty things. You can check out one of the books that I've written [[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/200950/Strange-Nations-A-Worldbuilding-Resource][here]], where you can pick it up for free.

(If you like it and want more of that sort of thing, then [[https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks][check out my patreon page]] and see if any of the rewards intrigue you. I wouldn't mention it out of the blue, ordinarily, but since you said that you aren't checking the updates regularly, you might have missed it when I made the announcement last month.)

Thanks again for reading!
