The problem is that we don't know enough about the magic to munchkin it, and the characters don't really behave irrationally enough that they need correction (most of the problems crop up from character traits and differing values rather than strict "you didn't think that through").

****** It's overly mysterious and purposefully frustrating in order to weed out unsuitable candidates. A lot of what they do is classic cult behavior; wear the candidate down with drudge work, entice them with mystery, break down their ties to the outside world, scrub away their individuality ("Who are you?" "No one"), etc. Part of this is to build up a dependency on the cult, part of it is to make the candidate feel like there are sunk costs, and part of it is to weed out people who aren't suitable. The only thing that marks the Faceless Men as different from a real-world cult is that they have an actual mystery at their core, rather than a faked mystery. This gives them even more of a reason to be mysterious and frustrating; they want to ensure that anyone they introduce to their secrets won't reveal them to the outside world, which would lose them one of their major institutional advantages.

For that reason, I don't think you can call it a lack of rationality, because rationality doesn't mean that you're changing your core values.

Some of the others are more arguable. I think I would defend religious fanaticism when there are actual, verifiable results that come from that religion. There's no excuse for [[#s][]] though.

His family /was/ more important to him than honor (and I would argue that this is one of the chief reasons to believe [[#s][]]), but honor was also something that he valued. I don't think trying to do things as honorably as possible while protecting his family was that irrational.

As a comparison, it's like Batman trying to fight crime while also refusing to use guns or kill people. Those are both values that he holds, and there are some good stories that come from throwing those values into conflict.

Honour means doing what you say you will do and following a strict code of conduct in certain situations. In doing so you become predicable but also gain power because potential followers know you will not betray them if it becomes inconvenient, thus giving you access to greater numbers and quality of fighters (among other benefits). It doesn't really matter much if you're doing it because of earthly or heavenly rewards.

Good is different of course.

**** I'm going to talk about Eddard here and this is going to spoil things from the latest season and book. You have been warned.

I hate it when people talk about Eddard as being "honourable to a fault" or having "honour before reason" because it's just not true. As soon as Eddard gets imprisoned the north rises up in rebellion and crowns Robb king of the north because they would do anything for Eddard and his house. They would go into war against the seven kingdoms if they had to because of their loyalty to the Starks.

While it isn't shown in the series, the books show how the north rebells against the Boltons in hatred because Roose Bolton helped kill Robb. The mountain clans of the north all join up with Stannis to march on Winterfell, the Manderlys join up with the Boltons by necessity but spend their entire time there insulting them and assassinating the Frey retinue present.

Eddard is an honourable man and acts honourably which has given him the most loyal and powerful kingdom out of the seven. He rules a land as large as the other six combined and everyone (with few exceptions) loves him and his house and know he can always be trusted. The north remembers and Eddard and his children will be followed to the ends of the earth.

Yes, "Honour" is a useful method for earning trust outside family units and building the reciprocal relationships on which feudalism is built on. But even a "Good Thing" can be a "Bad Thing" if done to excess.

Ned was honourable and that's why people loved him.

But he was /too/ honourable and that's why they cheered as they took off his head.

****** Well the people who cheered weren't northeners. The only northener in the crowd almost broke his vows to get Eddard's daughter to safety.

Throughout the series everyone else plays dirty and thus they keep winning but by the end of AdwD the Starks are basically the only house (neutral Martell aren't really relevant) that are still in a position of power. The Starks never compromise and err on the side of honour and therefore they are one of the most powerful houses despite not even having a member of their family not in hiding.

You could balance it out perfectly in theory but in reality that's almost impossible and making compromises would lead to more compromises if things got worse. The Starks stick to what they think is right and that's why they are left while the Lannisters, Baratheons, Tyrell's and all the others have fallen so much further as soon as they lose steam. The north remains as a base no matter what because the Starks are honourable no matter what.

Gods are real, but we don't know the details. Lots of people have magical powers, even if they're not throwing literal fireballs around. Much. Noble bloodlines have literal power that commoners don't. And that's just the passive stuff.

Instant healing from death or near-death exists, which depending on how it works is a game changer. Precognition exists, which is a game changer. Remote access sensory processes exist, which is a game changer. Precursor civilizations existed, but they were...destroyed by bio-weapons? And they tamed/made dragons? And had advanced or magical materials science? It isn't clear.

Without clear rules the author understands, especially about magic and the supernatural, a story can't be very rational. On the other hand, you could just make it a "real world" version of everything.

Magic doesn't exist. Magical priest-assassins are simply very good at misdirection and disguise. Maesters are simply using preserved sciences from the precursors. Dragons don't breathe fire, are no larger than Golden Eagles, and are even more fragile on the ground. Fire only works like it should, but when you start burning people they fall in line as one would expect. No back from the dead healing, just silk undershirts, ceramic inserts, blood squibs, and artificial adrenaline infusions. Yes bioweapons, no divine right of kings other than as a social construct. Precognition is what it looks like, seizures. Distance viewing is just cold-reading plus strategy knowledge and map reading.
