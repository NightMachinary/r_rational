Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

** Anyone read The Happiness Advantage by Shawn Achor ?

​

It's really good. Basically his research shows that being in a good / positive mood makes you smarter, more effective, efficient and stress resistant. Quite interesting, his arguments and finding showing that people who close themselves off when they are stressed perform worse and tend to fail in very competitive environments are very enlightening.

I'm one of those people that when things get rough I disconnect from everybody and figure it out by myself. Being told that's a sub optimal strategy really surprised me seeing how common it is among high performers. But his research proves this is the case.

​

Sadly the filler chapters are things I already knew from other books, but yeah the introduction + chapter 1 and 2 are well worth reading.

This book was more than worth it, positive ROI for sure.
