** A funny thing is, one of the running themes in Twig is the sort of background fear that everyone has about how biotechnology is starting to grow beyond any single person and becoming its own thing, with primordial life that can self-tile the entire world if not contained, and regular humans quickly becoming obsolete.

I've never seen a work hit those notes quite like Twig does.

** Woooow, that last arc was massive. Like five different major events happened all at once, each of which could have been an arc unto itself. I'm so excited for this one; one of the great secrets of the world has been revealed, but more importantly, the OTP is back!
