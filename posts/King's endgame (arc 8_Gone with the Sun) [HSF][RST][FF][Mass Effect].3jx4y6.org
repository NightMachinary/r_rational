** Mass Effect portrayed the way Commander Shepard dealt with the Reapers he met. This latest (and last) post links to Arc 8 of that story, dealing with what the remaining 20,000 Reapers did on their holiday.

To recapitulate the earlier posts' description: The next ME apparently involves an N7 operating in Andromeda.

Mass Effect 3 came out some time back, following which I wrote a 'rationalist' novel exploring the aftermath - posted for the canonical year and a day. It explored consequences of ME3's 'red flash' from the point of view of certain characters.

As it happens, the closing lines of the last arc had survivors heading for Andromeda. So imagine my shock when the recent E3 2015 trailer, "Mass Effect: Andromeda" was issued, also showing an N7 in Andromeda, obviously not Shepard but still. Hence the excerpting of the final scene as a prologue to arc 1.

The first (arc 1) was "Eternity", recapitulating the events of the Red Flash from other points of view. The opening chapter of the story proper is arc 2, "Queen's Gambit", followed in order by: arc 3 "Grave to cradle", arc 4 "Road to Nowhere", arc 5 "Somewhere over the Rainbow", arc 6 "Keeping faith", arc 7 "Way of Life", and now; arc 8 "King's endgame"
