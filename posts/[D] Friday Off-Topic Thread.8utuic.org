Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I picked up Opus Magnum of the Steam summer sale. It's been a while since I've played a Zachtronics game, and I had mostly forgotten that feeling of "here are mechanics, here's what you need to produce, if you're so smart, then you figure it out". Starting up each level gives me a feeling of disbelief, because the problem always seems so big, but it's really just a matter of breaking the system down into component parts, solving each part one by one, than getting it to run together. It really scratches the same itch that programming used to scratch for me, only more so.

I also really appreciate all the work that went into the story and aesthetics of Opus Magnum, which really didn't need to be there given that it's a puzzle game. Like in Shenzen I/O, I think it adds an extra level of investment and progression.

Factorio was much the same sort of game for me, but I burnt myself out on it after finishing it, then finishing it with Bob's Mods, then doing Bob's + Angel's.

I've played a couple "programming games", they usually feel too much like work for me to have fun. As soon as the work I need to do to beat a level gets past being trivial, I start feeling I might as well do some actual programming and get something useful out of it. I do like the ones with short levels that are far more about the puzzle aspect though, as opposed to having to sort 9000 different items which ends up being mostly busywork.

**** That was why I never finished TIS-100; it was very pure in its programming. For the others, it's mostly about getting the thrill of programming without any of the garbage that goes along with actual programming. I don't have to deal with incompatible libraries, functions that don't work like they're documented to, hidden assumptions of either the language or the code I'm working with, etc.

I guess if I had to make a comparison, it would be "romance novel:romance::programming game:programming"?

*** I really liked how the gameplay didn't undermine the story.

The tutorial didn't fall into the "As you know, captain..." trap:

  "Herr Einstein! We're so grateful to have a genius of your level here.

  Now... I'm sure you remember 'addition', yes?

  Well let me remind you, just in case..."

The tutorial made sense, and characterised the protagonist effectively.

The main character is more focussed on the alchemy than the automation, so good or bad solutions are equally in character.

*** I have been playing Sundered myself this week after going months cold turkey without any gaming. It started when I saw a feed saying it had a new update and decided to give it a go - I found myself three days later hitting the end game content.

It has got to be one of the more satisfying metroidvanias I have played. I adore the lovecraftian aesthetic. Great skill progression too.

***** I haven't had the chance to play Hollow knight yet.. but I'd say compared to Ori it was definitely more flexible in terms of gameplay - once you get around to powering up your character through exploration. I am so in love with my new teleporting ability. Instead of puzzles the focus is more on cutting your way through relentless mobs. It keeps you on edge - but it was really satisfying getting to the powerups and watching your gameplay change.

Both are artworks with beautiful design. Sundered is handrawn with 3 different regions - an abandoned military base sprawling with automatic defenses, a lovecraftian dimension with hordes of tentacled horrors - and a vertical level the Citadal. The monster designs were also really refreshing on the later levels.

A good game with focus on platforming and puzzles would be Inside. It is by the creators of Limbo. I.. love everything about it. The breathtaking dystopian world building, every single scene animated with loving care. I was blown away by the sheer amount of attention to even simple things like jumping and running.  It drew me into the world as I rooted for this young boy facing insurmountable odds -  as he jumps out of a ledge gasping, on the run by security dogs. Stalked by discarded test subjects as he swims through submerged office buildings.. 

And the ending - it  completely blew me away. I did not see that coming at all. I did ended up wishing it that it didn't finish so soon. Compared to difficulty, was much easier than limbo while the puzzles being still creative. It did not have the same  frustrating feel as Limbo, with its relentless death traps. Very smooth gameplay.

***** If you liked those two, you might also like Yoku's Island Express, which is a pinball metroidvania. My only issue with it was that it wasn't as long as I wanted it to be, and some of the 100% completion stuff was just stupidly hard and unfun.

I strongly disagree. The fancy graphics, story, and sound effects angered me significantly more than they amused me. In playing the game*, I was constantly wondering how much cheaper /and better-looking/ a no-frills version of the game (looking and sounding like /The Codex of Alchemical Engineering/) would have been. (+IIRC,+ Zachtronics even posted on +Facebook and/or+ [[https://twitter.com/zachtronics/status/979112047689396224][Twitter]] some [[https://i.imgur.com/EIJdJQz.gif][concept art]] that looked more like /Codex/, and I significantly preferred it to the final art.)

*Disclaimer: I haven't played it in several months and I haven't finished it.

*** I've had dreams (for /years/) about strange movie theaters, and strange bathrooms, and strange jumping that's kinda like flying but not.

Like, the theaters will have a few quarter-wide rows of normally oriented seats pointed at a strangely angled screen that's like a quarter of the size of a real screen, and then in the same room will be seats pointed like 45 degrees widdershins aimed at like a row of smaller screens all showing the same movie but the screens are like five feet in front of them and like 10 feet up in the air and beside the bigger screen, and then beside the normally oriented seats will be seats pointed backwards and it's always just a weird mess with randomly sized screens in random locations and little clusters of seats randomly scattered around, and half the time I have those dreams there's actual /stuff/ that /makes sense/ happening on the screens and I'll watch for a few minutes and then /that'll become the new dream/, like one second I'm watching a first-person perspective on a screen and then it morphs into that actually being my perspective, and half the time /that/ happens it's a strange map of Call of Duty Nazi Zombies. Sometimes the theaters are less weird, like one time it was a few normal-width rows but with another set of rows a dozen feet in front of them and facing them with screens behind each of the sets of seats, or maybe two normal sized screens directly beside each other but angled so they're somewhat facing each other and there'll be multiple levels of seats with some of them facing one screen and some of them facing the other.

The bathrooms always have weird layouts and there's usually like door in a weird place (like between two urinals or behind a secret wall) that leads into a huge bathroom/locker-room combo that has multiple levels connected by stairs, and just room after room, and it's always maze-like and the rooms eventually lose their bathroomishness and become like generic industrial rooms with lots of long 5-foot-high walls that aren't really connected to each other.

The jumping/flying ones are always the most vividly vivid, it'll be exactly like real life except there'll be situational context that requires me to jump, and I'll jump like 10 feet straight up, then like 30 feet straight up, then just keep jumping forwards at like 30 to 50 feet up and it feels super real.

Except for the jumping, it's always weird architecture with a ridiculous floor-plan. And it's always vivid, but never quite crosses over to lucid, and it happens at least three times a week.

I'm not sure why I told you all that, probably because I ought to have gone to sleep like 9 hours ago but I'm staying up the rest of the day to reset my sleep schedule.

**** Nah, it's cool. I know what it's like to ramble when you're sleep deprived.

I've been thinking a lot about writing a quest where the players are stuck with an unnaturally realistic dream of a maze. The maze is a city where the streets loop on themselves and there's no clear way to get around. It's going to be really fun writing it.

Here's the summary of the story:

/You walk down the sidewalk of an abandoned city. Implicitly you understand that time is running out, anxiety blooms in you chest as you look about frantically for what's coming. In an instant a white screen of light surrounds your vision. Sound disappears from the world except for a ringing in you ears. All sensations including touch vanish from your body, you feel as if you're floating in a void of light. When it finally ends, your vision slowly returns and with a burning sensation runs across your skin. The air is tinged a deep red, clouds running across the sky faster than you've ever seen. The city is melting, glass seeping into pools on the street as building deform and twist from the heat. Your skin too, is sloughing off in great chunks even as you scream your throat dry. The last thing you'll feel are your eyeballs dripping./

/Time is of the essence. You need to make use of what little time you have at the beginning of the dream to escape before it occurs. Car doors are rusted shut, bicycles are beyond repair, the roads go in circles and the layout is nonsensical. Through trial and error you might discover a method to escape beyond its boundaries. You have an unknown number worth of attempts before the nightmare becomes real, and there won't be any escape then./

I really wish I could take the credit for this masterfully written piece of purple prose, but it is a writing prompt posted somewhere months ago that inspired my maze-related ideas.

**** Interesting ,the watching something that becomes another dream thing also happens to me often , though usually the other way around , me noticing something that doesnt make sense (or that I decide in the dream that doesnt make sense for whatever reason ) and the dream changing to me complaining about it while watching a movie or something that was the previous dream (or just "waking up " into another dream ).

***** I tried doing a quest once (under pseudonym). It wasn't really to my liking, as I'd thought that it might not be, but part of that was that I was writing for an audience of like three people. I abandoned it pretty quickly, before those three people could get super invested in this thing I wasn't having too much fun with, and didn't have the time for. I generally consider it an artform not that suited to my particular tastes as both an author and a reader, mostly because I care more than average about narrative flow. Quests, even more than web serials, will sometimes just randomly introduce a character and then just never resolve it because the plot gets directed in another direction.

(The pros of a quest are basically that you get higher investment in the characters, because you're controlling their actions, and there's a more 'real' risk of failure which can heighten tension, especially if you're one of those people who wrongly believes that authors won't kill their characters.)

OH MY....I've read that book in middle school! It was from a shelf of 1970-1990s books which were all clearly published before I was born. It was a great story about the confusion and search for answers in a maze of stairs.

It turned out that the mysterious machine in the center of the house of stair was being used to train the kids in a Pavlovian way to automatically carry out certain physical actions and listen to the wielder of the red light. It was very creepy where the kids were learning a very specific dance which seemed to have no purpose. It turned out that they were the prototype group and learning the dance was just to demonstrate the complexity of what they could learn.

The novel ended on a sadistically hilarious plot twist where after the survivors were released, they were stuck repeating the same dance after seeing the red light of a traffic light!

** Just finished reading /Beautiful Fighting Girl/ by Saito Tamaki. It's an interesting (if somewhat unfocused, and with some Freudian/Lacanian psychoanalysis) book about 2000s otaku and the popular success of beautiful fighting girls in manga and anime. Saito sees the otaku's way of consuming media as an adaptive strategy in a hypermediated world, where they are ahead of the game.

He also states that their defining trait is the ability to achieve sexual release from a drawn image, and this is why real society must reject them, because they do not privilege reality over fiction. So there's that.
