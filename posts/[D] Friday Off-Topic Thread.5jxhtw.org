Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** So many of the stories we read or watch are about the battle of good vs evil. This has the unfortunate effect of leading people to pattern-match good and evil when it comes to real life politics. The results are dubious. Evil is easy enough to find thanks to the human capacity of demonizing enemies. Good, on the other hand, is more difficult. I would wager this leads people to embrace the factions that virtue signal the hardest, or otherwise have the strongest claim to moral purity.

I wish stories of *flawed good vs evil* were more common. An example might be Star Wars where the rebel alliance is led by an alcoholic general prone to the occasional sexual harassment; where rebel troops are former smugglers who occasionally revert back to criminal behavior; where the rebel alliance will occasionally blow up a civilian freighter by mistake and, though the rebel leadership always issues the requisite apologies, the problem seems to persist.

All the same, the protagonist of the story has few reservations fighting with the rebels because, goddamn it, the empire blows up planets to terrorize its subjects.

My hunch is that a higher frequency of flawed-good vs evil stories would have good repercussions for the sanity of our politics.

*** Okay, really here, this is the kind of thinking that leads to book bans and all sorts of other atrocious things. Which scenario do you think is more likely:

1) Authors and Politicians came up with the good vs evil narrative independently and on their own, and that books provided the majority of the inspiration.

2) Authors and Politicians get their assumptions from the same, obviously flawed source, which says anyone who isn't in your tribe is wrong. The source in this case being evolutionary psychology.

I don't think stories are responsible for the good vs evil narrative (in fact, the most popular stories make it very clear that the whole thing is morally ambiguous - Star Wars not included). More likely, the source of this bias is what authors and politicians and readers all share in common: human ancestry.

**** The choice between (1) and (2) is a false dichotomy. Everything influences everything else. We produce stories, which influence how we act, which influences the stories we produce, and so on; the cycle never ends. Evolutionary psychology may be an important factor but it is not determinative, as evidenced by the fact that the values embedded in popular stories have changed over time.

Sigh. Apparently, it isn't possible to comment on the negative effects of popular tropes without being accused of contributing to "book bans and other atrocious things."

***** Moral absolutism has been around for about as long as we have had stories. Values embedded in stories have changed over time, but the struggle against an absolute evil remains enduring. If it's a trope you see in the epic of Gilgamesh, I think it's reasonable to make the assumption that it's been around for a long time.

More recently was the study that made it to the front page, which showed that the brains of certain people start making unusual activity when presented with evidence contrary to political belief. I think that whatever hypothesis we go with, it's going to weigh more strongly on the genetic side than the learned side, simply because I've observed almost everyone react that way in real life.

I /am/ sorry if that seemed like an accusation of you wanting to ban books. I don't think you want to, but "stories cause x behavior" is something that I've seen time and time again, as reasons to keep books out of English classrooms, as reasons to ban books that people dislike. You aren't holding the gun, but rhetoric like that is almost always the ammunition.

There is an easy way to settle this, though - find a primitive tribe that relies entirely on oral tradition, strap somebody into an MRI, and then yell expletives at them. Compare the results with another indigenous tribesman that has read the /Harry Potter/ series.

** Sanity Falls is dead. It's been dead for most of the year. Here's how it was going to go, in broad strokes:

Dipper tries to use Gravity Falls' anomalies to uplift the world, but discovers that nothing paranormal can leave the city limits, putting a damper on his first attempts at munchkinry. Mabel generally accepts surprising results like this, while Dipper becomes increasingly emotionally frustrated by them. One particular adventure to destroy a pro-status-quo conspiracy, the Society Of The Black Swan, fails to remove the inability of weird things to leave Gravity Falls. Dipper's sanity is further strained by the revelation that time travel exists and the infinite quantity of beings who possess it refuse to assist him.

When the real Stan is inadvertently removed from his extratemporal battle with Bill Cipher, he states that "weirdness" is trapped in Gravity Falls by an indestructible magnet-like device, and that this is a good thing as it prevents otherwise-inevitable end-of-the-world scenarios. Dipper misinterprets this as insane Luddism, and Bill Cipher comes to him in his sleep and shows him a ritual to destroy the supposedly indestructible normalcy anchor. Dipper completes the ritual, even though it involves murdering Wendy; he weighs her life against the coming singularity and makes what he sees as an obvious utilitarian decision. The ritual turns Dipper into the literal prophesied "Black Swan", a living portal to the realm Gravity Falls' anomalies come from. Bill Cipher and his friends climb out of the Black Swan and commence Weirdmageddon, the "utility monster mash" wherein the streets are roamed by literal defect bots, trolleys fly everywhere, and people are spontaneously disassembled and reassembled by lightning all the time.

Mabel fixes it all by getting a favor from a time traveler to prevent Dipper from ever existing, retroactively making her an only child. A while later, though, she meets the real Dipper, Soos, and Wendy - as it turns out, the entire story up to this point is a lie, a perfectly realistic false history implanted in Mabel by Bill playing the part of the Cartesian Demon. Dipper isn't even really a colossal douchebag. The story ends here, with Mabel setting off to solve a problem in a real world she can't remember alongside a bunch of real people she only knows fake versions of.

** Every so often, I marvel at how much I lost the habit of engaging in toxic debates, and how awesome it is that I've found communities in which "try to understand other people's points instead of treating them like a political opponents" is something I can assume everyone is doing.

I can completely remember my five-years-ago self who was obnoxious to people with a different opinion, thought debates were about making other people look stupid and looking like you're right, and mostly participated in communities where that was the norm. And I'm really, really glad to have both moved past that, and found communities of people which encourage better discourse.

** So I didn't go full-on during RaNaNoWriMo, but I finally polished a little story of ~5000 words. It doesn't end well, and I think I could have taken it in a lot of other directions.

I didn't post it on the main page because I don't think it's super high-quality, but I'll link it here if anyone wants a ~10 minute diversion:

*** That was a fun read. It's a shame [[#s][]], it would have nicely tied off the arc.

I love this sort of low-magic setting, where being able to float a little off the ground is incredible one-of-a-kind magic. It encourages characters to use their powers in more unconventional and intelligent ways, and means munchkin-y techniques can solve problems without instantly conquering the universe.

** Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

Whoops, nearly forgot to post this. Funny how when I'm off work all pretenses of routine go out the window.

Work is slowly but surely coming to a fore on the design documents. I've divided the design up between what the engine should handle and what "mods" should handle, and now it's just a matter of getting all the ducks in a row. Once again, if you've been watching from afar and have ideas, speak now, or forever hold your peace!

I should hopefully have a decent set of documents all set up by the new year. At that point I'll then divide all of the various features into a roadmap, and then start at the top of the list and work down. We're on the brink, here.

Feel free to leave any comments or questions below. Also feel free to join us [[https://discord.gg/sM99CF3][on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server]] for brainstorming and discussion. It's a great group, really, and I would highly recommend hanging out, even if you're not in it for this project itself.

** Random thing I've been wondering that someone here likely knows the answer to.

If something universal in a setting exist that can signal faster than light, is the speed of causality whatever the speed of that thing is rather than light?

Of all things dragonball had me wondering this. People can sense ki over galactic to universal scale distances within seconds. It also allows people to travel massively faster than light.

On the other hand, it's in every living thing. The spirit realm seems to be pretty much made of the stuff as well.

Normally causality is thought to be broken when you travel ftl in fiction, but given there exists a constant in the setting that people can be taught to sense, that machines can be built to messure, I'm wondering if that just means causality is limited to whatever upper limit of information ki can signal data rather than light.

I could be completely off base, though.
