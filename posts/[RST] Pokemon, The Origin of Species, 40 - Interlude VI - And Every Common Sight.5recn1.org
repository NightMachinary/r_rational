** Hey everyone, welcome back! This chapter was written with the help of the Penny Dreadful soundtrack, particularly [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxs3wR1J8Xo][Street. Horse. Smell. Candle]], starting at the line, "We shall go together." I often wish I could add music cues to certain parts of the story, and think I might try to do it on my website, where I have more control of the formatting. I've been working on adding more content to my site anyway, particularly blog posts. Feel free to check them out, if you haven't already.

Thanks for reading, and the continued support of my patrons. As usual, all feedback welcome!

** Cannot wait for the Mewtwo plotline to enter the main picture.

Though I am still frustrated that Giovanni dropped the Mewtwo ball as hard as he has. He gave that whole "yo, we gonna end death together as bros, you with me?" speech and I was so hyped, he was like the best parts of Quirrel and Harry combined. And now Mewtwo despises him.

Mewtwo is ridiculously empathetic in this chapter, I'll give you that. But I fear what he's gonna do when he gets out of the box.

** Alright I have a theory*. Remember how Mewtwo was made from DNA taken from a human donor? What if it turns out that Red's dad was that donor? Then Red and Mewtwo would be kind of like siblings or something. Could lead to Mewtwo feeling a bit less lonely.

There is absolutely zero evidence for this, but there also isn't any real evidence against it. It balances out, so I estimate a 50% chance that this is true. Coincidentally, this is also my estimated probability for me winning the lottery.

*** I suspect that Dr. Fuji may be Mewtwo's "father." His kindly demeanor from the games lends itself towards a sort of "I always wanted a child of my own" sentimentality, and would explain his termination from the project, as Giovanni found him to be getting too attached.\\
Not that Fuji could only have had ethical qualms about the Mewtwo project if he was related to Mewtwo, just that it might be a path towards regret.

** It's chapters like this that have me chomping at the bit for Red to progress in his psychic training. Psychic powers seem to offer such a unique perspective, as befitting of a whole new sense, and I can't wait to see how Red's own views shift once he begins to be able to sense the minds of other humans and Pokemon.

Will he begin to detest battling, being capable of feeling the pain of battle alongside his Pokemon? Or will his ability to sense the apparently vast gap between the minds of men and the minds of beast only strengthen his belief in the humanity's right to dominion?

What does the mind of a legendary (e.g a Storm Bird) feel like? Are they 'too big' to affect by ordinary psychic means, massive mental behemoths capable of being felt from miles away? Or are all non-psychic legendaries dark, meaning they can't be tamed by purely mental means? Will psychic pokemon be nicer to him, given that to their senses he is more similar to them than other humans, or will they consider him an even greater threat?

For that matter, what are the ramifications of his abilities on his standing in normal human society? We've seen from Misty's interlude that psychics are treated, to some degree, as specalists (a psychic being required to finalize the trial of a Renegade) but are there any downsides? Any discrimination? Is Red even allowed within a square mile of a casino?

I've seen so many Pokemon fics that deal with telepathy just decide to make Pokemon just voiceless sentients, capable of purely coherent, language based thought. I've seen even more basically ignore telepathy to focus on telekinesis, or teleporting or stuff like that. But the way you write Mewtwo gives me hope that you are going to handle the topic so much better than that, and I can't wait to see what you do next :)

Keep up the good work!

Not quite: it's basically just an alternate universe from our own, where pokemon started showing up at some point in ancient history. It's more or less our "modern day," but history and technology are so different that the comparison loses any meaning, practically.

** Setting the stage for Mewtwo's escape! I like it. I don't think Giovanni is the kind of person to try and cripple a being created to destroy the stormbirds by forcing it to be dependent on the medication. There's far too many risks involved when creating Mewtwo had used up so many of his resources already.

Secondly, I forsee Giovanni being more comfortable with Mewtwo in the future and moving the tank to a higher location, nearer to the surface for him. If Mewtwo is ever to fight the songbirds then it needs to have its full power about itself.
