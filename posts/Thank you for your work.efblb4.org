Hello [[/r/rational][r/rational]],

I am quite new to this genre and thus I have read only HPMOR and Metropolitan man when it comes to rational fiction. And I can't seem to read anything else...

Like most humans on the planet, I don't agree with stupid "heroes". They are heroes and if they are stupid then they're worse than villains, I think. Or they should just hire a very intelligent advisor... Having powers means that you should have both the IQ and EQ in my opinion. Otherwise you'll be a monster or you'll be an idiot. Both isn't good.

I sincerely thank all the people trying so hard in writing rational fiction. Magical power is almost always bad in the hands of humans and a magical world with humans is definitely not a fairy tale. I believe that rational fiction really highlights that. So really thank you :)

I also have a request. Can you recommend me something which is mostly (or completely) written from the perspective of a rational protagonist. I now realize that once you've read that perspective, you'll always come back for more.


** There's a list of noteworthy rational works in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][wiki.]] My personal favorites are:

- Friendship is Optimal: Hanna, the CEO of Hofvarpnir Studios, just won the contract to write the official My Little Pony MMO. Hanna has built an A.I. Princess Celestia and given her one basic drive: to satisfy everybody's values through friendship and ponies. Princess Celestia /will/ satisfy your values through friendship and ponies, and it /will/ be completely consensual. (Copied from the description. It's extremely good even if you, like me, have no other interest or background in the MLP fandom.)
- Pokemon: The Origin of Species: A rational take on Pok√©mon Red/Blue, seen through the lens of three very different protagonists.
- Worth the Candle: Most of the time, LitRPG is about as un-rational as it gets. WtC, however, is a brilliant deconstruction of the genre that plays with and subverts most of its key tropes.
- Worm: Arguably the best web serial in existence, Worm isn't /technically/ rational, but features many of the same themes. It's a reconstruction of the superhero genre with some of the best worldbuilding and characterization I've seen in fiction, and I rarely miss out in a chance to recommend it. The sequel, Ward, is in progress. (Avoid [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]], though, as it tends to be very spoilery. The same goes for the subreddit of...)
- A Practical Guide to Evil: If you're familiar with TvTropes, you'll appreciate this one. In the guideverse, common tropes and patterns in fantasy, such as heroes being guaranteed to survive long falls off cliffs and villainous monologues signaling imminent failure and/or death, are intrinsic laws of the setting. Meaning they can be exploited by anyone enough savvy enough to recognize them...be they heroes or villains.

*** I personally stopped reading (and won't continue) reading A Practical Guide; not because of anything against it (in fact I think it's a really good story) but you can sort of learn the same lessons by actually reading the original stories where the tropes are from too. Plus to me it's kind of the same "journey" as WtC and I just prefer that one, so I read that instead.

Agreed on Worm. One thing I would like to see in the world is a faithful take on Worm as a movie or TV series, because I think making it that visceral would be beneficial to people to see just how bad a world that requires "superheroism" actually is.

Also, historically I effectively paid about $16,000 just to read it and learn a bit about how statistics was typically taught, which in hindsight is probably the best bargain I ever made (despite lack of academic achievement 2014 was a good year for me) and so I'm hoping that the author will make a significant amount more money from the work than they have.

**** I'll let others speak to whether it's good or not, but it's written to be accessible without knowledge of canon. Give it 2-3 chapters and the confusion of being dropped into the middle of things should be totally gone. All you miss by not having read canon is the occasional reference/easter egg.

#+end_quote

I don't agree with that sentiment at all, because I don't expect perfect decisions from protagonists.

In fact, I love idiot heroes. I love characters who are bumble-kings. Characters who stumble and fail their way to victory. Because characters who aren't perfect, who are flawed, who have limited information, who don't always get what they want, who make terrible choices, are /fascinating/.

Because they're /human/. Certainly moreso than characters who make correct decisions every time, all the time.

*** I think you're going too far on the opposite end.

People like competence, like rational thinking, like protagonists showing off intelligence as long as it is /realistic/. Realistic being defined as people making the best decisions they could (at least, better than what the average reader could think up in short time) given the limited amount of information at their disposal, in pursuit of their short and long term goals.

Rational protagonists are not emotionless robots nor perfect, they can very well have personal flaws, weaknesses and certain biases. They are merely those who make decisions that the reader can recognize as brilliant or ingenious occasionally, and arrive at their decisions in a way that can be easily followed along.

*** I agree that I had been a little extreme in that statement so sorry for that.

However, I feel that it's a very serious responsibility at being a hero. Most of the time, the whole world depends on them so no, they cannot be naive, they have to be clever and as perfect as possible.

Just imagine that you're having a brain surgery and your life depends on that surgeon, will you want him to be human and make mistakes? 1 life and surgeons have to make sure to not make mistakes. Heroes have to be responsible for millions of those.

Obviously stories are just that. Stories. And I often find myself enjoying something much less serious. So I'm definitely in your team about liking innocence and naivety in our protagonists :) I stand by my word though and that's why I deeply respect this genre for making people realize the consequences of having the fate of the world dangling on a few people.

**** Why would you expect a "hero" to be someone who is perfectly equipped for the task at hand? That's stupid. People don't do good works because they think they're a perfect fit for it. They do it because they /have to./ Because sitting by and doing nothing would be unthinkable.

By your logic, every heroic fantasy would be dead on arrival, because the villain would just run roughshod over everyone, while the goodies sat around with their thumbs up their asses, waiting for the perfect hero to show up and fix all their problems. Which will never happen, /because perfect heroes don't exist./

That's why I like flawed heroes. Because they're /real./ Because they're people who are determined to do good, despite their limitations. Because they're people who deal with the world in front of them. Because they're people who are scared shitless of failure, but try anyway.

Of course I'd want a brain surgeon to be a perfect, error-less robot. But they're not. They're human beings. They are going to make mistakes. Surgery is hard, and people die in hospitals all the time, even with surgeons and doctors doing everything they can to prevent that.

Medical professionals know this. And yet they still turn up to work, every day. Because trying to help, and sometimes failing, is still better than not trying at all.

You can make all the best moves and still lose. That's not weakness. That's life.

** Klein from [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] is one of my favourite rationalist MCs in that he often walks the reader through his thinking processes and leaps of logic. The guy's personality also shines pretty easily through his actions: a stoic miser with a strict moral code, a paranoid yet lonely fellow who keeps getting himself dragged into deadly situations (mostly of his own making) yet thrives in total chaos with his Batman levels of preparation, ability to think in his feet when plans inevitably go wrong and great talent at misdirection.

I've managed to get a few people here reading it over the last few months and it was mostly well received, with a few cultural/translator poor word choice issues due to being written by a Chinese author. I think you might like it too.

**** There are some questionable word choices I dislike from the translator but it only turns what is a 9/10 work to a high 7/10. Still very readable because the plot and characters carries it well, but I only wish the translation was better and didn't turn off people who can't stomach it.

Other criticisms of this story I've heard from friends include long chapters describing hermetic rituals in detail by the author "showing their work" and fluffing up the background, and many named characters being introduced in the first volume which can be overwhelming (some of the Western names are sort of anachronistic as well, as expected of a non-Western writer). All of this is restricted to the first volume though, after which the story takes off and goes crazy (in a good way).

Resist the urge to get spoiled until you caught up, seriously.

** Well, I'm partial to [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/][With This Ring]], though it's certainly not to everyone's taste.

Pros:

- The author attempts to keep comic book powers more or less self-consistent.
- The protagonist pays attention to the potential uses of superpowers. If a cosmic rod can create force fields and take a man into orbit, powered only by cosmic radiation, then there ought to be cosmic converter based electricity stations. If gnomes can steal people away through fairy rings, then they have an instantaneous and non-polluting form of mass transit.
- Updates daily, almost without fail.
- Multiple alternate timelines (Paragon, Renegade, Common Sense) give different perspectives on similar events.
- Characters and events are included from all over the DC universe, typically with accompanying wiki links to introduce them.
- The author is quite active in the accompanying discussion thread.

Cons:

- The style doesn't suit everyone: very slow paced (over two million words and counting), episodes are somewhat self-contained (but can have ripple effects), first-person present tense.
- The main timeline, Paragon, sometimes comes across to people as a Boring Invincible Hero.
- Renegade takes a while to hit its stride, and some people just don't like it at all.
- Won't be finished for decades.
