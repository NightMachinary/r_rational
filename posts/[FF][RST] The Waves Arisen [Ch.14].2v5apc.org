  “What? Why? What's going on?” Naruto asked.

  “What is it? Just tell me.”

No way. Just...no. I'm sure there will be more surprises, but this is definitely /not/ one of them. [[#s][She]] So unless you're suggesting that she's /actually not/ in love--which is an equally ludicrous claim at this point--she's absolutely /dying/ inside right now.

And hasn't it already been established that she just wants nothing to do with her old clan? My reading of her is that her first priority is to live, her second is to stick with Naruto, she's still trying to decide what the third should be, and revenge is maybe vaguely somewhere further down if it's on the list at all. Speaking of which, did her choice to kill Neji in cold blood strike anyone else as being totally out-of-character? I suppose she could've been just so fed up that she felt like she had to strike out /somehow/, and if we later learn that the experience rattled her enough to make her lose interest in further revenge, I'd be fine with that. Thoughts?

***** Yea, I know Hinata loves him.

She wanted to be approved of her clan before she got booted. Then she killed Neji. I'm not sure how it's been established that she wants nothing to do with the clan? I think she would have loved it if she was taken back, but obviously the situation doesn't allow that now, them being missing-nins and all.

We don't even know if she wanted to actually kill Neji. They never practiced killing anyone with the barriers, or Naruto would have known about it too and practiced them more and do it better with all those clones and all that chakra. She didn't have byakugan on, so she didn't see or hear what happened to Neji.

IIRC, there was a point where she basically said she doesn't care what they think of her, and upon hearing it Naruto remarked (in inner monologue) that the self-confidence book he'd given her was evidently working. I suppose I could be reading too far into that, though.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If she'd wanted to avoid killing him, she would've had it on, watching for the point where he yields. Even ignoring that, she would've been able to estimate when the barrier got too small to properly contain a human, and I think it was pretty clearly stated that she crushed him into a solid mass, which would require radius shrinkage significantly beyond that threshold.

  he says /to her face/ that there's no way he would ever /not/ think she's joking.
#+end_quote

In other words, Naruto explicitly just informed her---paraphrasing---"I give a 0% credence to the idea that you could love me. No evidence I encounter can update me away from 0%. Therefore, presuming you continue on the path of providing me hints and clues, and even just attempting to plain-old /tell/ me that you love me, it will never work. If you really wanted to communicate that sort of thing, you'd need to try something more drastic, to make me change my entire model."

This is a really useful thing for her to know! Right now she's moping because he effectively told her that her current strategy is futile. But he just told her /why/ she's been failing all this time---that his model doesn't allow for her evidence to enter it---and so told her exactly what she /should/ be doing: thinking of a /new/ strategy involving /forcing/ him to believe her.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think she was making a point about her clan in general. If you take her asking the "is the Gentle Fist style really weak" question as being for the sake of the /audience/, not so she could reaffirm her belief, then the whole thing is a demonstration that saying (in a very quiet, speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick way) that effectively, "I'm not fired; I quit. I can do a better job as not-a-Hyuuga then I ever could as one. They were just holding me back. In fact, they hold you all back. You, the branch house, they hold you back; rise up! You, the village, they keep you down; they're not invulnerable! They might know your secrets, but you could just kill them all, like the Uchiha! Don't feel so damn intimidated! I don't!" Etc.

Wow. This topped off that little section perfectly.

Kabuto is a pro:

#+begin_quote
  Kabuto inquired about their familiarity with medical ninjutsu, while they walked. Naruto didn't think it would be revealing too much to admit their ignorance, and on hearing his reply Kabuto offered to give the three of them some instruction in the basics, on the way.

  He was really doing his best to be useful---Naruto could see why Orochimaru would have liked having him around.

So Kabuto basically is continuously ensuring that they will find him useful. He manages it such that they let him stay with them and he learns all the techniques that they take with them.

In fact, the other Sannin's are enemies of Orochimaru in canon (and likely in this fic too if they know the type of experiments he does) and Jiraya is personally interested in Naruto.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  This type of irony is the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OED][OED]] has:

  #+begin_quote
  #+end_quote

  the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned; the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.

  According to Stanton, dramatic irony has three stages---installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution) ---producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the /contrary/ of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.

  For example:

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Lights][City Lights]]/ the audience knows that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin][Charlie Chaplin]]'s character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Cherrill][Virginia Cherrill]]) believes him to be rich.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_by_Northwest][North by Northwest]]/, the audience knows that Roger Thornhill ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant][Cary Grant]]) is not Kaplan; Vandamm ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mason][James Mason]]) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_the_King][Oedipus the King]]/, the audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon and Jocasta do not.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello][Othello]]/, the audience knows that Desdemona has been faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio and Roderigo.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cask_of_Amontillado][The Cask of Amontillado]]/, the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show][The Truman Show]]/, the viewer is aware that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this.

  - In /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet][Romeo and Juliet]]/, the audience knows that Juliet is already married to Romeo, but her family does not. Also, in the crypt, most of the other characters in the cast think Juliet is dead, but the audience knows she only took a sleeping potion. Romeo is also under the same misapprehension when he kills himself.

  Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary][Oxford English Dictionary]] has:

  #+begin_quote
  #+end_quote

  the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece][Ancient Greek drama]] was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend][legends]] that most of the plays dramatized. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles][Sophocles]]' /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_the_King][Oedipus the King]]/ provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:

  #+begin_quote
  #+end_quote

  Tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama ... The audience watched a drama unfold, already knowing its destined outcome. ... In Sophocles' /Oedipus the King/, for example, 'we' (the audience) can see what Oedipus is blind to. The man he murders is his father, but he does not know it.

  Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox][paradox]] that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare][William Shakespeare]] play /Romeo and Juliet/, when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead and kills himself. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself.

[Written After Reading]:

Well, no butchery. Surprised that both surviving Sannin are being introduced so quickly. I have to think this is just them having become aware of Naruto and the shenanigans that are going in and around Leaf and coming to support him. At least, that makes sense for Jiraya. Tsunade is less clear. I'm not sure if she was in on Naruto being Minato's son in canon. Gonna be harder to conceal their presence in Sound from Leaf than Team 7's, though, if that's the case. Makes me wonder how exactly the Sannin tracked them to Sound, given that Leaf's dispatch suggests that Leaf doesn't know they're there.

Pein "Nighting" Akatsuki seems a little weird, but if he's being setup as a foil to Naruto, each taking control of Mist/Sound in their own way, I guess it makes sense.

Do anything that might kill my teammates and I will activate it. However I don't like to use as it erodes my will to want to keep other people alive. If I use it too much, I will want to literally kill everyone.

N: In that state I will have enough power that you'd need an entire army to stop me. Additionally, I become more intelligent and ruthless in that state. Knowing this makes you a threat to the psychopathic version of me, and as soon as I urn psychopathic I will find you, every Kage, and every administrator of note, and kill them well before anyone notices that I might be a problem. That way the chance of any group raising the army that would be needed to defeat me is radically dropped, and I can proceed to exterminate the human race at leisure.

N: The me of now does not want to do this, but rest assured that I will as soon as that dead man's switch strips me of any semblance of care for the lives of others. It is in your interest to keep me alive, and help me gain power so that others can't kill me. Likewise it is in my interest to give you what you want as there are costs to my use of that power, and there are many instances where the costs of my deference to you will be less than the cost of activation.

I expect this tactic to backfire horribly, but i'm not sure how. A lot depends on Kabuto's goals.

Also, holy crap, rereading that dialogue makes me keenly aware of why I'm not a writer.

  - This means that he knows Itachi is after Naruto
  - Similarly he'll be on the lookout for the knowledge to reseal a tailed beast, and have a way to defeat Naruto in the near future.
  - He does /not/ know about the backup shadow clones, so he will be less wary of trying that too early. Though he may very well suspect it.

- Sasuke is much less powerful than Sasuke + Orochimaru. He could be caught out in a lie easily enough.

*** We don't know yet. That's part of the cliffhanger. But I think it's Tsunade's apprentice, Shizune.

As the weakest member of the trio, I bet that Naruto plans to kill her first, which would make Jiraiya and Tsunade to change their minds from helping to murdering Naruto. Let's hope his plan fails and that they are really there to help him.

**** Aaaaah yea I forgot about Shizune... Never mind. :D

edit: I'm not sure they are going to fight at all. They could have an audience with clones, while they would themselves be hiding in the trapped secret underground ninjutsu stash. They also have lots of ninjas in their disposal, so they might not even have to worry much anyway. Just send someone to ask them what they want first, make clones to go hide, and grant an audience with shitloads of guards.
