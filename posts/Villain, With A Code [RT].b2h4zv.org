** Not sure if anyone's seen this before but a quick search didn't show it posted here before.

Disclaimer: Not my work

Villain, With A Code (VWAC) is a college age superhero story with the MC as the impossible son of two S tier villains and a villain himself. When caught he is sentenced to attend the story's hero school, with hints that there's a behind the scenes agenda at play.

I won't spoil more about why it's RT but it ticks the first two bullet points in the sidebar and possibly the final one too.

It's currently at 52k words and updating at least once a week.

** Despite being a bit too much wish fufiment/OP MC with the vector powerset this is a fun read. The world so far is half the reality of worm and half the vile corruption The Boys is known for, so while you have characters that almost make sense you also have all you'd expect of a high school full of super powered adolescents playing status games. It almost plays a bit of the wrong thing for seductive reasons game worm does, or maybe I just don't quite like the main character. All that said it is a very fun read.

** This does remind me of the Aeromancer Storyline. The story has a lot of potential, as the way it does use the villian mc trope is not as used up as most others. The writingstyle is good but in terms of its problemsolving process so far it only plays the card of the mc not being as boxed into one thought pattern as the rest of the world, which is ok and good , but not enough longterm. This could get old fast, but i really hope the author is coming up with some nice twist and adds to the side and background characters behaviour and intelligence levels. In terms of rationality its not that rational right now but it could get into that direction, diplomacy as a focus point could be very refreshing.
