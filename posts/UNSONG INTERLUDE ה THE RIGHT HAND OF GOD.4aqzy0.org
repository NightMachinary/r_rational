** Hm. Not much to go on, but the fact this chapter exists implies mind-altering substances can influence or be influenced by magic somehow, which further implies a very simple uniting magical method, which doesn't actually need names. Or it could be like the sumerian tongue in /Snow Crash/, a shared language of all human brains, and /that/ is what interfaces with magic.

*** Placebomancy can alter reality. Mind-altering substances should be even more powerful than that.

*** When I was a young teenager I read a book called /Hitman/ that used the "psychosomatic" model of curses. Kind of. That was unclear because the writing really blurred the lines between the effects of the magic used by the antagonist and the drugs used by the protagonist. It was fun, but in hindsight, probably not age-appropriate.

*** I don't see this as confirming a single magical method. The psychedelic method seems similar to placebomancy, but I see no strong connection to the kabbalah method.
