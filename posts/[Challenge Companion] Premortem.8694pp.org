Generally speaking, I don't think you see too much of this sort of thing in fiction, though I think it's pretty ripe for use as a form of exposition. The problem, as far as a the narrative goes, is that the Unspoken Plan Guarantee exists for a reason, and that reason is that we don't want to hear people discuss a plan, then see them carry out that plan exactly as discussed. There are a number of ways of getting around that (e.g. through the use of black swans) but it makes "people go over a plan or course of action in detail" somewhat tricky to pull off.


** This is something that I frequently see high-level Magic: The Gathering players do, especially in situations when they're in a commanding position to win. The way I often see this phrased is, "How do I lose from this position?" In asking this question, a player who is on track to win might identify an unlikely-yet-possible avenue by which they could lose a game, and then play in a way to avoid that outcome, often described as "playing around your opponent's outs." The best players tend to be those who can take a position where they have a 85% likelihood to win, and play in such a way that they convert that into a 100% likelihood to win by cutting off specific possibilities for their opponent to get back into the game rather than going on "auto-pilot" and playing the game in a way that might feel like "winning harder" but doesn't account for the specific contingencies available to their opponent.

** This makes me think of strategies against opponents with some kind of save-scum mechanism e.g. looping in time, antimemetics, reloading new instances of your upload, etc. Develop a plan, then realize that your past selves would also have thought of that, so if it's such a good plan why didn't they already do it successfully?

** Murphyjitsu is a pretty good way to structure a premortem.

*** "What could possibly go wrong?" only jinxes you if it's rhetorical.

** This might be a little different; something I often do when running an experiment is think "This /should/ work, but if it doesn't (and I get a (/blank) result which seems to make no sense instead), what might have gone wrong and what should I try next to address the problem?". That feels as though it helps me approach results more calmly, having an A/B outcome flowchart to proceed according to rather than an 'If this doesn't work, I'm screwed' outlook.
