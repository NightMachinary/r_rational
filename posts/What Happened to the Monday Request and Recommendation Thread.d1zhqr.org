I don't see it posted on the subreddit by the Automoderator. Did it get canceled?


** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/d1b06k/is_automod_having_issues_scheduled_posts_not/][See here]], looks like Automod is having some issues, but it's being looked into. I will manually post on Wednesday if it's not fixed by then.

*** I went ahead and posted one manually a bit ago. Hopefully it won't end up as a double post once automod starts working again. If so I will post a link to it in the automod thread so people can find it.

** Would it be possible to have the Monday Request and Recommendation Thread posted at the start of the day in GMT?

** No idea, but it definitely hasn't been canceled. I messaged the mods about it.

Do you think someone should post it manually?

*** I was checking if it was just me for some reason. I have posted one manually for now.
