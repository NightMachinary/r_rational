This month we read /[[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]]/, a hard science fiction novel by Peter Watts:

#+begin_quote
  It's been two months since a myriad of alien objects clenched about the Earth, screaming as they burned. The heavens have been silent since - until a derelict space probe hears whispers from a distant comet. Something talks out there: but not to us. Who to send to meet the alien, when the alien doesn't want to meet? Send a linguist with multiple-personality disorder, and a biologist so spliced to machinery he can't feel his own flesh. Send a pacifist warrior, and a vampire recalled from the grave by the voodoo of paleogenetics. Send a man with half his mind gone since childhood. Send them to the edge of the solar system, praying you can trust such freaks and monsters with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they've been sent to find - but you'd give anything for that to be true, if you knew what was waiting for them.
#+end_quote

*NEXT MONTH'S BOOK:*

*Title*: The Pride of Chanur

*Ebook cost*: [[https://www.amazon.com/Pride-Chanur-C-J-Cherryh-ebook/dp/B00F3KXN1U/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=][$2.99]] (Consider using [[https://smile.amazon.com][smile.amazon]] to send part of Amazon's profits to a preselected charity like Doctors Without Borders)

*Page/Word count*: 239 pages

*Genre*: Science fiction

*Synopsis*: No one at Meetpoint Station had ever seen a creature like the Outsider. Naked-hided, blunt toothed and blunt-fingered, Tully was the sole surviving member of his company of humans―a communicative, spacefaring species hitherto unknown―and he was a prisoner of his discoverers and captors―the sadistic, treacherous kif―until his escape onto the hani ship, The Pride of Chanur.

Little did he know when he threw himself upon the mercy of The Pride and her crew that he put the entire hani species in jeopardy and imperiled the peace of the Compact itself...for the information this fugitive held could be the ruin or glory of any of the species at Meetpoint Station.

*Reasons [[/r/rational]] would like it*: Aliens! The [[https://www.tor.com/2009/09/30/the-best-aliens-ever-cj-cherryhs-the-pride-of-chanur/][best aliens ever]], according to one review of the trilogy.

*Content warnings*: None that I am aware of.

Next month's discussion will be posted by the superb [[/u/magicweasel]] on March 14th, or a few days later if we're a little behind in our reading.

I think that Blindsight is a great example of a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][weirdtopia]]--not a weird utopia, but a weird dystopia. The book doesn't dwell on this overly much, but it was interesting to read the book through the lens that we're sort of looking at the edges of something greater and that, for all that they think they're part of the bleeding-edge, our characters are sort of cast-offs, the bits and bobs that didn't get pulled along by the Singularity.

On a related note, do you think it's plausible for something that we would retroactively call “the Singularity” to occur without us realizing its significance as such till some time afterwards?

*** There's a subtext plot point in William Gibson's The Peripheral that touches on that. The book revolves around a piece of tech that was stolen from China, but is basically future tech to even the very advanced post-scarcity main characters. China basically turned into "unknowable intelligence", extremely advanced but insular. No one knows what's going on in China, and no one knows what will come out of China. I've made parallels of it before to something like Her, where the Singularity happens but the AIs just...leave us behind.

Blindsight also has a bit of this in another flavor, where there are the hyper advanced AIs that can solve physics but can't tell us /how/. Hyperion Cantos and I, Robot have the same problem, where there is the extemely advanced AI and you can't be sure what they're doing is what they say, because they're incomprehensible, and may be just stringing you along while they do their own thing.

*** I read an article a while ago about how The Singularity has already happened with the huge technological advances in the 1900s. I wonder if future historians would look on the period between 1900-2100 as a kind of "industrial revolution 2.0"? Probably not - there seems to be some natural divides with the advent of electricity and then also the advent of computers, so probably thinking too hard.

** My favorite worldbuilding line that wasn't related to anything else in the story: “third-world medical missionary work [...] in Texas.”

Another thing that I love about Watts' work: the abbreviations (we've got “TwenCen” and “WestHem” here, and off the top of my head “innersys” for /inner system/ and “N'Am” for /North America/ in other books of his). It feels very Philip K. Dick somehow, even if the rest of Watts' work doesn't really match up.

*** Blindsight focuses heavily on the idea of Transhumanism and the idea that humanity will eventually create their replacements. In that context, the characters who upload their consciousness to "Heaven" are perceived as copouts because they choose not to participate in that progress. It's definitely a very bleak view of that future, but something I could imagine happening in our own. I'm reminded of the [[http://dresdencodak.com/2008/06/07/eloi/][Hob storyline]] from Dresden Codak: /"I can give you anything you want, save relevance."/

In the story going to "Heaven" is indistinguishable from death because those who do so stop progressing as individuals. Siri's mother, and a different character seen in Peter Watts' /Echopraxia/, each wrap themselves in self-fulfilling fantasies where no real personal growth is possible.

One ugly detail is that when you stay too long and they have to find where the hell to put your body they start chopping pieces off so you will take less space, to the point you're nothing but a torso with a head.

Siri at one time mentions that uploading your consciousness to a machine is still not possible, but its being researched.

There's another novel set in the same universe, during part of Blindsight (specifically, after "Theseus" and "Rorschach" but before Siri receives that message from his father in "Charybdis"). Would anyone be interested (or actively disinterested, for that matter) in reading that in a year or so? If you liked some aspects of Blindsight but thought that it was too slow or too light on the action, then you may like Echopraxia.

I also found my suspension of disbelief constantly being broken while reading it. Even so, the ideas are very interesting and in the last third of the novel most of my complaints seemed to be addressed by the author... so I ended up liking it after all.

*** I did. The first paragraphs of description in the style I have now seen in Watts' other books clearly said "slow down or this could become word salad". World-specific contractions, staccato abstract and allusive descriptions, and lots of camera-eye views. So I kept track of everything as the perspective jumped around by reading a little slower.

Actually it was the "weird" characters not seeming weird that threatened my immersion the most. Watts had to provide scientific background for the readers, and he gave it through the characters; structurally I think he did it very well, but it means they often seem to be lacking high-school knowledge. So I was creating my own scenes to hide that a lot. And, they're not very rational. Their thoughts are guided towards the book's main ideas so that the readers can follow along, but too slowly for smart people in such a situation. Therefore ironically, my immersion hurt my immersion. I think this is the main reason I find Echopraxia much easier to reread.

By demonstrating that just removing our capacity for empathy would create something entirely inhuman and arguably nonsapient, it gets far easier to understand what I view as the main points of the novel: that our assumptions about sapience may be entirely wrong, that the universe as a whole does not know the difference between sapience and nonsapience, and that coming at problems from familiar points of view has a reasonable chance of backfiring horribly if you don't understand all the moving parts first.

****** It really didn't fit. One of the major themes of the story was how technology was making humanity itself obsolete, so it struck me as really jarring to have a "natural" being, reconstructed or not, that was able to match or surpass all of those transhumanism creations.

******* The vampires are build from scratch for pattern-matching and their brains are basically a bunch of brain "cores" put together running in parallel. Meanwhile transhumans are just humans retrofitted with stuff and as such are still limited by their own human brains.

******* Exactly. No matter how smart it is, it's a biological entity that shares the overwhelming majority of its genes with humans, they're even capable of cross-breeding with us. Baseline humans already developed GAI, and we've got multicore multibrain hive minds in the next novel. I don't care how good the pattern matching on them is, there's no way that without some serious augmentation and tweaking that would also be applicable to other human offshoots, that they'd be able to just take over without some bigger post-biological brainchild of humanity giving them the finger. Especially take over the planet as the Blindsight's ending implies.

Now, it's a great book, and vampires are an interesting /concept/, just one that isn't really water tight once you look at it closely.

****** They /did/ make the vampires through genetic engineering. Their limited knowledge sufficed to create something so different because of "vampires" already having existed, yes as an offshoot of humans. It's in the book...

The genetic engineering was mainly part of the process of resurrecting what was already there.

*** The vampires didn't bother me, because they're not gothic blood-drinking creatures of the night, they're human-adjacent predators that the humans of the story gave a thematically-appropriate name.

** [META THREAD]

#+begin_quote
  Next month's discussion will be posted by the superb [[/u/magicweasel]] on March 14th, or a few days later if we're a little behind in our reading.
#+end_quote

Also March 14th happens to be my birthday, so it might be a little after that just because I'll be too busy ~PARTYING~ (ha!).

In more housekeeping news, next month the book suggestion thread is going to become archived. With the rotating "hosts" each month, and the work that goes into "hosting" and reading a book, we might become more insular in the choices we make as choosing the book is the privilege of the book club czar: so if you want to guarantee the book you're itching to talk about is chosen, well, volunteer to host one month!

Also, if people are interested in accountability, me and [[/u/callmesalticidae]] have a "book club email thread" that we use to prod each other into meeting our reading deadlines (and that contains at least one image of the lovely spot by the river I stop on my way home from work to squeeze some reading in if the weather's pleasant). So feel free to PM either of us to get in on that.

To sweeten the pot, I can promise to include a picture of Edgar Allan Crow and the other corvids that live on my university campus!
