** How can naruto's every strategy revolve around a technique he learned within the past 6 months?

Canon ninja being one trick ponies as a whole makes sense narratively, but not rationally, imo. You'd just be setting yourself up for hard counters, every 1v1 would be a game of rock paper scissors, like Tenten vs Temari.

With regards to rational!naruto, he's had years to theorize and test tacticts, stealth, deception, etc. vs. ANBU through his pranking. So when he doesn't try to diversify his arsenal and continues to rely solely on shadow clones(even if he uses them really, really creatively), well, that just seems weird and out of character.

Though to be fair, I suppose he can feel like nothing so far warrants revealing whatever he has hidden up his sleeve.

I suspect that's more a reflection of Genin limitations. IIRC, it was meant to be a big surprise that Sasuke could do non-Academy ninjutsu /at all/ during the bell test. Expecting the Genin to not only know multiple techniques within their specialisation, but multiple /kinds/ of technique, may be unreasonable given the limited time they've had to train. Of course, some Genin, like the older and supposedly elite Temari, have no excuse that I can see. Meanwhile, J≈çnin appear to have much more diverse abilities - even Maito Gai has some upper-tier techniques that blur the line between taijutsu and ninjutsu.

I think there are two answers to that. First, /everything/ he does with shadow clones is a product of his experience and training. Shadow clones in human form are just him in greater numbers. Shadow clones in non-human form are just summonable tools. The capabilities of the Shadow Clone Technique in his hands are thus nothing more or less than a direct manifestation of everything he's learned. To him, it's less of a ninjutsu and more of a force multiplier on /himself/.

Second, I think you are overstating the case when it comes to him vs ANBU. He didn't make them, or other high-skill ninja, his primary targets by any means (there's only so much trouble the Hokage's intervention could get him out of), nor was he specifically trying to develop ability as a ninja through his pranking, or to accomplish his pranks in particularly ninja-like ways.

*** Well what exactly are his options against a team with a wide area defence and a long range offence? The only option I can think of is some sort of bizzare bum rush where Sasuke and Naruto hold a piece of ninja wire between them. Anything else is either blasted away or ineffective.

Maybe if they had time to throw logs at them, but logs can just be blasted to bits and then you're open for a counter. Or if they had traps set up beforehand, which would have been a good idea for a person for whom "many hands make light work" is not just a catechism, but a way of life.

**** Then they should have retreated as soon as their trap failed. There's no reason whatsoever to play their game at the place and time of their choosing. If shadow clones are good for anything, its setting up for contingencies.

But really, I'm not trying to split hairs on what they should have done. I'm just saying its kind of perplexing and contradictory to the established backstory that this Naruto would use shadow clones for every problem.

What are some other things you think he should be using? Given what's in his arsenal (body flicker, substitution, henge, shadow clone, taijutsu, some gear), is there a way he could have more effectively solved one of his current or prior problems?

    And then the initial wave of silence from the Nova Thrust cancelled out the wave of sound from the Death Knell.

    Sasuke promptly shoved both ninja off-balance, and Naruto used the window of opportunity to summon more shadow clones. The rest was history.
  #+end_quote

  Whaat? No way, that's-

  #+begin_quote
    -o-

    A throwing needle zoomed out of the tree above Sakura's head and impacted in the ground between Naruto and Sasuke. There was the faint ring of a bell, and then both stopped what they were doing and stood still as if in a stupor.

#+end_quote

Suggested clarification: adding a short description to "impacted the ground between Naruto and Sasuke" along the lines of 'near the downed Sound ninja' or 'while they breathed a sigh of relief' to establish that the scenebreak doesn't flash back a few seconds.

  Plus, if we weren't sure before, Miss Bubblegum Head there just confirmed it for us.

  Sakura went pink, unfortunately making the nickname even more appropriate.

  ...

  But the instant annihilation of Naruto's shadow clone army wasn't the worst part. The worst part was that the wave also popped Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura.

So it was Naruto disguised clone who got embarrassed in Sakuras place?
