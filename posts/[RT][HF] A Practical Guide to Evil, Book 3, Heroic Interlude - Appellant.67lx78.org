*** It was a pleasure to see the insights into their capabilities and the planning and coordination the Calamities can bring to bear. However I felt rather disappointed with the result and sad that all that preparation didn't pay off.

**** The Black Knight has a lot more to lose than the heroes do. He has no interest in a fight to the bloody bitter end. I think the Tyrant retreating twigged his weird-sense, he checked if any of the heroes were on the ropes, and when they weren't he went with plan B (assassin).

The Tyrant is the interesting part. It seems pretty obvious that he'd like plucky heroes more than the Calamities. The heroes are like a favorite toy that he can keep throwing more and more fireworks at just to see what happens. The Calamities, on the other hand, are like the stick-up-the-butt preppy kids who keep trying to give him sweet lifehacks for better flossing.

**** I think the point of the chapter is to show how different the fights between Cat+Akua and Calamities+full heroes. It also shows how hard the deck is stacked against The Black Knights plan.

Despite preparation, a horrible difference in experience and attacking exhausted heroes they will still previal because the story demands ist.

***** It also show a difference in how Cat and Black interact with the "Story". For the most part, Cat has taken advantage of the story when she could, and forced her way through when it's taken advantage of her (fight in Arcadia, final fight with Lone Swordsman, etc.)

Black however, show much more respect for the story, if less accommodation for it, and not just in the constant subversion of the Bard. He create a situation in which he has as much advantage as he could conceivably have, yet the moment it seems the story might strike back he gives it up. Gives up the opportunity to strike the heroes down, gives up the intelligence the heroes gain from surviving them and risks them becoming significant BECAUSE they survived an attack of the Calamities. Because you do not mess with the Story unless it's already dead.

Yes! And the point where he gives up makes me wonder how he managed to kill the other heroes.

I also wonder what Black figured was the trigger point in the original plan. Would he have continued if, e.g. the Hedge Wizard had fallen for the trap? Or if the Tyrant had continued attacking, or attempted a backstab? Is Black trying to set up a pattern of three (the heroes win the first one etc)? Are the Calamities going to give Hanno the seven days and seven nights before he awakens? So many questions and what ifs.

**** It was honestly rather predictable. White Knight wouldn't have been introduced simply to get killed in the first skirmish with Black. With his coin thing, he is pretty clearly a villain Cat will have to face, and erratic wouldn't have wasted all this buildup simply to make Black seem /more/ awesome.

  “I do not judge,” the White Knight said.

  The silver coin appeared in his open palm, as it always did. As a child, Hanno had seen the laws of men fail. He'd believed in the citizenship tiers, before he'd seen what they did to his mother. And yet Ashur was on the side of Good, was it not? So many places across Calernia were, and yet injustice was rampant. The thought had tormented him, as a child. How could one tell which laws were just and which were not? Picking and choosing was... imperfect. One's discernment could never be flawless. It was constrained by the events of one's life, the limits of one's intellect. Hanno could have, he supposed, destroyed the laws he'd seen destroy his mother. But what would he have replaced them with? His own beliefs, as fallible as those of the men and women who'd crafted the laws he railed against? That was not rectifying an evil. It was replacing it with a different shade of the same. But he'd found an answer, hadn't he? He flipped the coin, watched it spin in the air. It landed on his palm. The crossed silver swords, not the laurels. The Seraphim had rendered their judgement.

  “Kairos Theodosian, Tyrant of Helike,” the White Knight said, tone eerily calm. “The Choir of Judgement has looked upon the sum of your existence, and found you wanting.”

  Heat flooded his veins, lighting up his senses. For once, everything felt right.
