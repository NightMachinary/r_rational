** I wonder how much off the time skip is from the modern definition of an hour.

Did they build this when the world had a revolution in 12 hours or 23 hours?

*** Interesting thought. One hour is the approximate increment that the protagonist perceives that I picked artbitrarily, so, yes, that would be a 'modern' hour. This is a secondary world, modeled loosely on South Asia. I had imagined the ruins to be 50 million years old, based on old estimate for the Himalayas. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation][Earth's rotation]] slows at a rate of 1.7 milliseconds per kilo year. So a day would have been shorter by only a quarter of an hour when the Time Conduit was built.

**** Only a quarter of an hour should be perceivable with their technology (almost a minute a skip) so it is an accurate method of dating, assuming that measuring the slowing of the Earth's rotation is something they can do which I don't know.

** I find the fact that the second word of the first sentence is already spelled incorrectly to be incredibly off-putting.

I know it's petty, but seeing something like that saps all of my hope that I'm about to read something good.

*** Thank you (I corrected it.). You are not being petty. I feel the same way when I see spelling or grammatical errors in a literary work. Having smirked at similar errors in the work of others', I should hold myself to a higher standard. I appreciate the honest feedback, and up voted your comment.

*** Thanks ! Anemone was /very/ loosely inspired by the character(NPC) Quelaag in the game /Dark Souls/, a monster who is as much a victim (of her own biology) as the humans she preys on.

** I wouldn't expect to be able to find anyone in these ruins... If Anemone enters the ruins, then vanishes forward in time, then you enter before she comes back, then you will always be out of phase, both of you appearing exactly when the other vanishes. And the deeper you go into the ruins, the more possible phases there are, and the less likely you are to meet someone who crossed the thresholds more than an hour before you. Have I misunderstood the mechanics?

**** That's not what I mean. Say Anemone goes from normal space to a 6-hour-skip zone just before midnight, right in time to be hit with Skip 0 and sent six hours forward in time. Hot on her heels, Akalya enters the same zone just minutes later, but Anemone has vanished. Akalya wastes an hour searching for someone who isn't there, and is hit by Skip 1 and sent six hours forward.

Skips 2, 3, 4, and 5 pass without incident. Then when Skip 6 passes, Anemone reappears. She goes about her business for an hour until Skip 7 sweeps her further forward. While she is disappearing, Akalya reappears, none the wiser. She keeps searching for another hour, but Anemone doesn't exist then, so it's hopeless. Skip 8 sends her forward.

Anemone reappears with Skip 13 and disappears with Skip 14. Akalya reappears with Skip 14 and disappears with Skip 15. This happens again on Skip 20. They're practically right on top of each other, in the same place, in the same 6-hour-skip zone, in the same time period, but they never exist at the same time. Avoiding this would require either luck, or active coordination, I think.

***** Agreed. If Akalya enters the time skip close on Anemone's heels she will never catch up. However if she arrives there at least 7 or more hours later (which she does) then she has a 1/7 chance of getting back in sync with Anemone. She has to hit that 1 hour slot in the 1 plus 6 hour period or its multiple. A small chance to be sure, but not vanishingly small. Does that make sense ? Let me know if I am wrong. Thanks for taking the time.

****** Yeah, you're right. The chance is 1/7 of being physically capable of finding someone you're looking for, as long as you enter the zone from a zone with a cycle-length that is coprime with the new zone's, which is easy for a prime 1+6 zone. 1/7 isn't vanishingly small - if nothing else, you can leave and come back and search the area seven times, if you know to do that. But once you get deep enough that you're skipping more than a day, it becomes increasingly unfeasible to search the ruins, even if you're willing to burn decades of outside-time. It seems like something Sibi would have to worry about, if he's planning on entering the ruins to find someone specific. He knows how it works. Did he just plan on getting lucky?

******* Sibi knows the chances of a rescue are slim. But Akalya offers him more money than he can resist, and he intends to make a single good faith attempt and offer condolences to the widow after the search turns up nothing. He knows enough not to go too deep into the ruins. His main fear is random predators from the past, but Akalya's high-tech weapon reassures him. What actually happens is partly for plot reasons, as mentioned before, and takes him by surprise.
