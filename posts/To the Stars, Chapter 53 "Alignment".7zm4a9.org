***** Hieronym (the author of To the Stars) is still writing at a pretty consistent pace: ~1k words per week for the past 2 years or so. It's just that this is half as fast as they were writing before they finished grad school.

(Should also note that they've said the story outline has been planned since the beginning.)

****** I suspect it feels slower because relativey little happens in each chapter compared to some other stories on here (instead with more focus on characterisation and description). Not that that is a bad thing, but it makes the progress of the story feel very slow and incremental. In contrast to other stories that have a lot of plot relevant action in a short period, and make a point of ending on a cliffhanger
