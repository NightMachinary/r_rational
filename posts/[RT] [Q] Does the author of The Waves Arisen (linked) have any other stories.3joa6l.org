*** You know, I'm rereading the last chapter and it [[http://i.imgur.com/wwc6fbg.png][really]] reminds me of his style. Might just be influenced by him, though, or confirmation bias.

Then again, I doubt he'd write [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2upavf/ffrst_the_waves_arisen_ch10/cob8kyb][this]] if he was secretly the author.

I also tried to find the guy back then and completely failed, I agree it's probably a throwaway identity, but why someone would bother writing an amazing story with one I don't know.

***** Want to do a comparative [[https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/JStylo-Anonymouth#You-can-download-it-here][stylometric analysis]]? (But if it /was/ Yudkowsky, he'd probably be expecting that, and have used the other tool on the page to anonymize the writing. I wonder if the suggestions the Anonymouth tool makes are predictable enough to prove its usage---whether words are effectively re-attributed to the robot's particular style. That'd be evidence of /something/, at least.)

One could also likely generate a stylistic signature for every corpus on FF.net to compare to, if one had the inclination.

******* If you're ordinarily the type to make claim to what some would consider embarrassingly low-status writing (e.g. HP fanfic), but in some /particular/ case you decide to write under a pseudonym, that would suggest that you /really/ want to remain unlinked to that particular work.

Further, if you are aware that your fanbase is the type to be insatiably curious to the point where they would attempt to dox people, and you are also intelligent enough to realize that just using a pseudonym isn't enough to avoid that doxing attempt... then what else /could/ you do but to change your style?

Note that the above-mentioned program automatically makes these stylistic changes for you; it's not hard work.

******* I've intentionally changed writing style in order to beat cursory analysis, though not using any sort of tool. This is mostly in order to anonymously submit low-status works in such a way that they can't be connected back to me. (I've also anonymously submitted works in my own style, but have never been called on it.)

******** In /Ender's Shadow/, Bean decides Locke and Demosthenes were two different people because they had different writing styles, which he didn't think anyone was smart enough to fake. Might've been a joke on Card's account, as his telling the same story from Bean's perspective as he did Ender's is kind of like what Peter and Valentine do with their alter-egos.

*** *Yudkowsky

Also, it was posted from January to February of this year. Which a) was, AFAIK, months before Eliezer put up the thing about confirming or denying that authors were him, which seems unnecessarily risky (the other way around seems better), and b) was during the long sprint to the finish for HPMoR, which strains belief somewhat in terms of the writing productivity he'd have had to have.

** I had a similar thought a few months back.

The author created the username Wertifloke specifically to post and promote The Waves Arisen on a few webesites, then never posted with that username again. From my research, Wertifloke isn't associated with anything else, or any other user. It was an identity created for The Waves Arisen and discarded immediately afterwards.

** I'm seven chapters in. It reads like an imitation of Eliezer's style, but not quite as interesting to read. I don't think it's him.

Edit: I've finished reading the whole thing. Impressions unchanged. It had some funny parts, but I'm positive it's not Eliezer.

** I'm pretty sure it's Yudkowsky, especially this paragraph

#+begin_quote
  It really hadn't been that much unlike the case of the nine-tails---certainly not as much as he'd felt a minute ago. Sage mode /had/ been playing tricks on his mind. He resolved that in future he would try to have shadow clones in existence as a precaution at all times, and he'd require all important decisions to be made /outside/ the influence of sage mode, even if it seemed pointless to bother at the time---or, no, /especially/ if it seemed like he shouldn't bother. And if he ever caught himself trying to avoid even thinking about it so that he could stay in sage mode, that would initiate the emergency shutdown procedure, and his brain would unleash untold horrors upon itself.
#+end_quote

It just reads like his writing. It reads exactly like when Harry makes contingency plans.

** So because of this thread I read the entire story. I remember seeing it back when it posted but I knew nothing of Naruto so I didn't give it a chance. Thank you "Wertifloke", it was absolutely fantastic and gave me many laughs and feelings.

I am confused because from my perspective this was pretty clearly Eliezer's writing but I don't see much consensus on this. Can anyone attempt to answer these questions I have?

1. I would expect most readers of both The Waves Arisen and HPMOR to think it was by the same author. Is this the case? or am I in the small minority?

2. If it was written by Eliezer what are some reasons that he would write under another name?

3. Am I blowing his cover if it is him? Is there a reason it should remain a secret?
