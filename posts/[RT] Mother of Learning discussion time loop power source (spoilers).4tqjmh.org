With the information provided by the Guardian in chapter 55 about the operation of the loop, I've been thinking a bit about its power requirements and source. There are several fascinating/baffling/important points that seem to be worthy of input from the great minds around here.

First up - this thing has /so much power/ available that even in a premature, inefficient loop like this one, it still manages to recreate the world over 1000 times. We don't know how far the effect extends, but we can presume it's the entire planet at a minimum, and probably more. That includes all the mana wells; the Gate has recreated /the Hole/ over 1000 times. Presumably it has recreated the very heart of the world, the source of all ambient mana. So when Zorian suspects that the Maker must have been a god, I think there can be no doubt. Anyone who could do that would quickly become a god, Morrowind-style, if they weren't already.

Second, it occurred to me that the length of time inside the loop is actually supposed to be /greater/ than the 400 years /between/ loops. We can't be certain of the reliability of the legend that claimed the first emperor spent "11 lifetimes" there, but 1000 iterations > 80 years if utilised fully, and the Guardian made it clear that this particular loop is decaying "far more rapidly than it is supposed to." So the legend is probably about right. And if we make a highly conservative estimate that 1 lifetime = 50 years, then that's 550 years of time loop, requiring an absolute minimum of 6600 iterations (probably more; he would have died early sometimes).

So, if the Gate is continually gathering power during the intervening centuries, then each iteration represents about 3 weeks of charging time. Where could it possibly get that much power from? Cosmic radiation of some kind? Could that even be enough? Or is the power source something more local? If so, then it should be available inside the loop, so that in theory it could recharge /from the looping world itself/...

Or, if it's not a 400-year-long recharge, then perhaps we're looking at some kind of huge energy input from the planar alignment. But that would presumably leave open the possibility of multiple activations throughout the 2-month alignment period. Which doesn't seem likely, when we're already in Arc 3 of the story. Also, the Guardian didn't say that there was less power /available/ due to the premature start; it said that everything was more expensive and decaying faster. So I doubt that the alignment is actually providing power; it's simply lowering the usual barriers and making the process vastly more efficient. The power still has to have been gathered from somewhere else.

Anyone's thoughts?

#+end_quote

It is possible to calculate an upper bound, actually.

A loop lasts no longer than one month. It has a fixed light cone.

To clarify, if an object is farther away from the looper at the start of the loop than the distance photon covers in the duration of one loop, then the looper and the object cannot interact with each other: they can't travel faster than light, so the loop inevitably resets before they meet. (As example, no entity looping in a nanosecond-long loop will be able to affect anything beyond a sphere of radius 0.3 meter.)

Unfortunately, I cannot find any particulars about the MoL loop's length. I only know that it lasts 'a month', starts 'after two in the morning'^{[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/41/Mother-of-Learning][ch.41]]} and ends '2 hours and 40 minutes after midnight'^{[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/40/Mother-of-Learning][ch.40]].} For lack of better numbers, I'll go with '30 days long'.

30 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes × 60 seconds = 2.592×10^{6} seconds. 2.592×10^{6} × 3×10^{8} (speed of light) = 7.776×10^{14} meters = ~5.198×10^{3} astronomical units. In our Solar system, that's past the Kuiper Belt halfway to the Oort Cloud. (Volume of the corresponding sphere is 1.97×10^{45} m^{3} or 1.4×10^{18} Sol, if you care about that.)

Since the time loop works under extreme time acceleration, nobody in the non-looping universe will be able to notice any discrepancies afterwards, so I cannot think of any reason why the Time Loop Creator would create a template bigger than that.

Admittedly, that's not a very small template.

Of course, it all only works under the assumption that FTL signaling is impossible.

I wasn't under the impression that any (or at least any significant amount of) energy is expended during the iteration. Zorian seems to have discovered the opposite: "Wait," frowned Zorian. "So the time loop spends power per iteration, not according to how much time passes?"

#+end_quote

Good point; it might. Except my thinking was, this is an exact copy of the world and its surroundings - not an illusion, but a real and working copy. So, if the power source was anywhere in the vicinity, then it would be recreated inside the loop, and would thus be supplying power - potentially for longer than the 400 years that would otherwise be available for recharging. If the Gate is indeed making use of that already, then that would mean that charging time inside the loop is actually more important than the charging time in between, and that the length of each loop will greatly affect the capabilities of the next loop (eg this reduced loop would mean much less power available next time).

** We have no info on pocket dimensions mechanics. Given that, few thoughts:

- When creating pocket dimension, it may be possible to specify its content cheaply, but energy/matter transfer between dimensions is costly. In other words, pocket dimension spell is divination heavy. Or defining content may require privileged divine casting. There are rumors of ancient mages, possibly empowered by gods, doing true matter conjuration, after all. No gods - no true matter conjuration.

- Gate may be located in its own personal pocket dimension with power source unrelated to the host and copy world. In fact it may occupy arbitrary large amount of pocket dimensions.

Think typical mindscapes, only renamed pocket dimensions, no arbitrary modification after creation, and precision indistinguishable from reality.

Or, in MoL terms, using true matter conjuration is cheaper then moving matter between dimensions. You created it there? It does not help you here much.

There is some evidence that moving matter between dimensions is cheap, though. So I find this theory unlikely as well.

** From the description of the loop it seems clear that it is a closed system, and as such it doesn't gather any energy. Makes sense too-whatever energy gathering thingy you make on the outside, it won't work, since no time passes on the outside.

As for how much power it would need per iteration, it might not actually be as much as people make it out to be. There certainly would be a huge power requirement to initiate the loop for the first time, but after that you could probably reuse a lot of the assets. E.g. tectonic plates don't move much in a month, and change even slower than that, so you would only really need to shift them backwards a couple micrometers, but won't actually need to recreate them from scratch. Mostly you would need to change the surface layer of the planet, and that's not much.

OK, but it has to have gathered it from somewhere, at some point, because the Guardian referred to running out of power. So we're still looking at a situation where 400 years of energy collection allows you to operate 550+ years of loop. That's pretty massive energy collection throughout those 400 years. Offhand I can't think of any external power source that would supply so much energy.

#+begin_quote

Maybe you could - but looks like it doesn't. From chapter 55, "When an iteration is over, everything in it is destroyed." And the length of the iterations doesn't affect their power requirements, apparently, which it would if resetting were a matter of undoing changes. The loop isn't winding things back, but rather wiping and starting over.

**** 1. I agree that assets like mountains and such are probably not reused wholesale---seems to me like a lot of energy would have to go into rechecking fidelity to the original template. However, much of the energy can still be recycled if "destruction" means converting all matter to energy, then recondensing everything according to the original template pattern. This annihilation and repatterning is possibly what the monthly cost of the loop is referring to.
2. Simulations require operating power during the simulation. However, an actual copy only needs the initial energy investment. This is just another point of consistency with what the Guardian said.

** Any universe supporting magic has weird energy things going on. The body holds only a little bit of energy that can be used intentionally. This problem is often solved by the existence of souls. Souls are kind of like a mana battery in that case, allowing significantly more energy to be stored and refocused into spells.

For the universe, assuming similar physics and a roughly similar energy density, it would be a cool explanation if the universe itself had something analagous to a soul, and this soul stores energy from the multiverse. This would allow the universe, or sections of the universe essentially, to "cast spells" that might have the effect of creating loop-creating effects.

The real question becomes, how does an individual access the control functions of spacetime to make things like time loops occur?

** I actually think that the Maker /couldn't/ be a god. Or, if it is, it is a massively incompetent one.

This is due to the mechanism Zorian used to enter the loop. The fact that the entity in the Gate was massively confused that there could be multiple valid Controller markers means that the Maker must not have known anything about soul magic or Ikosians. The Maker was clearly massively incompetent or ignorant of what was possible with magic if it didn't take into account this possibility when it apparently ironed out most of the other bugs one might expect when programing something like this.

We don't know much about gods, but they are generally not the kinds of entities which would completely forget about an aspect of the universe they lived in when making a powerful artefact of ancient myth.

So here's another possibility: What if the Sovereign Gate is the /reason/ the Gods have vanished? What if they have been locked away by the mortal who created the Gate, their power siphoned off and used most efficiently when the realm they are imprisoned in is close, during the Planar Alignment?

** Okay, so it is, and nearly from the beginning it was, obvious that the author is heavily drawing on Time Braid. The question is of course how much.

I'd say that indeed yes, gods are the most likely suspects for creating this loop/simulation. I mean it's similar to the point where even Zach/Naruto both have fuzzy memories of how the loop started, and in both cases, it's more likely that Zorian/Sakura will figure it out how it's started. So the answer is most likely along the TB premise, where it's shenanigans of gods that enable such powerful magic to work. Or perhaps they're just really technologically advanced (even more so than in TB) and are capable of doing this through technology with some massive power source like a power plant near exploding supernova or some bullshit. (Nevermind the impossibilities i'm a tree (well only a branch really), I don't know half of the stuff usual humans do.)

Also in both cases, RR/Sasuke was removed from the loop. I think the real question we should be asking ourselves is who's Hinata. It's supposed to be someone shy but with some awesome powers.

Does the planar alignment usually coincides with that? Does it also appear every 400 years? Because if that's so, then they could, thanks to weakened borders between the planes simply siphon the energy from the positive energy plane. Otherwise nuclear fission is reasonable choice for gathering energy, ... With access to other planes you could easily dispose of all the nuclear waste too. Or you know some matter/antimatter thing from Star Trek.

Also, I wonder where do they store all that energy. Because if it's on the planet, then there's the issue of energy having to be reproduced in simulation. Ugh ...

The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World -- the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground.
