Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
#+end_quote

I've been wondering if rationality actually provided me with any benefits. A well-known criticism: if rationality is about winning, why aren't rationalists winning more? I certainly feel like I could be winning more. The limits of what is 'possible' seem to be far beyond what I am actually achieving.

Then I remembered some things. Since becoming a rationalist four years ago:

- I've lowered my BMI from 29 to 24.
- My salary has quadrupled.
- I have more free time than ever before.
- I overcame two (admittedly non-severe) addictions.
- My relationships with most of my family and friends have improved significantly.
- I am happier.
- I have become vegetarian.

Are these things that would have happened whether I became a rationalist or not?

Maybe rationality is like cloud seeding. We have reason to believe it works, but it is hard to know in a specific case whether it made a difference, and one shouldn't expect dramatic effects. I've been comparing my current situation to an idealized world, but perhaps that isn't a fair comparison. I /am/ winning, I've just started to take it for granted.

I still don't know how much to attribute to rationality. Whatever the case, I intend to continue improving my life and the lives of those around me. I've still got a more-perfect world in mind.

*** I feel like you somewhat touched on at least one of these two points, but still:

1) The question shouldn't be framed as "how successful a person practising rationality is compared to others", but "how successful a person practising rationality is compared to a version of the same person who /wouldn't/ be practising rationality." For some people developing "rationality"-adjacent attitudes and thought patterns can be the lifeline that allows them to function normally where they would not have been able to otherwise, for instance.

2) Practisng rationality doesn't have to be about "winning" either. Some examples: • It helps Alice avoid joining cults, avoid developing superstitions, spending money on charlatans and pseudo-science products, etc. • It helps Noel improve his everyday decision making. He ends up saving himself from a bunch of potential problems in fields of personal finance, personal physical and mental health, personal safety from various dangers and risks, etc. • It helps Marc build for himself a relationship that's free of needless drama, toxicity, etc. • It helps Nathan confront his own opinions and worldview, gradually adjusting them to more accurately represent the objective reality. • It helps Oliver better understand himself, his own motivations, values, etc.

Are these examples of definite and obvious instant successes in the person's life? Maybe not by themselves, but they both reduce the risks of lowering the quality of life and improve the chances of increasing it.

Promises of any more well-defined and obvious positive changes are usually what self-proclaimed gurus' literature merchandise dabbles in.

**** This. One book I really enjoyed was a math book called "How not to be Wrong", which sort of covers this except about mathematical literacy rather than rationality per se. Being decent at math isn't going to give you these brilliant insights in your everyday life that let you win the lottery or something dramatic, but you'll avoid simple scams like pyramid schemes or the lottery, and won't be fooled by statistical shenanigans, and the book provides a bunch of examples and explanations.

I expect rationality to be relatively similar, which is part of the whole thing about "less wrong". We can interpret that as having beliefs that are less wrong, but we can also interpret it as making decisions that are less wrong. It isn't always about making the perfectly optimal result and maximizing your utility, sometimes it's good enough to merely avoid a huge swath possible catastrophic failures instead of blindly wandering past and hoping they miss you.

**** There are very many specifics that went into each of those. I learned a lot to achieve them; if you want me to elaborate on any in particular, PM me.

In general, you need a willingness to try various things and fail repeatedly. I tried half a dozen weight-loss strategies. I applied to literally hundreds of jobs. I forgave myself for setbacks, whether they were my fault or not. Failing often is the price of success, and as much as possible I tried not to take failures personally.

The second thing, is acknowledging that I am not an isolated system. I look for solutions in environment, timing, or chemistry. A good night's sleep is more effective than any amount of willpower, for example, and a multivitamin makes vegetarianism much more reasonable (even if you could be nutritionally-balanced in theory). You can't eat junk food if you don't have junk food in your home. Basically, I looked for solutions outside of myself--I had more luck leveraging 'outside' forces in service of my goals. Or from another perspective, by putting myself in places where I could succeed.

Those things, like rationality itself, aren't silver bullets. The specifics of what you are trying to achieve matter quite a lot.

I also integrated the Sequences into my daily habits. I notice my behavior being affected by something I learned there about twice a day--but only because a few weeks ago I decided to try to deliberately notice. Before that I can only assume I was applying the lessons without reflection.

If I have to say that I learned anything from achieving those goals, is that I'll always want more. I'll never be content--but at least I can be content with that fact, hahah.

*** I'm of the opinion that rationality is like manually working out what most people know intuitively. And I think that most people who turn to rationality have a hard time figuring out things intuitively, and it's a good decision for us. Not everyone should embrace rationality practices, but most people who have have made the right decision.

**** I think I disagree.

You can certainly use rationality to cover ground that intuition normally flies over. I also agree that the people who need rationality most are more likely to turn toward it.

But I don't think that is all it is. You can use rationality to work out things that nobody knows intuitively, at all.

Also it's not like improving your rationalism makes your intuition weaker--if anything, they tend to reinforce each other. That's been my experience, anyway.

I only kinda disagree. What you said is true, but I think for people with strong intuition and weaker book learning skills not worth the effort. For the amount of time it'd take your average person to learn all the good rationality knowledge, they could instead have earned a bunch of money at their job or spent a lot of time at the gym getting healthier. There are opportunity costs to everything, and rationality isn't worth it for a lot of people.

I agree. If we substitute 'mathematics' for 'rationality', this discussion would look much the same, with the same exceptions for 'everyone needs math to a varying extent' and 'mathematics has uses beyond compensating for other weaknesses'. Heh, mathematicians also probably unnecessarily jump to the defense of their studies.

** I've made some progress towards learning Spanish this year. I have been using Duolingo for a while, which makes it fun, but recently I started listening to Spanish lectures (on physics) while playing games, social media, etc. to familiarize myself with the sounds of the language.

By turning the speed on the Youtube videos up, I've noticed that although there is some loss in comprehension, it makes it so that normal speed is easier to understand. I can also turn the speed down and deliberately focus, or turn on captions (in Spanish) to get a supply of words to plug into Google Translate to expand my vocabulary. The high speed version is actually easier to multitask with other activities because my conscious mind can't get caught up in what is being said, making it seem like background noise (although it does get in my head as part of the background chatter).

I have basically been treating my life as an RPG this year. I'm not sure it makes self improvement occur any faster, but it does help me stay on task and make it feel more like a fun project as opposed to a criticism of myself. I can imagine getting a +1 to INT when I think of something clever, or +1 WIS when I avoid a disastrous course of action. The WIS stat makes it a bit less scary to try new things with my life, since you can only get gains to WIS when you have a chance of messing up to begin with, and it tends to confer the ability to reduce risks. CHA also levels up in complex social situations, and makes you better able to handle those.

It also helps me build a skill tree. I don't have a consciously formed full list of skills, but when I do build a skill I think of it as having levels (what level, I'm not sure). Beyond INT itself, I've tried to build some skills for accelerated learning. Memorization, speed reading, and multitasked learning (which I call multigrinding). When I fail at using one of these, I tend to think of it more in terms of needing to level it up more rather than it not being possible for me. Hence the attempt to listen to physics in spanish despite not understanding much of it. When I do understand a bit of it, I feel a sense of reward in that I'm probably leveling up those skills.

*** Have you tried using any of the life rpg apps? I've recently seen doitnow (android) recommended, I'm curious but haven't tried it.

Although I think gamifying life could be useful, I think rolling your own system (whether pen and paper or something you code up) might be better than using the existing apps, allows you to modify the system so it fits you better.

** So. New Year is coming. Time for fireworks, drinking, and of course- resolutions.

I feel the most rational resolution to make for me is to simply focus and cut away a bunch of online clutter from my life. Which includes this subreddit, frankly. Not that it's bad- I just don't feel my life right now needs it.

Been wondering about stories and their value for a long time, now. Stories as memetic containers, stories as fake experiences, stories as another type of art. I still don't have any concrete conclusions, at least not enough to speak about them at length, but I feel I don't really get much value out of stories anymore:

For one, I stopped feeling anything from reading them a while ago. Probably overexposure and lack of focus on the content? I know I dunno.\\
What's more, I... well, I stopped writing stories for a long time, too. And that was one of the most certain ways to think about writing in depth. And what's the point of looking at gardening magazines if you don't even have a single fern in your house?\\
This issue extends to engaging specific stories- too little attention to talk about them in depth, or connection to share my reactions with others. It's come and go for pretty much everything.\\
Also, I just have studies to attend to, irl. And while I do want to use stories to enchance my learning, I don't have enough of a grip to make this little dream a reality.

So, in short, I am leaving this subreddit. Not forever, and you probably don't care about a random half-lurker saying this. Still, I feel this needs to be said. Mostly for me, to clarify my thoughts.

Happy New Year and successful resolutions to you all!

**** I honestly didn't think of it at the time. I mean, it's /there/, certainly. Main reason I still kept coming back.

But, as I said with feelings, there isn't much connection. There's little satisfaction, relief or excitement to be felt. And that means little enjoyment.

**** Yeah? Plenty of obvious things I /should/ spend my time on:

- There is the tidal wave of finals I have to survive, and college education in general.
- There's fundamental bodily maintenance of exercise and sleep I need to get to proper levels.
- As far as non-work reading goes, I have a number of relatively light non-fiction books I basically ignored.
- Also any and all social activity. Internet is not a good place to foster meaningful connections, especially for me.

And that's for the things that come to mind without thinking too much. If I get inspired, I can always start writing too.

** My shit is never really together haha, but I've been using trello to keep track of a lot of the things I'm giving my attention to (personal projects, courses/books I'm studying, etc). A lot of the stuff I do is self directed (even the place I volunteer doesn't have managers so the projects there are self directed too) so it helps to have it all written down somewhere.

I then use trello as a kind of menu to make a to do list for the day - usually just on pen and paper. I see what projects/courses are active and pick tasks for them to do (either based on priority or what I feel like doing that day)
