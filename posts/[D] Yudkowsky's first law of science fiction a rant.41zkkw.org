(*first law of fanfiction. Damn reddit's un-editable titles.)

(This thread contains vague, high-level spoilers for a bunch of rationalfics - which I can't warn you about because just naming them in context is the spoiler. I don't think it'll bother most people, but if you're a purist, stop reading.)

Pattern:

1. Add a smart character to an existing setting, often with bonus skills / information / magic.
2. They bulldoze through the setting's various problems, perhaps kickstarting a scientific / economical revolution along the way. This is a fun read, because it's pure wish-fulfillment sugar with munchkin flavouring. So I start to really enjoy the fic.
3. The author probably never had a long-term plan, but since everyone is showering them with praise they just keep going by following the logical consequences of early chapters. Having overcome the setting's primary adversity in the early chapters, the protagonist's successes naturally tend to snowball.
4. Eventually the author realizes that they need an opposition of some kind. It's too late though. At this point, any new threat they can coax out of canon is either underpowered or a diabolus ex machina, or both.
5. I stop reading or hit the in-progress mark, and realize I've stopped having fun a while ago now.

This has happened to me repeatedly with fics recommended in this sub.

(Even naming a work here is a spoiler; the vague, high-level kind that I think most people are okay with, but I'm tagging them just in case.)

- Some continuations / forks of HPMOR (possibly because it's really hard to write Yudkowsky-style villains, who act in the background and wield unknown powers but are still fair on some level)

- So many of the Worm fanfics I've tried (admittedly not all recommended here; still, OF ALL SETTINGS, Worm should be the one where authors have the LEAST trouble finding challenges their upgraded protagonist)

#+begin_quote
  If you do anything to increase the protagonist's power, or make their life easier, you must also amplify their opponent or add extra difficulties to their life. *You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star.*
#+end_quote

As an alternative, consider putting Jedi Frodo in a wheelchair. I would enjoy crossover-possessions, alternate universes and self-inserts a lot more if the protagonist didn't end up with a brand-new set of skills IN ADDITION TO all the skills of the original.

(It's often the skills the original had by the end of canon, too; Worm!Taylor spent traumatic /months/ developing some of the abilities the average Worm fanfic /starts/ her with.)

Or hey, you can ignore all that and just write wish-fulfillment. I will read it with pleasure. But then please /end/ your story on step 2.

Just needed to get this off my chest.


** I'll admit I personally prefer the stories where a rationalist character powers through, sneakily defeats, or completely bypasses various canon problems, but then runs smack into other problems (canon or derived) which cause them genuine issues. Particularly if they've started feeling a bit smug about how smart/informed/capable they are.

And it kind of makes sense. Any protagonist who keeps pushing their boundaries will run into a lot more situations, events, opponents, and so on than one who lives life in the background. And the more things that a protagonist encounters, the greater the chance that one or more of them will be something they can't handle - and the effect will be worse because the speed at which they were moving will generally mean that they haven't had time to build up networks, secondary defenses, and fallback positions.

Why do you say that? (Honest question, not snarky.) The details of the magic system are never really clearly laid out, true. Still, Wiz's actions are driven by his values and are reasonable based on who he is and what he knows at any given point. Better, his magic isn't "and then I needed a thing so I took five minutes to do it" -- he has to spend considerable time prepping his spells ahead of time, and he loses most of his most significant battles. ("Loses" as in "needs to be saved by an ally", I mean.)

In the first book the factions are good and evil, but after that it's more realistically grey.

** Yes, the same thing was with [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/threadmarks][/Blood and Chaos/]] --- the author had to both restrict his own character's originality and (at least partially) refocus the story from physical confrontations and powers required for them to inter-character relations.

I think not introducing an enemy of equal power could still work in at least two cases though.

- 1, if the protagonist [[https://medium.com/life-learning/your-life-is-tetris-stop-playing-it-like-chess-4baac6b2750d#.ro4ibyo6f][didn't think in terms of enemies\bosses to beat]] but rather in terms of “fixing” the whole universe to their likening. Difficulties:

  - if the story started as an action \ adventure, it would abruptly change its genre (strategy \ history \ infrastructure management) losing many readers in the process;
  - even if did start with warnings about the incoming genre shift, it still wouldn't be interesting for as wide an audience as a general action \ adventure story is;
  - it would be hard to write a high-quality story in this direction: one would have to be well educated in history, political and social sciences, economics, etc.

- 2, using an analogy with video games, the author could be describing his character's actions in an open sandbox world where the main plotline has already been completed. Often you want to know what happened with the hero after the main plot line is finished and they are at the peak of their power --- but for writers, the sensible thing to do is to finish the story right at this point. So you usually end up with either no continuation at all or with a sequel that starts right off with introduction of another [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad][big bad.]] In case of videogames, however, players will often return to an already “finished” RPG ([[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page][TES,]] [[http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][GTA,]] etc) to just spend some time there as a form of /casual/ entertainment. What eventually dims the interest in this case is depletion of original content in the game (e.g. side quests) and getting bored by the game engine's capabilities. Both these problems are solvable when an imaginative writer is writing a /story/, so I think an OPed protag could keep going from one original “side quest”\plot arc to another --- if the story was intended as a pulp fiction from the start.

I mean sure, lots of standard issue psychological torture but till now there hasn't even been any hope suddenly janked away from under her. No forcing her between the lives of a random innocent or that of her father. No Tattletale dying to a tragic freak "accident" or being forced by Coil to betray her. No finally getting free from Coil just to find her father already dead.

Sure, all those things may well still be coming but those comments about the story being unreadable really confuses me seeing how the original Worm not only had much bleaker moments but also had much more of a ramp up while this story starts kinda fucked up and then pretty much keeps the expected level without ever becoming worse.

I agree. The pattern still happened though.

The payoff of industrial revolution porn happens at the very beginning (when the time traveller is all "look at this cool idea!" and everyone else goes "oh my god this is the best thing ever") and again years or decades down the line (when all the cool ideas finally become widespread reality). I really enjoy this genre. But like many others, ASOIAFTWAMF makes the mistake of sticking to an almost day-to-day pace rather than jumping ahead. So it starts awesome and then gradually degrades.

And the author probably realizes this on some level, so to keep us entertained they tried to add in threats. But because the protagonist is a millionaire demigod gadgeteer (with [[#s][]]) in a low-fantasy setting, and because there's no buildup (since the author started out writing a peaceful slice-of-life story with no antagonist), it falls flat.

The pattern has already happened. Maybe it'll get better in the future, sure. But from where I stand, on chapter 1.16, it has fully entered the "[[#s][]]" phase.

Compare e.g. /The Two Year Emperor/. Fairly similar setup, fairly similar snowballing start, but the threats escalate /even faster/, so the protagonist remains on the brink of disaster for the entire story. And when he [[#s][]]

** I agree with almost all your points, save for the inclusion of Inviolate.

While several fics in DC have done the twist that Inviolate did, when you find out the real antagonists involved they are certainly still a significant threat to the main character, despite his optimization. I don't agree that it hits stage 4, excepting maybe the epilogue, which I'm glad ended the story there - any continuation from that point could have been bad.

Similarly, it's hard to justify stage 4 on Oh God am I the Mannis Now - the SI is in a setting with provable supernatural elements which hard trump any non-supernatural foes with no or little counter to them and no access to supernatural strength himself. He's also a lot more realistic in the sense of not remembering all of the minutiae of modern technology to be able to perfectly recreate it at will.

Trying to write my own SI story however, I can understand the problems. I tried to solve it by choosing a main setting which is basically impossible to directly overpower because the existing foes and threats in the setting are Worm level of dangerous and less concerned about stealth or collateral.

I also eliminate all my SI's knowledge of the setting until a significant point in the story - they have to optimize from their modern perspective but without meta-knowledge.

Also important is creating a specific storyboard early on to figure out where the story is going, and how it's going to get there. I'm still working on that, but I've got the major events planned out in such a way that those familiar with the setting shouldn't consider anything as Deus Ex Machina.

I'm considering adding in a canon plot device to help with avoiding that issue by providing a reason for what are effectively cutscenes of some of the opposition.

Things get moved around, reorganized, or changed in wording.

Having read an obscene amount of fiction, I've gotten to the point where I can instinctively tell what turns of phrase are good and evoke relevant imagery and which ones are jarring and remove you from the scene. An improperly worded sentence or description can be worse for immersion in a story than a nonsense plot point or even a blatant misspelling.

********** It's a concept that I propose to name the Gygaxian Paradox: you do not gain XP unless you deserve it. The universe's algorithm for determining whether or not you deserve XP, is based on the /difficulty/ of what you did. A life without suffering and conflict has a cap on its difficulty. Maybe you could challenge yourself intellectually, eg by playing games and /pretending/ to experience events which are difficulties from the point of view of your characters, however, unless the /stakes really matter to you/, you are (tautologically) not overcoming sufficiently difficult problems.

You are both author /and character/ within your own life. From the point of view of Theon Greyjoy, his suffering is terrible. From the point of view of George RR Martin, Theon's suffering is a necessary part of the story. This doesn't mean that George /hates/ Theon, or even that he doesn't /love/ Theon; it means that George has larger, and different, concerns than Theon's "right" (which only he and other people in the story think he has, George RR Martin certainly doesn't) to live free from suffering.

This is the insight that moved me from atheist to syncretic pantheist. The world is a story. "God", the author, the DM, the Ultimate Oversoul, may cause us to suffer /and/ still love us, /and/ also have the "right" to do so, because we are each a part of God, and we are doing it to ourself. We suffer because only /in suffering/ may we have the opportunity to overcome suffering; not just our own suffering (self-actualization) but the suffering of others (Good-aligned behaviour).

The child in the cancer ward, the pig in the factory farm, the Jew in Auschwitz, the people in the queue behind that stupid woman arguing with the post office clerk, the failed gambler, the sex-deprived friendzoned ratheist neckbeard, all may curse God and all may do so justly. And yet God loves them all. Their suffering creates the opportunity to not suffer. If not for themselves, for others.

(As a side effect, this manner of thinking helps depression a /lot/. We thank thee, oh great DM, for these monsters which we have randomly encountered, for only by defeating them may we gain XP and treasure. Amen, and roll for initiative.)

*********** While I agree partially, I mainly take issue with the idea that suffering is what makes life worthwhile. Yes, perhaps without "righteous suffering", we may not be able to develop a sense of empathy, but I disagree that we may not be fully content. Not everyone enjoys fighting monsters to gain XP; some may like exploring and learning about the world. Some may even like being the DM. All of those options are valid, including the original PC who just wants hard monster battles.

My gripe with the story was that the author tried to pass off a programming oversight as an insight into life. The AI that underwent Singularity in the story was bound by Asimov's three laws (which was fucking stupid, but that's another topic). Due to that, it couldn't allow any humans in it's charge to come to harm, preventing death by old age and even suicide. This scenario is not optimal, and is not the post-scarcity many of us are looking for.

To me, the most important thing in life is /choice/. Just as you can be given the option to work hard and struggle for all the things you want, I want the option to communicate, to speak with familiar and exotic minds without the need to worry about anything material. Both of us will be given the option to die, if we choose it, and the option to "harm" ourselves in any which way we choose (that won't take away the choice from someone else). That is what I want in my vision of a post-scarcity utopia. The one in Prime Intellect was not a utopia but a dystopia, ruled by a shackled God.

One of my favourite quotes on the subject, from "Harry Potter and the Natural 20":

#+begin_quote
  Steadying himself with deep, calming breaths, Milo forced his eyes to stare directly at the polished silver surface.

  The universe unveiled itself in front of him, and, while, conceptually at least, Milo knew from Wizards experimenting with Divinations and Greater Teleport that the distance between stars was inconceivably far and that the distance between galaxies made even that colossal distance seem completely negligible, Milo could see, clearly, pinpoints of light unfolding before him in numbers so large that they didn't have names. Many of those stars had planets, and many of those planets had moons, and a rare few of those planets and moons had life. Milo saw stout, bearded dwarves bustling about in their mines and forges, not knowing that with every greedy swing of their pick they unwittingly brought themselves one step closer to their own inexorable demise as they approached the horrors which lay beneath their underground cities. Milo saw proud elves, comfortable in the fact that they'd been toying with the very fabric of the universe and living in shining cities and soaring towers while the lesser races had yet to discover fire; blind, in their arrogance, to their ever-waning power, numbers, and relevance to the world outside of their sequestered paradises. Milo saw humans beyond number, living their lives, tilling soil, and always expanding outwards, propelled by their adventurous spirit and search for excitement, not knowing what was in store for them when they found there nowhere else to discover. Milo saw ankhegs, centaurs, chimera, dragons, gnomes, halflings, half-elves, aquatic elves, wood elves, dark elves, high elves, gray elves, wild elves, wood elves, orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, half-orcs, magmin, barghests, blink dogs, dinosaurs, dire animals, ghosts, ghouls, ogres, oozes, mephits, medusae, merfolk, sahuagin, sprites, lamias, wyverns, will-o-wisps, and wraiths. Milo saw the entirety of the Prime Material as if he were examining every object, creature, and wisp of smoke with intense scrutiny. Milo saw the Great Wheel of the Outer Planes, the sixteen infinitely large planes of Celestia, Bytopia, Elysium, the Beastlands, Arborea, Ysgard, Limbo, Pandemonium, the Abyss, Carceri, Hades, Gehenna, Baator, Acheron, Mechanus, and Arcadia arranged clockwise around the barren Outlands, which, from its heart, rose the impossibly tall Spire, ringed at its peak by Sigil, The City of Doors. Milo saw the Lower Planes ripped apart by the never ending Blood War and the uncaring laughter of their thirsting gods. Milo saw the Inner Planes of Air, Fire, Earth, Water, and Positive and Negative energy from which the Multiverse itself was made. Milo saw the Astral, Ethereal, Shadow, and elusive Mirror Transitive planes, and the madness of the Far Realm. Milo saw the Multiverse in its entirety, and it was all his.

  Milo saw himself, with an infinitely high level in every Class and Prestige Class, with every feat worth taking and a good many that aren't, with infinite ranks in infinite skills, with infinite ability scores and infinite ability modifiers, with infinite hit points, with infinite spells per day and every spell known, lounging on what, at first glance, appeared to be an intricately carved throne of every precious metal, expensive special material, and gemstone Milo had ever heard of (and several others, as well) but upon closer inspection were, in fact, Epic Magic Items and Artifacts. Milo saw a backrest composed of dozens of Staffs of the Magi sitting on piles of Rings of Universal Energy Immunity and Bracers of Relentless Might. One armrest was simply the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords while the other appeared to be the great battleaxe of Heironeous Himself, sitting on a pile of the six weapons of his archenemy, Hextor. Milo, the most powerful character conceivable, lounged on his terrible throne, staring at His gauntleted hand (in some detached part of his brain, Milo realized it was nothing less than the Iron Gauntlet of War), an expression of detached ennui on his blank face. In his other hand, he idly spun the Gold Dragon Orb around his fingers, one of the most powerful artifacts in creation reduced to a mere stress ball. Who has any need of an Orb of Dragonkind, even the most powerful one, when Milo could simply rewrite reality to create a breed of better dragons, forced to bow to his every will?

  Milo had no enemies, for they had all long since been defeated. He had no adventures to undertake, for there were none of an appropriate Encounter Level. He had no friends, for he needed none. He had no dungeons to raid, for he had the Multiverse in his inventory. He had no familiar, for they could be traded for more powerful alternate class features. He had no partymembers, because in the impossible event that he would need allies, what could be more powerful than Simulacra of himself?

  The Milo in the mirror had everything he'd ever wanted, everything he'd ever seen, everything he'd ever heard of, everything he'd ever only conceived of.

  Milo ---the real Milo --- wasn't sure when he'd started screaming. He felt hands (the detached part of his brain that kept noticing minute details even in impossible situations noted that it must have been Ron and Harry, not that the rest of him cared) struggling to pull him away from the mirror, but even as they dragged him away from it he couldn't summon the willpower to tear his eyes from the horrible visage. Eventually, one of them wrapped the Cloak of Invisibility around the artifact, and the visions stopped --- but the memories remained.

  "What the bloody hell was that?" Ron asked, his face pale and bloodless.

  "I... I saw everything," Milo said weakly. He tasted blood in his mouth, he must have bit his tongue at some point. "And ... and it was mine. I had everything ... everything except a reason to..." he trailed off, his brain still not fully functioning.

  "Reason to what, mate?" Ron asked nervously in an odd, falsely cheerful voice.

  "Anything," Milo said. "No reason to anything."

Barring anything that would kill them or make them kill themselves, any intelligent being would rise in power until they can sit upon a throne of Gods. Give a mind infinity, and it either kill itself or become a God.

Would that create ennui? Perhaps.

But the being that sits upon such a throne would be far wiser, far more intelligent and experienced than me, for me to foolishly declare them as bereft of existence. An ant may as well decry the same to me, asking what purpose my life serves if I don't need to fight for food and shelter, what purpose or goal I could have if all my needs were met. I would simply look at it, smile, and go back to watching cat videos, an activity that the ant would be hard pressed to understand (and would probably drive it insane trying to).

There was this interesting short story I read once on this subreddit (search for Lotus Thrones), where it talked about the endstate of a Singularity, namely a gestalted being that has run the simulations for every variation of the universe and thus has nothing left to discover. The author said that therefore a worthwhile end goal would be for it to enter meditation, to contemplate itself and it's body/home/universe in all it's wonder.

Personally, I found that rather boring and self-incapacitating. I would try to break free from the universe, either through a black hole or some other anomaly, whereby I could experience another universe in all it's forms and features.

Eventually, I may leave that multiverse cluster and head to a different one, where the laws of physics differed; or I may create my own. One that contained infinity in it's purest form and thus would never run out of things for me to do.

The problem with the quote is that it makes the assumption that absence of challenge is /possible/; it presupposes that there /is/ an end to what can be learned. I would like to see some evidence for the truth of that statement, because I very much doubt it to be the case.

Over the last few hundred years, humanity has reduced or eliminated many enormous challenges that have existed throughout history. Compared to someone from the Middle Ages or the Stone Age we have plenty of food, plenty of medicine, and we need to do less work. That doesn't mean that life has become boring; we have invented new fields of study, new means of entertainment, and new professions. In the 1700s it may have been possible to have a reasonable understanding of a major subset of the world's knowledge -- to speak the most important languages and have a solid if not perfect understanding of all that science then knew. That isn't even remotely possible today, as there simply aren't enough hours in the day. There's no reason to think that's going to change any time soon, either.

It might, of course. Perhaps ten years from now we'll all have a DNI and enhanced neural architectures that permit transferring memories, experiences, and comprehension directly from one brain to another. Then I could download the mathematical knowledge of Stephen Hawking, the guitar skills of Carlos Santana, and the X of Y for every X.

Perhaps.

It's unlikely to happen anytime soon. By the time it does happen I expect we'll either be in the middle of the Singularity or out the other side, at which point there is no point in discussing what life will be like.

Short version: you contend that we are going to become omniscient gods and suffer from boredom and ennui? Prove it. Or, at the very least, show some evidence. Right now you are arguing from assertion; I do not agree with your assertion, and I suspect that a significant number of other people would not either.

  Maybe you could challenge yourself intellectually, eg by playing games and pretending to experience events which are difficulties from the point of view of your characters, however, unless the stakes really matter to you, you are (tautologically) not overcoming sufficiently difficult problems.

It is true that learning happens fastest on the margin -- I learn a song faster on my harp when I push myself to play as fast as possible, because then my fingers/brain need to work hard to catch up. It is not true, however, that learning happens /only/ on the margin. I can improve slowly while doing low-challenge exercises. More importantly, it's a truism that teaching someone else will help your own understanding; that's because it forces you to go back and re-examine things that are simple and un-challenging for you, and to see them in new ways based on greater understanding.

That would pretty much put a nail in your argument, though. If you change your argument to be that I can only "gain XP" by experiencing challenge, then you still need to provide evidence that there is an end to the available challenges. And that's leaving aside the question of evidence for:

- any meaningful way in which 'XP' applies to reality;
- the existence of this 'Oversoul';
- the idea that the Oversoul makes decisions related to XP awards; and,
- the idea that reality and narrative have any sort of real link.

It is objectively determinable, and more than that, it is /ridiculously false./ Narratives are invented /post facto/ of reality, incapable of affecting its nature, and are not selected for explaining reality accurately, but for exploiting human psychology for the propagation of its constituent ideas.

  #+end_quote

  It's blatantly obvious. If ants were biting you, wouldn't you move?
#+end_quote

The situation you are describing /does not distinguish/ between valuing not suffering and valuing overcoming suffering. Here is my counter-argument. Assuming you would move if ants are biting you (there are some weird fetishes), /would you go and lay in the anthill so that you can get back up again in order to overcome it?/ That is the difference. Are you preventing suffering in order to not suffer, or are you causing suffering in order to overcome suffering?

I think we are using different definitions of suffering. I consider suffering to be disutility, the reason a choice would not be taken. Consensual suffering does not exist without perverse meta-utility functions or perverse scenarios. Choosing to be tortured for 50 years in order to prevent 3-up-up-up-3 specks-in-the-eye (I would perhaps choose to be tortured 50 years to prevent 3-up-up-up-3 people from simply being created) is not choosing to suffer, it's taking a bite out of the shit sandwich so the shit sandwich doesn't grow to truly abominable levels. It is minimizing suffering, though to an extent that involves System 2's values superseding System 1's.

What do you mean by 'suffering' here? I consider it to be entirely disparate from 'challenge.' Challenge is probably necessary to sustain fun in the way I want to have it. Suffering is my enemy and must be destroyed, though consent interacts with it in strange ways I haven't distinguished yet.

When you say its symptoms cannot be described, do you mean it causes indescribable suffering or that it has no symptoms? When you ask if I would prefer a cure to ipsischacthuritis, is that assuming that it does exist? I would not prefer a cure to a disease that does not exist until it starts existing and causes more suffering than leukemia. If you are making me choose between a cure for leukemia and /preventing/ ipsischacthuritis from existing and causing more suffering than leukemia, then I would prevent ipsischacthuritis.

I think this example is either disingenuous or reveals a misunderstanding, which is possibly mutual. Please address my anthill example above.

The problem with this argument is that it's self-defeating. You don't understand how the world truly works -- which is unsurprising, since no one does -- but, instead of challenging yourself to find the answer, you are simply asserting that there is an Oversoul who is responsible for deciding what's important.

You are giving up agency on the very foundational questions of reality: What /is/? How does the universe work at the deepest level? What matters? Why choose one action over another?

***** Mobile web is still in beta.

Spoiler tags are implemented through custom CSS, because reddit doesn't have sitewide spoiler functionality. The mobile site doesn't load the custom CSS, so it breaks all subreddit-level spoiler functionality.

If you have an app, most of them don't load in custom CSS either, but they have special static rules that allow spoiler tags in the most common formats like ours, which is =[text](#s "spoiler text")=. I know this is how redditisfun does it and I assume that's how other apps do it as well.

According to [[/u/akahotcheetos]], this is a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/mobileweb/comments/39nv1r/support_for_spoiler_tags/cs7awsb]["high priority"]] but that was seven months ago. There are still apparently people working on the mobile site, since admins like [[/u/schwers]] and [[/u/nr4madas]] still post in [[/r/mobileweb]], but they haven't fixed something that breaks basic functionality for discussion and requires a ten line change to their CSS without any redeployment, something that's already implemented by all their mobile competitors.

So yes, I think it's fair to see this as just giving you the finger. Unfortunately, there's no much that we can do on our end.

The problem with all of these fanfics is that they take a standard story where everything revolves around the hero, then give the hero rationality but /still let the entire world revolve around them/. Sauron does not need a deathstar to kill frodo. Frodo just needs to be able to die to a stray goblin arrow.

Heck, even Hpmor has this problem. Harry comes into Hogwarts and not only does he start out with a ridiculous amount of scientific knowledge right off the bat, but ALSO everyone loves him and he is super rich without having to do anything for it, and everything he does is awesome for some reason. He'd come across as much less of a Mary sue if the rest of the world didn't see him as the main character.

edit: one of the very few examples of a fanfic that does this right is The waves Arisen. No matter how powerful the main character becomes, he still feels vulnerable because the rest of the world treats him like fodder.

Because you expect to enjoy yourself again later into the book, enough so that the boring parts are worth slogging through. Even my favourite books are not thrill rides 100% of the time, they just don't have the downward trend of unplanned fiction. Often the biggest payoff is near the end, even.

** I'd say i definitely agree with the general point, and would add "The Waves Arisen" to the list if you ever think of trying it.

I also agree in regards to time braid, and I think its interesting to point that one of the interesting things that work for time braid in my opinion is that that it skirts some of the issue simply by having one of central most powerful characters offscreen half the time.

I of course think the way it built sakura up was really well done, but in my opinion if the story was instead on naruto it would have felt too OP. but by not having naruto as the MC it gets to sort of "eat the pie and have it" if you will.

******** Did we ever get an answer on where all the extra water came from, and why it didn't disrupt the ecosphere? I thought I remembered that it was supposed to have been the result of over-used suiton jutsu, but that seems implausible given how much water is involved.

********* It was heavily implied that the extra water was from over-used suiton jutsu. It was also implied that society was once much larger than what was presented to us in the fic, and kind of destroyed itself as a result of the water having nowhere else to go. There are a few off screen holes in that theory, in my personal opinion, but I let it slide. Although I found it hard to emotionally connect with "wanting to get rid of some of the water" as an overarching goal of his.

EDIT: Based on some other, less blatant hints and speculation, I concluded that the pre-existing society's over-use of suiton jutsu most likely wasn't so much of the "ninjas spit water" variety, as of the "large chakra-to-water spawning machines go nuts" variety.

********** There is no way that any believable number of ninja produced that much water, and why in the world would they create chakra-to-water machines? Where would they get enough chakra to power such a thing for the amount of water that would be necessary?

The thing that puzzles me is that it's a major part of the setting -- Wertiflowke went to the trouble of finding a map of the Tibetan Plateau and then modifying it to show the drownage. Despite that, it never had any actual impact on the story.

No. Fucking. Clue.

I just reached that conclusion because:

1. No way some guys spitting water filled up the world.

2. Chakra to water seems to be the method in which this happened. There's no other water spawning showcased in Waves Arisen.

It's right around that time I finally integrated the "you /can/ just stop reading, you dummy!" rule. (I do wish that had happened /before/ I encountered /Adventures in Effulgence/.)

But IIRC I dropped it because of a combination of poor pacing and unmet expectations (when a rationalist enters a superhero world, I kind of expect more than slice-of-life intersped with bog-standard superheroing to ensue; or at least I want better written slice-of-life). I agree it doesn't fit the pattern in the OP, which is why it's not on the list.

I've said as much in the thread multiple times.

Zoat just put all that out the window. The latest arc is Renegade-focused, and I think it's my favorite of the entire story so far.

** What isn't often considered in these stories that a rational individual won't always succeed even if they behave perfectly rationally throughout the entire story. Actually, in some setting, they will still be more likely to fail. You can't think you're way out of everything. Born during the black plague? Maybe you have a higher chance of survival, but you're not going to recreate all scientific knowledge since then. You still have a good chance of dying. Maybe you can attempt to escape to an unpopulated area, but can you get there in time?

Are you an illiterate farmer in a poverty stricken region l? You may eventually succeed, but there is no garuntee. Disease, famine, loyalty to family, and natural disasters could all easily stop you.

Even in a modern setting you can't always prevent a car crash. A rational character isn't a perfect one. They also should still make mistakes unless they are somehow omniscient.

Once you introduce magic it becomes more difficult, but assuming the power has obvious limitations that need to be worked around (not just unlocked by figuring out one key fact), you should still be able to have an interesting story.

Also, a rational character may learn faster, but they don't learn instantaneously. Someone experienced could still have the upper hand.

Anything else you've noticed along these lines? Ways to create difficulty for a rational character in a magical setting without giving them an equally intilligent antagonist (which is definitely a viable option, but I'm curious to see what else there is)?

On the other hand I've read plenty of awful Mary Sue fanfiction and it may just be wishful thinking. Something about this one makes me think he may be planning something different.
