** Oh shit, we're on our way to New York. We are officially entering the endgame. This very, very bad, considering the present circumstances.

The title alludes to the quote "Blood runs thicker than water", but my first thought was of /Fray/. We haven't seen her in a while, and this is the worst possible time for Sy's nemesis to appear, which makes it a virtual certainty.

** I'm at arc 9.

And I abbandoned it cause real life kept me away from reading.

Does the story gets better from 9 to 14?

*** Yeah. Twig just keeps getting better. If you liked it before, the only reason not to catch up is to try to read it all at once.

This question is vaguely offensive, not because you're saying that you believed the story was bad, but because you are implying that everyone must have the exact same tastes as you, so that everyone must know exactly how bad you felt the story was (without you explaining why you felt it to be bad) and so they can respond whether it improved according to /your/ tastes, which you haven't actually explained.

Perhaps you should indicate what parts of Twig you like, and which parts you don't, so that people can give a better response whether you're likely to consider it improved according to our understanding of your tastes.

EDIT: That having been said, I loved arc 13 the most out of the whole Twig, and probably better than any arc in Worm too.
