This is a companion thread for the Secret Krampus Contest.

Since the top level comments are prompts or stories in the other threads, this is the thread to go to for anyone who wants to discuss the contest itself or complain about the raving nutjob who set everything up.

Let me know if there's anything you think I could have done better or different in case I choose to run something similar again in the future.

Please do! I haven't read all the submissions yet, but my feeling is already that this was extremely worth it.

** How about an official Author's Notes thread to go with the eventual Results thread on the 14th?

- world-building notes on things we didn't explicitly put into the story
- things we'd do differently or revise
- prequel or sequel ideas
- the story's rationality focus and how much it affected the story

*** I like this idea. It also sounds like a good place for readers' followup questions and critique. Not that we can't already do that in the voting thread, but replies to the story comments don't automatically ping the author, whereas a reply to an author's note would.

** Hm. I like the idea of posting stories without posting their authors, but it's logistically hard if every author is providing their own link to the story hosted at a location of their choosing. I'm using a personal website, but even a Google Doc is attributable. The only alternative would be to have the contest-runner post each story to a standardized site.

Why'm I thinking about this? It would divorce the story from the story-author, so that authors with established fandoms or authors with no fandoms would be able to have their stories considered on the merits of the story, rather than the author's reputation.

With the current setup, it may be better to spoiler-tag author names, or to make the link to the story the top thing in each comment on the story-voting thread.

*** Pastebin would work for stories without any formatting; anonymity is actually one of the purposes of the site. For those of us with accounts, you could post it while logged out or in an InPrivate/Incognito window.

** aside from the stories themselves, one of the fascinating things about this even was the sheer variety in how people decided to upload their stories. It almost felt like people were trying to outdo each other in obscurity.

You had the standard google docs and AO3 links, but then some personal blogs hosted on wordpress, github, a seriously retro webring blog, a pdf filehost... I couldn't help but be reminded of [[https://xkcd.com/927/][xkcd's comic about standards.]]

** Am I the only one who's confused about how to vote?

Is it supposed to be like a regular Reddit thread, only no downvoting? Usually with these sorts of things, you only get to vote for one story.

*** Yeah. You can vote for as many stories as you want. But there's no downvoting allowed.

In general, this kind of voting system is called approval voting if you want to learn more about it.

**** Ah. Might make that clearer next time for Dumbos like me. I kept looking for a link or something to go and vote.

Does Reddit have a tool to disallow downvotes? If not, maybe setup a strawpoll (where you can't see the results of the until you vote). Incidentally if Reddit does have that feature, I sure wish more subs would use it -- I think downvotes suck.

***** There's a way for mods to disable downvotes across an entire sub, although that can be bypassed by unchecking "use subreddit style," so it's not a perfect tool.

**** Before the thread went into contest mode, I could see stories being downvoted. (Which I thought was needlessly unkind.) I don't know if it's because people didn't know that rule or because they didn't care, but it might help to edit these rules into the contest post. I assume they're the same rules that used to be used for the biweekly contests, but people who didn't participate in those or who came to the sub after they ended won't know them.
