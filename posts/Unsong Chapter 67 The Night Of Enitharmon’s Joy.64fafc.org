  Something opened in Ana's mind. New memories. Knowledge she shouldn't have. A deep loss.

Given that the knowledge clearly came from kabbalistic marriage to Erica, this seems to imply that Erica is dead? I can't see what else "a deep loss" could mean, but it also seems very odd for Erica to be dead, given that her last on screen moment was a moment of victory

**** The information Ana received was that Malia is Thamiel's daughter and that Mark's opal amulet bears her blood. We don't have a reason to think that Sohu knows Malia's true parentage, and Sohu didn't arrive at the dress rehearsal until after Dylan revealed that he intended to give everyone amulets bearing Malia's blood.

However, we saw Erica learn both of those critical pieces of information. It's also implied that Ana would be crying if she had time for it, which suggests that she's feeling a personal loss, not Sohu's loss by proxy.

Given all of this, I think it makes the most sense to conclude that Ana got the information from Erica and that Erica is, in fact, dead. This is consistent with Erica stabbing Malia "as the flames closed in around them." Her victory was framed as a self-sacrificial one.

Strength beyond her own, terrible cunning, wild rebellion. Whose are these? I'd suspect Sohu for Strength and Dylan for Cunning (Erica for Rebellion?) but Dylan's dead.

  “No buts. If you can fathom the mind of the Comet King, you can talk to him as an equal. Until then...”

  ...

  “Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a fishhook?” asked Ana, that night at the dinner table. “Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? Canst thou put a hook into his nose? Or bore his jaw through with a thorn?”

  ...

  “What I think my esteemed cousin meant,” Ana had said, “is that God argues here that we're too weak and ignorant to be worthy to know these things. But then the question becomes -- exactly how smart do we have to be to deserve an answer? Now that we can, as Bill puts it, send lightning through the sky, now that we can capture whales and make them do tricks for us, does that mean we have a right to ask God for an explanation? Discuss!”

I think she is combining these to the obvious conclusion: /Now/ she has captured Leviathan with a fishhook (it was her actions directly that did it) and so she has earned the right to ask him for an explanation.
