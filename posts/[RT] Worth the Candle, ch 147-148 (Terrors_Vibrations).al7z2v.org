The code phrase Ms Name Generator used is somewhat more suspicious now that we've heard about the Pathists in, like, the /chapter immediately afterwards/:

#+begin_quote
  “Are you a traveller on the path made by others?”
#+end_quote

Raven /really/ shouldn't have tempted fate about 'dead cabals' like that.

 

I would've thought Valencia would bring up Snape as the stand-in for the Slytherin professor when Joon explains she's not /actually/ evil. The same thing can be said about Severus, after all - a non-evil conspirator who looks and acts evil as needed.

 

The final part of the chapter can be briefly summarised as "Joon takes some time out to go to Burning Man with a bunch of fellow students." He's managing to get a great college experience already, I think.

In that case he completely blew off "watching her back while she was asleep" to go play with his shiny new litrpg mechanics, whereas in this case his offer to watch her back was something she could count on.

Which is maybe evidence that the loyalty increase mechanic is governed by his companions' thoughts rather than Jun's actions? Maybe it was Mary's recollection of Jun's initial unreliability contrasted with where they were in the present, and her recognition of the progress he'd made, that triggered this loyalty up.

Amaryllis edited Joon in some way when she was inocculating herself against the meme, with various small bits of evidence for this theory.

Still magic should allow Joon to basically walk on air by freezing his feet or shoes and pushing off then. Would require some decent timing to use in combat, but would allow quite a lot of mobility if feasible.

A mage circus idea would be pretty funny.

Joon shoots down Valencia's comparison of S&S to Hogwarts, and then had a study session in which two guys and a girl write essays on magic, essays measured in inches, and the girl then criticizes the guys' essays because she's the "smart one".

I was skeptical at first, but search the chapter for Fenn and it starts to look likely:

#+begin_quote
  Fenn and I,” my voice caught, even though I'd tried to steel myself, “We always talked about what it would be like for us to go to society balls with you, how much we would like stomping all over everything, and all the nobles would have to hold their noses, because we had superior firepower.
#+end_quote

And right after:

#+begin_quote
  “Fine,” I said, still giggling. She just looked so serious, and then had that ridiculous mustache on. It was a little crooked, which just made the whole thing funnier. Fenn would have loved it, and for a moment, that thought wasn't accompanied by regret and loss.

  “She would have loved this, you know,” said Amaryllis.

  “Yeah,” I said, and then I started laughing again, because she still had a mustache on her face.
#+end_quote

June was nearly unable to talk about Fenn but is laughing in the same sentence only a few paragraphs later. Mary probably turned down the sense of loss. The change might not even revert since it would happen naturally over time.

The key is that Mary would have seen this as compassion, not manipulation. I don't think Mary would make selfish changes for the many reasons outlined in other posts.

Unless she also plans to simultaneously increase their amount of physical contact (which is certainly possible given the particular change that she made) then it wouldn't actually work long-term.

I suppose that maybe repeated lowering of his already naturally diminishing grief would perhaps be easier to take hold in his soul than a change which wouldn't have happened naturally.

edit: Also, doesn't it take a lot of concentration to mess around in someone's soul, especially considering she's only at half Joon's level? If she were going to do this multiple times Joon would likely notice what she was doing. And I don't think Mary is shortsighted enough to risk doing this only one time, when simply being patient would likely produce the same results.

Making Juniper more ambitious toes that line. I'd rather the ambition and cheerfulness be a reaction to having Fenn's death lifted from his conscience.

Assuming that Mary /only/ helped get Juniper past Fenn's death, its possible that she gives Joon some time to enjoy the change then tries to talk him into maintaining it himself.

I think there are also situations where the change is permanent (accelerating the natural process, or loyalty + spirit + soul) but Joon needs to find out at some point so all paths lead to the same endgame.

Agency has been a recurring theme of the story, and this particular self-editing conflict developed in the time-chamber and has yet to be resolved.

Even if she did convince him to alter himself in the process, it's possible that the damage done once he found out would be way worse than what was gained.

It just seems like a big gamble without much benefits. Especially considering that Joon was pretty obvious that he's still into Marry and just needed a little time.

Opening up a narrative trap of this party shattering magnitude isn't NOT in character for Mary. There are meta-narrative reasons why she might be doing it, but the evidence weighs against.

There's an entire paragraph where it basically implies she is doing that. From the story:

#+begin_quote
  I found myself wondering what I was waiting for. Why hadn't I tried to make a better case for myself? Why wasn't I trying harder to be the person that she wanted me to be, especially if it was the person that I wanted to be too? Uther was my point of comparison, and while I didn't want to be him, the things that he'd accomplished before leaving were so far beyond what I had managed to do that they seemed more like myth than reality. Amaryllis ... left to her own devices in a parallel timeline, she had conquered as much of the world as she possibly could have, with only a slight bit of cheating. I wanted to be with her, whether as a friend or not, and I knew that if we were going to keep things copacetic between us, I would have to be more like her, more driven, more ambitious. I knew that I should be anyway, even if she wasn't around.

  I should have gone home and faced whatever terrible thing the Dungeon Master had planned for me there.
#+end_quote

I think that Joon is likely going to evince no desire to closely look at his own soul to check that his values haven't changed or been forcibly altered - because that's probably the first thing Mary changed, before she did anything else. Right after that, she made sure his desires to see her own motivations / mind was less than his ethical prohibition against it (see later on, when he hits her mind and decides not to look at it b/c he's been made to view it as an invasion of privacy). If she was really cunning and clever, she might have hit tertiary desires. Like, make him want to be different (see paragraph excerpted above) and ease back on his worries about self-editing (which Mary has already been doing herself) so that he makes the direct major changes she wants him to make to himself - giving the other party members a plausible narrative and excuse for Joon's eventual major personality edits, that Joon himself will tell them, when Joon 'changes himself'.

He wouldn't, but a DMPC doesn't necessarily share the same motivations as the DM. The DM is still trying to play a character, it's just that they designed the character to have a certain effect on the story. In this case, maybe the effect he wants is to have Joon realize that Mary tweaked his values at some point in the future and have him experience a sense of betrayal that he wouldn't have experienced otherwise. Betrayal is great for story-telling, and the DM wouldn't get that if he edited Joon directly.

***** I think there's ways that wouldn't be a deep breach of trust, particularly given the implications that Amaryllis' interface is entirely unlike Joon's. At least, I think that was an implication? Joon sees something like expanded character sheets, but the other soul mage descriptions (as far as I remember) aren't like that.

If someone reached into my mind and reduced my akrasia, I would probably go, "Oh! Good idea." That's one example. If I really go looking, I can find more - but basically, there are things in all (most?) of us that we are unable to do anything about - even to ask for the help of others - even if those things are small and otherwise unnoticed.

Amaryllis knows Joon really, really well. One of Joon's biggest issue is the issues he has with all of his issues. If she just poked something inside to let stuff flow and shift - well, I'd be in favor of that. And I can think of at least one thing Joon desperately needs but I think would never be able to ask for: Feeling like he can forgive himself for his mistakes.

****** I would be hesitant about that. Since I strongly suspect that akrasia aka lack of motivation is a result of tasks not being enjoyable enough for the amount of effort being spent on them, and/or insufficient positive reinforcement for doing those tasks. System 1 relies very much on immediate positive and negative reinforcements, likely because it uses a lot more file compression than system 2 and so has to be constantly reminded of details that have been compressed out of its map of reality.

That's the same reason couples tell each other "I love you" even if they technically already know. Because while system 2 already knows, system 1 needs reminding sometimes.

Basically, if you're not including system 1, then you won't have the drive to get things done. Artificially removing akrasia through brain editing is a permanent solution for a temporary problem. Or do you think that those who don't struggle with akrasia have magic superman mutations that let them be more productive? If that's the case I would encourage you to read the "The Simple Math of Evolution" as well as "Are Your Enemies Innately Evil" on lesswrong.

Since basically all humans are extremely genetically similar. Only reason for nature to have so much bigger impact compared to nurture is because humans are bad at nurture. Case in point, the education system is crap, and hardly any parents have any idea what they're doing and they dont bother to take teaching or developmental psych classes so that they can have a better idea, even though those subjects are a core part of what parenting is all about!

So yeah, any time you consider whether editing a human brain is a good idea, consider whether you could accomplish the same goals by learning the right knowledge skills or ways of thinking instead. Because most of the time unless you have a disease or a brain injury you could learn how to accomplish any goal without brain editing, assuming you had the time resources and assistance necessary to learn the requisite skills knowledge and ways of thinking.

I also really don't think this is the case. I also don't know what bar you're measuring against to think that could even lead to de-selection in evolution.

Most people know the education system could be better. It's already better than it ever has been in the past (AFAIK, on average), more parents have more of an idea what they're doing even if they don't aggressively pursue that knowledge just through cultural osmosis, and the rest of our civilization's support structure can (but not always does) step in to contribute.

I would say that that is (generally) HOW you edit the human brain. There are sledgehammers in the way of pharma, but AFAIK literally all of those work way better when combined with the "natural" editing methods. Air quotes cuz this strikes me as similar to the GMO debate, actually.

- Many parts of soul magic are excluded, like changing age. Joon says that most things that can be done with soul magic can also be done with spirit magic. Does that included the otherwise excluded changes? It seems like some good exploits Joon should examine. The fact that there are less users means that it may have less exclusions.
- They promised to give the tattoo book back to the tatooist if he told them the truth - and he did. But Joon is still using it? (or maybe he just copied it)

And a couple of less insightful observations:

- When Uther & Raven found the woman in the wine barrel it was the medieval equivalent of women in fridges. And it was the DM saying that women will be in fridges either way. Ok, that was probably obvious to most people but I missed it up until now.

In the beginning, she demanded they be on her side, not because she is in the right - overall shes not, since she wants them to overlook her own similar behavior but not Uthers. And not because they are friends - because at first, they were strangers. But just because of threats of violence.

The sad thing is it works for her and has got her everything she ever wanted. Violence got Uther what he wanted, and now it's getting her what she wants which is tenants.

What can they do about it though? Perhaps take her power away and show her they still want to live in her? That's assuming she has human psychology I guess.

** I'm looking forward to the character realization that delayed quests will continue to rise in difficulty while dropping in benefit.

Twice now we have seen a quest be delayed untill it was forced. The first was the quest to meet other dream skewered. Which, if it had been done when Joon was weaker, would have been an infodump, with some helpful NPCs and a pile of very high level loot. But delayed, it became a high level encounter that cost a party member and required a lot of careful RP to get part of the previous reward.

Next, finding the body's origin. If done early, Joon could have reconnected with people more easily, and maybe gotten effectively a actual rule book. But delayed, now trust issues abound and any information they do get must be coerced or bribed.

The only remaining early quest is God Brother, where he is to meet one of the gods,and maybe join their ranks. Following the pattern, if done early he might have met on good terms, had his divine yada yada awakened by a god that viewed him as some kind of apprentice or lackey, or maybe even friend, but at minimum Ally. Now, he is a contender, any god on the hex is more likely to try to cut him off at the knees than help him.

*** I think Tiff is replying to an argument along the lines of "the sword lights up when touched by a woman, so 'man' and 'woman' are real ontological categories in this universe."

The counter example, following your analogy, is that the sword isn't tapping into any "true" notion of redness. It's just lighting up when exposed to light with wavelengths between X and Y. Then the narrator describes that behavior as "lighting up with red light" because that's how people talk.

So using the first sword to come up with an objective definition of gender is like using the second sword to find a true meaning of "red."

You're not leaning a "true" meaning. At best, you're learning some swordsmith's implementation of his opinion of red.

Like, it's possible that the particular spell used to light up on red will also light up on responsible to bursts of X-Rays because (magic technobabble here). The correct conclusion is, "huh, that spell is buggy and weird" and not "X-rays are red in some deep and meaningful way."

Your point as to why that is dumb is accurate but I've never heard of anyone using it to find objectivity.

Whereas its existence might for example reinforce the gender binary or the light spectrum binary or anything else you want is another complaint. But as long as it exists in universe as a concept then I don't see why a sword maker couldn't have chosen their best interpretation of woman (or perhaps like you said the easiest interpretation to implement even if it is clearly wrong for somethings).

Wants to be a better person, but can't find true motivation since he's barely crawled out of the homeostasis of depressed, heel-Joon. Hopefully all the fan speculation of Amaryllis soul-editing Joon isn't true, or the moral of the story would be "seek pharmacological help." Which is further corroborated by his noticeable improvement in the interpersonal department after those SOC points, though I guess the more psychologically helpful moral would be to "seek help" in the first place and /want to be the change/ he wants to see in himself or Aerb.

Amaryllis is unlikely to be able to make any changes permanent as she lacks the Spirit virtue Joon received. Amaryllis is taking a huge risk that Joon doesn't just check his own soul and see the changed values. Amaryllis is risking all this to...make him more likely to complete a side quest? (Unless she can make permanent changes his ambition would revert back by the time any further quests are due to be underway and, honestly, the changes would revert back before this current arc is even done and the side quest is underway seeing as she would only be able to slightly modify his values if she wanted it to go unnoticed).

The change of heart Joon has while Amaryllis is within his soul is also entirely plausible as a sign of character growth, helped along by the conversation he just had with Amaryllis and a desire to be the sort of person Amaryllis would respect, seeing as he has feelings for her.

Too many convenient pieces of evidence that are difficult to explain via other means, and the theory explains/resolves a number of details

- the entire paragraph about suddenly wanting to be more like what Amaryllis wants him to be
- explains why they hadn't tested on "D-class personnel" first (because Amaryllis didn't want to be immune to the meme so much as she wanted to soulfuck him and it was just the excuse she used)
- the inexplicable loyalty level up makes sense if you consider she's more loyal to joon because she'll get to edit him more to her liking, or at least recognizing the unquestioning trust of him giving her free access to his soul without suspicion
- her wariness when woken back up suggests she was worried she might have messed something up (joon laughing could have made her concerned that something she had done had caused it)
- wanting privacy to do it, walking to get the plate when it wasn't necessary. Her hesitation and care and extra time taken when asking to get access to his soul and distracting him by mixing the request with a different topic that Joon himself recognized wasn't a debrief for the purposes of a quest and out of character since she doesn't generally talk about her past
- brushing off Juniper asking whether they should consult Raven and invoking the narrative to persuade him to just do it because she knows he doesn't like talking about it
- immediately being able to recall fenn without twinging when just prior to Amaryllis being in his soul he was
- this line: "Back near the beginning, when we weren't so close, I'd had some fantasies about Amaryllis, fantasies that I'd done my best to squash, and *fantasies that were returning, unbidden*." It is in her interests that Joon is more positive towards her, and the phrasing of "returning, unbidden" is pretty interesting.

**** Tiff's argument irks me to no end, but we've also heard less of it than needed to actually engage with it; that is, I'm itching to scream “wrong!”, but I don't actually know which of a couple possible weak points it actually has.

This argument, though, now that's something I can engage with.

Not going to defend the atom analogy, as I don't think it's good either. The social baggage argument, however, looks wrong to me.

Specifically, one doesn't get to discard a notion because there's social baggage attached to it, no more than one gets to discard a piece of physics because it was done by a Nazi, or a piece of medicine because it was discovered by making holes in people's skulls. (If that helps, I also think that the measures described in /Delphic/ 's “[[https://delphicserial.com/2018/03/25/interlude-stevens/][/In re/ Stevens]]” would, in the real world, be wrong and actively harmful to humanity, regardless of how depraved the real-world Dr Stevens were.) Yes, the baggage attached to “woman” is quite a bit heavier than being discovered by a Nazi, but the principle stands: one doesn't abandon a piece of truth about the world because of social issues incidentally attached to it.

The claim, then, would have to be that “woman” is a notion that does not represent a piece of truth about the world. That... would require a lot of justification, I think. My purpose here isn't to argue one way or the other, only to point out that “has social baggage attached” would be orthogonal to such an argument. Still, here's a list of other points against that wouldn't work:

- Pointing out that it's not the ultimate truth: the test is having a relation to the truth, not encompassing it completely, otherwise progress would be stuck; in particular:

  - Pointing out that the boundary isn't completely well-defined: something that's true even, say, 60% of the time is still telling us something;
  - Pointing out that it conflates several things into one; the fact that they did get conflated also tells us something, even if realizing that there is in fact several separate things is extremely enlightening;

- Pointing out that it's a social construct: just because something exists in people's minds doesn't mean it's not real (if possibly more mutable); how it got there is also bound to be an interesting topic.

Note, however, that something being related to truth doesn't have anything to do with it being related to morals, being suitable for usage in law, being suitable for a first introduction to the subject, and so on. These all need to be argued separately.

Which brings me to another baffling (in-universe) thing about the original argument depicted in WtC, because whether a magical sword that classifies bearers into women and non-women is feasible in a particular or any fictional world, whether building such a world is a good thing to do, &c. are all good and non-obvious questions, while whether there exists a well-defined class of people that includes most people commonly called such and excludes most people not commonly called such... seems to be trivial, along with the fact that the /exact/ description of any such class would have to be long and not in any way simple.

As to why I think [[/u/yagsuomynona][u/yagsuomynona]]'s atom analogy isn't of much use: the way it equates the subjective fuzziness of “woman” and “atom” only works against trying to categorically exclude any fuzziness at all, or any subjectivity at all, but not against trying to exclude unreasonably subjective fuzziness. /Atoms are not subjective/. If we admit physicalism and a fundamental mathematical model, an approximate formulation of that model, in a limited range of situations, as a model of weakly-interacting local degrees of freedom... is a thing that exists regardless of anybody's idea of what they want to find in that model. (This needs qualification --- in particular, we shouldn't be speaking about a single formulation, but about a family of related formulations for different possible values of “approximate”, “limited” and “weakly”; but it is morally true.) That we currently suck at finding these formulations except by following our preconceptions doesn't make them any less objective.

***** I think you've misunderstood me here.

I'm not arguing the social baggage around the concept of “woman” should /do/ anything; certainly not force anyone to discard the concept.

Further, I'm pretty sure Tiff doesn't know what she wants, other than to object to the notion that a magical sword can authoritatively tell someone who believes they're a woman that they aren't one.

Trying to create magic that operates on non-reductive concepts in a reductive world is pretty inherently difficult. Having to make authoritative statements about how /the magic/ classifies things is necessary in the same way that a decidable algorithm that doesn't have a deterministic output is in most cases useless or even harmful to rely on.

Reimer was right that there should, eventually, be a “way the sword works” and if you run enough tests you should be able to determine the algorithm.

Tiff was right that the existence of that classification isn't definitive, it's just the magic's interpretation among many many other interpretations. That privileging it is dismissive, even harmful, to people without any real benefit other than disambiguation.

Joon was right that creating such a magic item in your game is more trouble than it's worth in more ways than just the difficulty of drawing hard boundaries around fuzzy things that have no attached social baggage.

They were all right and all still arguing because they all cared about completely different things.

This is rather abstract and hard to unpack, but to try my best to put my position in opposition to this. Mathematical models themselves do not define anything - they need to be put in contact with the world via our scientific methodology and practice, which needs to be interpreted at the base level by our human perceptual capacities and capacities to act. It is this whole network - starting from our basic capacities, building up into the ability to create and use and interpret tools that manipulate and measure, which we build methodologies and theories upon, as well as our ability to communicate and socialize with other humans as epistemic agents - that constitutes our understanding of scientific objects such as atoms.

Any objectively existing thing must be understood via a perspective such as this, and there is no escaping from it, and only partial and lossy abstraction from this. It is a mistake to then conclude that because our understanding of atoms is dependent on all of these very human things, that atoms are subjective, because, as I note in my first comment, this deflates the meaning of "objective". "Objective" of course does mean something, we use it successfully all the time, so that deflation only begs the question of what we meant by "objective" in the first place.

An alien which completely different capacities as a human can understand atoms, but we can only understand the alien /as/ understanding atoms via our own understanding of atoms. An alien can similarly understand what a woman is.

Juniper's reading of Lisi's intentions feels wrong.

Let's look at Amaryllis's description of their friendship:

#+begin_quote
  “Motivated friendship,” said Amaryllis as she started walking. “It wasn't the first time, but it was definitely the least subtle. I don't know what she thought I would get from her company, but she was abrasive in a way that I never found entirely appealing. We Penndraigs are destined for politics and governance from birth, but not all of us are suited to it, and Lisi ... there's a reason that she's studying to be a combat mage instead of doing something a bit more prestigious. In another ten years, she'll be a multimagus, but she'll still be sitting outside of the traditional spheres of power within Anglecynn.”
#+end_quote

I think Lisi was abrasive to Amaryllis, and Amaryllis stopped being friends with her. Lisi was abrasive to other important Anglecynn royalty, and found herself shuffled off into a do-nothing position. Lisi regrets how her friendship with Amaryllis ended.

I think Lisi is trying to improve herself. I think she's trying to strike a friendship with Reimer for the sake of improving her ability to make friends.

With that, I'm going to register a prediction:

Stories like wandering Inn and practical guide that update multiple times a week set expectations unfairly high for other serials.

*** It used to update more regularly, but seems like it's taking progressively longer between updates. There's a public drive file up somewhere where the author keeps updates of how far he is.

The good news is the updates tend to be pretty large. Think of it as being on a similar schedule to MoL, but with updates 5x the size.

  Amaryllis held the glove out and a hand mirror popped into existence. She stared at her reflection for a moment, then looked back up at me with a raised eyebrow. “Really?” she asked. For a brief moment, she seemed disappointed in me, but then her eyes went down to the mirror again, and she cracked a smile. “You're ridiculous,” she said. She gave me a skeptical look, then her eyes returned to the mirror again. “You didn't even draw it right!”

  “I didn't want to spend a bunch of time on it,” I explained.

  Amaryllis set the mirror down. “You know that this means retribution, don't you? A Penndraig is not to be trifled with.”

  “Wouldn't be the first mistake I've made,” I said, smiling at her.

  “She would have loved this, you know,” said Amaryllis.

  “Yeah,” I said, and then I started laughing again, because she still had a mustache on her face.

**** It was a wholesome moment of reminiscing about a dead loved one, that is kinda death flaggy, but not excessively, no more than the more directed attraction that Joon has been showing towards her recently.

***** I don't think I've ever noticed reminiscing about a different dead person being a death flag. In fact usually that's a flag that the dead person is going to come into play in the story - that they're going to find out something new and material about them or they put something in motion that would affect the main characters post mortem.

If they sleep together, that's a death flag.
