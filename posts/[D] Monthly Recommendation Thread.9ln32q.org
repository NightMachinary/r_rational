** *Request:* Fiction focused on a conflict with an overwhelmingly powerful enemy in full control of the protagonist's environment (or where such an entity is suspected to exist).

It's pretty high-concept, yes, and could take many forms. Such as:

- A conflict with an eldritch entity which kills you if you learn of its existence. ([[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][Example]].)

- A conflict with a Matrix Lord from inside its simulation. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Possible example]]).

- A conflict with a Physical God. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Example.]])

- (Kind of.) A conflict with your own creative insanity. (Example: [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-18-dog-eat-dog-story/18-09/][this arc]] from /Twig/.)

- A deep cover infiltration mission into the upper echelons of power of a watchful/paranoid enemy. ([[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][Partial example.]])

I find these kinds of stories extremely engaging. Protagonists can't make any mistakes or they will be crushed, which makes the conflict very tense, and the power disparity forces them to act covertly, which makes it intelligent. There's something very neat about having to pay attention to every little detail in fear of an active and perceptive enemy, too.

Any other examples?

*** I mean, I think your example might be a bit big. The third, given your words and your example, would fit works as far out from this topic as Namek arc / BotG of Dragon ball in it. If this is intended, let me know and I can cast my search net wider, but as is:

Youjo Senki: [[https://www.crunchyroll.com/saga-of-tanya-the-evil]] (Vs a being who claims to be god; demonstrated powers of reincarnation, time stop, body puppets, matter creation, time travel, mind control). Category 2 or three probably.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death]] an actually good SAO fanfic; I would probably even call it rational. Against a sysadmin with a general Ai and a designed world. Little / no knowledge of the source required, no knowledge of source mechanics needed because they created a self consistent magic system (one of the outright best I've seen in fiction). Category 2 ish

[[https://www.crunchyroll.com/puella-magi-madoka-magica]] Probably my favorite anime of all time. If you haven't been spoiled, don't spoil yourself. The twists work even if you've been warned of their existence, but work better if you don't know the details. Givign the category would also be a spoiler.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo]] Post rebellion PMMM Fanfic; category is a spoiler unless you've seen the work above this. It doesn't look like it fits at first, and you could argue that it's honestly two books with that as the plot of the second one, but I think that that's worth reading anyway. Requires canon knowledge.

Worm arguably fits here, but it takes a long time to get there and I can't wholeheartedly shill it, since it does have quite a few issues. Category 3.

Fate Grand Order is a mobile game (I say, ignoring the fact that it has more story than many book series at this point) in the Fate/Nasuverse multiverse about this topic, although there are several writers of varying quality involved. Warning: some of the plots by the side authors can be, well, weak. Mix of 1, 2, and 3.

if you've already played the game, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/eye-of-the-gorgon-fate-grand-order-si.610048/]] is a fun fanfic of the above, although it does have some spoilers for NA on it.

**** Thank you for the recommendations. I'm familiar with four of them (/Youjo Senki/, /PMMM/, /Fargo/, /Worm/), however.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, I think your example might be a bit big
#+end_quote

It is supposed to be broad, yes. But perhaps I described it poorly, thereby making it seem even broader?

In the kind of story I'm talking about, if the antagonist realizes that the protagonist is a threat, the protagonist will be immediately and absolutely annihilated, with no chance of defending against it. E. g., if you figure out that the cosmic horror exists, it will see you and kill you. If the Matrix Lord realizes that you're successfully rebelling, it will freeze you, read your mind, then erase it and replace you with a less smart fork. If the organization you're infiltrating sees through your deceptions, you'll be seized and executed.

And so on. The protagonist needs to act very carefully in order to not alert the enemy, while still somehow fighting it. It's less about threats' /nature/ (gods, lords, humans, doesn't matter), and more about the protagonist's position relative to them.

From your examples, /Fargo/ fits perfectly, at least from one perspective: Kyubey was up against a nearly-omniscient Homura, who loathed it, was suspicious of it, and planned to erase it from existence if it betrayed her. In response, it covertly enacted a complicated plan designed to look harmless if it failed, and carefully managed her attention and diverted her suspicions while it unfolded.

On the other hand, /Youjo Senki/ fits less: Albeit the protagonist is up against a godlike entity as well, there's no threat of immediate destruction if she permits herself a misstep, or if she makes her desires known to it. It's not finished though, I believe? I hope it'll go in that direction.

/Worm/ doesn't fit as well either. Except from Cauldron's perspective, perhaps? Battles following Gold Morning fit only loosely, since Scion isn't playing to win and the capes don't realize they can't defeat it physically. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][/El-Ahrairah/]], a rational fanfic, is more similar to what I'm describing (and is otherwise great, I heavily recommend it), though it's not a perfect fit either.

#+begin_quote
  /Fairy Dance of Death/
#+end_quote

Question: Are the characters actually /focused/ on Kayaba? Do they treat him as the enemy, and scheme to escape or hack his simulation in denial of his will? Or do they treat him as a /gamemaster/, and strive to exit the simulation by beating his game the way he wants them to? If the latter, it wouldn't exactly fit. Just as a certain popular rational story doesn't fit exactly.

Similar questions about the /Nasuverse/-related works.

I'm not very sensitive about them, though I'd prefer to avoid spoilers about genre twists^{1} and about the story's ending. But since we're already talking about fairly important plot points, don't feel too restricted. What shape does /F/GO/'s conflict take?

******* To say as much as I can, without leaving any serious spoilers unboxed:

F/GO is a mobile game in which you play as a "master" (a mage that provides mana for heroes summoned from the past) for Chaldea Security Organization. Chaldea is a United Nations project that's dedicated to protecting humanity; it's the first serious collaboration between the (becoming less and less) hidden magic world and mundane government. They utilize a pseudo-time traveling device known as rayshifting and said servants to deal with any issues that crop up.

Just after Chaldea begins its operations, Goetia launches his initial strike. He's an immensely powerful being with an extraordinarily strong clairvoyance to match, and Chaldea is one of his two actually three, but the third is also in Chaldea and is the reason Chaldea is able to form blindspots. For his opening move, he alpha strikes the only two things that can move against him, chaldea and atlas; the latter is summarily defeated. For the former, he suborns their second in command, kills 47/48 of their eligible masters, all but one of their senior staff, destroys all of their important equipment, and kills or otherwise incapacitates most of their ordinary personnel; the only reason he misses a spot is that the protagonist is talking to Dr. Romani aka solomon, the third blindspot, which puts Romani enough behind schedule that he's not at ground 0 of the explosion.

He immediately follows this up by incinerating human history via attacking 6 "singularities" (think fixed points from doctor who, if you've seen that) placed at important events in humanities history. You and chaldea have to clear 6 of these singularities, each filled with some of the strongest servants available, when:

They have to find and clear each and every singularity

Failing even once is a loss.

They're on a timer.

They can't afford to lose their sole surviving master.

They have to keep from seriously threatening his victory until they are absolutely ready, so he doesn't crush them like a bug.

They have to fight against some of the absolute strongest opponents Goetia can throw at them, including multiple infinitely regenerating demon gods, actual gods empowered by a holy grail, the beast Tiamat who, among many other extremely obscene abilities, categorically cannot die as long as any other being is alive and can kill some of the most dangerous threats in existence just by being near them

and all without losing Dr. Romani, since he's the only one with the knowledge to keep things running still alive, or letting goetia learn his true identity

****** [[/u/1101560][u/1101560]] is correct, it's indeed the opposite. The loopers are the privileged ones here: immortal, with access to future information, able to effectively erase their enemies' memory and try out different deceptions until they've manipulated them into doing what they want.

If the protagonist was a non-looper with goals opposing Zorian's (such as Quatach-Ichl or Sudomir), it would have fit perfectly. Non-loopers can only win by ensuring that there's virtually no possible sequence of events the loopers could take that defeats the non-loopers (either in battle or socially), which is quite hard.

*Edit:* Well, on the other hand, if Panaxeth --- an intelligent nearly-omniscient eldritch abomination which plays the role of the gatekeeper --- was more active from the beginning, it would have qualified from the loopers' perspective too.

**** u/CouteauBleu:
#+begin_quote
  Darth Plagueis by James Luceno is surprisingly good. It's in depth exploration of prequel politics and how Sith exploited it.
#+end_quote

Eh. I thought it was kind of monotone.

It didn't really sell me on the Sith's supposed genius at politics and manipulation. It just depict evil rich people being evil and rich; applying naked hypocrisy and nepotism and being systematically rewarded for it.

It makes the Sith ascension look easy, because nobody ever opposes them and everybody is evil. The Star Wars universe doesn't seem to have syndicates, NGOs, journalists, anti-trust laws, and whistle-blowers for Plagueis to navigate around. Rich people don't invest based on how much money they'll make, they invest based on how evil and dishonest the investment can be. Plagueis can slaughter a room full of assassins is a club he's the official head of, and nobody seems to think the guy miiiiiight be shifty.

(also the fact that Palpatine gives a vibrant speech for letting the Trade Federation acquire giant robot armies kind of undermine the whole plot of the Prequels; why was the guy who became famous by endorsing the Trade Federation put in charge of fighting them off?)

I started reading it because [[/u/VorpalAuroch]] called attention to it recentishly in a thread that was about trying to find a story Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote under a pseudonym. I think it feels plausible, based on having read just the first four chapters (I was in the middle of reading another book at the time). At the very least, I think it's probable that it was written by someone who's familiar with the rational community. From what I've read so far, it seems pretty good.

*** 40k Years of Cultivation is probably the best Xianxia I have read. The author updates at a breakneck pace, although the translation is somewhat slow to follow.

Edit:40k Years of Cultivation (hence 40k), written by Ascended Auroch (can't remember what the canon translation of his name is), is about a man who has a chance encounter in a XianXia world, and then bootstraps himself into greater power... and greater troubles.40k's best qualities, from my point of view, are the sympathetic, idiot-ball-immune villains, and the arguments that the protagonist has with said villains.

â€‹

The villains are sympathetic because their goals make sense. By and large, many of the villains' goals are partially absorbed by the protagonist, or at least taken into considerations.

â€‹

Protagonist: Hey, I found out that <evil race> isn't that bad! We can have treaties and intermixing!

â€‹

Villain: but, <traditional enmity reasons>, <good anti-immigration reasons>. You can't just suddenly mix us together and expect that a few centuries down the line, our democratic system won't be overtaken! Death!

â€‹

Protagonist(over the villain's body): We'll add some voting rights restrictions and such, and see how it turns out.

*** Since this seems like it is becoming a Xianxia response thread, I have to say you need to read Way of Choices. It is the only multifaceted one with interesting characters, both protagonists and antagonists, good writing and plot setup, and actually has a very good translation available.

Takes a while of getting through initial chapters before you might get invested (as is usual in wuxia/xianxia) but I definitely recommend you do. The main character starts out as a nobody, as is usual, but really takes a long time to develop and give a sense of EARNING his eventual strength, which most webfictions fail to do.

It is also the first thing that I have read in a long time that properly set up a power scale and remained relatively consistent with it. It sets up these larger than life end game type characters who exist in the world. And they actually exist! They aren't just mentioned and then eventually faced once the main character and crew are strong enough to take them on. They are actually influencing the world and interacting with other people from the very beginning of the story.

Plus, the main character faces enemies from multiple factions, people who are stronger than him, and faces situations where the fight just isn't fair and it isn't right for people who are much stronger than him to fight him but, it only makes sense for them to do so since they are his enemies. You aren't left with the classic oh send henchmen of gradually increasing strength. On a related note, the reason why other strong characters don't interfere and why actions taken by the main cast are allowed make sense due to the political set up of the world (and can have political ramifications) and are not purely for the author's convenience.

The translation has also recently finished over at Gravity Tales so I would say now would be a great time to get into it.

- Dungeon Born/Cradle: I'm bundling these together as non-web-novels by western authors. I haven't finished either, but I've seen enough recs on this sub to be optimistic about their overall quality
- Reverend Insanity: A surprisingly in-depth portrayal of a genuinely sociopathic 'protagonist' with an interesting magic system. Not my thing, but technically good.
- Soul Land(manhua): Thoroughly middle-of-the-road even by genre standards, but the good art and supporting cast make it very enjoyable.
- Zhu Xian: A hidden gem, if you can get past the awful translation. The conflict, both literal and ideological, between the factions generates some actual pathos, as does the MC's romance with a girl from the rival faction.
- Avalon of the Five Elements: What happens when a Jianghu runs out of qi? This is the sequel to world of cultivation where, untold eons later mankind? barely clings to survival in a world where a strange new cultivation system has arisen. Keeps things fresh by forcing the MC to deal with everything from politics to colonization to war to trade.
- Peerless Dad(manhua): Strictly comedic, a former mercenary wants to raise his kid, while unaware of how insanely strong he actually is.

** *The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement*

A novel about a factory that's on the brink of being shut down. Fascinating read. Lots of cases were conventional wisdom and Campbell's Law made the characters make terrible decisions, which they only realise when thinking about what their goals actually are.

A frequent argument:

"We should do X."

"But that completely goes against principle Y!"

"Y is a terrible principle, because Z."

"But that's just common sense! Of course Z implies X"

"So we can do Z?"

"No! It completely goes against Y."

*The Phoenix Project*

Inspired by The Goal, basically an IT version.

*Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War*

True story. A fighter pilot who wanted to understand the principles behind fighter planes. He stole $1,000,000 of computer time to build his theory, which proved that American planes were pretty shit, despite being much more expensive. He then set out to build the perfect plane, but was stymied by the politics.

It's inspiring to watch his dedication to the truth, and heartbreaking to see him battle against the insanity of the system and the careerism of the people in it.

Alternates between being "porn" and horror for rationalists.

**** And Groundhog Day is a romance movie. Time loops can be an interesting twist on the genre. A month is more than enough time for romance to develop (Before Sunrise anyone?) and even reach a satisfying conclusion. But that would be a waste of potential in my opinion. A more interesting take would be to explore the implications of such a situation : experiencing that first magical meeting over and over again in different situations, getting to know someone so well and staying a stranger to them at the same time, exploring all the facets of them by masterful manipulation. Even the act of seducing someone you have no chance of ever being with in real time, by trial and error( sort of like Zach tried to kill that dragon at the start) could be very entertaining.

** Request (and kind of a recommendation): This is a strange request because it might already be in this thread and I'm just not seeing it. Very recently I read a story that I thought was linked from this thread, or maybe elsewhere in [[/r/rational]], but I can't find it again. It is about someone from our Earth who finds himself transported to a world where he is in what looks like a gladiator stadium filled with an audience of elves and the announcer announcing him as the next contestant. It is LitRPG; he sees stats and levels. He has little physical strength or combat ability, seems like a physics nerd, and his opponent for the match is a type of combat robot. I can't really say more about it without spoilers other than it is a short piece, complete though the author could choose to make it the start of something longer, I found it funny, with twists and munchkinry, and I really liked it.

Can anyone identify it from that? If anyone can then this is a recommendation as well as a request.
