** Interesting Amazon reviews, don't seem to suggest it's very rational. Contains spoilers.

#+begin_quote
  This is an interesting read for sure but it's also seriously weird. Spoilers coming so look away.

  #+begin_quote
    The MC hears about a game he can make tons of cash in to support his family. Ok reasonable, and hes desperate enough to try it. Again ok. Where it takes a super weird twist is when some rando dude hands him a magical invisibility cloak for a few rabbit hides. Then he uses that to sneak in to an exclusive and super powerful guild. Then he accidentally joins said guild. While there he makes plans to use his cloak to rob the place, but only steals one treasure map. Cause hes not a thief see? He finds the loot wich turns out to be a magical sword and amulet. Then gets poisoned after slaying a demon and gets robbed of everything. Including what he had in his bank some how. He tells a GM but apparently GMs have 0 power in the game they just greet new players. They cant even delete illegal items wich apparently the cloak sword and amulet all are. Weird right? It gets better. After his betrayal he gets locked in a dungeon as a traitor. Then meets the same weird dude who gave him the cloak. Weird guy says "hey kill a GM for me" mc says "no way crazy dude" then crazy dude curses him with a death spell. Wich apparently translated to real life. Because he logs out and the same game mark is on his hand as was in the game. So now he has a week to get revenge, get his items back. Kill the guild leader that kicked him out. Oh and murder the GM, who will also die in real life when he does. Thus making him a murderer. But hey it's all good cause in the end he makes a million dollars and effectively retires and just has to play the game now.

    Super weird.

*** It can be a polarizing read, no doubt. The MC is often his own worst enemy. The decisions he makes can seem irrational at times because he thinks it is all a game. Consequences arise from every decision he makes, but his intentions have always been to give his family the life he envisions them having, which is a free and prosperous one. He didn't expect to get in over his head with a video game.

**** This is a bad way to sell to this subreddit. Rather, what rationalfic would you say this is closest to? Which are you favourite? How is your story different to other litrpg stories? What's different about the worldbuilding that makes it more careful and cleaner than the average for the genre?

Right now your only hook is the supplied blurb, which is particularly generic, and a claim that the MC is rational without any particular backing.

***** I've compared the MC to Walter Whyte from Breaking Bad. I can't really compare my book to anyone else's. It's not crunchy and it doesn't hold to the conventions of the genre. I guess it falls into the GameLit category. If I'm wrong in my assumption about the rational aspect, then I apologize. I find that, in many cases, rationalism is in the eye of the beholder. Everyone thinks, or justifies their actions, in whatever way they think is best. That's how I wrote the MC.

****** If Vee wouldn't mind me chiming in here; Matt; I think everyone here would agree with me that even if it turned out your story wasn't a good fit for this sub, there is no animosity for sharing it. Releasing a book itself is a great achievement and if you are proud of it then you should share it where you can. With that said, if it isn't a good fit be prepared for some harsh (and I hope constructive) criticism, because most people here believe that rational (not rational/ist)/ is synonymous (or at the very least correlated) with good writing - me included.

To clarify what I mean by rational, in two words it would be "internal consistency", but I usually explain it to people like this;\\
"In the stories world, if you take for granted a few base premises where the world differs from ours, other than those base premises the story progresses exactly like it would in real life if those base premises were true."

So to give an example of something NOT rational that you are probably aware of: (*INFINITY WAR SPOILERS*)\\
In the scene where Dr strange, the guardians, iron man and spiderman are fighting thanos, Dr strange looks into all the futures and sees that the only future where they succeed is by letting the main guardian (forgot his name) screw up getting the gauntlet from thanos and "loose" to win at the end. This is irrational. They had almost defeated thanos, and there is no way that Dr strange would not have found a future where that defeat succeeds and the gauntlet is delivered to someone who won't fuck everything up again. There was nothing special about the future he saw which couldn't have been repeated in any other futures where they had taken the stones from thanos. This is irrational, and in my opinion also bad writing. A good writer, would have found a way to get the narrative to move the way he/she wanted with all the tension required while keeping internal consistency.

I think the misunderstanding we may have about the genre may be that a rational story isn't one were the characters don't act out of character. It is one where the characters and the WORLD doesn't act out of character.

So, getting back to the point, from only reading your summary and the review Vee quoted, so far the story seems incredibly irrational. (keep in mind I haven't read the story, so many of these points may be incorrect, but the point stands that this is the impression that this community is getting from what we have available before actually reading it)

- " Where it takes a super weird twist is when some rando dude hands him a magical invisibility cloak for a few rabbit hides. " This kind of premise is almost always irrational and IMO only done because a more realistic way of progressing the story couldn't be found. No-one gives random people random shit; say the guy has some purpose to it; he has some grand plan where this guy using the cloak does something specific he wants. Unless for the rest of the story the MC has no choice but to go with the flow such a plan is way too shaky, it has virtually no chance of happening the way the rando expects it to and so there is no way they would do that. Lets say he wants to frame him; why would he reveal himself? why would he trade for something worthless like that? - I'm not going to cover all the reasons here, but I would bet money that whatever the reason it is it isn't going to be good.

- " While there he makes plans to use his cloak to rob the place, but only steals one treasure map" this isn't how a normal human being would act. Maybe there is a better reason in the story, but according to the reviewer there isn't.

- " Including what he had in his bank some how. " Sounds like an irrational plot hole - which would pretty much kill any story for the sub

- " He tells a GM but apparently GMs have 0 power in the game they just greet new players. " and all the next things about how this game isn't just a game; If that was the case there is no way the general public wouldn't be aware of this. This is what I call "uncreative creativity" which is very common in anime from what I have seen, and I would also call irrational. Random rules and premises added to a world to make it "interesting" or to help plot along but don't have any foundation on more base rules of the world.\\
Two good examples could be comparing harry potter (or any superhero movie) with, say GOT. The former has a whole lot of rules implied form the start with no explanation, magic (for no reason) has these specific rules, these superheros have these specific powers and there is no rational reason for them (of course the shows try explaining them in some way but its obvious that the rules were made FIRST and then the explanations just tacked on to make it not obvious to children) while in GOT, the rules of the world are the means to an end, not the end itself, the story looks like it has assumed a score of facts about the world and it's magic, and then the rest of the plot was drawn around what the logical conclusions of these rules would have been. (And even if it wasn't written like that, it would be the job of good writing to make it SEEM like that was how it was written, and the books definitely deliver on this point).\\
I think if you talked to any of the people here who regularly comment in the world-building threads they could give you many more pointers and explanations to keep in mind for your future stories.

The rest pretty much falls under what I said above^. It sounds like a whole lot of irrational random things happened to set up a premise for an interesting story. And anyone who enjoys their fiction rational would have all their immersion broken by then.

Unless I am resoundingly mistaken and got the completely wrong impression I hope you would take this as advice for your future stories. making a story rational just makes it harder to write, not less enjoyable for most audiences, so I would strongly recommend to try. The highest recommended stories on this sub are also excellent examples of rational stories, so I would strongly recommend you read them. We stand on the shoulders of giants after all, standing on the ground out of pride will not get anyone anywhere.

Hope this was helpful, and subscribers to the sub, I would love your opinions and especially Matt I would love to hear from you as well.

And good luck on your book sales!

Those most attracted to Shakespeare's writing, in the academic environment to foster such things, oft consider that genre to be what good writing is about. As can somebody read a work like Ulysses, see the immense talent it took to write, and figure that it stands so high and seems so great that it can only be a natural pinnacle of writing, and those others writing lesser common books do so only because they do not have the skills or audience or experience to climb these heights. Yet others think the same of Tolkien. Perhaps the animation industry thinks the same of the writing of Spongebob, or Frozen, or Spirited Away.

The punchline is obvious. Goodness isn't a measure of what you happen to like, but it's easy to think that way, so we should be cautious before making the same mistake about ratfic. Heck, if I cared too much about that goodness of writing I'd have never read Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, and if I cared too little about others' fancies I'd never have tried Moby Dick. I prefer to keep it simple: good writing is what most enriches people's lives.

******** Completely agree and I would be the first to say that what you happen to like is 100% subjective and does not give anything any objective value (unless you are defining the value on enjoyment of specific people), I would clarify my statement then with the following; I define "Good writing" in my comment as "well written" or "requiring skill to write". - which may correlate but absolutely does not have a causational relationship with what any one person may enjoy, but I would argue that by the definition of "well written" being "took skill to write", well written work necessitates some level of rationality - with the obvious exception of if it is not meant to be... But I guess you could forever go into the exceptions, I guess I must generalise; the majority of what the majority of people describe as well written work is fairly rational, with the majority of the ones that aren't have a specific reason why they don't want to be rational and that it enhances the effect the author was after, specifically if it wasn't rational.

My point in general, is that making the work more rational would make it more popular with a strictly larger audience which I think still stands? Or do you disagree that is the case?

It's pedantic, but surely not, there are lots of things that take skill to write that are nearly valueless.

My objection wasn't just pedanticism; rationalist fiction might be new, but rational fiction has a fairly lengthy history and yet hasn't taken all that much of a grip on the wider market. People generally prefer Star Wars to hard sci-fi, and I'd bet most people into romance would find the idea of a rationalist take on it distasteful. Many people have a strong aversion to rational fiction as-is (albeit often that's a status issue). Most portrayals of intelligence in fiction are intelligence-as-status, and frankly people seem to like things that way. One much less obvious concern is that real rational behaviour requires more cognitive work to follow than posturing behaviour, and that's an effective way to chase off large fractions of one's audience.

********** mmm now that you mention it i guess so, I had probably been influences too much by my social bubbles.

though i would still insist on an mean level, most people may prefer SW over hard SiFi but if any show looses too much rationality it is not enjoyed as much, take GOT; when it deviated from the books I noticed and lost interest but the general public didn't and it was going strong, but when the plot holes get too obvious it does have a negative effect.

**** (having only read the amazon reviews) if I had to describe the critical sticking point in one sentence: A rational fiction is something in which /every/ character is [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][lvl 1 intelligent]], or "rational" as per your understanding. This includes: the guy who gave mc the cloak, the guild leader who appointed mc as a battle leader, and then kicked him out, the guy who sabotaged him, but also, the other players who are searching for ways to make money but aren't finding the MC's methods, the game makers who made an imbalanced system and built in the ability to kill people in the real world.
