[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3159][SCP-3159, entitled The Trashiest World in the Multiverse]]. Features a transcript from a parallel-universe Jerry Springer. On the lighter side for an SCP. Basically an attempt on my part to crystallize some of what's unsettling about daytime TV.

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3192][SCP-3171, entitled When the Bell Tolls]]. A clock that tells you the time of your death. Partly based on suggestions people gave me in one of the munchkinry threads here. A little long.

A failed SCP entitled [[http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/167426702262/statistical-significance][Statistical Significance]]. This one features only real-world facts, accurately described. Most people on the site hated it, complaining it was too densely written.


** Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it almost looks like SCP-3285-004 and SCP-3285-005 are the votes that happened on 1/7/2015 and 9/20/2017.

Nice writing.

** I don't like Statistical Significance because SCP's shouldn't be mundane. I really like When the Bell Tolls.

*** I like it as a thought, but it really doesn't work within the context of the SCP Foundation. Surely the Foundation has numerous ways to prevent a threat so mundane as nuclear war.

**** It might work if it weren't the anthropic principle but some kind of benevolent (or "benevolent") anomalous force. Or maybe it /is/ the Foundation intervening somehow.

** Small typo

#+begin_quote
  The Norwegian rocket incident of 1995 (when Russian radars recorded an unexpected missile launch, consistent with an attack from a nuclear-armed submarine, projected to hit Moscow in *under than* 5 minutes
#+end_quote

Either under or less than.

** I think Statistical Significance would be interesting as background data for another SCP. Perhaps something that ties the anthropic principle together with the temporal shenanigans present in 3171. As-is, it's more like an excerpt from a trivia article than an anomalous object.
