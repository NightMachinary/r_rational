Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have been given an extremely detailed snapshot of Earth's surface by say, aliens. Nobody else knows you have it, nobody knows it exists.

Snapshot itself is a gigantic array of non-indexed data. It is stored in an irreplaceable and irreplicable artifact that you have managed to build an interface to. The data contains everything 10 km above and below sea level with a resolution of 1 nanometer, taken at January 1st of this year at GMT 00:00. For every nanometer cube (actually slightly skewed cube, being part of a shell), percentage of every element (down to a minimum of 1%), and its overall weight in grams are given.

[Some back of the envelope calculations suggest that amount of data exceeds the storage capabilities we have, so assume you send queries for a given volume and get back the results.]

You have the resources of a mid-size software company; 100 employees, $100 million in liquid assets, as well as a network you can tap for additional financing as needed.

How do you effectively go around making money (and/or take over the world), without getting killed by every intelligence agency ever?

That's not even close. This /contains/ all the storage we have, and a whole other bunch besides.

The primary issue is that if you only have access to the raw data, you won't have the compute necessary to exploit it properly. If it came with hierarchical summaries, usage would be a lot more feasible.

**** For reference, the actual volume within that shell would be about 10.2 billion cubic kilometers, so you'd have about 1.02 × 10^{25} nanometer-cube-sized spaces within the shell. Each cube would need to specify a position to nanometer precision, plus a list of elements by percentages (to what precision?), and the combined mass of the contents of the cube in grams (to what precision?). Without specified precision it's hard to say exactly how large this would be, but the upper limit should be an exact specification of the number of atoms of each element. For that, we'd be looking at something like less than 100 bytes for each cube depending on how many different elements are present. That leaves us with 1.02 × 10^{27} bytes of data. So, that's maybe a billion times more than the combined data storage capacity of all devices on Earth at present.

You could exploit the data fairly effectively for mining if you just ask for millions or billions of nanometer-sized areas scattered around the world at positions that would place them underground in a location that you would be able to buy mining rights in. That gives you little samplers of the exact geological composition so you could easily locate ore deposits, precious gems, groundwater, oil reserves, etc. Basically, use a stochastic search. You could also, conceivably, build your own hierarchical summary based upon stochastically-collected data to help you analyze the best locations for setting up mines.

****** Thank you, you are close to correct, but calculating for a flat plane. I screwed up on the volume conversion between kilometers cubed and nanometers cubed. I had a brain fart and treated it as 12 orders of magnitude instead of 36 orders of magnitude. The correct answer using spherical volumes is actually ~ 1.02 × 10^{49.}

To get the volume in kilometers cubed: (4/3.0)×pi×(6371+10)^{3} - (4/3.0)×pi×(6371-10)^{3.}

*** Background on this thing's resolution: A nanometer is hella small. An atom is about an angstrom, which is 0.1 nm. Typical lattice parameters for crystals are like 2-3 angstroms. So a 1 nm cube is averaging over something on the order of 100 atoms, and for a good proportion of them the percentages boil down to more-or-less exact atom counts.

*** My first thoughts would be mining, make some sort of a simple ordering function accounting for market value of a material, density, depth etc, and ask for a sorted list of deposits in terms of this ordering. Then pretend you've got a fancy new method for finding this info without telling anyone how it works and start a small but hyper efficient mining operation.

Maybe this could be used for fossils or something, but I doubt you could make any great distinctions with this sort of resolution, and there's not much money to be found here. More generally along this line, I realise I'm thinking down the track of valuable things to be found in the crust of the earth, and other than simple valuable materials, probably the next best thing is underground ruins? I don't know much about the field, but with some research, maybe this is a valuable path to go down. Maybe air pockets of a certain unusual shape? Look for sharp corners?

I don't think this has a whole bunch of utility with regards to doing anything with the populated world, because the data you're getting is rather vague with the whole elemental breakdown thing. How could you read a piece of paper or hear a conversation using such a tool? This makes it kinda worthless for political stuff I'd think.

You could find man made objects on the floor of the ocean, but that seems like it might net you notoriety, not riches. Which is kinda my thought on the ruins and fossils thing too.

Maybe there's some value in being able to chemically analyse objects that already exist but are too valuable to actually break down? If you got isotopic data (I'm lightly massaging the prompt here) you could carbon date anything, but you can't disclose information gotten this way to the world, and it seems a little hard to leverage. Maybe isotopic data could be calculated based off the weight (if it's precise enough) and you have the elemental make up?

*** A high-risk high-reward scheme is to start blackmailing the hell out of people. 1 nanometer resolution is enough to read every printed or written text on any surface within your snapshot, and most of the world still hasn't transitioned to keeping all documents on computers. You will be able to pick just about any target and read through everything in their office/house.

Even better: plenty of people are dumb enough to write down their passwords somewhere so they don't forget. There will be lists of passwords in their wallets or their homes and you can see them all and log in to all their accounts. Emails, banks, offices, social media, you'll have access to several accounts on just about every network on earth.

Now you can either stealthily log in and gain information about your targets for more blackmail, or you can loot them dry through a series of proxies that include the other accounts you stole so you can frame everyone for stealing from everyone else while you secretly make off with the profits.

***** Well, whether this method is feasible depends on how quickly you can send queries, and whether you can send multiple in parallel, or do other kinds of queries like "tell me which of the 1mm3 cubes in this volume of space have high ink content".

The main idea is to do binary search on the house to find any kind of paper, then binary search parts of the paper to determine where the inked volumes are and are not. Since the snapshot has 1 nanometer resolution, this is way more than enough to determine exactly which parts of the paper have ink and which do not, effectively letting you create a picture of the paper and read it.

*** In case of gold, I first have to wonder, what ppm of gold is considered rich enough to be worth mining? If the number is less than 10,000 ppm (=1%), then we have a problem: the artifact cannot detect which site is worth mining. The artifact would only be useful to detect place where purified gold located. This is doubly troublesome for other mine-able stuff, as they're not occurred in nature as un-compounded element. Therefore, lawful mining operation is out.

But the artifact is not useless to seek riches. Consider you want to rob a house, the artifact would be useful to locate where the inhabitant of the house hide their precious metal. Of course, if they store them inside a safe, you'd still need to break it.

Repeating this for many lines should begin to form approximations for land masses, which can be matched up to a map. Once the general position and orientation is found, we need more precision, and we can do that with a series of (elementally) distinct things with progressively smaller sizes.

*** One of my favorite little 5e tricks: the Find Familiar spell allows you to look through your familiar's eyes as an action, and the Misty Step spell lets you teleport anywhere you can see within 30 feet of you. So if you send your familiar somewhere that it can access but you can't, like over an enormous wall, you can circumvent Misty Step's line-of-sight rule as long as it's within 30 feet. My wizard once used it to nope out of a ship's hold: left his familiar aboveboard, then blipped back up when things got dicey.

Namely you can take any container and shrink internal dimensions, to a minimum size of all entrances to the container placed side by side. If another entrance is opened while it is smaller than that it will expand and not shrink again. Shrinking will compress anything inside, but it will push back against the walls, possibly breaking them. Growth will not uncompress anything inside, merely provide room to grow into. At anytime while touching a given container you may change size between proper size and minimum size as rapidly as you wish. How do you use this power?

As rapidly as you wish is extremely exploitable. Above lightspeed size changes are effectively time travel. Below lightspeed size changes that are still at rather high speeds can cause air to literally undergo nuclear fusion. If doing this doesn't drain you dry of energy, it would be a massive source of free energy.

What if there are no entrances? It's simple enough to make a hollow cylinder with no openings. Or simply seal the entrance of a water bottle with clay so it can't be opened without breaking open an entrance. In that case, is there minimum size? Can you shrink everything inside into 0 volume, effectively creating a very low mass black hole? Can you use such a trick to create extremely powerful grenades?

ANY container? What counts as a container? Is there a size limit? Does the Earth's crust count as a container that contains the Earth's core? Can you apply your power to the Earth's crust and cause earthquakes and volcano eruptions everywhere from all the internal magma trying to escape the shrinking space within the Earth?

What's scarier is that the containers are allowed to have multiple entrances, which makes the definition even more vague. Does a fishing net count as a container for fish, even though it is full of holes (entrances)? If so, can you create a very sparse net around the solar system and shrink the space inside to reduce the distance between planets and the Sun? Would clever compression tactics let you bring the orbits of Mars and Venus into the same range as Earth, thus making them much easier to terraform and colonize?

As was noted in the initial question, it was noted that anything inside pushes back. Given that no matter how sparse the filling of the container, attempting to compress a finite amount of matter to a zero dimensional point seems like it would generate infinite pressure, probably not, unless you had a infinitely strong material. A grenade seems like it would work.

While I didn't state it in the initial question, what I was assuming that a container was is a solid shape enclosing a hollow cavity, filled with either vacuum, gas, liquid, or disconnected solid. A fishing net would count as long as it enclosed the volume, but given the minimum size is the total full length of all opening put together, might not be effective. For example, if you have a box with holes on each side totalling half the length of each side, the smallest you can shrink it is half each side length, or 1/8 full size. A fish net, being even sparser would have less effect.
