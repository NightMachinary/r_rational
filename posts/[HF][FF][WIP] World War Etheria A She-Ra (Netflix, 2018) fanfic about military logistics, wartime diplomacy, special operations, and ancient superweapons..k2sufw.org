We're /really/ nearing the endgame. This is also a reminder that this fic updates almost daily.

Fair warning for prospective new readers: this is not a canon-divergece fic, nor is it explicitly rational; it is a more solidly world-built and differently-focused, differently-ordered retelling of the source material, ironing out some of the logical inconsistencies in the show that irked me personally, and throwing in some cool shit I feel like the showrunners missed the opportunity to add.
