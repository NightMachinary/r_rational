*** Is there more than one chapter? It says "Published: Jun 11, 2013", and you're talking about the first chapter, but there doesn't seem to be more. EDIT: nvm, intro says you are "rewriting it all".

I like the writing style. The plot is point for point the same as the manga/anime.

Also it wasn't very smart to not check the time and kill the harasser faster, saving the girl and Light some suffering. He could've said "broken neck" or something as cause of death.

Do also read this: [[http://thefutureprimaeval.net/the-tragedy-of-light/]] . Key part:

#+begin_quote
  Yagami Light had that magic ring. And instead of using it to seize political power for himself -- with a tough-on-crime platform that would be pretty popular and the threat of the notebook itself to keep challengers at bay -- Light instead tries to wield his influence anonymously from the shadows. And so a story that could have ended with Yagami Light on the Chrysanthemum Throne instead has him hunted like a dog.
#+end_quote

So consider that for your story plans, if you haven't. Of course, do continue with whatever you have if you think it is better.

**** At the time it hadn't occurred to Light that he could also set the time of death.

And the plot isn't /exactly/ the same, canon Light didn't do the one-death-per-hour thing. And it'll change more as the story goes on, but spoilers :P

***** So is this still being updated? because on that website it looks like thats the only thing there. Was that just a replacement chapter for the full story which exists somewhere else?

** Well done! I really enjoyed this first chapter, and Light is more intelligent, flawed, and generally interesting this time around. I don't know if you recall, but I beta'd for you last time. If you ever want to add another person to your crew, it'd be my pleasure!

Things to look out for, if I remember correctly what you ended up with last time, would be following canon too closely and messing up the introduction of Misa. In the first version, I recall there being some complaints about her being a bit too perfect -- especially given the constraints on her time. I can't remember how valid those complaints were, but I do remember feeling as though the story went off the rails somewhere, and that she might have had something to do with that. The confrontation between the two of them was great though; seeing something like that again would be awesome. As would seeing ongoing interactions between the two of them, except, unlike in canon, with a version of Misa who is actually a character. There hasn't been enough romance in Rational Fic in my opinion, and LightxMisa has the potential of being both delightfully dysfunctional and really deep/heartwarming. HPMOR showed us what a "rational protagonist" will do for someone important to them, but we haven't seen what a relationship between two such people (especially with not-quite-aligned goals) looks like.

Of course, you might be planning on going in a totally different direction. Whatever your plans, good luck. I'm seriously looking forward to reading :).

** Typo:

#+begin_quote
  "The death note is the bond that ties the human Yagami Light and the shinigami Ryuk together," Ryuk explains. "I know who has touched it, and who owns it. Until you give up ownership of the notebook, or die, you will remember, and see."
#+end_quote

"Ryuk explains" should be "Ryuk explained" so that tense agrees.

** a typo: when Ryuk "loses his pose" it should be poise, unless Ryuk was doing a dramatic pose, which would not be out of character, now that I think of it.

** Nitpick: "...and maybe take over Japan. By become its president, of course."

Shouldn't that be Prime Minister? Seems super extra nitpicky for me to be nitpicking that though seeing as the actual term is 内閣総理大臣
