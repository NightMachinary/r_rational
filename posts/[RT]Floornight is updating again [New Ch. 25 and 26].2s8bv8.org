** Hey, just wanted to comment to tell you guys that although I didn't write anything for a bit, I've just posted a bunch of new chapters. It's now up to Ch. 33 (which is the end of Part 2).

*** It's about ... parallel universes? Monsters from the deep? Alternate timelines? Humongous mecha? A bunch of stuff really. I guess my elevator pitch would be that it's /Sphere/ meets /Cthulhu/, but that's only part of it.

** YMMV, but maan, this is hard to read for me. The setting is very interesting but the presentation is so confusing I had to give up around chapter 17. I guess the style of having a multitude of threads interspersed in chapters just isn't for me; I might come back once the story is finished and read it in chronological order for each character PoV.
