I wonder who?

I really like the Grey Pilgrim, both as a character and as a person. Fortunately, this seems to be a story about coming to terms with a bitter foe, rather than a story about Evil crushing Good. I wouldn't like to see him die.

  Queen Catherine had brutalized the children, but not beyond repair. Antoine's arm had been reattached, and another greatsword found for him to wield. With the coming of dawn, Tariq had been able to Forgive the death of Mansurin. The young man, displaying the famous fortitude of the Champion lines, had only been spurred to greater zeal by his stay Above. Little Sidonia, with her laughing eyes and quick wit, would have to remain under shroud of preservation until tomorrow.
#+end_quote

I'm really starting to sympathize with Black now. Evil has quite a few dangerous weapons on their side, but the amount of trump cards and last-minute saves that the Good side can pull out is getting ridiculous. Fighting against Good does not appear to be the same thing as fighting Evil, and even though the Pilgrim and the Saint are arguably a special case, I'm not sure that Cat has gone up against any truly Good characters so far. (The Lone Swordsman was too edgy to make a good opponent for Cat (get it? /Get/ it?), and most of the other heroes she's fought so far have been relatively insignificant.) This is new for her.

I actually have no idea how Cat is going to wriggle her way out of this situation. She'll probably manage it somehow, but the Pilgrim and the Saint are not opponents she can beat through direct confrontation, especially with the Pilgrim being as genre-savvy as he is. She'll need to come up with a way to cripple the rest of their army before the heroes can engage her again or exert some form of pressure to force them to retreat (threatening future supply lines, political stuff, a more indirect weapon than absolute positioning), but I can't think of any obvious solutions. She's already used her big secret weapon.

Can't wait for the next chapter!

#+begin_quote
  The Pilgrim looked up at mockingly sunny skies. There would be a time, after the war turned here and the Red Flower Vales broke, where the Heavens would assemble their sharpest blade. The ancient forms would be observed. Five heroes, sent into the breach to quell the howling dark.
#+end_quote

A random thought I had: What if Cat ends up replacing one of the five heroes? She's not Good, so whether or not this is possible is iffy, but it would certainly be in character for her to volunteer for this mission. Also, as the Pilgrim has noted, she tends to toe the line between Good and Evil; there might be enough flexibility for her to fit into this niche. Plus, the Good guys might be forced to pick her if Cat keeps murdering her way through the weaker heroes. (If anyone gets replaced, it'll be the Valiant Champion.) Not sure how likely this outcome is, but I'd still love to see it--the interactions between her, Hanno, the Pilgrim, and possibly the Saint would be glorious, even (and perhaps especially) if the Saint snaps halfway through the journey and tries to stab Cat. Which is pretty likely, given that Cat's typical response to aggression is to double down on the sass.

This is prophetic enough that it will probably come to pass, but it could apply to the Woe. None of them have overtly Evil names, and if they win here they are by definition the sharpest blade. The Red Flower Vales (and the Calamities) fall to Empress/Dead King, and The Woe have to stop them. I can see Cat et al crossing the floor if needed.

The problem with this is that there are a ton of ultimate tier heroes they have to surpass/kill to get the spot.

****** I agree that they're an immediate threat, but in the narrative sense, I think it would be pretty strange if she succeeded in killing a decades (centuries?)-old hero with a long history with a cheap trick or even a clever scheme. Maybe if she had already fought the Pilgrim on multiple occasions before and everything was building up to a single massive showdown, she could do it, but even then, it seems unlikely. Pilgrim is basically Gandalf--the wise old mentor who helps the heroes along but isn't necessarily the person to land the final blow. He's not going to die to a villain who isn't really that evil; he's going to go out at a crucial moment, sacrificing himself to let a younger, powerful hero go on and defeat some greater threat. It wouldn't really fit with his character.

The Saint of Swords is more vulnerable in that sense, but she has similar levels of power, experience, and narrative weight. I'd be surprised if Cat was able to kill her without insane amounts of preparation at the very least, which she doesn't appear to have at the moment. IMO, it's more likely that she manages to cripple the army in such a way that they're forced to retreat, either through killing enough troops or more subtle means (politics, supply lines stuff, etc.).

******* The Kensai needs to go down /hard/ before her OP-ness breaks any potential of an enjoyable story.

Armies, magic, siege engines, and Named-tier special abilities that even work on Demons have all had zero effect on her.

She either needs a weakness or a relatively equal opponent to appear soon, because it's really stretching believability as to why she doesn't just jog over to the villain side, assassinate all the Named and ranking officers, and then just wander off for the Muggles to clean up the mess.

** I know I've complained about this before, but it's becoming really weird that every single male Proceran Prince we see is shown to be a scheming, overconfident hypocrite, and every single female Prince is flawed-but-honorable pragmatist.

More generally, I feel like these secondary characters aren't varied enough. We don't really get much personality out of any of them besides "this one is an asshole" or "this one is principled". I wish we'd get more insight into their personality that isn't whether or not they like to scheme, or whether or not they're racist; most of them show very little self-awareness, if any.

Stuff like "This character has no military experience, but he has spent months before the campaign reading every military book he could find. He hope that's going to be enough".

Or "This character usually doesn't like working with Chosen. She's seen them upset the balance of power all too often during the Proceran civil war, making what should have been a sure victory turn into a defeat in a blink. She's been told that such was the natural order of things, for there was no higher arbiter for a war than the Heavens, and that wanting to decide battles through pure armies and logistics was Evil, but she couldn't help empathize with the perspective. It's funny, now that she's facing Evil, with Chosen on her side and logistics on theirs, she still feels drawn to the same perspective. Is it insanity, that she thinks her side ought to lose the coming battle? She tries push out the thoughts, as she addresses the other Princes."

My point is, I think the story should have more characterization that's orthogonal to whether or not they're Evil or honorable or racist; characterization that's no meant to make us like them or dislike them. ([[/u/ErraticErrata][u/ErraticErrata]])

**** It would be oddly amusing if it turned out that the grey pilgrim is sexist.

He's supposed to be the old wizened hero, that dispenses wisdom the protagonist. Now most old fantasy was pretty heavily set in the gender roles, so we can find some basis there that the women are pure princess and victim of manipulation, but PgtE world so far seems relatively egalitarian on the gender issue. Like, there are some things like Goblins being a matriarchy but unless procer is a hotbed of it, there isn't much of a basis for the grey pilgrim to fall into that trap. (Though the title "first prince of procer" being a kind of weird about it, why not first princess?)

*** I think instead of assuming it's a flaw you should attempt a charitable reading. There are plenty of Non-Procerean male secondary characters in the story that don't fit your mould so I doubt this is a simple oversight. Adjutant, Robber, Ratface, Black, Warlock are all hyper-competent.

So what do we know about Procerean society? We know Procerean Princes are scheming because that is the nature of their reality. It's scheme or be out maneuvered and killed, game of thrones style. We also know Cordelia being a woman as First Prince is novel and she purposefully didn't take the feminized title to project power. This implies that while women rule in today's Procer they aren't normally considered Claimants to the grand prize of the throne. Likely, this means women rulers generally do not have to play the "game" of scheming as much as long as they can avoid getting usurped up by a neighboring kingdom during the decades of civil war. Hence a general competence and martial prowess being required for Procean women rulers.
