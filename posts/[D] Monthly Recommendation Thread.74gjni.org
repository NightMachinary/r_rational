** TV:

[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/][The Good Place]] is, well, good. It's managed to be both funny and surprising going into the second season, and I strongly recommend it.

I've been watching a little bit of [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3865236/][Into the Badlands]] recently, and while I can't recommend it on the merits of the plot, the fight scenes are quite nice for a TV show.

[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/][Lucifer]] is still funny, though it seems to have lost a little bit of drama going into the third season (in particular, I think they're drawing out the "Lucifer reveals the truth to the detective" arc too much).

Which Star Treks are good? I've been watching the Orville, which has seemed alright, if slightly underwhelming, and I'm not sure if that's because it's legitimately an average show, or because I'm not the target audience. I haven't watched a whole lot of Star Trek (the "save the whales" movie, /Into Darkness/, and /Darmok/), so I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for which movies/TV series/episodes to people would recommend for comparison.

Books:

It's a long way from new, but I would strongly recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky][A Deepness in the Sky]] to any fan of science fiction. It's my favorite work in the genre, and I think it works well either on its own or as a prequel to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep][A Fire Upon the Deep]].

I wouldn't generally recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dagger_and_the_Coin][The Dagger and the Coin]] series because it's rather dry, but I think this sub in particular would appreciate fantasy that's more focused on economics and philosophy.

I'll second your mild recommendation for /The Dagger and the Coin/, and add that /The Long Price Quartet/ (starting with /A Shadow in Summer/) by the same author is very good, and I found it to be even more in line with this sub, with themes of existential risk, and alien intelligence in addition to the generally good plotting and scheming.

  Which Star Treks are good
#+end_quote

I recommend starting with the middle seasons of The Next Generation. The original series is fun, but can occasionally be cheesy by modern standards. Voyager, Enterprise and the first season of TNG could be anywhere from decent to painful depending on the episode. A lot of people like DS9, but it's a departure from, and in some cases a deconstruction of Roddenberry's formula of peaceful, heroic exploration and extremely secular optimism, so I don't think I'd recommend it as a starting point.

Mid-series TNG, though, holds up well. The writing is smart, the characters are likable, the effects still look decent, and it's probably the best example of the kind of idealistic themes the series is famous for.

I'm one of those, and I'm also the first to admit it's very different from the others. Mostly in that it has an identifiable plot arc, rather than just continuity. But it really doesn't fit into the pattern of the rest of Trek. I see TOS, TNG, and Voyager as forming an irresistible progression. Kirk the explorer, Picard the diplomat, Janeway the warrior. Diplomacy from weakness, equality, and strength.

******* I think it casts a fascinating contrast between two different types of deity.

The Prophets were aloof. They sent divine artifacts to their chosen people which served as cut-and-dried evidence of their existence, but these artifacts ranged from vision quest tools to horribly dangerous time machines. Occasionally, prophecies would be handed down to those who used the Orbs, and these prophecies were fairly accurate, if sometimes inscrutable before the fact. They were reliable, and the general thrust of their interactions with Bajor were positive. It was pretty difficult, as a Bajoran, to think that the Prophets were malevolent. Far away and incapable of answering most prayers, perhaps, but not malevolent.

It's a good religion, and those who truly knew the voice of its deities were good people. You know, the way most religions claim their followers should be.

The Founders, on the other hand, were clearly evil. The only people who worshipped them were those they genetically engineered and brainwashed to worship them. Subservient pawns who received nothing but abuse at their hands and would sacrifice themselves in an instant for their sake. They ruled with an iron grip over countless civilizations, the fear they and their warriors instilled the only binding force. Their crusade brought them to the other side of the galaxy, where they were beaten back by those who relied upon realistic assessments of their own capabilities rather than their reputation and delusions of grandeur.

You know, how most religions wind up playing out.

The scene where Sisko convinces the Prophets to vanish the Jem Hadar fleet coming through the wormhole was the clash between these two religions, and the real religion with good deities handily won by virtue of having never lied about their power. Outside the wormhole they could do very little, that's why they needed the Orbs. But the wormhole itself was their domain, their celestial temple. If the Founders had bothered to listen to the Bajorans and observed their evidence for their religion, they might have realized that. Instead, they lied to everyone including themselves.

Kind of like most real world religions do.

I recently tried some Discworld (which are some of my favorites), but they're a bit young for those yet and didn't really take to them like I'd hoped. My son liked it at least, but it was a bit slow for his taste, and all the puns and references go over his head. Part of the problem might also have been my bored daughter's constant interruptions. Still, my policy is that if they don't actively want me to read it to them, we find something else to read.

Maybe I'm just getting ahead of myself. Still, it'd be nice if there were a few more level 1 intelligent characters in juvenile fiction.

*** For a significant part of my childhood, up to and including high school years, my dad read the Riftwar Cycle to us after supper. The first saga is about Midkemia, a relatively normal fantasy world, as it gets invaded by the Tsurani, humans from another planet who found their way to Midkemia through rift technology and desired the natural resources Midkemia has. The first trilogy is about Pug, an orphan in a relatively minor holding who gets apprenticed to the local magician and eventually gets wrapped up in the war.

The world comes across as surprisingly fleshed out, which is a result of Midkemia being a world the author used for roleplay. He had a rule that to participate you had to add one thing to the world, be it a place or a historical figure or a species, and once he made Midkemia into a setting for a story there were tons of elements scattered around with no grand purpose for the plot behind them, making them feel that much more authentic when you come across them.

As the story goes on and you enter new trilogies, you find that decades may have passed and the exploits of main characters a trilogy or two ago are the stuff of legends. When the master sailor is forced to brave the most dangerous of waters in what amounts to creative suicide and /succeeds/, people talk about it books later.

Of course check them out yourself before reading them to your children, but this was a formative series for me and while it's been quite a while since I read those first books I highly recommend them.

Ah well, that at least gives a few years to maybe read the series on their own before deciding, but I kinda feel like even if they read it to them now or soon it wouldn't traumatize the kids or anything since (if I'm remembering right, please correct me if I'm wrong since this /was/ a long time ago) most of the content in question is subtleties that the kids will just not catch in the first place.

edit: also now that I think about it my dad had a tendency to censor what he was reading at times because he doesn't like swearing or other words like that, so in retrospect my impressions of the writing style could've been significantly different from what it actually was.

**** Sorry, but we did the first two books of Narnia, and although I thought they were great as a kid, I can't figure out why now. It's one deus ex machina after another--heavy on the deus. I honestly have no real problem with the religious stuff, either; it's how I was raised, and the books are supposed to be allegorical.

But there's just no real plot structure in there. Aslan fixes all, and if the children are ever in any danger, it's only due to their lack of faith in Aslan and his inevitable resolution of all plot points. It makes for a very clumsy, ham-fisted story, with extremely little dramatic tension. Character development, such as it is, is usually limited to one character per book, and even when the rest of the characters are not flat, static foils, tired cliches, or mere scenery, his female characters are almost invariably all three.

And then there's the problem of Susan (Google it, or read the story by Neil Gaiman here: [[http://grotesqueanddecadent.tumblr.com/post/21272759751/the-problem-of-susan-by-neil-gaiman]])

I just don't think they are good or satisfying stories, and I can only chalk up their enduring success to how unlike anything else they were when they were written. The fact that a work is intended for children seems to excuse all manner of literary clumsiness, and while I can admit that the Narnia books were quite original in their day, I can't imagine why they've stood up over time. I have to chalk that up to the religious content and the fact that, like I did, most people who've enjoyed them did so as children, without the benefit of any experience with a really gripping narrative.

The omake bit in HPMOR knocking the Narnia books was dead on.

They're pretty easily ignored though and the anime doesn't dwell on them so overall it's a pretty relaxed adventure story that only catches up to reality (i.e. what the characters should really have gone through given the difficulty of what they've attempted and their experience) in the last few episodes.

** So yesterday I bought [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EveryHeartADoorway][/Every Heart a Doorway/]], and ended up more-or-less reading it in one night and morning.

If an intellectual thing can be a mindfuck, this thing is a feelsfuck. /Damn./

Without spoiling, it's /dark/. Like, it takes what ought to be a whimsical magic-boarding-school genre and turns it into regular emotional knife-twists and serial killing. It made me sympathize with the characters even when I was judging them for basically being doubly-abused children with a measure of Stockholm Syndrome, and then it started hurting them /more/, and then it would give little narration details that made it /even worse/.

Or maybe I've just read enough Discworld to immediately compare what happened in /this/ book to the Queen of the Elves, and see a level of darkness that wasn't even there.

Or maybe my real problem is that I've been repeatedly torn away from my roots in life and /am/ my inner child, so I empathize with the characters /much/ too easily.

****** Part of the reason I think you might want thematic redundancy like that is either if you're A) a somewhat polarizing figure or B) you want to create a feeling of false consensus. That is, if you are the kind of guy that a lot of people seem to have a hate boner for, you could write under a pseudonym in order to reach those people, who might not otherwise give your work the time of day. And similarly, you might want to trick people into thinking "oh, well authors A, B, and C think that" because that will cause them to weight whatever you wrote about higher (this is one of the primary reasons that people on the internet use sockpuppets).

****** I'm finding that to be a surprisingly difficult question to answer. I want to answer with works of fanfiction known to this community, comparing apples-to-apples, but unfortunately the set of stories I enjoy and the set of stories I consider well-written are not 1-to-1. Maybe /Luminosity/? But not /Radiance/, which was very poorly done. /Time Braid/, of course, even if it does have its share of problems. /Applied Cultural Anthropology/ showed up recently; I thought it was extremely well written, even if its incompleteness makes it difficult to judge as a whole.

Concerning /The Waves Arisen/, I can say I thought some of the re-imagining of the Naruto-verse was well done, even though I didn't like the grimdark feel it gave the story. Maybe I should ask in turn what makes you think it was well-written? Suppose for a moment that the overtly rationalist elements were removed or downplayed. Can it be considered good in any sense?

So it's weird for me to see you say that after praising Time Braid, since Time Braid has things like Tsukuyomi mindrape almost right away, which is one of the things that turned me off the story (unless that is part of the share of problems you alluded to).

I found Waves Arisen very competently written from a technical standpoint (sentence-by-sentence). At a higher level, the plotting was solid, where I could see how every arc led into the next and it wasn't just a collection of stuff happening. Mostly what I liked, though, was the rationalization of the Naruto verse, as opposed to the didactic rational/ist/ elements. It had a similar appeal to me as something like Mother of Learning, where there was a fantasy world that seemed internally consistent in terms of "who was doing what sorts of things for what sorts of reasons," and it did it without inserting elements into the pre-existing setting that came out of left field (e.g. Time Braid's demon metaphysics which have no precedent in Naruto). Even if you got rid of the lessons about rationality or the anti-deathist stuff, it's still got a coherence that does a lot for me.

Good sentence-by-sentence construction is one thing. Necessary, even, or I won't even read a thing. But insufficient. The plotting of /The Waves Arisen/ was fine. Not superb, but fine. That is to say, it was clearly written from a complete outline that existed at the outset. But scene-by-scene, it was terrible. It's like the author just gave up halfway through every scene, and killed off characters just so he wouldn't have to deal with them or their consequences.
