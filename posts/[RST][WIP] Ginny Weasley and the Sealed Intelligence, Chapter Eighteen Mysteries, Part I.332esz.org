** So, based on this chapter, the only information Ginny is missing is what the Dementor represents and she'd be able to cast the True Patronus otherwise.

Saying this now in case the opposite ends up happening, so I will have agreed or disagreed in advance.

** It's interesting to see how there's such a difference in up/downvotes between the Sealed Intelligence posts here on [[/r/rational]] and over there on [[/r/hpmor]]. It has been very consistent, too, after it first started to dip over here.

*** After seeing this comment, I decided to plot it. On both subreddits, there was a large drop between chapters 1 and 8. On [[/r/HPMOR]] there was about an 80 point drop before the scores started oscillating around 20, while here the scores started just over 50 and dropped to zero. Given that there are 2850 subscribers here, and almost 8000 there, I don't think there is a significant difference.

**** /nod

I was paying attention the percentage of upvotes, but this is also interesting.

**** I'd figured that [[/r/rational]] and [[/r/hpmor]] had similar tastes, given that HPMOR seems to be why this subreddit is a thing in the first place, but the difference in upvote percentages (for example, 38% here as opposed to 76% over there) seems to trash that idea.

***** I think the issue may be more about the purpose of the subreddits. [[/r/hpmor]] upvotes it because it's an HPMOR fanfic. [[/r/rational]] downvotes it because the protagonist (or, at least, the main character -- unclear if she's actually a protagonist) is not actually behaving all that rationally. She certainly is not behaving like a rational/ist/, despite professing an interest in becoming one.

NOTE: I'm not saying that this is a bad story. Simply that it's not a good fit for a subreddit devoted to rational(ist) fiction.

****** With this in mind, I'm considering the possibility of writing something more targeted at [[/r/rational]] when I'm done with GWSI, though on a /much/ more sporadic update schedule.

******* I'll look forward to reading it. Whether or not this is a good fit for the subreddit, I like your writing style.
