Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I've been playing through Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney after its release on Steam, and it's got me wanting something that at least /tries/ to be realistic to how courtrooms and the law actually work, rather than effectively being a detective game in a courtroom setting. Does anything like that exist? A courtroom game where you could make actual/accurate objections like "question lacks foundation" or "relevance" or "hearsay" or something like that?

(Though I've been happy enough with PW:AA on the basis of what it is, it's just not got a lot to do with actual law.)

*** They don't exist, probably. Things like that are subjective, or carried by the lawyer's persuasive ability. And real courtroom procedure is designed to be as boring as possible. The Ace Attorney Investigations spinoff is good in that it is just a straight detective game, where (hypothetically) you combine facts into logical statements, and logical statements into hypothesis. But if you want actual lawyer shenanigans you might need to make that game yourself.

**** Oh, I'm already thinking about how I would design a more correct legal game. It would probably take a ton of work just to do a proof-of-concept first case, but you could have a jury selection phase, opening statements, witnesses, expert witnesses, closing statements, etc. Maybe more than that, if you wanted to expand outside the courtroom, like, I don't know, being with your client as they're answering questions with the police.

And yes, a lot of being in the courtroom is boring, and a lot of arguments are subjective/nuanced in a way that doesn't lend itself to selecting different dialogue options. But I'm thinking about the way that /Return of the Obra Dinn/ did things, and I'm thinking that you could get something close to that. Maybe each line of dialogue could be objected to, with reasonableness rankings for each of the options, e.g. you could object on the grounds that it's hearsay, or irrelevant, and whether or not the objection was accepted would depend on the background numbers assigned by the developer. Sustained objections then help to alter either a global meter, or an individual meter for various parts of evidence and/or witness/defendant credibility.

(You'd still have to (or want to) play fast and loose with courtroom procedure, since the typical case isn't filled with objections, but it would still in theory be closer than Phoenix Wright is.)

Edit: Obviously, I'm hoping that someone has already made such a game.

Anecdotally, there might be more games or similar resources aimed at criminal justice majors in the future, apropos of a lunch chat with a bar president about pattern recognition and AI's impending takeover of the legal system. Algorithms are supposedly slated to replace judges in sentencing suggestions and will probably be relegated more duties wherever empirical pattern matching can improve the subjectivity of "justice." So if AI doesn't outright replace the industry, there oughta be more stuff. It seems the textbook-adjacent industry has already got [[https://www.objection.com/sub-page/products/all-games/][a money-grubbing foot in]]. These "games" might not give the same dopamine kick as an ace attorney saving the day though.

*** It's an intersting idea.

I suspect the main limitation will be financial. You'd have to hire at least one lawyer to consult on your plot and game design, and lawyers who're any good get expensive fast, while independent game development tends not to make much money.

​

That games like MS flight simulator, Kerbal Space Program, Fam Simulator and Bus Simulator make money, implies at least a niche market for a highly detailed law simulation game probably exists. But I can't guess at how big that market might be.

​

The otehr problem would be that there are laws about non-lawyers providing legal advise, and a game that lets you run a legal case of your own crafting in a simulated courtroom and get a simulated verdict which you present as being "realistic" is close enough that you might want to be carful about it, as if any profession is going to make an effort to defend their protectionist laws in court it's lawyers.

** I'd like to recommend [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com][All Night Laundry]], a webcomic with themes of time travel, eldritch horror, and genre-savvy protagonists. The author committed to a page-a-day at the start, and it has been running for /seven years/ without missing a beat. It looks like it's finally, /finally/ wrapping up and seems to be tying up all the loose ends, so now is a good time to jump in and ride out the final few months.

Beyond that I don't have much to throw out right now. It's a bit of a dry spell for me- every serial fic I'm reading is either on break or updating very slowly, and I haven't come across much finished work that I haven't already read or dismissed in the last year.

Maybe it's time to start writing a serial fic of my own with all this free time.

** Some time ago someone recommended [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][Embers]], an Avatar: The Last Airbender fic. It's definitely worth reading, even if the story itself is a bit mediocre and ends in a disappointing manner. The original premise is that the Crossroads of Destiny episode of the original show does not result in Zuko betraying Iroh and the Avatar, but the fic starts somewhat before that episode so that it has time to ensure the dominos result in that effect, and it eventually ends up diverging fairly hard. It starts shortly after the start of the second season, with Iroh and Zuko traveling the countryside alone as fugitives.

(Oh, and I'm quite certain that this isn't readable if you aren't familiar with the show; if you weren't able to follow the above paragraph in your head you won't be able to follow the work. Entire episodes occur mid-text without much more than a passing reference, even after it begins to diverge.)

The real benefit to the work is the high-quality worldbuilding. The entire world of Avatar is reframed and fleshed out: the various factions, kingdoms, and movements are tweaked to be more consistent, more distinct, and have much more of a cause-and-effect relationship.

As an example, Sozin's warmongering is due to Sozin having too much draconic ancestry, making him vengeful and bloodthirsty. The Fire Nation is forced to follow him due to the Fire Nation being bound to the whims of a single Fire Lord (rather than the feudal system of old, which was self-correcting). The Fire Lord's position was created by decree of Avatar Kyoshi, which has spiritual weight. Kyoshi made the decree due to the Fire Nation not accepting the responsibility for rogue pirates staffed by ex-citizens. And Kyoshi only got involved because one of her own was killed by those pirates. None of the major events in Embers (or the parts of the canon show that it borrows) exist in a vaccum; everything is someone reacting to something, and once details are revealed it's usually the case that everyone had at least a shred of justification. It feels very realistic, politically.

The Air Nomads benefit the most from the reworked worldbuilding; their pacificity is both explained and lambasted (the author frequently mentions that they have a hard time steelmanning Aang's position, yet does so admirably anyhow). The Water, Air, Earth, and Fire nations borrow heavily from the real-world Inuit, Buddist, Chinese, and Japanese cultures they were based on to great effect. The spiritual ramifications of "bending is a gift of the spirits" have much more concrete results (and even weaknesses!), and spirits in general are much more 'real' and present in the world than just as Avatar-bait.

The author does an excellent job of weaving their new lore in with canon quite seamlessly, to the point that I'm certain I'll have a hard time keeping it straight from canon in the future. As an example, Sokka at one point notes that when the Gaang find Monk Giatsu's skeleton among others at the Southern Air Temple, there were no child bones in spite of the temple having a large youth population. After confirming that the Northern Air Temple did have such skeletons (buried out of respect by the earth kingdom inhabitants of that temple), he suspects that either the Air Nomads had prior warning or the Fire Nation did something with those survivors. The real reason that's the case in canon is Doylist, but it's a perfectly justified Watsonian observation, and this ends up a subplot of its own.

All in all, A+ worldbuilding, A- characterization (the character's voices are an excellent rendition of the show's), B- pacing (it's slow, albeit satisfyingly so), C- plot and ending, tho for what it's worth this is only obvious in retrospect; the plot was engaging enough until it was over.

If you're looking for an example of how to make the setting of a work rational, or how to make characters think and still have conflict, this is it.

I posted this question after finding qntm's /Ra/ on Kindle, and rediscovering how much of a better reading experience a dedicated e-reader is than a browser.

Also, I'd rather not bias the recommendations by specifying a specific preference, since I kinda like looking in to whatever people have been enjoying recently.

Worst for me is that the very long-lived elves are basically just short longer living humans. That's it, no thought was given to develop them beyond that. And then we find out that (iirc) wealthy elves can pay magic users to be ageless and healthy. Also no apparent societal repercussions.

How different would a society be if the ruling class were basically immortal? How would they function, how would things change? How would the outlook of a person who doesn't have old age mortality to motivate them be, with regards to ambition, family, conflict resolution and so on? Would people resist risky occupations, if death were a comparatively bigger deal? Would they institute mechanisms into their society to prevent stagnation, or would they even have a negative connotation to freezing conventions and failing to change?

To all this and so much more, the answer is: No, they're not at all different to just pointy eared, short humans with magic. Blergh.

There's some fun examination of some rational topics. I'll give it a soft rec because there are some irritating anti-rational tropes:

- Bob is an easy-goin' guy who stays easy-goin' even when knowingly engaged in a conflict where all sides have access to exponential growth tech. Bob's growth delays should be fatal.

- Bob picks a winner in an evolutionary race due to emotional attachment (“prime directive, bah!”), then plays tribal deity for tens of thousands of words. It could have been an interesting uplift sidestory, but is largely cliche filler.

- virtualxhuman romance sidestory so cringeworthy, I almost stopped reading.

- no one wants to upload despite the physical human race being threatened with imminent total extinction.

- relativistic kill vehicle is super secret “hail mary” option that only the protag considers, instead of being a core military consideration by all parties.

*** (review without spoilers)

I've been reading the aSoIaF fic 'King Robert's Crown', [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bauwc6/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ekeb177/?context=1][recommended last week]]. It's a solid fic, I've enjoyed it. The writing is pretty good, particularly in the beginning. The innovation of having the SI not be a POV character is interesting, it definitely gave the fic a different feel to most Self-Insert fics. I was about 60% of the way through and rapidly losing interest, but then the author finally started to throw down some curve balls and stuff started to go wrong, which reignited my interest enough to finish .

Thanks for the rec, [[/u/XxChronOblivionxX][u/XxChronOblivionxX]]!

It does have its problems, mostly in that it takes almost 100k words to really get to a significant point of diversion from canon, in terms of major events anyway, if not characters. Additionally, the SI is totally a mary sue(as usual), and the fic feels very much like a fixfic for most of it, which I would normally hate, but it's something I've never encountered before with aSoIaF so I was able to persevere until shit started to go south. Also, the timeline is often confused, chapters have very little exposition outside of dialogue, and the author writes with no regard for establishing characters or setting. If you never read the books or watched the show, I imagine this fic will be very dry, but that's a very common fault with fanfics, so no points off.

Finally, I wish the SI would have introduced more innovations. What captured my interest in the first place was that I thought there would be more "uplifting", but that was very low key. I can only think of three or so things off the top of my head. Oh well.

*Verdict:* A solid aSoIaF SI fic that tries something new, and pulls it off decently well. 4/5

--------------

Additional thoughts: I would like to someday read an actual rational fic of aSoIaF that tries to plausibly explain how the world of aSoIaF is the way it is, beyond the doylist "GRRM is a middle ages/chivalry weaboo who's bad at geography and logistics". How does a feudal society that spans a continent larger than north america remain so (relatively) stable with early medieval tech and political institutions? Even with dragons, I don't think it would work. How did technology fail to advance? Have they been stuck in 12th century european technology for what, 4 centuries? Longer? Add to that the unpredictable seasons...

How do low tech humans survive even 1 year of winter, let alone 5 or 10 years. It seems to me that people wouldn't venture too far north with such a massive disincentive without a substantial upside to living in a land that's so deadly. The less affected southern regions would dominate the northern regions, if only by virtue of being able to sustain a much larger population that doesn't half die or starve to death every arbitrary number of years.

It would be interesting if all the north would have built castles on geothermal sites like winterfell, rather than it being a special feature that's unreplicable. Such a boring trope. Congregating at these sites come winter would go a long way to explaining how the north manages to survive.

How do animals and plants survive that? It would be interesting to examine the adaptations that the local flora and fauna would have.

**** Playing devil's advocate in defense of canon:

The government "stability" was due to dragons: unbeatable, terrifying, and magically fast flyers. Tyranny isn't too unreasonable when you can fly out and roast anyone anywhere without real resistance. Also the winters incentivize strong central governments, anyone who doesn't have one to stockpile and defend them dies in winter.

Technology isn't always progressing like we are currently used to, for most of human history the "golden ages" were in the past before they fell and things fell apart with tons of examples in Egypt, China, Greece and Rome. For most of history technology ebbed and flowed to an extent, horse's were the best transportation until less than a hundred years ago now. Also again, the winters and magic probably knock everything back periodically.

I think all you need to make the world's food logistics possible is magically rich cold/winter hunting:

1. Winter warping government and culture answers a lot of questions, we hear a lot about how they've survived in the past and are preparing for the next one (a lot of tell don't show in my opinion). They've survived insane winters by having strong governments that stockpile astronomical amounts of food, not being urbanized. You don't need much tech to just hunker down with enough food, hunt (magical?) winter animals, and defend against those animals. Southerners stockpile more, northerners hunt and tolerate cold more.

2. My understanding of the North, and people's hatred of them, is they survive largely by hunting, raiding, and fishing. There'd have to be some magic supporting wildlife numbers to support them all or an abundance of seafood we don't hear about. When it gets colder they just move down as they get uncomfortable, thus their nomadic styled life and southern people's hatred of them. They don't get crushed due to low tech levels, warrior lifestyle, and homefield advantage cold (that periodically travels south).

3. Agreed that I wish there were more heat forts since presumably every other northern fort has to get abandoned every long Winter. A cave fort, volcanic, or just natural springs to normalize the temperature would add cool themes.

4. With just a few efficiency tweaks animals could super hibernate through it, or be like woodland frogs and literally freeze then come back. A lot of our plants as seeds can survive for absurd amounts of time without growing, Michigan State University has an ongoing experiment with seeds 120 years old that still germinate, without any direct selection. Aside from these, wildlife could just migrate south or recolonize North every cycle.

TLDR: Magic away the food logistics (imagine trying to keep vermin out of years worth of food!) and it might work. Culture is incredibly flexible and could explain the rest.

***** From checking the wiki, the last dragon in westeros died 130 years or so before the events of the novels. So the argument that they provided stability doesn't really fly(hah) for almost half the reign of the Targaryen's 290 year reign. I agree with the rest.

In the middle ages famines were pretty common and devastating. Imagine a famine the year before a long winter... I think a decent explanation for the sustainability of their society would be no crop pests and a more consistent climate during the seasons. Pests reduce yields by a lot, and unseasonable weather in springs and summers caused a lot of famines, even up to recent history.

****** Yikes, 130 years is a long time to rule without your superweapons. Fear of them hatching new ones certainly helps for awhile after, the only other explanation I can think of is inertia? Relying on dragonpower prior leaves them with a very fresh, although green, military and people that haven't been able to think about organized rebellion against the dragons for generations before. Throw in some divinity/magic and decent rulers (that got worse every generation)?

I'd actually expect them to handle famine pretty well, since they need to be stockpiling huge amounts whenever it's not winter. What's one bad year when you're always preparing for a possible generation long winter?

They'd also have less blights. They can't have huge long term monocrops outside of the deserts due to periodic winters and the variety of climates going from South to North, unless the blight can survive on the stored seeds or food it would get wiped out every winter. The winters help get rid of parasites and insects (I actually don't recall any insects in the show?) so that would significantly help low tech yields.

So yeah, maybe yields could be high enough without magical food sources. (I guess you could also cheat and just claim their plants/soil are just better than ours too.)

I will say that westeros is a good deal larger than China is or ever was. The equivelant of going from Sunspear to Winterfell is farther than New York to LA, for example. Also china has a long tradition of civil service and bureaucrats, as well as sharing similar cultures and history and a sense of nationality(somewhat, anyway). Westeros is basically 9 different countries that all hate their neighbors which is ruled by jocks, and their bureaucrats (maesters) seem pretty sparse.

  Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

  I gaped at her. "Was that your plan?"

Hermione is forced to rethink some of her stupidly idealistic ideas (though she doesn't lose her moralistic view of reality), and all-in-all, they complement each other nicely.

It is leaning toward romance (hinting at it), which often I'm averse to because it's done so stupidly and seems so unrealistic, but that is not the case here.

There are some interesting explorations of magic--warding and permanent enchantments, etc.

He has a nigh spiritual experience due to his designer clothing that washes away his insecurities. He has the confidence to approach a woman at a bar because of his designer clothing (this is emphasized). She becomes interested in him largely because of - you guessed it - his designer clothing. When they have sex, she wears his designer clothing, etc, etc.

^^^ this is the content of the book.

I think Lockhart could be a good funny full of themselves SI, you have a lot of opportunities to be funny with the arrogance, but the problem is the SI keeps it up in their internal monologue and it's so grating. I think I got to chap 8 or 9.

***** Weaponizing advanced mind magic makes for a lot of paranoia... so if it's an entire society, it might be a constant state of cold war if defenses aren't equally adequate (mind-melded coalitions?). I don't know of any fiction that goes deep into the magic aspect, but you might be interested in mind magic in real life, AKA mentalism. There's a lot of quacky stuff out there, but for the layman, methods of manipulating perception and instilling suggestions are as good as magic.

****** What about defense? Imagine being able to go into a poker game knowing they won't be able to read your face.

***** Sci-fi rather than magic, but Glasshouse, by Charles Stross, sounds right up your alley. People periodically purge old memories when life gets stale, and are living in the wake of a way against a memory-editing virus spread by infected humans.

I remember really liking this story, but I actually can't remember what happened in it well enough to give more detail.

​

This one might be controversial. Harry is...too competent, and there's some bashing of Harry's family that abandoned him in favor of his brother, the "real" Boy Who Lived. Now, there /IS/ a reason for their actions, but if my family used the reasons that they did to abandon Harry with the Dursleys, I would still hate them, and probably think they're honestly unimaginative idiots. Over time, some of his family redeem themselves, which is rare in fics where you have serious bashing, and a sign that the author at least is attempting to use it as a plot device rather than a personal vendetta.

Basically, Harry's more than a bit Mary-Sue, but...I still enjoyed this story, and I continue to read new chapters when they come out. There's a lot of explanation and development of the world and backstory, as well as exploration of magic, mind magic, etc. It also features a hyper-competent Lockhart, which is one of my favorite tropes.

Overall, YMMV, but this story does definitely get into mind magic, and specifically the ways you can augment your own thoughts and perceptions with it.
