Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have the power to retcon your own actions.

Specifically, there's a mental button in your mind that you can push whenever you are conscious and want to. Pushing this button rewinds time all the way back to the last time you woke up. Everyone except you will have their memories of everything that happened since you woke up erased.

But, from the time you woke up until the time you pressed the button, you are now stuck in a magical coma that you absolutely cannot wake up from, preventing you from using your memories of the future to do whatever you want in the past.

What can you do with this ability?

*** Gambling jumps out at me as an obvious exploit. Place double or nothing bets and undo them if you lose.

A slightly fancier version has you using a second person. You give instructions: tomorrow morning, check if I'm in a coma. If so bet $1M on black, then wake up and bet $1M on red.

**** Optimizing this a bit, book a room at a casino for a few days to minimize the travel time from your bed to the roulette table. Go to the floor and bet everything on a single number as soon as you wake up, resetting if you don't get it. Using a low chance, high payoff bet lets you burn through probability/payoff faster, so the extra time you spend in a coma each iteration is lower. The final timeline is you sleeping in for a few hours then walking down to the table and immediately making one bet for 35x your money. Repeat tomorrow, or today if naps let you reset. You might want to spend the evening drinking so people don't question your sleep schedule / lack of judgement.

(Betting straight up at roulette has the lowest odds of any casino game I know, but you could use up to around 1:100 odds if you can find one; assuming it takes you five minutes to get out of your room and down to the floor, that'll take about eight hours.)

*** You can also recon-away the cost of learning information.

For instance, you could have a doctor perform exploratory surgery on a patient, send the info to the looper, and have the looper send the information back in time.

That way, you still learn if your patient has cancer, but don't have to have them cut open

** In a world with speedsters, energy blasters, and a grizzly bear who shows up to maul evildoers in unexpected circumstances (and /only/ unexpected circumstances), you have the rather C-list power of "super good at math." Yes, you could prove the Riemann hypothesis in as much time as it takes you to write everything out, but you're no more interested in "solving" mathematics problems for a living than most people would like to spend a lifetime writing their name over and over again. You want /excitement/, and by Great Caesar's Ghost you're going to get it if it's the last thing you do.

How do you leverage your power in order to become a beloved superhero or feared supervillain whose name will be whispered in awe or horror for years to come?

(Either option is fine.)

*** Is it just "math", or does it extend to related fields?

Can you use your power to code super efficient bug-free programs? What if you encoded programs as mathematical formula to trigger your power? What if you encoded literally any problem you had as a math problem?

What about passwords and encryption? Encryption at its core is simply math, could you use your power to break it? Take over anyone's account and do whatever you want with it?

**** I think that you'd have a straightforward time doing those things, but you'd need to still e.g. learn how to code before you could apply your mathiness to it. Like, it seems plausible to me that one could "encode programs as mathematical formula," but /not/ plausible that one could do this without first having any knowledge of programming.

*** Can I use math (specifically, statistics) to make probabilistic predictions about the future?

It'd likely help if I first take a brief course in Python and then rent some time on a supercomputer to handle the heavy calculations. But I can then make a fortune by exploiting rare mathematical trends on the stock market, or perhaps finding a mathematical exploit to the lottery.

My fortune will then allow me to purchase Batman-level gear, along with my own supercomputer. My (computer-enhanced) ability to predict the future will allow me to predict the likely targets of future supervillains, and set up ambushes for them (superglue to stick down speedsters, and so forth); I can make myself a name and go with the catchphrase "You villains are /so/ predictable." Of course, I only personally turn up when I have a 99+% chance of surviving the encounter; otherwise, I send a tip-off to the Hero Society. I don't need the credit for those guys - getting them off the street helps my hero career by helping me survive.

It'll work very well, because I'll be in a perfect place to catch villains who act predictably. And villains who act /un/predictably? Well, they're going to meet the Bear, sooner or later, whenever they least expect it.

I get this data by:

a) Breaking into other peoples' surveillance systems and camera networks

b) Creating my own satellite-based surveillance system using my stock market/lottery money

c) Eavesdropping on and decrypting what other people think are secure communications channels

However, in order to preserve the integrity of my information, I also:

d) Create a small army of autonomous camera drones, which I claim to be the source of all my information.

****** To me it's being able to look at a problem and figure out how to apply the mathematical knowledge I have to simplify it. A part of this is learning lots of techniques, another is having a strong intuition for what concepts to apply in a given scenario, another is having the ability to analyse the situation and create new techniques to solve the problem.

** You have been selected to test an experimental space technology: a "Relativity Compensator". It will make your spaceship immune to the effects of time dilation: If you travel to Alpha Centauri from Sol at 80% the speed of light, it will take about five years to get there AND you will age about 5 years during the trip, instead of coming home to find your girlfriend 10 years older than you.

This seems like mostly an inconvenience that just makes subluminal space travel take longer for the traveler, but is there a way to munchkin it?

*** Yes. You're basically messing with the flow of time over a limited area. With a few tweaks, you can probably do the same thing to a non-moving spaceship; you could age wine in seconds, you could put a supercomputer on your spaceship and do a million years worth of computing in a day!

***** Maybe, maybe not. There's a very big step between merely altering the rate of flow of time and actually messing with causality.

I'm not seeing any evidence that the Relativity Compensator helps us to break causality in any sort of meaningful way; merely speed up or perhaps slow down time.
