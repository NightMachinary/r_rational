** General thoughts in chronological order of reading:

- The point about Akua being lonely as a result of the insane competitiveness of her upbringing was interesting. You can almost treat her as a tragic figure, emotionally stunted and grasping for the only way she knows of to get approval, power and respect. Makes me a think of those kids who are trained from five to be athletes, dancers or piano prodigies. They end up kinda messed up in the head. It seems like her mother raised her a similar way but with power and magic as the focus. Even her father who seems to have an almost normal relationship of love and affection with her mainly related to her by teaching magic.

- The idea of the “Fourfold Crossing” test as being cleansing also gives us a hint of how she thinks. Seems like a lot of her ideology is a kind of refined self interest. Where being true to yourself means not having contradictions, even if that means being 100% evil its still being true to who you are. Cat regardless of her circumstances made the same choice in all the scenarios. Seemingly black didn't in his?

- ““That's your first mistake,” I said. “Thinking I'm only now beginning.”” Reminds me of a certain famous moment in Watchmen.

- Nice to see Cat actually having prepared for a fight by thinking about tactics and benefitting from that. Makes a nice contrast to what was alluded to earlier about her habit of recklessness. Only really works because Akua is so predictable though. Against a smarter enemy it wouldn't. Akua always thinks of herself as the only clever one.

*** I think one of the most interesting point of the "Fourfold Crossing" is the contrary of what you think. You may say Cat acts in a kind of self interest, but the three other "what if" show something really important. No matter the way she could have choose (General/hero/underground lady), Callow DOES end very very badly. Her current path was as she said, the best way for the country. When she said things about how the things would go with Praes kicked out, one could say "yeah, but it's all theorical, it's not sure".

Now, she IS sure. She saw the other possibilities. Sure that her way is definitely the best way she could have done things, and thus, she will even more believe she is doing the right thing. It can be good, or it can be bad. But she will even less hesitate, now.

**** That depends entirely on how the crossing works. It has be based in something and it seems like it using the target's mind as a basis to generate hypothetical scenarios instead of literally being able to traverse time in multiple directions seems much more likely. And if it is based off the target's mind then biases could play a pretty big role in determining how the pathways flow and ultimately converge.

option A, Black just didn't know, and if Cat hadn't known, she wouldn't have stabbed either. Stabbing seems logical for at least 2 out 4, Cat herself and White Knight, General was also in it for Callow, but what about the Toltaker, seems out of character for her?

option B. Black's 4 lives are vastly more different than Cat's, if they diverge at a similar point (So black doesn't become the Black Knight) then presumably in one life he lead the life of a farmer or something in that vein.

option C. Blacks pragmatic nature lead him to bargain or cut his losses in several worlds.

** Waiting until Wednesday is gonna kill me.

EDIT: So, the Fourfold Crossing was the trial, and Akua herself is the monster. Interesting. It's pretty likely that this tenth exchange will be the pivot.

My theory, here, is that Akua will attempt to usurp Cat's Winter powers (like in the Crossing-vision), but the fact that Cat is in Arcadia will fuck with that. Cat herself mused within the last few chapters that fey were weaker (for lack of a better term) in Creation because they need to fit into reality.

Edit2: Found the passage I was thinking of.

#+begin_quote
   I should have understood it properly then, because what were even the most powerful of the fae but Named with the weight of millennia behind them? It was why they'd lost. Because when they'd come down to Creation, to this messy battlefield of ours, they'd been forced to fashion themselves into people. In Arcadia, they were perfect: not in the sense of flawlessness, no, but in the way that a cog in a machine fit exactly the form and purpose it was meant for. A god made to masquerade as a mortal had the fatal flaw of perfection removed from the perfect.
#+end_quote

While Cat isn't truly fey, she is closer than a regular person, so I don't think she'll get a huge power boost (though she effectively has 2 Names right now) from this, but she should get some benefit from it.

Not exactly. It's widely accepted that /heroes/ left to certain death will come back at the least opportune moment. Hell, the current White Knight explicitly calls on this at one point (saying "We couldn't possibly survive this! Let's do it!").

Akua definitely isn't playing a hero role here, and she definitely doesn't have the providence that heroes do.

This is not to say that Akua is definitely dead and gone (someone guessed her *claim*ing the portal to Arcadia, and I find that likely - if she even needs to). Just that Cat isn't insane for doing this against another villain.

Brilliant.

--------------

Cat was dominating from the very beginning. Diabolist never stood a chance.

Nice use of the villainous monologue. I was actually shaking my head at the beginning, because you'd think that Cat would know better than to launch into a monologue - Akua even hangs a lampshade on it, pointing it out - but, evidently, Cat was playing chess while Akua was playing checkers.

She should have killed Black as soon as he failed the trial. Classic blunder, and a massive mistake from someone who was thus far admirably avoiding the idiot ball. I wonder why she didn't, actually.

Akua's as good as dead now. Neither of them have used an aspect, but I have a feeling that Cat's prepared for that eventuality. The only question is, what is Cat's endgame with stepping into Arcadia?

The fact that Akua knows about and uses it points to it being Praesi (she seems the type to disdain using non-praesi workings), so probably during the civil war. I just said 'before/during' to give a general time period.

I suspect Akua going to Arcadia is part of Cat's plan. First, it's where Cat's power is at its strongest and, more importantly, stories and narratives hold more weight there. Since Squire is much more adept at manipulating the story being in Arcadia would be a huge benefit to her.

** You know, for a chapter that starts the direct phase of confrontation between Squire and Diabolist, it's surprisingly self-contained. No references to next parts of their respective plans, exact number of turns proclaimed at the outset of the fight and all of them carried out by the end of it, even the beginning of the next chapter (Akua having to follow to Arcadia, where Cat has more power, story not limited by the laws of Creation and fairies that can't touch her) is relatively clear.

The only loose thread remaining is, well, Black. Who's still stuck in Liesse, with whatever Akua's monster is, most of her mages and wight. And Thief with about a company of sappers freshly out of goblinfire.

I gingerly hope for another interlude, now from PoV of the remains of Diabolist's staff, in style of what TVTropes would call Mook Horror Show.

In that case, how is she planning to keep Black alive? My guess would be that he is also in Liesse (or at least accessible from there, hmm, he might not be in Liesse, but still, there's a chance that he is there); meaning the goblinfire would engulf him as well, correct?

Also, although it is somewhat likely that Ubua's phylactery is hidden somewhere in her city of power, it's not /that/ likely and so I don't think I can hope for it getting destroyed here :( Any thoughts on how Ubua is going to come back if she doesn't get in on Cat's gate?
