** Is anyone worried about what happened to Elvis? It was mentioned he went straight to heaven, no death involved. Just a shoutout to Elvis conspiracy mythos, or is The King making a return?

Wait-

The King

Who went to heaven like Enoch

The... /Other King?/

  Furthermore, I am a placebomancer. These things have their own logic. When a young woman with a mysterious past comes to you bearing strange secrets and offering to join you, you take her. If she has no apparent skills or abilities, you super take her. If you hurt her, bad things will happen to you. If you take her, then, when all else is lost and your own power avails you nothing, she hands you victory in some totally unexpected and hilariously ironic manner.
#+end_quote

Excellent decision, Mr. Alvarez. But most of those guarantees are centered around the protagonist - and considering how long it's been since your last appearance, I don't think you're the protagonist of this story. How does that play into your trope-centered morality?

Though, placebomancy does line up quite nicely with Ana's recent revelation in Panama, which strongly hints everyone's the protagonist of their own story. But even then, the p-zombies of Africa can't be protagonists, so is there anyone else who isn't?

*** That really is incredible. The big businesses (they say) think that what they are doing is for the good of the world, and so do the UU, and so does Unsong, and so does the cometspawn. Even ziggurat boy is just trying to build his sandcastles.

It seems like the Other King is a complete antagonist, but we just haven't had his perspective yet. His soldiers (at least two) thought he was bad, but maybe he's fighting a secret war against Thaumiel or something? Keeping him contained?

On that note, since the siege of hell, where has Thaumiel been?

**** Being a diplomat, probably. Once his invasion was thwarted, it seems that Thamiel spent most of his time chipping around at the edges of the world - the Madrid Conference and so on. Time is on his side, after all.

(I don't think we've seen him since Madrid, though. Which leaves over 20 years for him to start up some new machinations.)

The gateway to Hell is in Russia, and the Other King is based in the Southwest USA, so I don't think he could attack directly. He's in a good spot to push back the Drug Lord, though. If he's interested in that - he apparently lets people sell peyote in his capital.

****** Yeah, right after Madrid happens, TCK shows up on Uriel's cloud to talk to him and Sohu about what happened.

I don't think we have an exact timeline for the siege of hell, but Madrid happened in 1991 (as it did historically), and the chapter where the crew of /Not A Metaphor/ meets up is in 2002, and says that the Comet King went to find Metatron 5 years before. So the siege of Hell and TCK's death happened between 1997 and 2002.

** I wonder that Dylan was putting so much effort into writing snark that is, while good and interesting, not the central part of his work. After all, it's not like Dylan's gonna win a Nobel Prize for Literature or anything... but on the other hand, having excessive snark might be all to the good for a BOOJUM.

Brian Young's name reminds me a lot of Adam Young, who was the Antichrist from Terry Pratchett's Good Omens; Brian was a friend of his who faced down the Horsemen of the Apocalypse Pollution; I wonder about Brian's role in Unsong?

A pretty fun and amusing chapter. I hope that Erica has the Vital Name, and that Elvis is the Other King.

*** I think he's taking it as part of establishing his image as a non-villainous protagonist. When I see it like that, it does make sense: he's trying as hard as he can to make the tone of the scene lighthearted enough that he can send bombs to people without being seen as a villain.

A world in which the deepnet's currency is lewd anime pictures suddenly makes Unsong a lot more attractive. Though I wonder about the course anime takes in this world.

*** Hard to imagine, given that the internet can't do video or audio. Given his statements, I would imagine images work (Unless he's /mailing/ those pictures) so I suppose the old tradition of passing along the tapes still exists.

Still, given that broadcast TV isn't a thing, either there's a lot more direct-to-video anime than in our universe or there's a large enough demand for playing anime in theaters.
