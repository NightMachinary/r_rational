** Hello, first off just wanted to say that I have really been enjoying this story. I discovered it only a few days ago and sped through the whole thing (which I normally do not do) because of how high the quality is. This latest fight scene was really great and definitely lived up to my expectations.

The one thing I was curious about is the moral ramifications of Dragon Ball's afterlife and how they have (or have not) affected the characters. Bulma has been aware of the specifics of this afterlife for months, but her moral system seems to have changed in almost no way beside seeking personal immortality to avoid hell. From her characterization thus far, it seems to me that she should have received a much bigger shock from the new knowledge.

There exists a heaven, where sapient beings go and keep their sapience, and a hell where sapient beings are damned to eternal suffering. Is sending people to heaven early a good thing? I think you could easily argue it is, as people in heaven is surely not any materially worse than the world of the living, and you save them from the possibility of being sent to hell. This is just the first question which comes to me when I imagine learning that heaven and hell are real, but I imagine that a character as smart as Bulma could think of many others.

Is there a reason that Bulma's actions and motivations do seem to stay mostly intact after experiencing the afterlife? Does she experience a large amount of moral reflection which just happens to land very similar to her own moral system before discovering the afterlife, or has she not fully considered the ramifications?

*** From a meta viewpoint, I think the problem is that if I spent whole chapters on my characters musing philosophy, this would become quite a different story. Not necessarily an /uninteresting/ one, just a different one. I've considered delving fully into that notion, but if I were to write a rational fiction about the philosophy of the afterlife, I think it would be a Bleach fanfiction, not a Dragon Ball one. I say this because Bleach has both a higher focus on the afterlife and a ridiculously oblivious attitude to just how /shitty/ its afterlife is for pretty much anyone. Also, I like the idea of Ichigo as a rational hero focused on this issue - he's canonically pretty smart, albeit not a genius, and he's grown up in a clinic, with a doctor as a father, seeing death up close (and then ghosts) from childhood.

From an in-story viewpoint: while they know there is an afterlife, they also are really ignorant about how do you go one place or the other. There is not a holy text or a prophet's word. Bulma, at the very least, knows she's doomed to Hell no matter what, and that's simply because Enma is pissed off with her personally. Baba learned about Enma and tried her best to butter him up, and that obsession actually ended putting her in a worse spot than she started from. I may have made these world-shattering revelations sound too trivial, I'll admit, but in general my idea here is that knowing that there is an afterlife but also a capricious deity who decides if you go to Heaven or Hell based on unknown and arbitrary rules takes the edge off many of those questions. Such as, killing someone at the height of their virtue to have them go to Heaven might sound like a /good/ thing... but then again, will it send /you/ to Hell because that's how Enma thinks, regardless of your good intentions? How do you even tell if that person will go to Heaven anyway? Really, the fact that Enma has /mood swings/ suggests he could send the same exact person to Heaven one day, to Hell the next, simply based on how he feels that day.

**** First off, I just want to say that the Bleach fanfiction idea you mentioned sounds insanely interesting to me. I would definitely read that if you ever found the time / motivation to create it (though to me it sounds like it may also be well suited to a short-story or one-shot format?)

I definitely agree that characters having these moral quandaries is probably not something which will fit into the flow of this story. That does not mean, however, that they cannot happen "offscreen" and modify the perspectives of characters. I have noticed the examples you have given, and I think that how you have handled personal motivations in the face of afterlife knowledge has been very strong. I also see how a great deal of uncertainty existing muddies the waters and makes logical reasoning about the afterlife very difficult for our characters.

However, I still think that Bulma especially should have a different set of motivations after these revelation which could be concisely added to the story in a way which does not inhibit the flow of the story or seem confusing to the audience.

An example of this for me is Freiza. Bulma is horrified at his widespread genocide. Why? While the obvious answer is that "genocide is bad," under the afterlife system set out killing seems at least a much more neutral action, simply sending someone off to a realm which they would go to eventually. There are still many reasons to oppose Freiza's action and he is still almost definitely an immoral figure. However, I think even a throwaway line about why she is so motivated to prevent his actions (beyond the normal motivations of killing=bad which she would have before knowing about the afterlife) would deepen our understanding of her character.

I love the story, and I don't think this is something that needs to be focused on at all, The elements of the afterlife and the personal issues it poses are already present. I think that the moral issues do not need to be heavily focused on at all to be added and to richen the story. Of course, you may disagree: that's why you're the author and I am the random fan writing paragraphs on reddit (lol).

***** Well, blowing up a planet doesn't just kill everyone, it also destroys a whole culture, history etc. and stops it from ever going on. I would say that's still a net loss, even if everyone went to heaven. But you're right that I might bring that up - but there will be plenty of time once I get to the Frieza arc (which will actually be sooner than you might expect).

Also, speaking of one shots and Bleach, I /did/ write one, “End of Empiricism”. That one was about the problem of connecting our senses with reality, though. But I am also considering something short along the lines said above.

****** Honestly, from reading all of your replies I'm already confident that you do understand the moral ramifications of the knowledge the characters have gained and just haven't found anywhere you want to add them to your story yet. I'm excited to see this one continue, and I will definitely check out some of your other works like the Bleach one shot you mentioned!

****** From the perspective of the mortal world it destroys a whole culture, but from the perspective of the entire culture who just went to heaven they all entered a post scarcity paradise, and might just view it as the next step for their culture, though i guess if you cant reproduce in the afterlife a lot of stuff would change.

******* They can't reproduce, and they lose all material leftovers of their civilisation. It's not like they wouldn't enter that paradise individually eventually anyway (unless for some reason they're all good at this point but will all become damned by the end of their lives), so it's still a net loss. If everyone on Earth right now died and became a disembodied soul, how many would be able to recite every single work of literature and math theorem by heart?

** Very good chapter.

I 'm happy that you didn't drag out the fight too long.

Now I assume Goku will get mecha-eyes?

But I see a little issue here. Goku winning with Tao means that he is now stronger than Crane Master and his underlings as well, right?

*** Not really. In canon Goku beats Tao much more comfortably than here - after training with Korin - and still has trouble and eventually loses against Tien at the next Tenkaichi. But regardless, I also didn't really stick to canon power levels all the time (for example, I made Bandages and Spike significantly weaker than they should have been - in theory, THEY are stronger than Tao too, since in canon Goku fights them after him). As a general rule, in this world, Tao and Tien are both stronger than the Crane master and Chiaotzu. I won't pronounce myself on who's stronger between Tao and Tien though; the former had more experience, the latter is more of a rising young talent.

**** For me, this is a common issue in all kinds of fiction, including Bleach as well. Power levels are not consistent and hero always barely wins and learns something, what always makes me wonder "what if he fought his opponents in a different order".

It's the same with fighting games, the opponents are always magically one step above the player. The real question is how to rationalize it.

You have kinda written Tao as best world fighter (assasin) and Crane as kinda scared of Tao. Tien and Chiaotzu are Crane's pupils, so I would think they are way weaker than him. It's suprising that you're saying "Tien is stronger than Crane", is it the same as in canon?

***** The question is never settled straightforwardly in canon, but I believe that by the point Goku and Tien fight, they're both stronger than their respective masters. Goku barely loses against Roshi in his PREVIOUS tournament. He powers up a lot since then, and Roshi has no reason to grow much more, since he's so old and has basically peaked his potential. Then Roshi surrenders against Tien, basically saying that it's better if his old generation leaves the field to the young ones. He's acknowledging that he's been surpassed: there's new, fresh blood now. And there's no reason to think Shen is much stronger than him. I think at one point Roshi tells Tien that he's surpassed his master and should not feel bound by his will any more.

** Thank you for the chapter, I was happy to read it.

A minor technical question, just to help me complete my mental picture of the fight. How did Goku do the move with the Pinecones? I feel like I can visualize almost the whole fight except for that part, because I can kind of imagine several ways he could do it, but I'm not sure which one he used.

*** Basically the idea is, Goku has become really good at delicate ki control. Look up for example Yamcha's Sokidan technique; what he's doing is something like that, but with very small blasts, and no need for large gestures to control them. So in this case what he did was:

1. use small, faint blasts as explosions to propel pinecones towards Tao from direction A;\\
2. hide some brighter blast behind one such cone, so that it would blind Tao when the cone itself was deflected;\\
3. use the diversion to then get to land in an attack from a completely different direction, where he was actually hiding.

As for how he could get the blasts in position while keeping them hidden, with enough time and patience there would be several methods. He could delicately slip them under the first layer of leaves and soil of the forest's floor, or have them go vertically from his position, up above the tree cover, so that they might be ignored or simply look like planes or satellites flying overhead without a closer inspection while they move, then have them come down in position.

** Hi, just wanted to drop a quick note right here were I'm sure you'll read it. I really enjoy the story, the divergence from canon, how you grew some side characters, and the worldbuilding you are doing. The good mix between RATIONAL characters, simple smart/rational characters and strongly emotional characters.\\
The story flows well, because for all the good communication most main characters have, there are a lot of normal miscommunication, unsaid things, normal human failings.\\
This is the perfect rational fic for me, some very smart characters, some more normal ones, not everyone is a Machiavellian mastermind, not everyone thinks at 30 levels deep, and even "simple" characters can have valuable input both in story and in the meta message.-

Please, continue this as well as you can, because it is one of the most satisfactory rational-DB fics I enjoyed ...

*** Kind of late to this but... thanks a lot for the comment! It's always great to hear from someone that they liked it. And yes, that feeling of a story that tries to be rational while also having pretty fallible characters is exactly what I was going for. I enjoy the occasional overpowered genius schemer like the next guy, but I didn't think it'd fit the setting, or make for a gripping enough story.

*** Hm, talking about that in detail would be too spoilerish. But I think by this point you can already imagine divergences will get pretty big - seeing how Dr. Gero is changing allegiances, and the whole original reason for him to build Cell has evaporated. Besides, Cell is a /hugely/ ethically problematic project - given that he subsists entirely by absorbing the energy of other people and killing them, plus incorporating the androids #17 and #18.

BTW I'll direct you to my /other/ Dragon Ball ratfic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001348/1/The-Killing-Goku-Maximizer][The Killing Goku Maximizer]], if you're interested in my most unhinged possible take on Gero's androids and haven't read it already.

i've seen that but I haven't read it that before. Still, now it turns out great. Altough I can see two small issues with that:\\
1. as far as i know, the paperclip maximizer idea is that AI starts with innocent goal and ends up badly, the AI in the story has kinda different vibes and I'd say it's doing what it is supposed to. The world 'singularity' would fit the story more\\
2. in order to fix 1), I'd change your storyline AI to create more artificial Gokus just to kill them later. Maybe somewhere after the point when he sacrificed himself

***** I say it in the introduction, that the goal was malicious; however the AI vastly exceeds its original scope and goal. Killing Goku only meant sending him to the afterlife: anything else it does is value creep. I think the title makes sense on the face of it, it describes what the story is about - while inspired by the Paperclip, I never meant it to be a 1:1 analogy.
