** Clearly if running around in circles isn't solving your problems then you just aren't running fast enough.

**** Yeah, but that made some sense. He went FTL and traveled back in time. This is just weird.

** I've figured out how /The Flash/ works: the faster he goes, the stupider he gets.

Hence why he's marginally competent at the beginning, and by the time he can go FTL he's been reduced to running in circles very fast and hoping it fixes everything because he ran at /just/ the right fix-everything speed somehow.

** After I finished watching and parodying SG-1 and Atlantis, I started in on Supernatural. I've been taking a break from that for a few weeks to focus on writing, but tonight I noticed that season 2 of The Flash had started up. I had to go back and re-watch the season 1 finale in order to have context; it was stupider than I remembered, so I decided to write it up.

** Is this based on DC or something? Seems very silly. If one plans to involve technobabble, I'd at least try to make it follow esetoric rules explaining why it can do x when our current understanding of the world says x is impossible.

*** Yeah, Flash is a DC character. The show is fun, but definitely on the goofy side of the physics scale.

  (I did quit watching when they obviously went through a lot of trouble setting up a singularity, then ended on a cliffhanger, then skipped over it in the new season.)
#+end_quote

They did actually address it, they just did it via flashback.

*** Well, it wasn't very good. I liked your early Stargate "fanfixing" because it went through the episodes and then tried to progressively "fix" them until they were actually good. The latter episodes just ended up being, just like this Flash one, essentially you running really fast through the plot and holding up billboards where you didn't like the plot. It's not fun. It's mildly humorous at best. This is, after all, [[/r/rational]]: we are perfectly capable of spotting all of these plot holes ourselves. What is interesting is seeing how they can be fixed.

**** Huh. You know, you're right. I just went back through every chapter in the SG-1 stuff. Chapters 6 and 7 did not, in fact, feature any fixing, which I hadn't really been aware of. All the ones after it did, but I suspect you stopped reading.

Thanks for pointing that out, I hadn't thought about it.
