** “Instruments.”

“Yeah, like I said, tools.”

I love it. Bunch of great lines this chapter, really, like “Nowhere. I'm from the other place.” Seeing Giran's mood whiplash was well sold, particularly given how little interaction we had with him here and in canon.

** Barely made it this time. I risked pushing it to next week but in the end this weekend was really prolific for me as I wrote more than 4500 words. I'm also writing a special that will begin introducing some of the DBZ characters (specifically the Saiyans and Frieza), so look forward to that at some point!

*** Really great work keeping at it!

And of course I look forward to reading it, but I really admire your writing discipline too!

You rock!

And your story rocks!

**** Thanks! I've been actually swinging back and forth between different ideas (especially an Harry Potter one that I've started and rewritten at least three times now), so that slows down the process a bit. I'd really like to work in parallel on something shorter and different, just for the sake of variety (since I won't get that nice feeling of having wrapped up a story from this one for quite a while) but yeah, with my job and all I'm often just too tired to produce anything decent.

****** I want to write a series on 'A History of Magic', meaning, historical fiction set in various eras exploring episodes we know of from the HP canon and how they intertwine with real history. I have a very clear idea for the first story, but it's still gotten hard to write for... reasons, I guess. I first tried writing it like I would pretty much anything else (though with a generally more serious tone than the OWP) but I found myself dissatisfied at how the dialogue and way of thinking of the characters felt way too modern for the setting. I then tried a more literary style of prose (drew inspiration from Virginia Woolf's "Orlando" for that one), but it felt really tiring to write for a long stretch of time in it. I also had a problem with the projected story length - I wanted it to be not longer than four chapters, but considering how much world-building I wanted to pack into it (this being obviously a very nerdy project to begin with, I had a lot of ideas for references to real history and such), it would just have felt a dense stream of exposition in that way. However I did not feel like committing to a longer work either, what with already being managing this one huge project!

My end solution was to try and write it as a mock essay. I'll pretend to be a present day magical historian who tells the tale for a modern public (which leads to some neat literary framing device). I tried writing the first chapter yesterday, and while it's perhaps not the most impactful way to convey a story (I'm sure some people will be bored at all the geeky historical asides), it's definitely the most fun and natural I've tried yet. And there's already a precedent of sorts in the HP fandom, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1149623]["Disillusion, by Hermione Granger"]]. Being an academic, it figures that writing basically a fanfiction /paper/ would be right in my alley... I hope I can finish it that way, and then I'll probably split it into three/four parts for publication.

******* Good luck! It sounds like a neat idea for a story. It can be hard to find the right viewpoint, but if it feels right to you, then go for it. :)

** I guess that technically [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/amotxh/comment/efnmrj2][my predictions]] about who beats who in fights have not been wrong so far, but the chapter still wound up going a different way than I thought. It was pretty obvious that Mai had some evil plan to enact with being in the tournament. I thought she would use some trickeries or hidden techniques to advance to the final match before unleashing her endgame, but in hindsight she just wanted access to the backstage. Still not sure what she gets out of shooting Giran, maybe it's a distraction or something.

*** The outcomes weren't exactly shocking. We knew Gohan and Goku had to win their fights, and Muten losing in some contrived way to Mai would have been stupid. In the only match left we have Krillin who needs to finish his arrogance arc against a stronger opponent than Yamcha, and Yamcha himself who can't be too successful or it would diverge way too much from canon.

Being Yamcha is suffering. That is one of the unchangeable laws of the universe.

*** She's working for the Instruments. He had the stone Dragon Ball, and the Ptero tribe knows their plans but has officially pledged to be neutral (chapter 17), while sneakily sending Giran on a mission to undermine them.

Also, speaking of your predictions, my question was why you'd assume Mai could win against Roshi, but that was already discussed in the comments. As seen here, Mai's just not on that level.

**** Shit, you're right, forgot about the dragon ball. I guess that's what happens when I read a story as it comes out, instead of waiting until it's complete like I usually do.
