** Well it's not /much/ like Mother of Learning, but I've found [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/][All Night Laundry]] scratches a lot of my same fictional itches anyways.

Competing time travelers, consistent time-rules, semi-competent characters, interesting villainy.

** What exactly about /Mother of Learning/ are you trying to get more of? I can't think of anything that does everything it does, but I can think of books that are similar in one detail.

*** That's hard to describe but the main character abusing his circumstances , being rational, amazing magic system and worldbuilding, the fact that there's so much more than it never goes into and just mentioned, good villains. Not necessary but the time loop is great
