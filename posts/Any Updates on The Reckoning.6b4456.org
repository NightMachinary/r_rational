Animorphs: The Reckoning probably has to be my top favourite !rational fic that I've read so far. Any idea when next it's being updated?


** Yeah.

1. Guilt/shame/apology/excuses.

2. There's an interlude written and an Ax chapter half-done that are meant to come out Tuesday and might end up coming out Wed or Thu, but for real, it's this week. For real.

3. Since February, the org I work for ([[http://www.rationality.org][CFAR]]) has been doing an unusually intense sprint; we ran as many workshops as we used to run in an entire year, and I was supervising a bunch of brand-new instructors and a little bit of new and experimental content. That sprint is over, and I should be able to catch my breath. I intend to update at least twice in the month of May, and hope to get to the end of this arc and the start of the next one via a few rapid updates (e.g. every week or 10 days rather than every other SEASON).

4. Things in-story are going to start getting crazy (relative to how quiet and sane they've been thus far).

*** As someone who has also been slipping behind schedule, I strongly advise against feeling guilt or shame.

**** I was wondering what was going on, and glad to see a new chapter today.

***** There's been some stuff with getting sick and being in my final semester at college, but mostly it comes down to "Running a story with 100+ characters to keep track of is hard, and while I made adequate preparations for the story, it became progressively harder in a way that I didn't anticipate."

(The biggest thing is that, as much as I knew that the characters would throw off my plans, I didn't know that they would throw off my plans /this much/. Basically the only parts of my outline that remain intact are those that involve characters who are still more or less isolated from the others and haven't been affected by the butterflies yet.)

Anyway, I'm working on resolving that, since being on hiatus for the past couple of weeks has shown me that I can't just ignore the problem and hope that things will get better without changing my strategy.

****** I'm enjoying it, take your time. I'm also in my last semester, and I've had a fic on hiatus for well over a year now (that I fully intend to finish), so you get no judgement from me. :)

Wait, things have been sane? What is crazy going to be like then?

*** The recent chapter was incredible. Holy shit.

I wish I knew someone who had read Animorphs as a kid just so I could share this with someone. I've tried introducing The Reckoning to people with no background in Animorphs, but no one was willing to try the fan fiction without the reading the source material first. It's a shame because I feel The Reckoning really stands on its own feet well.

Also, have you ever talked with KA Applegate? I think she would love your fan fiction. Your characterizations are so well done that I can't really distinguish your versions from canon---though I feel in a sense your characterizations go so much deeper as well.

***** I would love to hear how that goes. Good luck with it.

Do you have a set arc planned? How many more chapters remain?

*** Awesome. Take your time! But just FYI, I've been compulsively checking to see if you've posted a new chapter, at least 4 or 5 times a day, all week. Cause I'm fucking stoked. Cause your story is fucking amazing.

** It's up now. Someone will probably link it here within the next few hours. There's actually a really short interlude first, and /then/ a chapter.
