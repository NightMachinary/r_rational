Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** What determines pitchability of an idea?

I've been looking at [[/r/WritingPrompts/top]]. There are a lot of cool ideas that don't naturally make for good stories; that subreddit tends to upvote those, because people get pleasure from the /pitch/ rather than the /execution/.

At the other end are works which are difficult to pitch but are nonetheless very good. I think you hear this expressed most often as, "I'm not sure that I can describe this in a way that would make you want to read it."

Now, obviously some of this comes down to the skill of the person writing the work and the skill of the person giving the pitch; poor execution can ruin /any/ idea, while a poor pitch can make /any/ work look bad. But with that said, I think the concept of "pitchability" is a meaningful one, and I'm curious about what's at the core of it, if it has a core.

To take a stab: "pitchability" is about packing the payoff into the small pitch, which can run /against/ the long, involved effort of /growing/ an increasingly interesting story over a substantial space (eg: the standard 5000-10000 words for a short story) and then paying it off at the end.

*** I feel that pitchability as your describing it has a lot to do with how interesting the world the author is creating is. Even if you can't explain your character and their motivations very well most people will agree that Frodo would be badass with a lightsaber. Therefore I think something with a high pitchability but hard to make a complex story of have the authors describe interesting worlds but with subpar characters. Often I find when reading(or writing) a BST the general world is described far more than the characters which can leave you wanting to see this world but when you do actually see it you dislike it because of the boring characters in the world.

**** Characterization is one of those really difficult things to pitch, because it tends to come off sounding cliched and flat. What can you really say about a person in a single sentence, or even a pair of sentences, that will get people interested?

I'm in the process of developing a new web serial and trying to go character-first, but even though I've got lots of description written for them (their personality, worldview, emotions, connections, etc.) I don't know that I could pitch them properly in a way that would make people care.

***** I've only seen better than the technique [[/u/Luminnaran][u/Luminnaran]] proposes on jacket insides and first page teasers. An example of a teaser follows, after which I've transcribed character pitches from a back cover. Both are from Daniel Abraham's /The Dragon's Path/.

  "Yardem?"

  "Sir?" rumbled the Tralgu looming at his side.

  "The day you throw me in a ditch and take command of the company?"

  "Yes, sir."

  "It wouldn't be today, would it?"

  The Tralgu crossed his thick arms and flicked a jingling ear.

  "No, sir," he said at last. "Not today."

  "Pity."

  *MARCUS*'s hero days are behind him. He knows too well that even the smallest war still earns somebody's death. When his men are impressed into a doomed army, staying out of a battle he wants no part of requires some unorthodox steps.

  *CITHRIN* is an orphan, ward of a banking house. Her job is to smuggle a nation's wealth across a war zone, hiding the gold from both sides. She knows the secret life of commerce like a second language, but the strategies of trade will not defend her from swords.

  *GEDER*, sole scion of a noble house, has more interest in philosophy than in swordplay. A poor excuse for a soldier, he is a pawn in these games. No one can predict what he will become.

  Falling pebbles can start a landslide. A spat between the Free Cities and the Severed Throne is spiraling out of control. A new player rises from the depths of history, fanning the flames that will sweep the entire region onto The Dragon's Path -- the path to war.

** We have names for logical fallacies and these names are very helpful; they allow us to say something like "That argument is an ad hominem" without having to explain what an ad hominem is and why it isn't a good thing.

I think there should be a name for the following rhetorical move.

Persons A & B are arguing about something, either in real life or online. At some point, person A makes some kind of error in language use. If it is an argument online, it may be a misspelling, or its vs it's, or something else; if it is an argument in person, it may be a mispronounced word or maybe something said in the wrong tense, etc etc.

Rather than ignore it and proceed with the argument, person B launches into a long lecture about the mistake, usually discussing not only why person A was wrong but also multitude of related technical issues (e.g., how to pronounce words coming from Latin, technical details of tenses in the English language).

I've seen this sort of thing happen many times, not just on reddit but throughout the internet. It seems like a common enough way to derail a conversation that it deserves a name.

**** I strongly dislike the article you linked.

Attacking the language is a very poor way of arguing, and I understand that 'the tone argument' is a term that makes sense, but just like the article makes clear, usually when I've seen someone accuse others of tone policing in the wild, really what they mean is that person B wants them to calm down and present a rational argument. Which they think is unfair as it polices their tone and ignores their strong emotions on the subject. The article also says that tone policing is something people with more privilege use to silence people with less privilege.

The tone argument definition used by rationalwiki is bad. It tells readers that if they are not a white male and a white male is asking them to calm down and back up their position, the white male is trying to silence them with his sinister tricks. There is a brief paragraph at the bottom where it says it is /hypothetically/ possible to use a tone argument honestly, but then it also suggests that if the language discussion is not mutually consented to, it's ok to 'light the flamethrowers'.

***** Allow me to illustrate why I think you're wrong (don't take my insults seriously, I'm sure you're an okay person):

You cunt, did you ever fucking think that you could ask for clarification without the self-righteous tone policing? The point the article is trying to make, and that you missed like the little shit that you are, is that my evidence doesn't care about my motherfucking emotional state. My points stand regardless of what language I decide to use, and asking me to change my tone is a way of evading my valid points in favor of telling me to shut the fuck up and speak so that I don't hurt your precious little feelings.

****** Excuse me, could I get some soup with my fly?

Your reply is something perfectly valid, with bad words tacked on. In my anecdotal experience of arguing with anonymous strangers, the way "Don't tone police me" is used /most of the time/, is by someone who is called out for making a special pleading or simply asserting facts, while being very rude to those who disagree.

I agree entirely that attacking only grammar or spelling is bad. Attacking use of slang words (politely), while more of a gray area, is bad if the argument is still understandable by the vast majority of people. Same with needlessly complicated/obscure words, which are just slang for academics.

But. I more often see "don't tone police me" as a cheap attempt to score points without addressing the arguments of the other side than I see any variant of tone policing used for the same. Although I guess I don't count "You need to calm down if you want to be taken seriously, but here is why you are wrong" as tone policing, because the person then goes on to answer the substance of the policed person's arguments.

And in real life, demanding to be taken seriously when you are rude or hysterical is a bit like demanding that someone evaluates the quality of the soup you made without complaining about the fly they saw you put in it.

#+begin_quote
  You can't invest 45-50 percent of your gdp very well forever. It's amazing how long China's run has been, but it is over. The quality of their marginal investments is now low and that means their growth rate will be much lower too. The low hanging fruit is gone, at least for the time being.

  ...

  I would not so quickly infer that the Chinese government is stupid when it comes to economics. It is true their actions do not correspond to what professional economists would recommend. But they are painted into a very unpleasant corner and have lots of interest groups to feed.

** Noah Smith talks about [[http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2016/01/situationalism-in-economic-policymaking.html][situationalism and models]] in economic theory and policy. Put simply, given multiple competing models of how the world works, which one if any is right? If, as some suggest, we pick different models in different situations, how do we know which one is the right one for this situation?

#+begin_quote
  Here was an interesting paragraph from a recent Simon Wren-Lewis post:

  #+begin_quote
    The big models/schools of thought are not right or wrong, they are just more or less applicable to different situations. You need New Keynesian models in recessions, but Real Business Cycle models may describe some inflation free booms. You need Minsky in a financial crisis, and in order to prevent the next one. As Dani Rodrik says, there are many models, and the key questions are about their applicability.
  #+end_quote

  Rodrik pushes this idea in his book Economics Rules, which I am about to start reading. But he's far from the first to advocate the idea of using different models for different situations. Let's call this "situationalism".

*** Models may not be right but they can be more correct. For example, the meta-model consisting of all the different models and how to chose which one will be more correct than any one of the sub-models. It may be more likely/plausible if the extra correctness outweighs the added complexity.

But yes, the idea that models have realms of applicablity is important. We don't try to calculate the lift on an aircraft wing with quantum mechanics or even by tracking individual air molecules but by treating air as an infinitely divisible fluid. While QM is probably closer to reality, it's just not practical.
