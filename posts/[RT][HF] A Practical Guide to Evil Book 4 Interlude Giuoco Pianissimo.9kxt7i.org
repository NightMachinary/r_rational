*** To quote TFS!cell: I have so many questions!

Does this person know who hakram is, and is lying to Hakram? That seems pretty ballsy, but that's the only thing that really makes sense here. Like, if they're a poor refugee in a medieval world, in a city with crushing housing prices, as a single parent, how the hell can they afford to give away meat to a random org? Like, poor people in modern countries have difficulty supporting kids as a single parent; add in all the above and it boggles the mind. That despite losing their home and livelihood they have 0 complaints whatsoever and are super stoked despite, in there eyes, and orc being in charge only seems to work if they recognize hakram and don't want to be seen as diesloyal, but that just raises further issues.

****** 1) the Story needed Hakram to see that he has friends in the town - not everyone fears orcs, even if they fear the Deadhand. A free feed of a strip of meet is a Good way to make him feel welcome in the city.

2) didn't the refugees from the edge of Callow just bring all their animals into the capital? If there's ever a time to give away gamey meat to someone who just had a friendly chat to you, it's now.

3) if she is a refugee, she's new to the city too. Seems like Callow is the type of place where cheap meals might be shared between friends. The exact economics of callow is obfuscated and kept deliberately in flux.

There's a lot of unbelievable stuff in the story, that isn't one of them.

*********** I do mean them. Callow is a preindustrial farming nation, with massive chunks of their farmland burnt down, their biggest trading city in ruins, their economy in tatters, and their military has horrific casualty rates, but instead of the citizens having to be forced into the military and the kingdom of callow starving, they're... just fine, apparently, and everyone is totally behind the black queen who caused literally all of this. If this were to happen in a comparable country multiple hundreds of years more advanced in tech, you would have widespread food shortages and mass starvation, even without having to feed a massive training army being taken from the population of farmers at a critical time; most states from comparable tech levels would have collapsed completely.

******** I was pretty sure there was a much more recent Proceran invasion of Callow than that. In any case, it's like that chapter start quote says

#+begin_quote
  The question of who the most vindictive people of Calernia are has long been debated. Some say it is the Arlesites, who will duel to the death over the use of the wrong adjective in a verse. Others say it is those of the Free Cities, where the moving of a border by half a mile will spawn a war lasting three generations. Others yet say it is the Praesi, who indulge in political assassination the way other nations enjoy a cup of good wine. I would humbly put forward, however, that the answer is the people of Callow. Steal an apple from a farmer of the Kingdom and fifty years later his grandson will find yours on the other side of the continent, sock him in the eye and take three apples back.

Wait, is he saying he's trying to confirm her allegiances and that he'll betray her if they aren't raising the same tower, or that because she doesn't trust him he's going to stick the knife in before she gets a chance?
