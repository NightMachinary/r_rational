** So far as I know, a few people have talked about writing one but none have been published. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2jn2e1/bstqd_code_geass_lelouch_of_the_rationality/][See this thread for some discussion.]]

** Not directly related, but some people suggested in the other discussion thread that a rational Lelouch would have used his Geass to 'wish for more wishes' by Geassing people to be loyal to him. He does do that in the show later on, but he avoided doing it until then because he disliked taking away people's free will. So he was already limited in its use by his personality. That could be considered hypocritical, but hypocrisy was a major element of his character and I'm not sure I would like a rational Lelouch as much if he was less of a hypocrite and didn't struggle as much with morality. I don't know how others feel about that, but those are my $0.02.

*** I'd say that Lelouch was right to not 'wish for more wishes.'

'Be loyal to me' is a much more obvious use of his power to others. Unexplained personality shifts are a lot harder to pass off as brilliant tactics, people skills, or information gathering than single tasks that the Geassed individual then forgets.

** Seems to me an interested story take is a Lelouch obsessed with the preservation of free will, without simply denying the use of his power. One distinct possibility is to geass people with their own wishes, and to then find the people with wishes that match your agenda.

Think about the ability for people to accomplish things they're both certain of and obsessed by. It's pretty astounding.
