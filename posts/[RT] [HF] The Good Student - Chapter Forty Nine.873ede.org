** Maybe i'm an idiot but could someone explain what just happened? From what I can tell the All-mother and winnem roke switched places but if so where is the all-mother, shouldn't she have taken the earth by now? Is the all-mother the mother of Simole? Also what is the real rokes plan? Is the demon with nick the only one left truly, if so what is the all mother? Finally is the librarian a failed mage or like a half-demon because she appears to be very old and wrote the fairy tales of roke.

*** This chapter implies the Librarian is actually the All-Mother, who switched places with Winnum Roke ages ago (back in Roke's time). The All-Mother's plans aren't well known but is seems like her main goal is to protect the demons, rather than to destroy humans.

We don't know if Nic's demon is the only one left - it's certainly a possibility, though it could be that the rest are captured and used to create mages.

**** Isn't the all-mother supposed to be super powerful though? Because the librarian even admitted she wasn't all that powerful without her stone stuff.
