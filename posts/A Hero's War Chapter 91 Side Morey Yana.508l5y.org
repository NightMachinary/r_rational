** Nice chapter. Morey's kind of turning into a Che Guevara-like figure.

*** I usually write the side stories after the main arc is finished. But in this case, I feel like there is room for another chapter in the main story for better closure.

** The vibes and chills from this chapter. It really brings you the pain and suffering of the victim of slavery. One of the best chapter written in the series!!
