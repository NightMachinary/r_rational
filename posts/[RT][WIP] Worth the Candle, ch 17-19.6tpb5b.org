**** Huh, I've never played Dwarf Fortress. I thought I was being somewhat derivative of the tinker trance from Worm, though I didn't realize that until after I'd been running a D&D campaign with it for a few months. That mechanic is basically a way to circumvent the "why don't people just reverse-engineer it" problem and the "why don't they just mass produce it" problem in one fell swoop.

#+begin_quote
  Worth the Candle is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul.
#+end_quote

If you haven't read any of this, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][here's the link to the full thing]].

I am back from my week away, here are the three chapters I wrote while I was without reliable internet. These chapters are somewhat slower and more character/worldbuildy in preparation for the meat/action of Book II.

Thanks to everyone who has helped to make the numbers for this story become larger numbers, and to all the people who have responded to me on the weekly worldbuilding posts, on the [[/r/rational]] discord, etc.

** So, uh... did anyone else read the intro to the bath scene, and Fenn's concerns, and Juniper raising his Flirting/Romance skills, and think, "Incoming harem ending"? Or was that just me?

In case it's not clear, that's very much not a criticism; I'm rather enjoying the read so far.

I.e., he deliberately took a bunch of clichés and tried to deconstruct/rationalize them while writing an engaging story. The moment it became apparent Fenn could become a companion, I started suspecting he plans to do the same with the harem cliché. [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]], am I right?^{1}

*** Maybe, but Amaryllis' general attitude toward Juniper seems to be more one of cultivating an asset to be used in her own larger plans. She's distinctly manipulative and guarded with information, seeming to see it as leverage, or a means of influencing Juniper by controlling the picture he builds of Aerb.

This might all just be a deconstruction of tsundere's, but I really haven't picked up on any hint of Amaryllis being attracted to Juniper.

**** Loyalty 5? Granted, we don't really know how this "loyalty" works. The game couldn't be tricked, exactly, but it certainly could "play along" with any sufficiently competent or dramatic manipulations or betrayals in the making. Among other evidence could be her lines about Juniper being "a very decent person" and apologies for leaving him, but obviously it's even easier to fake than loyalty.

That said, it's mostly irrelevant. We know /Juniper/ is attracted to her, which means she counts. This is an advanced RPG we're talking about, why wouldn't there be optional romantic subplots for every companion?

Oh, by the way, I'm reasonably confident that her beauty is abnormal. Reread the relevant paragraph from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25816869][chapter 2]]:

#+begin_quote
  Imagine that someone spent a few years studying your likes and dislikes, running through video of your every private moment, somehow surreptitiously hooking up EKGs to measure your physiological responses without you know. Then imagine that they sat down with that data and the best photo manipulation artists in the world and made the absolute perfect picture to cause your heart rate to spike, a jolt to run up your spine, butterflies in your stomach, and a cold sweat on your palms. Then imagine that they did this again, over and over in slight variations, until they had a full 4K 60fps 3D movie to show you. That was what it was like watching her.
#+end_quote

It's not normal, it's either some glamour magic, or the DM-entity deliberately putting Juniper's dream girl in front of him; neither implies good things about this whole arrangement.

******* if you look at it as skill levels being a roll modifier, then even deception level 6 doesn't save you from rolling a 1-5/20 on a deception check. I think that's the most plausible explanation right now between the gap of his skill levels and inconsistent moment-to-moment results (i.e. low level rifle skills, shooting a sniper behind cover in the head from a moving vehicle). That doesn't address the apparent lack of interaction his real abilities have with the system stat display though (knowledge, prior experience with guns, etc.).

*** The better question is whether he could avoid it if he tried. The way relationships stats in RPGs work is frankly bizarre. Because of levels you never /stop/ growing closer unless you break off things completely so eventually you're simultaneously fulfilling the role of everyone's soul mate/personal messiah. Persona 5 in particular makes several hints that the protagonist might just be a teeny bit of a psychopath if they can shift gears between what different people want so easily. High level SOC gets into scary territory regarding trust and whether someone you can perfectly control even counts as human any more. That way lay the path to Anasûrimbor Kellhus .

*** I wonder how gravity works. Presumably the hexagonal world is made out of some very strong material so it doesn't crumple into a sphere -- but if one is near the eastern edge of the hexagon, does one feel a strong westward gravitational force? Or maybe the hexagon is spinning fast enough to prevent this...

Or maybe the answer is just "magic."

**** The hexagon is tiled, effectively forming an infinite plane, so the gravity would be directed 'down' into the plane at all points. It would also not get any weaker with distance.

But this is all irrelevant, since this is a videogame. The gravity is implemented via constant force 'down', sun is just a circle on the skybox and a directional light source, and coordinate wraparound is not very hard to implement either.

  Aerb was about ten times larger than Earth, flat instead of a sphere, and shaped like a hexagon. If you went far enough north, you would end up in the south, and it was the same in any direction.

First sentence clearly states that Aerb is hexagonal and is 10 times the size of Earth (I assume by surface area). The second one implies infinite tiling of said hexagon. What is unclear?

********* If it was a infinite plane you could go on north forever, but he says if you go north you end up in the south. Not entirely sure what that's about, but my guess would be some magic thing that returns you to the opposite side so you can't escape the hexagon.

But I guess it could potentially extend forever (or up to a arbitrarily large point) and the magic barrier just limits them to one hexagon.

********** You /can/ go on forever in the same direction, while the landscape and everything else will be infinitely repeating. If you could see far enough with your line of sight perpendicular to the edge of the hexagon, you'd see the back of you head. Same way you would on a spherical planet it you could see around the horizon. Except tiled hexagon is the surface of a torus, not a sphere.

You can also think of it as a single hexagon with three pairs of infinitely tall portals, located at opposite edges of the hexagon. Walking into one causes you to walk out of the opposite one, likewise for everything else, including light, which means there is no discontinuity. It isn't even possible to tell where the edge actually is, only that stuff repeats in hexagonal pattern.
