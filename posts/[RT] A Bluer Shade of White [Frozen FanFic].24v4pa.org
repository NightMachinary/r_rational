** Thanks very much for writing this! Things I appreciated:

- Fast pacing
- Disney references ("Olaf has a genie now?!")
- Exploration of the consequences of an intelligence explosion and self-replicating technology
- Real-feeling motivations and dialogue for Elsa, the Duke, Jack, and Olaf

Reminds me of Friendship is Optimal in the emotional effect it had on me. Bravo and thanks again :)

** I'm spacing out the updates a little bit so that I can edit the chapters one by one as they get put up, but this is complete - the full story should be completely up by next Monday.

Hope you enjoy - comments, criticism, or reviews are welcome. It's not a complete "optimize the world and exploit everything" fic, mostly because I find it really hard to make a story that can actually survive that, and I'd rather write a story than just an exploration of ideas through conversation.

**** New chapter is up - you can post the link if you'd like, but I don't want to self-promote too heavily. You can also set fanfiction.net to send you e-mails for the stories/authors that you follow, which I believe is the preferred way to do it.

***** Yeah, but then you have to get a fanfiction.net account, leading to the following internal mental exchange.

Me: It'd be awfully convenient to get an account, so I can have it list the last update for all the stories in one place.

Me: But then I'd be the sort of person who has a fanfiction.net account.

Me: You're no virtue ethicist! Go with what optimizes future enjoyment, which you already agreed is signing up!

Me: OK, I'll do it. Maybe this practice will help me become a better utilitarian.

Me: You're REALLY not getting it, are you.

***** Ah, fair enough. I've had alerts up for a while, but recently switched to a different pseudonymous email address and it seems to be having trouble.

Also new headcanon (until next chapter): something goes wrong, and eventually the snowpeople end up as Luminosity!vampires - it explains the cold and sparkly skin, the obsessive love, and a fair bit more besides...

Congrats on finishing it! It was an enjoyable read. (Though I think Olaf's semi-Friendliness maybe came a bit too easy.)

** I like what you're doing with the story, especially how you continue the existing story, rather than having an earlier point of departure. What I also like is that there seem to be more than one thing going on, not just the improvement of Olaf.

My only criticism so far is that you've written it so that the idea of improving Olaf comes from a male OC. This might seem like pedantry, but HPMOR (and Less Wrong as well) already get the criticism that they make it look like rationality is something men do. It would have been easy enough to have the idea come from Elsa. It doesn't ruin the story, but it's something that jumped out to me.

The story with devil and cursed mirror is the original Snow Queen, right?

*** Yes, that story is the original Snow Queen.

I get what you're saying about gender roles, but it's mostly a result of how I conceive of Elsa. She starts out the movie being very restrained and proper, a creature of order afraid of hurting people and losing control. Mid-movie, she basically just says "fuck it" and abandons her kingdom, responsibilities, and only family, swinging the pendulum pretty damned far in the other direction. Her motivation there is twofold - one, she thinks that she's going to hurt someone, and two, she's been bottled up so tightly for so long that she needs a release. And then at the end of the movie she swings back towards synthesis, takes up the crown again, and tries her best to live in harmony with her power.

But I have to believe that the end result of all that is that Elsa is a fundamentally cautious person. If Anna hadn't made it to the ice palace to tell her about the eternal winter, everyone in Arendelle would have died. Elsa has to think about that from time to time, especially given that her early life was shaped by a similar accidental use of her power when playing with her sister.

So it's not that Elsa isn't rational, it's that she's very wary of using her power, and cautious about upsetting the status quo because of how easily things could spiral out of control. I'm somewhat prejudiced to thinking that caution here is more than warranted; I'd like someone to figure out how to make a superintelligence safely before we actually try to make a superintelligence. The duke is supposed to sort of be a foil for her caution, and while he might be imaginative, that imagination is very optimistic about what the end results will be. I was originally going to try having Anna occupy that role, but I think that it fits Anna less well - she's impulsive by nature, but focused on people and relationships more than governance, economics, warfare, etc., and this way she gets freed up for a different role.

Anyway, I'll try to make some of that clearer in the coming chapters, and might go back and edit the first two. Elsa is (supposed to be) pretty smart and mostly rational, but she's more the kind of person who wants safety and security than the kind of person who wants to optimize everything as quickly as possible.
