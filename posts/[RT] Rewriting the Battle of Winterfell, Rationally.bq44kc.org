Hi fellow rationalists,

As you probably feel after watching Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 3, some things just didn't seem like they were done right. This is my take on the battle, where I try to be more intelligent with strategy, as well as to give meaning to development of more of the remaining characters / have them do something meaningful. Please let me know what you think!

*Heroes' Reunion*

• Before the battle, Jaime shows up with Cersei's contingent, to the incredulous disbelief of Daernys, who admits that Tyrion was right about his claim that Cersei would help. Cersei's contingent brings with them six Scorpions. Tyrion explains that he had informed Cersei about the Undead Dragon and cynically notes that Cersei figures the Scorpions taking down an Undead Dragon at Winterfell would be a lot safer and cheaper for her than having that fight happen at King's Landing, and besides the Scorpions won't be any threat to King's Landing, only to dragons.\\
• Daernys has the Scorpions placed around the battlements of Winterfell, alongside the trebuchets (not far afield), but has her own people man it as she doesn't want to risk them attempting to kill her own dragons with it.

*Attack on the White Walker Camp*

• Bran reveals his ability to scry through the sights of others, as well as the fact that the Night King can locate him when he does this, to the defenders at Winterfell, who realize this gives them a way to hunt the Night King.\\
• Based on this information, the top leaders devise a strategy. They want to lure in the Night King and his four White Walker underlings, with Bran as the bait, because they figure that the Night King would want to use Bran's scrying power for strategic value (rather than because Bran is a living memory of history). This means they'll have to lose a lot of lives just to convincingly seem like they're losing, and make it seem like they have few forces left. As such, they decide to send 80% of their forces south, along with all the noncombatants (i.e., they won't be participating in the battle). However they also note that they can't very well tell their soldiers about this plan, as that would cripple morale. Bran notes that if they put up too good of a fight, the Night King won't even show himself in the fight, but the leaders decide that's a risk they'll have to take.\\
• They also discuss the fact that the Night King has an Undead Dragon who can melt walls, so they don't want to concentrate too many assets in Winterfell proper.\\
• Dragon #2 has a barrel filled with obsidian shards which it carries in its mouth. At midday, Bran scries the location of the Night King through identifying geographical features in the Night King's view, then tells Daernys, who immediately takes Dragon #2 to go Night King hunting. They keep Dragon #3 at Winterfell as they expect the Night King to attack with the Undead Dragon.\\
• The moment the Night King realizes he's being scried by Bran, he knows there's a likely attack inbound so he leaves the undead camp, and he also dispatches the Undead Dragon to attack Winterfell, as he assumes both dragons are coming for him and that would leave Winterfell defenseless.\\
• When they arrive at the location Bran indicated, they finds a pair of White Walkers there, who begins sharpening their ice spears. Already prepared for this, Daernys stays out of range, and Dragon #2 open up its mouth and drop the barrel down at its target, then breathe fire at the barrel, disintegrating it and causing the obsidian shards contained within to shower down upon one of the White Walkers as a rain of flaming shards. White Walker #1 is disintegrated from a shard injury, and the zombies in the vicinity are as well, however another White Walker several dozen meters away is unharmed and has an ice spear ready, and so Daernys retreats, not willing to risk losing her dragon (as she would then die too).\\
• At Winterfell, Dragon #3 and the Undead Dragon engage in a brawl high over Winterfell, with Dragon #3 making it impossible for the Undead Dragon to ever breathe fire on the castle. The Scorpions open fire on the Undead Dragon, but only one manages to clip it. The Night King learns that Winterfell has Scorpions defending it and has the Undead Dragon retreat.\\
• The Night King, realizing that Bran can just keep guiding long range attacks against his White Walkers, immediately abandons his slaughtering of civilians throughout the surrounding countryside, and leads his army to Winterfell.

*Battle of Winterfell*

• The battle of Winterfell begins right before dawn. This is so that the Dothraki charge can happen in the darkness (for cinematic effect) but the battle proper happens in the light (so it can be seen).\\
• Bran scries the Night King's position again and again Daernys and Dragon #2 take to the skies, to drop a barrel of obsidian shards on the Night King. The Undead Dragon intercepts, but Daernys manages to send a shower of flaming shards down on the Night King's position. The Night King has an undead giant cover for him; and its hide proves too tough for the shards to penetrate.\\
• Under the light from the dragons' fire, the first of the undead forces can be seen charging at Winterfell. The leaders note that having the battle in the darkness would be disastrous because the troops won't be able to see clearly, but they only have to keep the undead at bay for another hour before it's dawn.\\
• Therefore, in the twilight, Melisandre uses her contagious enchant fire spell to light up the Dothraki swords and they charge into the undead forces.\\
• We get to see the first half of the Dothraki charge in under trebuchet support, however we don't see them fight the zombies, just see their lights wink out.\\
• When the undead forces get closer, the sun has come up from the horizon, and the second half of the Dothraki charge in, once again with trebuchet support, and this time we see the Dothraki fighting the zombies up close (it's doing them an injustice for them to all die off-screen as if they were some kind of footnote), and see how the fire burns the zombies to a crisp, and how the Dothraki set their fallen comrades on fire so as to prevent them from being raised by the White Walkers -- and see the Dothraki noble courage shine through when, if they aren't able to set fire to themselves upon being overwhelmed, they ask their allies to light them up.\\
• At the same time, Daernys and Dragon #2 make strafing runs on the undead forces, constantly watching the ground below for any sign of a White Walker and keeping out of range of their ice spears. A few times she accidentally gets too close and some ice spears come close to hitting her, after which she retreats for a bit and probes for another weak spot in the undead forces to attack.\\
• When the zombies get up close, the infantry sets fire to the wooden stake outer perimeter (which is in front of the infantry, not behind them), holding off the zombies for a short while as archers on the walls shoot down at the closest zombies with their obsidian arrows.\\
• The Night King summons a blizzard. The casting noticeably weakens the Night King (so it's clear he can't just repeatedly cast it) (as it's too useful to only cast once, and we don't want it repeatedly cast because it would make it impossible to see the battle properly). The blizzard puts out the flames from the wooden stake perimeter.\\
• The zombies just fall over the (now no longer burning) wooden stakes so that those after them can climb up over their dead bodies, and then the battle with the Northerner infantry begins in earnest.\\
• Under the snow cover of the blizzard, in the melee outside the castle, Arya puts on her mask, disguising herself as a White Walker, and starts to mingle into the zombie lines, who totally ignore her.\\
• Under the snow cover of the blizzard, the Undead Dragon attacks Winterfell, burning right smack through the walls. The people manning the Scorpions never even see the Undead Dragon coming, and take too long to turn their Scorpions around as the Undead Dragon flies about. Five of the six Scorpions are destroyed.\\
• Jon takes Dragon #3 to engage it in melee and the two dragons tumble to the ground in the middle of Winterfell courtyard, with the Undead Dragon breathing fire every which way and killing many of the infantry in the courtyard, who panic. The crew of the final Scorpion has it pointed at the dragons but don't dare fire for fear of injuring Dragon #2.\\
• Jon tries to stab the Undead Dragon with his valyrian steel blade but the Undead Dragon, being aware of the threat, manages to get Jon flung away, and his sword is sent flying and lands by Tormund's feet. The two dragons are unable to cause lasting damage to each other. The archers manning the battlements shoot down at the dragons, knowing their obsidian-tipped arrows will only kill the Undead Dragon. Picking up the sword, Tormund rushes the Undead Dragon and penetrates it with the sword, causing it to disintegrate, but is hit by a final breath of blue flame and is burned to death. The blizzard meanwhile has petered out.\\
• Daenerys returns to Winterfell and reunites with Jon. Sticking with their earlier strategy of trying to bait out the Night King, Daernys and her two dragons make a show of flying south from Winterfell, even though they know this will devastate the morale of the defenders.\\
• Arya manages to sneak up on White Walker #2 and stabs him with her valyrian steel blade, disintegrating him and causing the first undead army (the ones currently attacking the infantry outside the castle) to drop dead. (This makes Arya's face changing plot relevant and thus rewarding to the audience.)\\
• This gives the infantry an unexpected respite and allows them to reform ranks and set fire to the fallen before any of them can be raised, as well as to re-light the stakes.\\
• White Walker #3 then leads his undead army in to attack. This time the worn-down defenders are defeated and rout, and retreat to the castle.\\
• The zombies swarm into Winterfell (whose walls had been blasted apart at several points by the Undead Dragon). The defenders engage in melee within the castle.\\
• An Undead Giant charges in, scattering the defenders. Theon musters his courage and charges the Undead Giant, gets picked up in its grasp, but manages to stab the Undead Giant in the eye with his valyrian steel sword, disintegrating it (concluding his character arc about courage, making it relevant, and thus rewarding to the audience), however he's also suffered lethal injuries from being crushed in the Undead Giant's grip.\\
• The zombies have now poured into Winterfell courtyard and slaughtered many of its defenders. White Walker #3 approaches the castle walls, with zombies close at hand to absorb arrow fire, and reanimates all those in the courtyard, devastating the morale of the defenders.\\
• As they are all concentrated into a tight location, Melisandre casts her contagious fire enchantment again, just as White Walker #3 comes face to face with her as if daring her to finish. The white walker skewers Melisandre through the heart with an ice spear, but she finishes casting her spell.\\
• All the weapons of the living, the fallen, and the undead in the courtyard catch fire, and since many of these weapons are on the ground, this causes flames to erupt from the ground up, setting fire to basically all of the zombies in the courtyard and spreading outward to much of the rest of the undead army, and as they fall, this leaves White Walker #3 temporarily undefended. (At this point it's clear that Melisandre's earlier fire enchantment casting is foreshadowing for this, much more effective use of the same spell.)\\
• Jorah is caught in the melee and gets his greyscale-infected arm cut into -- and when the ichor therein sprays out, it melts the attacking zombie like some kind of incredibly corrosive acid. Realizing this, Jorah starts slashing away at his infected arm (which he can't feel anyway), from the elbow down to the wrist, sending sprays of ichor out before him that melt any zombies that get in the way, and thus he manages to approach the now lightly defended White Walker #3. After confirming that his greyscale ichor has no effect on the white walker, they engage in close combat. The White Walker fatally skewers him in the abdomen with his ice spear, but Jorah grabs on to it (so the white walker can't make use of it to defend himself) and then hacks the head off White Walker #3. (This makes the plot relating to greyscale relevant and thus rewarding to the audience.)\\
• The death of the white walker causes another undead army to collapse, and the defenders have a short respite during which they burn the corpses of the fallen so they can't be raised. At this point gallows humor abounds as the defenders know they're all going to die. Many of them take the opportunity to flee the castle, Jaime, Sandor, Bronn, and Brienne among them (Jaime and Brienne knowing that appearing to lose is part of the plan).\\
• The next undead army shows up and this time the (next to nonexistent) defenders are truly overwhelmed.\\
• Finally, after securing the castle, and knowing that the dragons are nowhere near the area, the Night King shows himself (alongside White Walker #4 and #5) face to face with Bran, Jon, and Beric -- the sole survivors at this point. The Night King knows one of the remaining White Walkers (who only now have just showed up beside him) is a fake because by his count there should only be one White Walker besides himself (there were only 4 to begin with), and decides to take advantage of the situation by having each of the White Walkers face off against one of Bran's defenders.\\
• They then fight: Beric vs White Walker #4, and Jon vs White Walker #5. Arya (as White Walker #5) is pained to have to fight against her brother Jon, but realizes that defeating the Night King is more important than letting Jon survive, and this may be their best opportunity. Arya accidentally fatally impales Jon, and the Night King destroys his valyrian steel sword. At this point by Arya's calculations the Night King should trust her, and she gradually approaches the Night King in a way that wouldn't look suspicious to him. However to her surprise Beric manages to kill White Walker #4 after skewering him with a normal sword, then invoking the Lord of Light to set fire to his sword.\\
• More of the undead die, and the Night King knows that White Walker #5 is a fake, but realizing that her identity has been revealed, Arya runs and turns a corner and changes her appearance into that of a zombie, and the Night King can't tell her apart from all his minions. Instead, he skewers Beric with an ice spear.\\
• Then right before Bran, the Night King reanimates Jon as a zombie. Except unbeknownst to the Night King, the reanimated Jon isn't under the Night King's control, and Jon fights the Night King with Beric's (now-back-to-normal) sword. The Night King is shocked but isn't worried about dying to a normal sword, especially since Beric is now dead. Jon manages to impale the Night King, who only grins -- until Jon calls upon the Lord of Light as well, and the sword catches fire, killing the Night King.\\
• As all the undead disintegrate, Arya has a tearful reunion with Jon, saying she had not wanted to kill him and why didn't he dodge, and Jon says he recognized her combat style and knew it was her, and that it was more important for her to kill the Night King by getting his trust (which would have worked if White Walker #4 hadn't died to Beric), and also how did Jon come back from the dead not under the Night King's control, and Jon says he has come back from being dead before, with intercession from the Lord of Light, who probably has a bone to pick with the Night King anyway given how they're of light and dark and the Lord of Light had helped both Melisandre and Beric in this battle. (This makes the plot relating to Jon returning from the dead relevant and thus rewarding to the audience.)

Thoughts? Suggestions?


** if I'm Cersei I would never send scorpions north. One undead dragon versus two alive ones? I would absolutely send a contingent whose only job is to scout and a meagre force to justify them allowing the scouts to ride on horse.

Also would scorpions even do anything? There's no dragonglass bolts nor time enough to make it. Might even have to be Valyrian steel.

I'm not sure this is even rational. Seems more like you're trying to write a good show. It doesn't seem like you gave the Night King any equivalent boost? If he's aware of Bran and knows that Bran knows what he knows then he should be acting differently.

** [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jY2jAnV5Fa4][Why cavalry charge the undead"]]

The linked video also stresses how ineffectually the castle was used in the episode. You improved on that, it seems, but I expect he'd still complain about the underutilization of archers and the castle for maneuvering. One specific tactic suggested was to position the infantry around, not in front, and attempt to lure the Whites into circling the castle to be softened up by arrow-fire. However, if that had been executed effectively, it would have made the episode kinda drag and limit the opportunity to show the other defenses being of use.

I like your more effective use of dragons. I almost want to say the barrel of daggers should have been a barrel of flechettes, but that would imply someone had bothered planning for how to launch obsidian attacks from dragonback, and why would they bother developing a weapon specifically for that when they already have a dragon and daggers? Barrel of daggers is already pretty effective. The only downside would be if the handles outweigh the blades, since that seems like it would reduce the number of daggers that would actually do the necessary damage to neutralize Whites. But I'm just quibbling over the precise shape of the fragments, when the tactic overall is sound.

*** Pretty good video. There are so many problems with that battle, none of it made any sense.

Other points not broached in the video:

- the living troops are dispersed like they are preparing to march, not fight. They should be densely packed into literal walls of soldiers. The word "sergeant" comes from french "serre-gens" which literally means "squeeze people", because they were employed to keep pikemen squeezed together contiguously. That density is necessary in order to break charges and physically prevent enemies from passing through their lines.

- beyond the issue of absent shields, hardly anyone even wears a helmet (save for Grey Worm) ! And the armor is overall shown as little more effective than papier mâché which is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlIUrd7d1Q][utterly ridiculous]].

But then I'm sure there are half a million articles and videos pointing out all those and more already.

** There's actually another reason to give the NK a reason to personally go after Bran. I'm actually baffled it wasn't used in the show, because as far as I can remember it only took place in the show, and hasn't been shown in the books, so it might actually have been something DnD came up with together.

In one of the earlier seasons, we had a great scene where the NK seemingly turned one of Craster's baby boy sacrifices into a new White Walker. This established that, at the very least, the NK was capable of turning humans into White Walkers with a touch.

Given that Bran has spent the past 7 years amassing more and more mystic power, it would be perfectly rational for the NK to want to recruit Bran into his army, by turning him into a white walker. Having a White Walker general with all of Bran's established powers (controlling animals, controlling people, clairvoyance, an unlimited ability to see and even kind of influence the past and a vague, implied ability to see at least some of the future) could essentially be a win condition for the NK, and would provide him with a strong incentive to want to get within touching range of Bran. It would even make sense for the NK to be aware of the Three Eyed Raven and his powers, given that the NK was a creation of the Children of the Forest, and it would have been perfect if it was the weakening of the old Three Eyed Raven, as well as the decline of the few remaining Children of the Forest, to be the reason the NK suddenly became capable of waging his war on the living.

Other than that, I really don't think Arya would be able to impersonate a White Walker. From what we've seen of their biology, and how they shatter after death, it seems impossible. And honestly, without somehow buffing Bran or making him an irresistible, instant-win target, I don't see how the living could ever possibly win once rational NK has a dragon.

If the NK was rational, there would never have been a siege of Winterfell, Bran be damned. Last episode we saw just how effective a dragon is at taking cities and mass destruction. Dragons are already incredibly hard to hit, and an undead dragon would be even tankier, making any hits that landed even less. A rational NK could have just flown around Winterfell during the night, headed south, and just spent a while razing cities to the ground and bringing back the dead as even more fodder for his army. If a rational NK is going to be defeated, there has to be a reason for him to take risks; a target he can't risk killing the normal way.

The NK wanting to turn Bran, I think, could very easily provide that reason, and could be a springboard from which a rational strategy could be planned.

If he did that there'd be no corpses for him to raise, it's established that burned corpses can't be raised. So he wouldn't want to actually use his dragon to just toast everybody. And if the dragon killed through non-fire means, it'll have to get up close and personal, /and/ be far away from zombie support and the support of his night walkers. If his dragon got shot by a ballista he'd fall and wind up alone deep in enemy territory.

**** Dragons are incredibly hard to hit in flight, and dragon fire in the show has been shown to have an incredible amount of kinetic force behind them. Simply flying around a city and focusing on blowing up structures so that towers and buildings collapse on people would yield a significant amount of non-burnt dead. But even if that wouldn't work, he easily could have flown around the southern countryside at night slaughtering smallfolk (who, without valyrian steel or dragonglass, would be powerless to stop him). He could amass a decent force this way, and then attack towns and cities the normal 'zombie zerg rush way'. The last episode shows us that a single dragon can easily solo a city, and only Kings Landing has Scorpions. And even then, there's nothing saying that the NK couldn't just pull a Scorpion bolt out of his dragon and raise it again, if the structural damage wasn't to severe. Hiding from his horde in a castle would be completely impossible, unless you have your own dragons to defend you, and any survivors fleeing the flames would run right into his zombies But essentially the point I was trying to make is that, given the situation we get in season 8, a rational NK is basically unbeatable. The fact that he has a dragon, is completely immune to harm from anything but valyrian steel and dragonglass, can mass raise the dead, and already has White Walker Generals that can control their own thralls, means that, if he plays his cards right, he really can't lose.

The only way the good guys have any chance of winning is if the Night King has a very strong reason to attack Winterfell personally. Otherwise a smart NK just has a few of his generals attack Winterfell, and flies south by night to start another horde, in a land where there are no dragons to fight him, and nobody knows how to hurt him. But from your other reply I can see that you already like my Bran idea xD

*** I always figured he turned children into WWs instead of adults because he doesn't have control over them like he does with the zombies, so he has to raise them from a young age to ensure loyalty. Otherwise, I don't know why he wouldn't just turn adults. Assuming that theory is wrong, even if he could turn Bran and control him, wouldn't it be smarter to just kidnap him? What does the NK's presence accomplish that a thousand zombies couldn't?

I wish we knew what the NK's range for controlling and raising the dead was, he might've been able to just wait them out until their people started to starve or he could pick off the weak in their sleep with zombie [insert small but potentially lethal animals] and raise them to do the same. It kind of seems like the NK was in a hurry for no apparent reason, the weather alone would have depleted the living's forces considerably.

**** I kind of assuming that, from the way all his generals died when the NK died, the WWs are kind of a vague hive-mind. They are all obviously linked to him in a major way, given they all cease to exist once he's dead, so I thought it wouldn't be a major leap to assume they are all at least somewhat under his control. As for why the NK would need to do it personally; in the scene I mentioned, the NK was shown having to physically walk up, and touch the human child in order to turn them into a WW. It would however, be easier to just kidnap Bran, unless somehow the NK doesn't have enough fine control over his zombies to do that efficiently/safely. But that's making even more assumptions. We do need a lot more information, because you are right; the NK had absolutely no reason to be in a hurry. Put a rational actor in the NKs shoes at the start of season 8, and everyone on Westeros dies within the decade. We need more information on the specific weaknesses of the WWs that might have motivated them to chose a straight up battle instead of a war of attrition they were guaranteed to win, but that probably means waiting until either the books, or the prequel series comes out.

Wasn't that answered a few seasons ago? Basically, rogue magical androids created by the Children of the Forest to fight the First Men who went out of control. They're a paperclipper, except instead of making paperclips they were supposed to kill already to begin with.

****** We know where they come from, but what actually are they? Do they think? The Night King seemed to show emotion; do the other White Walkers have independent minds, or are they a hive-mind? Do they have a culture? They wear clothes, so clearly they can make stuff, and that seems indicative of culture - why wear clothes when nothing can harm anyway, and the few things that do instantly pierce your clothes, except for cultural reasons? How do they raise the Whitewalker babies we see the NK create? Do they even have to raise them? Do they have a language? How exactly does their ability to raise the dead work? Do they cause winter, or do they only invade during winter? Are they alive? If so, what do they eat? Are they solar powered? Somehow powered by magic? Do they have to sleep? And tons of stuff like that.

Essentially, we know where the come from. But we don't really know anything about how they work, and that's what I meant by not knowing what they 'really are'.

******* True, true. I don't know if the books will necessarily answer all that (after all, sometimes keeping a veil of mystique is a good thing when it comes to supernatural eldritch threats), but there's a lot of potential. Maybe someone ought to write a ratfic about that. A story from the viewpoint of the WW.

** I think in order to do a rationalist rewrite of this battle we'd need a stronger understanding of how the NK's powers actually work, something that Bran could conceivably tell us about if he observed past battles that the NK took part in and how he reacted/approached certain situations.

I like the idea with Arya but I don't think impersonating a white walker is feasible. On one side I think she needs to remove the face of someone in order to become them so she'd need a white walkers face, but they crumple into ice when they die so this might not be possible. On the other hand, I think the show gives decent evidence to the fact that the NK can see through the eye's of his zombies but can't control them, or see through them, all simultaneously, instead, he can give broad orders to groups of them telepathically. This might make impersonating a zombie possible since doing a search through his entire army to find one that he can't see through would be pretty hard without something like a mental look-up table and a decent search algorithm, realistically it probably shouldn't be something that crosses his mind in the first place unless he happens to spot the one acting abnormal. His white walkers, though, are few in number, distinct in appearance, communicate in some way that isn't the common tongue, and would be easy to keep tabs on (something the other white walkers could help with as well).

I like the idea of the NK wanting Bran for his strategic value but, honestly, he should want him dead just as much, since, without Bran, enemy forces would have little to no chance of locating the NK who could then just hide as far away as possible and safely direct his army. Also, Bran needs to be warging into people (or fucking toucans, maybe other wargers could allow bird to bird communication, are any left?) in order to direct his forces if he wants to stay competitive with the NK's abilities, otherwise the strike teams and dragons sent to kill the NK will have a rough time actually finding him if he isn't stationary.

Cersei probably should have sent scorpions since, if they won but the scorpions were destroyed in the process she would look good for helping (giving her some political leverage), if they won and the scorpions weren't destroyed she could have left her soldiers with standing orders to kill the remaining dragons and/or any other key assets, and if they didn't win she would be fucked either way.

Overall, I much prefer your version to the travesty that was actually shown. The better use of Milasandre, Greyscale, the dragons' ability to airdrop stuff, and the lord of light are all far more satisfying.

*** Good point on the impersonating a zombie difficulty, in my revised script (not here) I have the night king moving his minions and spotting Arya when Arya (while in the crowd of zombies) doesn't move the very instant the minions do.

It's already explained in the show that Bran can't possess people (except the insane, in the case of Hodor). In my revised plot I have Bran directing Daernys and directing the Scorpion crews (to aim at the night walkers) with ravens.

Thanks!

**** Ya, I figured humans or toucans would be the most convenient options and I wasn't sure if his ability to control humans might have gotten a buff when he became the three-eyed raven, but it doesn't really matter, there's a ton of ways to create methods of communication with even a single bird (tactile or audible morse code, flight patterns, probably other stuff I haven't thought of). Although, the show leads me to believe that Bran can't multitask (he controls a flock of ravens and flies them in formation, but I don't think we've seen him perform separate tasks in separate areas) so scouting with birds in one area while relaying information with birds in other areas may not be in the cards for him. His ability to coordinate the human forces is probably less powerful than the NK.

I think something may need to be said about zombie giants using their massive bows to take down dragons or just snipe people from range, they're basically highly mobile scorpions. Throwing other zombies over the walls or past enemy lines could be fairly useful as well.

Just remembered animals can be made into zombies too, so zombie birds for recon, mammoths (could've sworn I saw these at some point), bears, etc. should all be tools at the NK's disposal.

** One way to give the NK a reason for going after Bran is that there's a scene where Bran used his greenseer abilities to disrupt the NKs control of the wights, possibly even (temporarily) subvert them. I feel like it'd add more urgency to the NK wanting to take down Bran + needing to be close enough as to be at risk

** Are we minmaxing here or going for a cinematic story?

I actually wonder why the Night King attacks Winterfell at all. He is not in a hurry. He could just lay siege and wait for them to starve or freeze. Creating zombies in the crypt is a nice trick to devastate moral during the siege, but maybe he would have to be too close.

In terms of cinematic story, I think [[http://www.sirlin.net/posts/game-of-thrones-predictions-from-a-game-designer][David Sirlin has the best retelling]]. It also includes Arya killing Jon.

*** hmm, interesting. I wanted to both make the story rationalist, and make it cinematic.

In my version the Night King has to be in a hurry, Bran can constantly direct the dragons to drop bombs on him and his white walkers (as seen in the first segment of my plot), and his white walkers need to be around or else the dragons will make quick work of his zombies (meaning he and his white walkers can't just hole up somewhere).

I was working this morning on coming up with the rest of how I would like to see Season 8 play out. Basically, in my version, the Night King is trying to set things up so that the rest of the characters set out to destroy themselves (Cersei, Daenerys, Jon) to make things easier for himself, and he is able to reincarnate from other white walkers (this is me pulling artistic license here) so his objective in the battle of Winterfell is to convincingly get his current body killed. So he can't make it too easy on the defenders, but he can't also be entirely away.

I don't like the idea of Bran being the Night Walker. That has a lot of problems, too, such as how the Night Walker possesses him (not a power the Night Walker is supposed to have).

Now, idk if this is actually the case, but I was under the impression that his WWs were autonomous generals with there own zombie forces. Is there any reason for them not to separate? Could the NK and his undead dragon with endless stamina not just lead the other dragons on an endless goose chase? Maybe he could take a WW with him too to throw spears off the back of his dragon. While this is happening, the rest of his WWs could just attack Winterfell or King's Landing.

The NK has been seen downing a dragon with a javelin throw. And if he downs it, he adds it to his forces. What's a few hundred mindless undead lost compared to /that/? If he gets all three dragons, the world is his. The enemy sending the dragons right into my maw would be /exactly what I want/, if I were in him.

** Why all the cleverness? The defenders of Winterfell have such a massive advantage in the fight its almost obscene.

In Season 6, it is established that Bran can warg into people in the past when he possesses Hodor and sets him up to hold the door against the wights and save Bran later on in life. I'll accept that maybe Bran has to be nearby to the victim or the victim in question must be susceptible to being possessed in the first place, so perhaps Bran could not just possess the Night King before he was undead and was only a child and have him commit suicide, but Bran is still the most powerful being in Planetos. All Bran needs to do is to simply warg back into an animal or human in the past near his old self in a timeline he dislikes and explain to him the exact repercussions of a certain action his past self takes, presumably collapsing the current timeline and allowing past Bran to make a more prudent choice. In theory, Bran could simply test thousands or more actions, strategies, etc, until he finishes the battle in a timeline wherein the Night King loses.

Hell, he could probably have Theon shoot an obsidian-tipped arrow from the castle walls and, over hundreds of timelines, refine the exact angle, force, time and location to shoot it at to dink the Night King in the forehead and allay the siege with one simple flick of a bow.

**** I guess there's no point in just arming our living dragon to the teeth with Valerian steel /obsidian if their scales are /that/ good, seeing as they're not strong enough to break little metal chains...it would be like two turtles trying to kill each other, except without any of the little fleshy bits.

If the eye is the only weak spot, I guess Bran can warg into a little mosquito or something and get the eye.

However...the scales /aren't/ that strong, are they? If they are, how did the night king kill the living dragon /with a spear/? (And we know that Valerian steel is an effective counter to ice blades, unless this is some sort of rock-paper-scissors magic deal and Valerian steel is strong against ice spears but weak against undead dragon scales, while live dragons are weak against ice spears).

** Sorry, this kinda falls apart for me at the very beginning. Why would Cersei, the way we know her to be, do that? Yes, Cersei's actions are short-sighted and spiteful. But Cersei /is/ short-sighted and spiteful. That's her whole personality, basically. She thinks herself cunning but ultimately she's never able to have the big picture, she can scheme but not lay down a strategy, and that's her undoing time and time again. A story being rational should not mean every character being rational. Also because at that point if the Night King was fully rational /too/... well. Good riddance, humanity.

** While I certainly feel that your solution is more rational than the episode it still focuses on creating scenes that the audience find appealing, at the cost of optimizing the chances of winning on both sides. Now, if the natural laws in the GoT universe(which we know are different than ours due to magic) then you could potentially justify it or the characters didn't have winning as their first priority.

I am toying with this idea of a setting in which there is a symbiotic relationship between the world and the author in the sense that the author in fact observes the world and it's characters rather than dictating it and the worlds continual existence depends on the author devoting mental energy towards sustaining that world. If a few individuals(namely the main characters) knew about this interaction it might be rational for them to create narratively appealing scenes, at the cost of other elements of their utility function, to appeal to an audience in order to keep the author continually interested in the world.

In such an instance it would be easy to justify a number of choices both in your version and the cinematic version.
