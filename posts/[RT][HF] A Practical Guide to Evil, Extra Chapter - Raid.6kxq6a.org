** Robber is so getting a name. Or maybe even has one and will reveal it in a hilarious fashion.

*** Maybe his Name is Robber. Or is that too close to Thief? Then again, robbery is theft through violence or threat of violence. Thief mostly seems to stick to burglary.

**** That's my thought. Robber is his assumed name and could very easily turn just like Adjutant's has. Especially given how much of a story he and his band of murderous plunderers are provoking with all his antics.

** Robber and his team are always a delight. The Goblin culture is both well realised and still mysterious.

Seeing Thief was a surprise and the fact that she's still around is another potential complication on top of everything Cat's already trying to deal with. The Thief's dismissal of Cat because she's in Arcadia has got to come back to bite her.

  “Everybody knows Foundling's in Arcadia,” the heroine snorted. “She's not getting out for a few years, if ever.”

And, can someone explain this comment The Thief made to Robber?

  “There's a reason we're even having this conversation, goblin,” the heroine replied frankly.
