If you want to just dive into the story, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pEQp8tBxZrx9k5PhdsADgIrNr5IHF3E_aoxLs0yXTw/edit][Jump in here and enjoy]].

If you're wanting to know more about the story, it's a first-person POV story told from the side of the main male protagonist, with planned flashback chapters from the POV of the gynoid protagonist.

The setting is heavily inspired by several post-cyberpunk works of fiction, such as The Diamond age by Neal Stephenson and Saturn's Children by Charles Stross, but I've so far managed to find my own twists on the post-scarcity not-quite-utopia.

So, this is the first place I've dared to put any of this work out there, mainly because it took me several painful rewrites to get an introduction that fit the setting without being too long.

*** Thank you for the odd compliment, I guess?

I found it very difficult to make a synopsis that didn't sound like the first episode of a harem comedy, even if in the writing I found myself far from that genre's tropes.

I've never really gotten much enjoyment out of that genre, an utterly whipped male protagonist with no real character traits against an increasingly unlikely number of female deuteragonists gets annoying quickly.

** How does a cat know how to put on clothes?

Well. I suppose I should be asking how and why this anthroid mind is considered feline. I thought it was going to be a literal cat. And if it used to be a literal cat, then how do they not have AGI when they do have the capability to uplift emulated minds. Did they do some sort of probabilistic mapping from a cat's brain to a human's brain? What is the relation to cats, besides the Doylian interpretation of the catgirl trope as premise? It honestly seems cat-themed, but... why?

** My first though was "wait, a vagina robot?" And then I realized that it's meant to be the parallel etymological path as android
