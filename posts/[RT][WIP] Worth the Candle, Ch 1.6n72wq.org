** This is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, and I would have made it a Groundhog Day loop if I thought I could fit that in.

** u/LucidityWaver:
#+begin_quote
  loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul. This story uses some custom CSS for the character sheet and definition tags to allow mouseover on various game terms
#+end_quote

I can tell I'm going to love this already.

Update: Yep. Definitely enjoying this so far.

*** It's supposed to be "unreadable", i.e. unknown to the player but viewable by a sufficiently interested reader for a peek at what's ahead. More on that next chapter.

** Really enjoyable so far! I'm curious to see how the main character's personal history will influence the story.

*** Thanks! I don't for sure know how long this will go, but I'm hoping that the weaving of candid personal information and narrative is at least entertaining.

*** Ch 6 should be up late tonight and I will make another post to the subreddit tomorrow morning. I'm writing fairly quickly and mod/community preference is to not have serial works posted more than once a week.

** I'm enjoying it a lot. So far the world seems really well thought out and I'm enjoying the blending of Joop's reality with the fantasy world a lot more than I expected at the beginning.
