** Nose goes as to who writes the sequel in which a literal court of kangeroos reviews the Simba.v.Scar case to decide whether Simba was or was not justified in throwing Scar to the bloodthirsty crowds and effectively murdering him.

** I kinda disagree? Like, in the film, we didn't actually see anyone holding political positions. Which is, admittedly, /how it works/ in a system based on /royalty ruling/ instead of officials standing for election on the strength of their policies and ideologies.

  Mufasa's rule is portrayed in the film as a time of joy and tranquility, where all animals live side by side in love and harmony. Even if they ate each other on occasion, it was okay -- all part of the great circle of life. "When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great Circle of Life," explains Mufasa to his son Simba. This, of course, is harmony of tyrants, for it is almost completely uncertain that Mufasa ever asked the antelopes whether this arrangement is fine by them. If I were an antelope, and a lion was tearing my sister's neck and ripping her insides as he hums "The Circle of Life" -- the first thought going through my mind would not be "That's okay, tomorrow I'm going to eat tons of grass. Tons!"

Ok, sure, it sucks being eaten by a lion. But the question is: what are the antelopes going to do about it? They're an r-strategist herbivore: if they overthrow the lions and take the entirety of the realm for themselves and other vegetarians, they're breed themselves into an overpopulation crisis.

So the nasty question is: how do you get (IIRC) r-strategist herbivores to develop the intelligence and technology necessary to use birth control so that they don't need a predator to control their population numbers? And then, of course, how do you execute a genocide by vegetarians against born-and-trained hunters? And then, of course, how do you deal ethically with committing a self-defensive genocide?

Nasty issues here.
