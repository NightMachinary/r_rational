*** #+begin_quote
  The protagonist is largely amoral, preferring enlightened self-interest and seriously considers buggering off to Essos and leaving everyone else to burn.
#+end_quote

I know it's not diplomatic but is that a polite way of saying he's an asshole? I can't read anything with unsympathetic characters as protagonists.

**** Hmmm. Well I was using it to mean that his personal goals do not include making things better for everyone and he acts accordingly. You might find him an asshole, I'm not quite sure: it's a rather personal judgement. Callous, definitely.

He has no qualms about being a /pointfully/ cruel despot though. He has a dude tortured and everything.

**** Well honestly it takes a gigantic asshole to be unsympathetic if they are in the context of asoiaf. Being amoral is required if you want to make changes and not die much like self interest and leaving everything behind to enjoy riches is what most people would do if the have to choose between it and trying to make their way through King's Landing intrigue.

Having read the story he's very pleased with himself and quite ruthless (he really enjoys having power and money unsurprisingly) but his main goals include making the smallfolks lives better and helping out his new family and friends...as well as making a ridiculous amount of money through industry.

I've seen this mentioned often, is it really that good? Is it like Sleeping with the Girls where in-universe concepts are explained to the reader so they don't have to watch/read everything they reference?

***** He's actually got two Multiverse SI, and gabbalis is talking about the one I consider to be the worse one (due to comparative lack of dragons).

Hiver is an interesting fellow. Not a native english-speaker, the quality of his writing has increased greatly over the years, yet his early works are still readable despite all that purely on the strength of the rest of it. I would definitely call his writing enjoyable, with solidly applied munchkinry to fantastic settings and such. Logical thinker by and large.

Personally I'd call the majority of his stuff good but not great, workmanlike would be the word I would use, I think. Also rather easy to binge on, and quite a lot /to/ binge on seeing as he's been churning out updates daily on various stories for something like 4 years now. Not Quite Shodan (star trek) is probably his best work from my perspective, followed closely by the Multiverse SI with the dragons. I seem to recall I had to do some googling when he went out of the works I was familiar with.

***** Strictly speaking it was a MTG planeswalker fic starring Hinata, and just happened to spend most of its time in GoT.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-saga-of-many-planes-planeswalker-hinata-mtg-crossover.336114/#post-17151992]]

As for rating it... Eh, Id say it was so so. It probably would have been cooler as a straight Naruto/GoT crossover...
