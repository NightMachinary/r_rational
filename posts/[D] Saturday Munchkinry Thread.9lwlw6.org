Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I'm currently sketching out a variant of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111][The Rules of Wishing]] (very) loosely based on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA][Twisted]] (NB: Chances of my going anywhere with this are relatively low, I'm mostly just thinking this through). As part of that I'm planning to nerf the wishes down to a bit more "mundane utility" level.

​

As in rules of wishing the restriction have a certain amount of in-build extensibility and a certain degree of sentient judgement built in. Assume anything that looks like you're trying to rules lawyer will be nerfed (e.g. no wishing for wishes, no "I wish for X and Y" composite wishes, etc). Beyond that the main restrictions are:

1. The wish may only directly affect one person and requires informed consent from that person.
2. Even indirectly the wish may not harm anyone (ETA: The level of indirection here is bounded. You can use things given to you by wishes to harm people, and long chains of causality are fine. This is mostly a cap on things like "I wish for an anvil to appear over their head").
3. The wish may not cause persistent magical effects. Once the wish has completed in "reasonable time" (not more than an hour, certainly) the result of the wish is purely mundane.
4. The wish may not grant people knowledge that has never been known by any human. However it can combine from multiple sources. e.g. you could wish to be the best, say, blacksmith in the world and you would get knowledge that was not possessed by any single blacksmith to date. You could not wish to learn how to make technology that has not yet been invented.
5. Similarly the wish may not grant an entity ~~physical~~ capabilities outside of the range of normal variation for the target. You could wish to be the strongest man who ever lived, but not for the strength of ten regular men. You could wish to become a youth in peak health, but not for immortality.
6. +The amount of stuff a wish can create is bounded to, say, the size of a large palace.+ The total volume affected by the wish (including creation, destruction, modification) must be contained within a contiguous region contained in a sphere of no more than about a mile in diameter.
7. Wishes cannot create or restore life.
8. The wishes may not grant knowledge about or otherwise affect any other magical items that may exist.

(The actual rulebook is much larger, and may be expanded in response to wishes)

You have three such wishes, and are a native in a roughly medieval tech setting. What do you do with them?

​

Additional rules added as a result of munchkinning:

1. +The area of effect of the wish may be no more than a few miles across (I can make a ruling on exactly how many is "a few" if it matters)+
2. The rules of wishing themselves cannot be affected by wishes.
3. The results of the wish may not depend on knowledge of the future. e.g. you cannot wish for something that maximizes the chance of some outcome occurring.
4. The rules may not create anything that could not in principle have been built by a small number of people subject to the "normal range of variation" rules in up to about 100 years of work and an effectively unbounded amount of unskilled labour. You cannot bootstrap this by assuming such people have access to previously wish-created items i.e. you can wish for things that have been created to an implausibly high level of engineering and craftsmanship, including the development of some new techniques, but new technology is right out.
5. The rules may not create non-living intelligences (mostly covered by the previous rule).
6. Ruling on the interaction between knowledge and "normal range of variation" rules: What is achievable for a given person is roughly "assume they are at one in 100 billion levels of natural talent and worked at this for their entire lifetime".

*** Wish one would be the essential 'I wish to be as intelligent as the most intelligent human to ever exist' or some variation on that if the wish giver is malicious. Alternatively, 'I wish for all the knowledge of rules lawyering'. Something to that effect. I can then base future wishes on that level of intelligence, which would affect my other 2 choices, but if precommitment is a thing that has to happen, then...

Does rule 2's 'anyone' cover microorganisms? If not, I would wish for all harmful to humans microorganisms to be modified to not harm humans in a single change. If germ theory has not been invented, then a varient of that (ie 'the end of those malignant curses' or such) In scenario one, it is not a persistent magical effect, but rather a single change, and thus works even with rule three. In scenario two, it is essentially the same thing, if less informed. Either way, it will keep humanity less dead for a decent length of time. Advice with better phrasing would be appreciated, as this is just the general gist of things.

Finally, a wish to be placed in the position where I can do the most good at the most personal satisfaction. This should be relatively lofty due to my wish for high intelligence, and essentially works as a poor man's precog without the work of interpreting it, since I'll essentially be creating the future which gives me the most bang for my buck.

One thing I didn't take advantage of was a noticeable lack of defence against 'meta' wishes in the main list of rules (eg, 'I wish that my future wishes were not affected by the rules of wishing'). You gave it a sort of acknowledgement before the list, but rule 8 only concerns items, when it could be altered to affect wishes as well. That would be my only qualm at a glance.

I don't see how that follows; even if the rules adapt to prevent "exploitation" over a certain threshold, there should be an acceptable level of comprehension that stays in bounds. Any rules lawyering knowledge that would be invalidated as a consequence of it's bestowal is necessarily invalid rules-lawyering knowledge and therefor out of scope for the wish anyway. Wish one in this case, simply guarantees the best possible human wisher is making wishes two and three on your behalf.

Seems like it comes dangerously close to allowing a smart character to wish for more wishes. What's preventing me from taking the genies place and interpreting all future wishes to be more in line with whatever my goals are?

The rules around informed consent make it /relatively/ hard to do that effectively. Malice will mostly result in less effective wishes rather than wildly creative misinterpretations. Also "An eternity of slavery" (or until someone else swaps with you at least) is a pretty high price for the amount of power it gets you.

(In case anyone was wondering, the wish counter is attached to the lamp, not per genie. You don't get more wishes just because someone new has swapped in for the previous genie)

********** I'm not suggesting becoming a genie just to torment whoever gets a hold of the lamp next (I have no interest in tormenting random people) but it should be possible to interpret their wishes in such a way that they align with whatever I want to achieve.

For example, suppose my ultimate goal is reverse climate change. With 3 wishes that seems hard to do given the limitations that you have provided, so instead I use my final wish to trade places with the genie. Now the next schmuck comes around and wishes for a billion dollars, I fulfill that wish by converting approximately 1 million kg of CO2 or other greenhouse gasses (or whatever I can get from the most contaminated 1 mile radius volume in the atmosphere) into 1 dollar bills.

Now, that does presuppose that I am willing to spent "an eternity of slavery" in order to accomplish my goals, but honestly depending on what the conditions are like inside the lamp, that doesn't sound too bad. I also don't think it would be /that/ hard to convince someone to take the same deal that I did (or arrange for my lamp to get into the hands of someone that will) once my goals are accomplished.

As was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9lwlw6/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/e7a5iy7/][implicitly pointed out in a different comment]], it doesn't even need to be ruled as composite to be invalidated: This wish would put the wisher well outside of the normal range of human variation, in a way that "I wish to be the best possible at X" typically would not.

For a more specific ruling on what that rule covers for skills, I guess something like "You can't be better overall than an implausible-but-not-inhuman level of natural talent and a lifetime of dedicated study would get you"

It wouldn't surprise me if there were a bunch of arbitrary categorisations in the rules in various places. The way this worked in tRoW was that the rules tended to get backfilled with overly specific patches when someone was playing silly buggers. Mostly because I thought it was funnier that way.

The fact it would put you well outside the realm of normal variation in some regard doesn't actually matter, because it wouldn't put them /physically/ outside the realm of human variation which is what you specified.\\
They would be granted knowledge that it's perfectly possible for a person to have, it's just no human would ever have all that knowledge at once because they'd need to have more experience than people ever ordinarily get.

This works but it's important to specify that /this is a new rule not implicit in the original rules you laid down/. Also it's not clear why you'd even bother to prohibit this, after all the person might be an amazingly good blacksmith but given it can't grant any /new/ knowledge I really doubt this is remotely world breaking.

Right but I'm saying that this isn't actually patchable in a way that prevents people from exploiting this, unless somebody is trying the nearly /exact/ same wish as somebody else. Trying to go about formally categorizing knowledge in a way that corresponds even remotely with the concept of a "skill" is the sort of hard problem I suspect is on the level of say making AGI.

Yes these rules aren't intended to be a complete list so much as the "essential flavour" (when "rules of wishing" started the official number of rules was 5211, though obviously that's just flavour text and I didn't write down that many rules). In general the rules of wishing cannot be affected by wishes.

Since how exactly diameter is being measured isn't specified, you could for instance have the diameter be of a curving tube which wraps around the earth touching everything you care about but still not having more than a mile diameter at any portion.

Really that's an easy patch though, just specify that the wish measures the diameter from a single central point.

*** That's a lot of significant restrictions. However, there are only probably-circumventable linguistic difficulties with personally obtaining the synthesized sum total of all knowledge and useful insights held by any human ever. There is probably a huge amount of value in that synthesis.

It's your blacksmith example, but broadened as much as possible. And there are compounding effects from the synthesis - your uber-blacksmith would be capable not of just all the things any individual historical or contemporary blacksmith could so, but also a wealth of new things only enabled by their combination.

If you can get this full synthesis done in one wish, the rest should probably be spent getting a head start on having the means to apply the knowledge. Details would be shaped by exactly what you want to accomplish.

The possibility that this wish causes problems with human biological limitations should be addressed and mitigated or circumvented if possible. At some point these mental assets and capacities butt up against physical limitations mentioned in your restrictions. If so can we circumvent them by no longer remaining human, but becoming an instance of some other class with different physical limitations? Or is that exactly what is restricted by saying "the normal range of variation for /the target/?

--------------

Another, separate point is that more understanding around what /should/ be accomplished may be just as important as the knowledge and means to enable it. It's natural to think you know what you want, but wish stories are also full of foolish desires fulfilled and regretted. The sum of all human insights into what makes people happy or capable is a great help, but can we use a wish to get any additional wisdom/knowledge on this topic?

Edit: On reread, I think the rules prohibit that (the time limit), but you could implicitly do it by wishing for the outcome that maximised the chance of the desired outcome. I've now ruled that out.

Probably. That's more or less what Jasmine does in the original story. I haven't decided whether to rule it out yet or not. I think at the very least it would require you to pin down a bit more precisely what you mean by "best".

As others have already pointed out this limitation still lets you create machines which are intelligent and staggeringly powerful. So you're going to need to also put a limitation on not creating anything remotely intelligent. Also even once you've barred the creations of other intelligences you're going to need the power to consider any self replicating machines to be life (even though they wouldn't be technically) otherwise that creates an obvious ability for people to exploit advanced nanotech which isn't intelligent.

Of course even barring the creation of intelligence you're going to have a problem in that you can still create various physical systems which will go on to non-magically alter life or create extremely powerful life or machines.

Honestly it seems like ruling out exploits here is probably just completely impossible, because you can't predict every way the ability to manipulate matter except in certain specific ways I've disallowed will be exploitable.

Yes, this is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13523703][kinda the ongoing premise/joke of these stories]]. Note though that because the rules list is dynamic it's generally pretty easy to rule out the /obvious/ exploits as and when they come up.

They don't need modern concepts of AGI for this to be an exploit people would think of. For instance after trying some wishes and having them be denied, somebody would likely wish to create something which was able to satisfy the requirements they laid forth but wasn't technically alive by the standards of the wishing rules.

Well as your epilogue notes this sort of thing just doesn't work if you have intelligent characters around, also what counts as an obvious exploit is extremely relative. After all if I'm representative of the general level of effort of the comments you got then finding exploits in the rules you laid forth isn't even the sort of problem [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fhEPnveFhb9tmd7Pe/use-the-try-harder-luke][which is hard enough to require five minutes of serious thinking.]] Of course people who have these sorts of discussion on this subreddit are going to be fairly clever on average (at least if we're as clever as say [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]) thus tying back to the point you made in the epilogue.

*** I don't see any restriction to saying "I wish that you grant me whatever wish best satisfies my preferences" or something like that(even mor specific ones like what's the best way to get rich) , which should be at least as good as the best exploit people come up whith here.

Does that count as being a rules lawyer?

Also you can't be granted "knowledge" but can the wish implicitly do computation for you? I guess someone in a medieval setting would't be able to properly exploit that though.

Can you wish for a library whith books containing a lot of the most useful knowledge humanity has?. Or maybe just whith all existing books in your language(though It will be a problem if you can't read)

Otherwise wishing for a giant palace full of valuable things after wishing for peak intelligence and other things depending on the number of wishes seems a good option. Maybe ask whith a list of trustworthy people that will accept to work for you if you pay them/give them a home and were to find them (Someone in the world knows that information). Or detailed info on everyone on the world(just current people o magical effect), their desires , motivations etc, or maybe only people in the region so it's more manageable , but you can just ask for the whole thing ordered by where they are.

Once you have a few servants the risk of being betrayed starts to diminish. Get a few trustworthy mercenaries to protect yourself etc.

You can pretty much wish a palace as complicated as you want as long as it doesn't need magic to exist , it doesn't contain anything too difficult to make for a group of people of the time and fits on a mile.

Maybe you can even wish a city whith the palace as part of it(or copy an existing one whith a few changes) , and then start getting people to live in it .

Its difficult ,and there are lots of risks , but there is a path to becoming a local power there. You will have to bluff a lot at first ,and be very careful to avoid people just taking your palace.

And of course you would have to do it in a relatively inhabited place without local lords that will interfere.

If you are on the desert you can get the genie to make an oasis as part of the palace/city and also maybe make the surrounding desert fertile.

Btw gold is most likely not very valuable in the setting , if someone greedy and whith a bad grasp of economics IT's bound to already have wished for insane amounts of gold.

You should keep a wish(unless it bothers the genie too much) for emergencies ,since it allows you to do things like putting buildings in front of your enemies , teleporting you a mile away, destroying cities in such a way that does't kill anyone and making the weapons of an entire army in your range disappear.

If giving the lamp of whatever wish granting device to other people lets them also get whatever number of wishes ,you can get trustworthy people to use it for whatever the city needs , maybe things like creating rain in times of drought , making more houses , making them smarter ,charismatic and skilled in their job etc.

Basically the main uses seem to be buffing people matter creation , building things,and mind reading/ getting insane amounts of knowledge(either directly n your mind or in books depending on the circumstances and how much information you need)

I don't think they had a lot of gear-powered devices in the middle ages, largely due to the lack of efficiency, but if you had an infinite power source a lot of otherwise impractical devices would become useful.

If you had this device but were not a crazy smart inventor, the best thing to do would be to find some crazy smart inventor and get them to invent whatever technology they thought this device could be used for.

*** You don't want to put it on a trebuchet. When you apply it to an object and square the mass, the moment of inertia will increase not the angular velocity. This will make your trebuchet /harder/ to turn and won't speed it up.

It is very useful for things that you want to keep spinning such as a thrown spinning weapon (shuriken or frisbee), or things you don't want spinning such as you. You could apply it to your opponent's weapon as they are trying to swing, and watch as their practised motions utterly fail them.

It would be prudent to set a 'unit' for your mass so that we can accurately see how the scale of the object affects the moment. Angular momentum is measured in kg m^2 s^-1, and we can't change that even in fantasy. So if we multiply the mass onto it then we need to convert it to a dimensionless number by dividing it by a "one mass" constant. This also implies that if the object is below one mass then its angular momentum will decrease instead.

** You are a person who is, by your nature, driven to affect the world at large. (As many of us are.) You are also a wizard, capable of applying magic in arbitrarily flexible ways, though with limits on output which prevent you from affecting more than a cubic mile or more than a ton of matter.

A magical edict has been active for some time which forbids wizards from affecting more than their personal scope. This does not discriminate between means (e.g., you cannot do it by magic and you cannot do it by political office). The explicit exception is defending the world against external threats (aliens, shoggoths, Outsiders a-la the Dresden Files), and the implicit exception is that other people affected by you can affect more than your (or their) personal scope.

Attempts to modify or affect the Edict will guaranteeably, lethally fail. Things which violate the Edict will fail in ways that at best expend your effort for no effect.
