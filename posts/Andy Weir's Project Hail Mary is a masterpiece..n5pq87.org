I loved The Martian and thought Artemis was...okay.

Project Hail Mary is excellent. Much more similar to The Martian, but with some fantastic differences. It's some of the best, hardest sci-fi I've read in a long time. I haven't finished it just yet but...do yourself a favor and pick it up if that's your kind of thing.

Edit: I finished it. Fantastic. Definitely stand by my recommendation.

If you do like The Martian, (and/or Project Hail Mary) may I also recommend Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke and Seveneves by Neil Stephenson. One thing I like about all of these books is that the antagonist isn't some inexplicably evil person or entity, it's just the universe. The drama derives far less from people being bitchy and far more from situational problems that the protagonists have to solve with science, creativity, trust and teamwork.

(There is a fair bit of human-derived drama in Seveneves, but it's still secondary to the actual problem around which the book centers.)

**** I don't think artificial suns would work to solve the global cooling problem. The way they enrich their astrophage is by having it absorb sunlight. Having it release that energy later is a net zero. You could use astrophage as a grow lamp in a greenhouse or something like that, but it's not clear that this is easier than getting the energy from solar panels.

If you set up infrastructure to collect the astrophage migrating towards Venus and return it to Earth on a massive scale, that could solve global cooling but would be far beyond the tech used in the book.

***** I meant the panels they use in the Saharah, put on grids in the L points. Closer much better concentration+harvest than natural Astrophage. But my error was assuming that Spindrive solves space travel - it only solves spacetravel in vacuum, you can't use it to start from atmospheric gravity wells.

****** the problem with Black Panels at the L points is that there's no CO₂. They need carbon to undergo mitosis.

I think small spin drives *could* solve atmospheric spaceflight fairly well; if you can exert massive energy on demand, there's a way to do what you want with it. A nuclear rocket concept would translate incredibly well to using Astrophage as a power source--just superheating H₂ or whatever reaction mass you have on hand and throwing it out the back will get you to space eventually.

I haven't done the math, but it seems like spindrives would put the Epstein drives from The Expanse to shame--a lot fewer free neutrons flying around, for one thing. Pretty badass concept.

** Yes! I just finished it myself, and I loved the martian too, but my favorite thing about PHM is its basically and galactic buddy cop movie with a bunch of science thrown in.

Serious spoilers below, do not read if you haven't finished

Rocky and Grace's banter while they investigate astrophage, tau ceti, adrian, and taumeoba felt like a super fresh take on the classic buddy cop plot. Ryland is such an endearing character, and Rocky is the most lovable blind musical spider thing ever. I also really love that for a "first contact" story, it didn't both doing all the usual first contact bullshit... they both decided to trust each other from the get go, and it made for a much more enjoyable story. I think there's actually a framework to develop subsequent books off this foundation too. Using astrophage for interstellar travel, Ryland communicating with earth the let them know he survived and lives on an alien planet, Rocky and Ryland searching for life around other stars around the tau cluster, or even just "fixing" the other infected stars with more taumoeba, watching the Eridian society develop as they master electronics and computers. There is so much potential here.

I hope Weir gets another movie deal out of this because I think if done well it could be an incredible story on the big screen; actually, a 6 or 8 part mini series might be better so they don't have to trim stuff out

*** I was thinking the same thing. This could potentially make a better movie than The Martian, I think, since it's really hard to film a solitary character on their own in an interesting way--but two? Way easier. Plus, there's more visually exotic stuff going on with Rocky and his tech to work with.

Not only that, but I love the idea of an interstellar species that just got lucky with an incredible materials technology and consequently never had to work very hard on science in other areas--"Quantum what? Nah, man, we just strapped some Astrophage tanks to the back of our unobtanium party barge, hauled it up the space elevator and flew it to another star. Hey, have you noticed that there's something fucky about the speed of light?"

*** I would love to see more in this universe. I don't think it makes sense for Ryland's story to continue; perhaps a brief cameo at most. He's kinda old for space travel by the end (53) and fragile due to high gravity. His character arc was given a proper end. Exploring Eridian society from a human's point of view would also be problematic since everything is in complete darkness and in a hot crushing atmosphere.😬

I am super curious about the Eridians but also about what exactly happened on Earth. Though I'm also afraid that what happened on Earth was ugly despite humanity surviving and recovering in the end.

*** Funny, the banter was my last favorite part, to put it mildly. When Rocky is suddenly talking just like a typical marvel bro at the end... it made me physically cringe.

I feel the current state of dialogue is similar to the '90s and early 2000s where everybody was copying Tarantino's style, only with marvel/whedon-esque banter instead. Most books or movies nowadays have this tonal disconnect where people are flippantly humorous in the middle of tense and dramatic situations.

"Uh, did you just shoot me in the spleen? I was using that!" Kill me, please.

It feels like our civilization was stealthily taken over by a cabal of hack writers and they've been slowly erasing the very concept of "cliche" and "hack line" from the collective consciousness.

I willingly listened to the audiobook all the way through - I mostly listen to audiobooks when driving long distances when I physically can't read paper. I actually preferred the audiobook performance (and kudos to the audio engineers who worked on it), especially for his monotone superimposed over a musical tone filter that Rocky the Eridian communicates with and the overall cadence and inflection of his delivery, but I had to span it out during downtimes or tedious work at the office so it took me about 2 and a half weeks to finish on 1.5x speed. This has to be the closest voice that Andy Weir had in his own head while writing the novel.

** It is very similar in style to The Martian but because it concerns itself quite a bit with things that are more just fiction than actual science-based fiction it's not as interesting. The Martian was an interesting story where you learned a lot about Mars and what it would take for humans to exist there. This story is like that but with a fraction of the learning about anything real.

*** I see where you're coming from, but I think I disagree. Yes, the premise of PHM is a lot further outside the bounds of known science--it's a lot more speculative--but I think it depends on what you're looking for. Science isn't a collection of facts, nor is it technology. It's a process, and I think PHM does a great job of demonstrating science and rationality as processes even if they aren't being applied to real-world situations.

Also, The Martian stretched things a bit, too--"hab canvas" was basically unobtanium, and the inciting incident--the Martian storm--was not realistic at all. The movie did an even worse job of Martian wind.

In PHM, the only errors I caught (outside the "we don't know how this could work" alien technology) were that

A) the atmospheric comparison between the Hail Mary and the Blip A was...odd. Why would Rocky assess the Hail Mary's atmosphere as primarily O₂ rather than N₂? Were they really pressurizing the Hail Mary with pure O₂? If so, that would make the Blip A's atmosphere only 7-10atm, not 30.

B) 3D printers absolutely work in zero G, assuming they were using an FDM process--which you obviously would, /because they work in zero G./

Yeah I guess it has some not completely bogus representations of the kind of work that scientists do and how to think through problems but so did the Martian and for me personally none of that was new information. I was disappointed that I didn't come away learning more about actual exoplanet and astrobiology research and instead just got a bunch of hand-wavy made up stuff.

The Hail Mary was using a low pressure high oxygen atmosphere. This is normal for space travel. Apparently the challenges of a high oxygen atmosphere are seen as lesser than than the challenges of higher pressure, maybe due to the extra material and thus extra weight required? I can't remember the details but I think it was specified at some point at least exactly what pressure the atmosphere was at.

Well you could maybe defend optimizing for something other than "works in zero G" if you want as much versatility as possible but yeah it seems odd. If it's a metal 3D printer (I can't remember) it's less odd, as they were doing the whole "only using proven off-the-shelf technologies" and I don't think there are any non-powder off-the-shelf metal 3D printers except for WAAM which requires some non-trivial post-processing for fine detail that isn't generally compatible with spaceships.

But Rocky would have sampled the air from the Hail Mary, which only had 1/5th the pressure as Earth since it was basically all oxygen. So wouldn't Erid's atmosphere be more like 29/5 times Earth's?

**** Near the end of the book they said that Hail Mary's atmosphere was only 5psi. Running a pure oxygen atmosphere at 5psi, just like the early Apollo missions did, makes sense. It only becomes dangerous when pressuring it to 20psi on the ground for testing, which is what caused the Apollo 1 fire, but that shouldn't be a problem for a spacecraft that is assembled on orbit.

I did find several other "errors", however, including Grace sending a wax model to a ship he knew was hot, Grace being excited when he thought Rocky's biology didn't use water but showing no disappointment when he found out it did, Stratt assigning Grace the task of putting together a list of replacement science officers but Grace later having to ask Stratt for the list when they meet to choose a replacement, Grace trying to figure out whether 20,000kgs of methane was enough to get home while completely ignoring that he'd need 80,000kgs of oxygen to burn it (which he wouldn't have on his 120,000kg ship), Grace's shoddily repaired chair somehow surviving the second bought of high gravity (and Grace positioning himself in the worst possible way, head down, instead of lying on the ceiling), etc.

Thank you for your response. As I said, I do wish to avoid getting into a thorny discussion here. To answer, though, I'd say: like a woman whose behavior makes a lot more sense if she's regularly getting high doses of exogenous testosterone. Describing what that particularly /means/ is probably beyond the purview of this place, but I expect you can fill in the blanks.

And no, I had no issues with /The Martian/. I expect women who become astronauts to be brilliant, fearsomely competent, and have the hearts of lions, not to mention already having been selected for unusually-high risk tolerance.

Highly, highly, highly recommend Neal Stephenson's /The Diamond Age/. One of the premises of the world is that the blank slate hypothesis is fundamentally true, which frees up the author to isolate and explore all kinds of cool stuff regarding culture and education. There are two major female characters, one of whom is a brilliant, ambitious, /psychologically normal/ woman that I like a lot, while the other is... well, psychologically exceptional, but for good reason, and the world and other characters /notice/ this about her, which makes it all work for me.

Probably my favorite book of all time.

If you do try it out, I'll issue a standard warning: It's one of those written from multiple character POVs, one per chapter, and relatively early on in the book one of the POV characters dies and is replaced by another. I've seen this throw off any number of people trying to get into the book, since it's sci-fi and losing a solid foothold like that can be challenging for the reader. OTOH, everyone I've warned has gotten through it just fine and loved the book. So, hopefully forewarned is forearmed! And do let me know how you like it.

Despite accepting for the sake of the argument what is perhaps the core of leftism -- that is, blank-slatism -- it is decidedly non-woke, and its politics are (mostly) solidly fictional enough to not be obnoxious.

Surely the astrophage only takes over a star if there is a nearby planet with a CO2 atmosphere, otherwise they cannot breed. Does this imply that *all* nearby stars have such a planet? Seems quite unlikely.

I hate bashing a novel because the author put a lot of time and effort into it and it's much more than I could ever do but this one just left me cold.
