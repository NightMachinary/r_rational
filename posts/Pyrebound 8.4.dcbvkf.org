Sorry this is late this week! I posted this announcement Sunday night, but some bizarre bug ate it. This is one of the longer installments to date. Thanks to all of you who've followed Ram thus far.

Pyrebound is a high fantasy serial about power and survival in a very grim world. The first installment is [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]].

** I'm at work so I can't give as much thought to puzzling out the ending as I should. Anyone from the Reddit hive mind want to help out? At first glance, it sounds like maybe the Ensi made another Ram and sent it off? I'm not sure how that impacts Ram though. Like I said, I don't have the bandwidth to puzzle this out on my own for a few days :(

**** /shrug/ The implication with how it is written is that the reader should be able to figure it out. If that's not the case I would maybe rewrite the ending slightly.

***** My experience thus far is that I'm really very bad at predicting what my readers will or will not deduce from clues. I've tried to drop clues as a general rule, and it seems to me that a sufficiently determined close-reader would be able to at least guess what's happened here, but I don't necessarily expect someone to go back and skim the text and get a one-week jump on the author.

***** There is, to my knowledge, no PB fanfic yet, only an aborted Wiki. If there must be erotic PB fanfic, I insist it honor the spirit of the original by overthinking every detail. For example, if Ram did something unnatural with a murrush, he would absorb a fair amount of heat in the process, which would increase his aggressive impulses accordingly and thus possibly drive him to greater exertion. With the current state of lore it is difficult to say how much heat he could absorb without sustaining burns, assuming there is such a limit, but ...

[several paragraphs of speculation excised]

... so the only solution would be for Ram himself to stand in a large body of water (for a heatsink) while the murrush remained outside on the bank. Which brings us to tinap voyeurism--but that is a matter for the sequel.

** ... yeah, not gonna lie, that scene felt extremely rapey and inappropriate to me. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't fly /at all/ with the genders reversed.

Actually, it reminds me of a certain scene from WtC, except the equivalent character in WtC gets (rightfully) treated as a piece of shit for doing what Darun does here.

*** Not sure how to reply to this, TBH. It would have a very different vibe with the genders reversed because, if push came to shove, Ram could pick Darun up and throw her bodily out of the room (as she more or less notes herself). The other way around, there would be a constant threat of coercion or physical violence hanging over them, and it would be a very different kind of scene. I think a double standard makes sense here.

I would say Darun's approach is not respectful, nor likely to lead to a healthy relationship in the long haul. It's not moral--but then, very little she does is moral. A large part of what goes on in this story is morally far from optimal. By inappropriate, do you mean it shouldn't have been included? Because the story also has much worse things shown in detail, like child soldiers, muggings, death threats as jokes, human trafficking, involuntary human experimentation, and organized crime. What's the difference here?

*** Eh, I'm not certain that that is a valid comparison. (WtC spoilers from here on out)

In WtC, there was a significant amount of narrative time spent showing the equivalent character as incredibly powerful and also with a blue/orange moral code. Joon himself also had a number of outstanding, serious hangups regarding sexuality and interpersonal relationships in general. There is a huge power differential there, plus the house could not understand Joon's objections.

Conversely, there is no equivalent power differential between Ram and Darun. Ram has expressed (internal) interest in Darun, and his objections to actually sleeping with her were broadly a combination of "my mom warned me that would be a bad idea", "I'm very cautious in general and Darun in general is not, so this is probably a bad idea", and "Darun made it clear she was not interested". Reading through it, I don't think that I saw any indication that Ram didn't want anything to happen or anything that reads as rape.

A comment from the author indicates it's supposed to be more seduction-focused, and from that sense it's... not great, I'll agree there. I would not have thought seduction reading it. She's very much just throwing herself at Ram rather than seducing him, but given the comment I would chalk that up to authorial inexperience rather than anything else. I wouldn't have even noticed if it weren't for the comment; Darun has always been written as pretty straightforward with her sexuality so throwing herself at Ram could absolutely be in character now that he is a ticket to the kind of wealth she wants. Which is an entirely separate issue, but I digress.

**** For reference, my wife is the first woman I ever seriously dated, is temperamentally extremely far from Darun, and is not at all seductive; I have no experience with the hookup scene (assuming The Kids are still calling it that these days) and don't know anything about how it works firsthand. I didn't really distinguish between "seduction" and "throwing yourself," though now that I think about it seduction would be more subtle, yes.

***** I believe the preferred nomenclature is "whippersnappers". And just to be clear, I don't have a problem with Darun as written. The seduction was heavy-handed but not necessarily out of character, and you'll get better at writing it as you practice more. I'm very much enjoying the story so far and all criticism is for the purpose of discussion and growth rather than any of actual complaint.

*** I mean i'd call it questionable rather than rapey. There is a lack consequence hanging over his head if he refuses, I think he just doesn't trust in her intentions or her character - but is still attracted to her.
