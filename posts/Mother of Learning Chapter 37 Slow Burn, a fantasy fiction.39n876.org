  Greeting loyal readers! I have published a new chapter, and well within my self-imposed three week limit too! I will aim for the next chapter within three weeks as well, with an eye for improving it further.

  Read at your leisure and tell me what you think.

** Typo thread for [[/u/nobody103]] . I love MoL and I offer these typos in the spirit of improving it! :->

"Not in a way I had expected or *planed* for" - should be "planned".

"Domination and suggestion *represents* spells" - when you say "X and Y", that's plural, so it should be "represent". For example, Murray and Cantwell represent Washington in the Senate.

"spells that *enforce caster's* will upon the target" - missing "the".

"Suggestion and *Illusion* are subtle methods." - the other mentions of techniques aren't capitalized in the middle of sentences.

"these things were all *unquestioningly* useful" - instead of an adverb, you want "unquestionably" here, which is an adjective.

"the Yellow Cavern *guardians* lost both their matriarch" - should be capitalized.

"causing *to whole* the whole thing to blow up" - extra words.

*** [[/u/nobody103]] please notice me sempai

Is there some easier way for readers to submit/edit typos for chapters? Like [[http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Mother_of_Learning][Mother of Learning's page on Baka-Tsuki]], where users can make simple spelling/grammar corrections.

Fictionpress doesn't allow copy+paste afaik, and Baka-Tsuki doesn't update fast enough and might not have enough visitors to make it worthwhile.

Also, any update on expansion to sites with more readership/traffic (Wattpad)?

Thanks for the new chapter!

Sadly no. Fictionpress and Baka-Tsuki are the only places the story is posted at for the moment. I do have plans to check out Wattpad one of these days, but somehow I always find something more pressing to do.

Fooling fictionpress's stupid copy block is a simple matter of going View>Page Style>No Style, at which point you can copy whatever you want. If you don't want to install one of many workaround browser extensions, that is.

If you don't want to clutter the threads on this subreddit with corrections, you can always send me a PM to this reddit account.

  What I'm trying to say that
#+end_quote

*is

#+begin_quote
  [Domination and puppeteering are forceful methods,] he said

  [An interesting breakdown,] she said.
#+end_quote

Just a suggestion, but I would put the commas outside the brackets. In the first case I would also replace the comma with a full stop.

**** The school is the only place they would normally intersect unless Zorian purposefully goes looking, and he's too paranoid for that. Neither of them has seen each other for a long time, so the eventual meeting has been building for some time.

I'm just betting this'll happen so I'll be able to say 'I totally called it!' if they do.

Anyone have stories that are similar to this in style or feel? Sort of a fun power build up but couched within rational means?

Can I say that that second sentence somehow screams great writing to me. Being able to give a small bit of trivia and then getting back to the meat, all the while making it sound as natural and normal as we do in everyday conversations is just awesome. I think the part where +D+*Z*orian goes through things just like I could imagine myself with all the highs and lows of life that that involves is what I love most about your story.

That and the rational D&D style magic world of course.
