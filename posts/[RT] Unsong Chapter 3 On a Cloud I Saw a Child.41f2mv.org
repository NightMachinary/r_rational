** So, um. This is still pretty great.

It's confirming implicitly that this is a simulated / code-based universe, which given everything else that's going on I find unsurprising.

A callback to a previous chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Gebron and Eleazar's classic textbook says that only four kabbalists have ever gazed upon Adam Kadmon bare. Rabbi Isaac Luria. /The archangel Uriel./ The Comet King. /And an eight year old girl./
#+end_quote

(italics mine)

The events of this chapter happen in 1990, about 27 years before the events of the previous chapters. 27 is 3^{3,} and there are three characters of consequence in the chapter (the girl, her father, and the archangel). Also, the archangel repeats the figure "4.9 seconds" three times.

Edit: The number of days separating the date of this chapter from the date in chapter 1/2 is 9,720 - which is the mystically significant 40 multiplied by 3 repeatedly (3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 40). 40 is often a biblical amount of time, as in the 40 days and nights of rain or 40 years wandering in the desert. So we've seen 3 * 3 * 3 and 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3, so after those sequences of obvious 3's the missing sequence 3 * 3 * 3 * 3=81 must be somewhere hidden in the chapter. And, of course, it's hidden in several places - in the Archangel's thoughts of killing Sohu, he thinks about how 29.4 kJ of energy would smash her skull, which is about 8.1 watt-hours, for example. The rest are left as an exercise to the reader.

*** Given your edit, I'd say that 27 years is a coincidence. It is simply 3^{5} * 40 days / 3^{2} *40 days/year.

Also, it is chapter 3.

**** Anyone who dismisses this as coincidence will soon find the coincidences adding up to an implausible level. The kabbalistic perspective is that nothing is a coincidence.

** Well-written but I guess I was anticipating a different sort of fic.

I didn't anticipate a semi-humorous kabalistic sci-fi/fantasy work. Personally not a fan of stories that focus too much on humor, but I'll keep reading because I live reading about Jewish mysticism.

*** I am constantly boggled by people who have read my previous stories still being surprised that I like humor in fiction.

But I am trying to make the book able to stand on its own aside from the humor (sort of like HPMoR or Discworld, which both included humor but weren't /about/ humor), so I hope you'll stick around anyway.

yeah I used to have that problem but I think HPMOR probably solved it permanently

**** I've read some of your other work (most of the stuff on SSC but not much of the stuff on LiveJournal) and I knew you liked humor but the first chapter felt pretty serious so I thought the fic was going in that direction.

But yeah, I'll definitely stick around.

*** I myself find am almost the opposite - I love humor, and wish there was more really good science fiction / fantasy humor. There's tons of well-done serious books out there, to be honest; the number of really well done funny ones is much lesser.

**** I like funny non-fiction more than funny fiction. Bill Bryson's books are very funny.

I think its quite difficult to do generally accessible but intelligent humor. I like Discworld, but the humor often falls flat and IMO really damages the emotional drama of the work. I never feel emotionally invested in Discworld; I find it funny but not serious, though I enjoy the creative worldbuilding.

** Absolutely dying with laughter throughout this. Loving the contrast of serious angel business vs the dialogue.

If the worst that can be said is that it's reminiscent/derivative of Pratchett... that seems like high praise.
