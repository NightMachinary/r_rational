** Just for funsies, because of that bit about atoms. Each size category is a factor of 2 along each dimension and confers a + or - 4 on Hide checks. Iron atoms have a diameter of 252 picometers. Dividing the average human height by the diameter and taking the log base 2 reveals that iron atoms are about 33 size categories smaller than humans. If someone manages to temporarily get about +132 to Spot checks, they'll be able to see atoms. I don't know if you can come up with a plausible excuse for this to happen, but it would be hilarious. I'm sure one of those threads on optimizing for epic skill checks would help. Fortunately, at such high levels they can get almost halfway there just on skill ranks alone. Also, freaking out about being made of cells. "I can see my own eyeballs! And they're made of little things! Oh Gods, they're moving!"

*** Given that most people seem to have at least 60 levels now, anyone who has specialized in Spot should have +60 to it at a bare minimum (ranks only, no special feats, items, or weird stuff). While that's not enough to see atoms, the smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers across, which is 800 times larger than an iron atom - or about 10 size categories. So to see a single cell, you only need to have a spot check of +92 - which is fairly easily achievable for any of the newly hyperleveled characters.

Incidentally, such high Spot checks allow you to see invisible creatures without really trying:

#+begin_quote
  A creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20 Spot check. The observer gains a hunch that “something's there” but can't see it or target it accurately with an attack. A creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an unliving creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature is even harder to spot (DC 40). It's practically impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature's location with a Spot check, and even if a character succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature still benefits from total concealment (50% miss chance).
#+end_quote

But if we were /really/ following the D&D Spot rules, you wouldn't be able to see much beyond a few hundred yards (or something like that), which makes almost no sense.

Edit: +15 to Wisdom from 60 levels and +5 to Wisdom from the POPE gives you +70 without much optimization. That's enough to see things on the micrometer scale when you take 10. Of course, it's sort of questionable whether things in Stupidworld are even made up of cells or atoms in the first place, but I guess given the matter-antimatter reaction they must be. If you take 20 you can see cells, and that's without a microscope.

#+end_quote

I am pretty sure they do. The rules in the [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/wilderness.htm][Wilderness section of the SRD]] give the guidelines. Also, from the entry on Spot:

#+begin_quote
  Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).
#+end_quote

This is backed up by the fact that the SRD gives a Spot DC for seeing a forest fire, which by definition can't be hiding. [[/u/eaglejarl]] has said that this is too stupid to really be worth including. The reason for these rules is pretty obvious - short encounter distances are more dynamic and all for melee/ranged to both get more out of the encounter. I've never met a DM who actually uses the guidelines though; it's always been straight fiat.

****** Nothing in the wilderness section overrides the information on spot checks, they merely give the maximum distances you can make spot checks. They don't give the maximum distance you can see people with a clear line of sight. Also your cite from the spot check rules doesn't say that this applies to people who aren't hiding or concealed- the start of the spot check doesn't go away because they don't repeat it.

#+begin_quote
  This is backed up by the fact that the SRD gives a Spot DC for seeing a forest fire, which by definition can't be hiding.
#+end_quote

A forest fire can be concealed by trees and thereby be difficult to see. Poor visibility is covered under spot checks.

#+begin_quote
  The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.

  I've never met a DM who actually uses the guidelines though; it's always been straight fiat.
#+end_quote

None of the guidelines actually oblige even a rules stickler DM to use spot checks for situations other than the ones they explicitly cover.

Heh. Actually, I think this is the first time that's happened. Usually when I ask innocuous seeming questions it's because I've got something up my sleeve and I don't want to spoil it but I can't resist hinting a little bit.

[giving 2 wishes vs 1]

In both cases, it's because the extra Wish didn't matter and there's a question of perception. If the person you're doing the deal with is getting more out of it than you are, there's a small sense of irritation. If you're getting more out of it, you feel all magnanimous and DEFINITELY don't want to screw around.

And the second Wish really didn't matter -- in the first case, one Ring was enough to get infinite Wishes. In the second, Wishes were easily available and XP was the limiting factor, which the Earring solved.

It was more "you can't do that en masse". Converting individual worshippers of a god is an acceptable and time-honored tactic in divine warfare. Stealing entire swaths of them in one go is not cricket, however. Anything that violates the divine equivalent of the Geneva Conventions gets all the gods uniting to spank you with an axe.

As to the Sunburst -- it would be useful, yes, but it's approximately the same thing that Fragment already kiboshed. They might try asking about it separately, though.

Grey Goo...might be useful, although the only thing I can think of that you'd use it for would be utterly destroying an area of ground and everything on it, and there's already plenty of ways to do that. It's pretty much the same problem as the AM explosions -- chewing up lots of landscape tends to piss off the mountain / earth / river / etc gods.

*** Ignoring the volume constraints, the problem is just a simple polynomial. If then cannot spread the things out fast enough, this just remains an upper bound.

Assuming that it starts at round 0 with 1 GGG and nothing else, that each round the total number of GGs is the sum of the previous number of GGs and GGGs and likewise for Gs and FBRs, you get:

0: (1, 0, 0, 0)\\
1: (1, 1, 1, 1)\\
2: (1, 2, 3, 4)\\
3: (1, 3, 6, 10)\\
4: (1, 4, 10, 20)\\
5: (1, 5, 15, 35)\\
...

This generalises to (1, n, n(n+1)/2, n(n+1)(n+2)/6), or (1, nC1, (n+1)C2, (n+2)C3).

If you started with a G^{r,} rather than a G^{3,} it would be (G^{r,} ..., G, FBR)=(1, nC1, ..., (n+r-2)C(r-1), (n+r-1)Cr)

So, after 1 minute you would have 220, 5 minutes would give you 22100, half an hour would give you 4545100, and an hour would give you 36180200, enough for all of Grofhamr and Flobovia's population. If you're willing to wait a day, every person in Grofhamr and Flobovia can make 13500 Ice Assassins and give them all a Fortifying Bedroll, with a few left over for all the trees and animals in Flobovia.

*** I think triangular numbers may be relevant here. I don't know much about Wolfram Alpha, but here it is in Python, in the most simple, easy to understand way I could write it:

#+begin_example
  ggg = 1
  gg = 0
  g = 0
  fbr = 0
  maxturns = 100
  graph = []
  for turn in range(maxturns):
      for i3 in range(ggg):
          gg += 1
      for i2 in range(gg):
          g += 1
      for i1 in range(g):
          fbr += 1
      graph.append(fbr)
#+end_example

Obviously, this only runs for 100 turns (ending in 171700 FBRs on the final turn). If I were making a larger graph I would probably use something more efficient, like this:

#+begin_example
  ggg = 1
  gg = 0
  g = 0
  fbr = 0
  maxturns = 10000
  graph = []
  for turn in range(maxturns):
      gg += ggg
      g += gg
      fbr += g
      graph.append(fbr)
#+end_example

After 10000 rounds, 166716670000 FBRs have been produced; in the 10000th round alone, 50005000 FBRs have been produced (naturally, the number of G's is the same as this.. The number of GG's is 10000; the reason for this should also be obvious.)

Very quick graph of FBR production, turns is X axis:

Simply take the integral and you get 1/6x^{3} + 1/4x^{2,} where x is the number of FBRs. (Of course, this assumes infinite space, which constrains the actual numbers of a bit. Stupid reality screwing up math.)

I believe my algorithm works as stated assuming that the FBRs are continuously distributed away from the production area, and creation either has enough space and works, or doesn't and fails. At some point production overtakes distribution, at which point the number of FBRs/GGGs/GGs/Gs stays constant. You can simply clip the graph at that point.

For added fun, let's assume Jake "forgot" to put in the volume restriction.

After 10 minutes it's already reached 5 million bedrolls. An hour and it's shot up to 5 billion. Let it run for the day and it's up to 1.8 /quadrillion/. A week and it's up to 5 *quintillion*. Depending on the size of the planet, that's enough to cover every square foot with well over a thousand bedrolls. Woops.

So if each gnome arm can cast Wish, wishing for a G^{r} will give you 2^{r} FBRs within a round, as each gnome wish will create two more wishes, which again create two more each etc.

** My idea for an equip-engine, the G.O. (gear and out) system:

Create a magic statue with outstretched arms, if it does not hold a handy haversack in its hands it creates a handy haversack in its hands and triggers any attuned spell engines behind it to create whatever other magic items you want inside the handy haversack. Stack the POPEs in the same square next to the statue.

Just needs a single level of meta to create each individual engine, made on demand instead of automatically. Alternatively add another layer of meta by having spell engines put into the haversack to create a given item when it does not exist in the same extradimensional space as them, allowing you to pull out and use X every round.

The round after they use the flea, the new archmage picks up their equipment, gets +5 to all stats, then moves off. This frees up the peasants used in a railgun and avoids having to deal with giant piles of replicating equipment. Added benefit of being modular for future uses, just make a new spell engine and attune it to have whatever you want deposited in new handy haversacks.

*** Haversack gnomes gave me another idea. Spell turrets from DMG2 (pg45) are diminutive traps that can trigger by type and cast 4 different spells, one spell a round, and repairs itself after rotating through its spells. Diminutive is only 6 inches, so make a 6''x6''x1'' wall that you carry around in your haversack with a spell turret on you.

Make a "trapper keeper gnome" that creates one of them every round there is not already one within 5ft of it for deployable spell turret mines. Key one to undead, pick the four meanest spells you can think of, and have the landguard drop one every round they spend in the maze. Not only will it mark where they have been, it will make short work of any undead that comes across them.

Alternatively, key it to humanoid, pick four amazing buffs and line grofhamr with the things.

Thanks to their diminutive size you can actually fit 25 of them in a single square. Cover the entrance hole's walls with them for a crazy number of spells per round being shot at any invaders.

**** [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time]]

Ostensibly, a very popular kids/stoners cartoon. /Also/, a sometimes dark and adult story about a violent, post-apocalyptic world, with lots of fantasy and sci-fi trappings built into the absurdist presentation. It /quite often/ meets rational fiction story requirements, with serious consequences and logical plot outcomes.

The characters are kids, but they still use the world as well as they can. Rules exist for a reason, if it is a fantasy trope, and are consistent. Things that happened earlier that no one noticed often come back as highly significant in later plot lines, often for perfectly logical reasons. It does world-building and plot advancement in almost every episode, even if that isn't always apparent. Virtually no take-backsie one-shots that don't change anything.

Usually rather funny, but also really sad sometimes with some serious moments. Like the ongoing storyline with a character who continually loses their memories, having lived centuries with a cursed magical artifact that they had originally used to survive the apocalypse. Their also-immortal friend has to deal with the situation of knowing someone who only sort-of remembers them and their long history together. It is maturely handled and emotionally moving. Some other downright futurist concepts get snuck in there sometimes, as well.

The creators are genuinely intelligent in their writing, and it is never dumbed down for its supposed younger audience. Instead, the metaphor and heavy significances are simply silently left in for the more adult topics and never explained. It isn't done like a Pixar movie, with the wink and a nudge for the parents. But instead, it is simply told mostly from a younger perspective, and the dialog reflects that. The world is still fully formed and deep, though, and that comes through all the time. Especially in the wreckage of civilization and the world itself, which is literally shattered.

Also, a stretchy dog creature farts. So. Yeah.

Won't make any sense at all unless one invests serious time reading up wikis and such, or watching a hundred or so episodes in some sort of order.

Which is one reason a lot of people dismiss it as merely banana-monkey-dishwasher wackiness when they drop in half-way through a single episode in, say, the last few episodes in the third season.

These people are shallow and dismissive of something genuinely good on TV. I like to laugh in their faces when those same people complain that English language TV doesn't have anything as deep and artistically significant as Japanese anime. Which I also like to watch quality examples of, of course, because /I'm/ not a shallow, dismissive idiot myself. At least, not about that.

In conclusion, if you have the means, I highly recommend picking it up.

That was from /Ferris Bueller's Day Off/ (1986), BTW.

Oh yeah. The dog is named "Jake". Huh.

** I have to wonder how the various stat blessings will affect people (especially Jake as the viewpoint character).

I mean, if I get that right, the POPE will grant +5 to the various stats, respectively, right? And given the exponentially growing blessing capability soon enough everyone will have arbitrarily high stats, with the only distinguishing difference being what the characters started with and selected for when they gained character levels. My assumption is, soon enough either everyone will have a POPE and can increase all their stats +5 every... day or so.

Since all stats are similarly increased, there shouldn't even be a period of acclimatization to the increased stats be necessary. Sure, everyone is suddenly stronger, but their *wisdom* and thus perceptional and intuitive faculties ought to be increased as well, so no accidental dislocating door handles and other mishaps, right?

But what are the limitations? Will soon enough everyone be strong enough to

- jump hundreds of meters high (based on *strength*),
- put eyes out with paper air planes consistently (hand-eye coordination based on *dexterity*),
- have astronomical hit points (are there even hit points?),
- disable everything (based on *intelligence*),
- be living lie detectors (Sense Motive, Listen, Spot all based on *wisdom*),
- and be insanely appealing to everyone not /blessed/?

Also, if I got your chapter right, Jake now has +25 INT to whatever his natural score was due to each "I wish to be smarter" granting him +5 INT; the parenthesis pandemonium that followed was due to (a) the sudden increase and (b) Jake not having the appropriate increase in WIS that would have the willpower and intuition to deal with this.

(I never played D&D, but due to popcultural osmosis am aware of enough tidbits to reason a lot of stuff out, yet do not know the rules and, more relevant, tripfalls of the system.)

** I'm wondering if it would have been better to create a Duplicate Item Gnome Gnome.

/I am imagining a magic item that I shall call a Duplicate Item Gnome. It is a one foot tall magically invulnerable statue of a gnome. It starts with one googolplex experience points. It can be primed with a magic item. Waving a magic item within three inches in front of the face of the statue primes it with that magic item. Every round, if the statue is upright and is primed with a magic item and has sufficient experience points, it produces a copy of that magic item./

Then a Duplicate Item Gnome Gnome is a magic item, similarly capable of being primed with a magic item; the DIGs that the DIGG produces inherit the DIGG's primed magical item.

This is a bit more complex, but you only have one family of item makers to deal with. It's easy to switch out the type of magic item you're creating.

I think the largest problem with this tactic is narration. It's easy to narrate the current set of items: something that spews out fortifying bedrolls, then something that spews out that. It's another layer of abstraction to get to something that spews out copies of a given item, and it isn't as easy to draw a path for the reader from something concrete to this abstraction. It's also a bit harder to follow the additional abstraction from a DIG to a DIGG [to a DIGGG].

[[http://dndtools.eu/spells/races-of-destiny--81/delay-death--3048/][Delay Death]] would be amazing if it exists as well.

EDIT:...if you can make a level 10 million spell engine. Stretching a 1 round/level spell to lasting two years might be pushing it. If arbitrarily high spell levels are allowed, there's all sorts of exploits that are possible.

Would a [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/healMass.htm][Mass Heal]] engine be allowed? Running into battle with one would be very effective, damaging all undead enemies within 30 feet 250 damage per round per engine, and healing all allies the same amount.

For new tactics, they can now carry out instantaneous attacks with their high level casters. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/timeStop.htm][Time Stop]], then [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/teleportGreater.htm][Greater Teleport]], drop Doge Balls (or some other free action), then teleport back out again. It is literally impossible to retaliate against the attacker if they do this, and each Wizard 20/Sorcerer 20 can do this 10x per day (or more if they have >= 28 Int/Cha).

**** I was under the impression that the Gods put strict limits on Ice Assassin use, but I may need to reread it.

The advantage of high level Golems (or a [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/monsters/colossus.htm][Colossus]] if you want one) is that they are completely invulnerable to lesser undead, and very resistant to casters. As long as nothing can get through it's DR 20, spell immunity, and construct traits, it can fight off an entire legion of ghouls, zombies, skeletons, and vampires, and ignore the ghosts and shades. Golems are ideal for front-line fighting against an undead horde.

**** True. This just means that without a way for Jake to improve himself beyond that +5 he's going to be left way behind in the ability department. Also, due to munchkining (who doesn't do that?) most characters would dump those ability points into one to three abilities.

I also hope that Jake's reaction to Intelligence enhancement isn't usual or Intelligence enhancement after the turret and FLEA would make many people kill themselves.

***** No worries on that score -- StupidWorlders won't freak out like that. There's nothing in RAW about ability enhancement being difficult, so it isn't. I felt that Jake, coming from outside the system and without its protections, would probably have some reactions to his brain being modified, that's all.

Besides, it added good drama and made it clear that he had actually been enhanced.

As to being left behind in ability scores -- Jake has never really been within shouting distance of any of the main character-leveled folks. Isaac/Reynard/Matthew/Unn have always been smarter. Drifa and Albrecht have always been wiser. The Landguard are /ridiculously/ stronger and faster. All he's got is outside perspective, deep knowledge of the RAW, and the memory of a lot of internet discussion about exploits.

******* Well, first of all, Mindscrape isn't really a polite thing to do to a friend.

Possibly more importantly, it's an Evil spell that is banned in Flobovia. So, Mindscraping Jake is literally against the Writ (the law), which means the Landguard will kill you if you try.

Finally, my interpretation of Mindscrape is that it gives you all of the subjects knowledge and memories as something like the Brainopedia; all of the information is there, you have a good sense of what's in it and you can easily find anything you're looking for...but you have to look for it. It's not the same as your own knowledge where the information is fully comprehended and connected with everything else so things float to the surface / suggest themselves to you on their own.

********* Much like real world nations, Flobovia has two levels of legal structure: the law and the Writ. Think "legislation" and "Constitution."

Mostly, Jake can muck with the law all he wants but cannot change the Writ without some lengthy and difficult hoop-jumping.

In practice, there are limits on what he can do with the law as well. Lady Justice is, as has been shown, rather proprietary about the legal system, and the Conclave also has some strong feelings about things. Changes that they disapprove of tend to be lost in the paperwork shuffle, or poorly enforced. Although, yes, that doesn't affect things happening in his immediate presence.
