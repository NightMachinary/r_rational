** As a professional translator this suggestion is making me weep blood. If you aren't familiar with fanfic etiquette, it goes like this:

1. You contact the author. 2. Tell them that you really would like to read an English translation of their work. 3. Offer to do it yourself, if you have the competence. 4. Or maybe one of the author's fans translates it.

The entitlement and sheer lack of disrespect for a profession and skill set is unreal here. Yikes.

*** And that's why I'm asking here! To get y'alls knowledge. The first thing is definitely something to do. I wonder at your suggestion that this is entitlement when I went out of my way to ask for people who know what to do in this situation. I'm not exactly disrespecting anyone's skillset here---I'm a writer myself, so although any translation I made would be incredibly destructive to any cultural references and whatnot, it wouldn't be abysmal to read, which is sadly the case for machine translations.

  the best translation for the title is probably The Word of the Dragon, despite Google saying it's 'A word about the dragon'
#+end_quote

If Google didn't translate the title well, how often do you think it's going to mistranslate the original in ways that you don't notice, because you can't speak Russian?

A better idea would be to find somebody who speaks Russian and is a fan of rational fiction, have them translate into English and then you polish it.

But first you need to contact the author and ask permission to produce a translation.

***** Also, if you can't find a good translator who is willing to translate the whole thing for free, your plan could be to translate the first few chapters, post them here, and then crowdfund the rest of the translation.

Of course you'd need to /get the author's permission/ and then agree how to split the money between the translator and the author.

****** > What I want to know is if this is feasible (meaning, has anyone successfully done it before),

Have people produced bad translations of novels before? Yes. If you buy pretty much any paperback edition of Journey To The Centre of The Earth, it's probably using an early translation with the scientific references garbled, and the part where they solve a letter substitution cipher rendered meaningless.

> where I might put it online so others can read it,

There are lots of places you can do this temporarily but:

> and finally if it's legal.

It's copyright infringement, like I said. Maybe the original author won't care, but it's kind of rude to produce a low-quality translation without even asking.

******** Fan fiction is a very different thing from an unauthorised translation. Fan fiction is arguably transformative in the legal sense, translating a work into a different language definitely is not. It's not legal to publish Harry Potter in French without permission from JK Rowling. And just because you put a work online for free, doesn't mean you give up the copyright and the associated moral rights.

You should really, /really/ read a basic primer on copyright law before you try to go any further with this.

  Aight mate, when the author puts a work of theirs online for free, that's usually indicative of a certain sort of spirit, you see? One that generally approves of a work being spread around and modified---though I have more experience with software, myself.
#+end_quote

I mean even in software, it's possible to put your code online but not to allow it to be "spread around and modified" without permission. It depends on the particular license, doesn't it? In the case of this particular story, he's put "© Copyright Shumil Pavel", and he hasn't licensed it using Creative Commons or similar, so your assumption that he'd be fine with your botched translation is probably false.

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, copyright law is really different in Russia. Do you know anything about the law there at all?
#+end_quote

Russia is a Berne Convention signatory so the law there is not that different any more.

#+begin_quote
  Not that this point is actually applicable, since if the author grants permission, that kind of renders the entire thing moot.
#+end_quote

Yeah, ask the author's permission. Be sure to tell him that because he put the story online, you feel entitled to run it through Google Translate and hack it around and then publish it, so you regard his permission as a mere formality and you'll do it anyway if he doesn't reply. I'm sure he'll see that you're a smart guy who knows what he's doing.

Adding a copyright notice indicates his intent to control his copyright. He would have copyright in the work even without the notice, so choosing to add one is good evidence that he doesn't want the work to be in the public domain.

Ok let me I can fly (what am I doing now?), but I have to fly at speed no less than four hundred kilometers per hour. I have landing speed should be three hundred kilometers, like a jet fighter, and I I can hang in place like a helicopter. And how do I know about jet fighter jets? There are none in this world. And for a long time will not be. Again distracted. It should be in order. Information is the third. Biology Secondly. And physics is in the first place. Over there, right on course, physical the phenomenon is outlined. Transition of electrostatics to electrodynamics. With the rain and roar. Fucks me with lightning now, and fly by all the laws physics. Vertically down. Freshly fried and appetizing, with crisp. From a height of a thousand feet. Or three hundred meters. Or three hundred thirty yards. Can elephants fly? Show me the flying elephant and I I'll eat my tail. On the other hand, when I take off, there are branches on the trees breaks off by the wind. A cubic meter of air weighs less than one and a half kilograms. The area of ​​my wing is not more than fifteen to eighteen meters. On two wings - thirty meters. And five tons. Almost two hundred kilograms per meter. On a thin membrane. And a maximum of four strokes per second. No by I cannot fly the normal laws of physics.

A dragon ruminating on why its existence violates the laws of science is extremely [[/r/rational]]. I really think you could crowdsource a translation for this.

Why don't you just use DeepL to translate and read the story, and forget the part about translating it and publishing it? That would be the best for everyone.
