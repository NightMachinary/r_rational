** Holy shit guys. [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/][The Gods Are Bastards]] is /so/ good. It's got the banter and mood of Practical Guide to Evil with the wide cast and worldbuilding (and length) of Worm.

It's a DnD-esque fantasy setting on the tail end of a magical industrial revolution, where the age of marauding adventurers and heroes is limping its way to a close. The Pantheon are a group of known and (mostly) approachable deities who interact with the world through their respective cults, and are themselves mortals who ascended eight thousand years ago following mysterious circumstances. The story follows a group of young magical oddities, prodigies, and scions who attend an adventuring university ran by infamous 3,000-year-old adventurer/archmage/menace/magnificent bastard Arachne Tellwyrn, who has graciously decided to pass down her historic ass-kicking skills to future generations.

It's got intrigue, plots, manipulation and counter-manipulation, thrilling action, appealing character arcs, twists galore, and excellent banter (and it's also got one of my favorite tropes, which unfortunately is a spoiler just to mention, but still). I much appreciate the author's willingness to timeskip the boring parts and focus on what matters, with liberal sprinkling of interludes to cover side events and backstories.

I can't recommend it enough. If you enjoyed Practical Guide you'll like this.

*** HIGHLY second this. The Erogamer blows my mind every time a new update comes out (Sexual innuendo only /somewhat/ intended). It also has some fantastic moral questions, and is extremely inclusive, sexuality-wise. If you liked Masego being a good Ace character portrayal in APGTE you'll likely enjoy the most recent arc of The Erogamer, where an Ace character (and the protagonist) have to resolve the question of "if reality is being remade like an eroge, where do non-sexual people fit in? Or if they don't... what happens to them?"

Following up on that suggestion... if you've enjoyed The Erogamer but also enjoy videogames, I would recommend [[http://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/][The Last Sovereign]]. It's less meta than The Erogamer, but, uh, keeps the same kind of genre. It's a free RPGMaker game that's being constantly updated, and while the setting is inherently sexual (you're in a world where the Incubus King is threatening to turn all the nations into sexual slave states), the decisions are extremely rational in execution and the MC is much the same, using his sexual power to advance his agenda. Perhaps it's more... rational-adjacent? Either way, it's a fantastic game, and the choices you make early on may come to haunt you later. The sex scenes (and there are MANY) are all text-based... or 8-bit graphics... so don't worry too much about skipping them. Sex is a tool in this game - totally not the goal.

You'll need to download both the game and RPGMaker to play it, but both are in the link. Can't beat the price (FREE!) either!

*** I have to recommend against it. As porn it's not very good with how slow-paced it is. As a story that tries to take itself seriously, the main character is not likable at all IMO. She has a very twisted attitude towards consent and morality. She thinks losing her virginity in consensual sex would be unsatisfying since it wouldn't make her feel desired enough, so instead she manipulates a good man into thinking that her powers are due to her being an alien and that he has to rape her in order to save humanity.

**** No, it's not good as porn, but I don't think it's meant to be, any more than Game of Thrones is meant to function as porn just because it occasionally includes people having sex. Obviously the theme of Erogamer is much more pornographic, but the point still stands, I think.

As for the spoilered text, In my view, the author tried to take a very delicate and rare theme and play with it from both sides. On one side you had someone with a (clearly and self-admittedly unhealthy) kink for non-consent, and on the other side you have someone who's in the absurd "what if you actually had to rape someone to save humanity?" position that often remains the "Last Exception" of consequentialist morality.

I think it handled it really well, personally. I get that not everyone would be comfortable with the concepts being explored, but neither character came off as unrealistic or unlikable to me afterward.

Not much sex for erotica, not much room for rationality given the reality warping power, I didn't find the emotional storytelling very compelling especially with all the lying, etc. It may have gotten better since I stopped, but I wouldn't really recommend it to people even aside from the fact that it's a porn fic.

Disagree: The character is potentially likable, in that very few people have been in Cindy's position. But she lays out her position straight... it's pretty clear. She absolutely has a twisted mentality to consent and morality, but to be fair:

1. Her idea of consent is HEAVILY debated in the comments.
2. Charles is NOT a "good man," as has been the subject of recent chapters. He thrives off non-consensual encounters with Starry. There's a good argument that he's been molded to like that, or Starry craves it, but... at this point, it's on Charles. And as recently as two chapters ago, he's willing to let Starry get used by others.

If you only ever get reviews from people who have continued following a serial, you'll get a skewed view of how good it is. Unless they stopped reading very recently, most negative reviews would be disqualified under this criteria because the people who didn't like the work wouldn't continue to read it.

The solution would be to have the person who didn't like it catch up to the current chapter, but I think we could all agree that that would be too harsh on the reviewer.

I don't think a software analogy is apt. Software gets rewritten all the time, while stories generally aren't. Unless the author invests a lot of time into rewriting their story, which most serial writers don't, the current story will build off the parts that the person didn't like. If you were to force a video game analogy, it would be like really disliking a core mechanic of the game, like platforming in Mario games.

**** u/AurelianoTampa:
#+begin_quote
  I'm kinda bored, skipping chunks of text.
#+end_quote

If you're skipping chunks of text, you're likely missing some important signs of the deeper issues that are to come. IIRC, the early parts of the story are very much about Cindy/Starry testing out her new powers and stats, and getting used to the concept of the Erogame. After her time with Charles the meta-plot starts becoming much more developed... I forget exactly when, but if you've gotten to the part where Cindy reviews the perks, there are a variety that are clearly horrifying to her and show that the Erogame may have less than benevolent intentions. I THINK that's around the time that she goes to the hotel with Charles, because the room they get has references to several extremely disturbing hidden perks in the form of paintings/pictures. I can't recall if Cindy reviews the perk list before or after that, though.

But even before then there are worrying signs, as well as a lot of internal conversations about self-identity by Cindy herself. Probably the two most notable warning signs are when Cindy tries to change her hair style and the result of doing so, and when Cindy learns Slack and immediately gets inundated with messages from several alternate-future selves, all of whom have met various kinds of terrible fates.

To each individual point you wrote:

#+begin_quote
  the Mystery of What Is Going On and Why Cindy
#+end_quote

This is currently still a mystery. Characters provide several theories, and there seems to be some progression toward more understanding, but there's been no true answer.

#+begin_quote
  are no Stakes or (external) Conflict to keep things interesting
#+end_quote

Well, there are stakes even through what you've read already (see: terrible fates of alt-future Cindys), but I believe Cindy's already been reflecting on larger issues about the effect she is having and what it means. Like... what happens to ugly people as the world becomes more "ero"? Or the old, or deformed, or asexual? Will they be forced to change to something against their will, or simply deleted from reality? There's a ton of conflict as well about what Cindy can do, what she should do, and who that makes her (for example, how Charles freaks out when he thinks Starry is an alien who ate and absorbed Cindy).

#+begin_quote
  Like she has to avoid being murdered, exiled, whatever, and reality is constantly bending itself to contrive such situations.
#+end_quote

This happens literally right near the beginning, doesn't it? One of Cindy's first quests is "Gift Sex," where it's heavily implied that if she goes to an alley in the wrong part of town, she'll get raped. But doing so also rewards a perk point... but later I know there's a lot of discussion about whether she wants her Erogame experience to go like that or not, and what will happen if she increases her LST. Some of the perks echo that this is a legitimate concern ("There are no brakes on the rape train" and "Let's not turn this rape into a murder" for example).

#+begin_quote
  Or some kind of eroge nemesis that Cindy has to defeat.
#+end_quote

This hasn't happened yet, although she does have a potential rival or... what's the Homestuck word, /kismesis/? with a girl from her university. That will likely progress later but hasn't thus far.

#+begin_quote
  So I guess what I'm saying is, I don't really get why I'm supposed to care about Cindy's adventure.
#+end_quote

There are several elements that seem to appeal to readers. IMO: the first part is the mystery of what the Erogame is, what it wants, and why it chose Cindy. All still very much question marks. The second part is Cindy's development herself; how does someone with sexual-based, reality-bending superpowers react, feel, and think about them? The third part is the worldbuilding and implications to society at large when the Erogame takes over, and what happens to the people in it who don't fit the "new world"? A ton of the story is regarding ethics and morality in the setting. Fourth, it's the meta-commentary and crowd participation that give an even better insight to Cindy then she herself does. And finally, it's the humor and references that draw in people. The writing is really freaking hilarious at times and catching the references liberally interspersed is a treat for careful readers as well.

It's a lot of writing, and if you're not a fan of it now you likely won't be later. If you're skipping chunks of text, I don't think you'll find nearly as much enjoyment as readers who like poring over it for deeper meaning, philosophical implications, or hidden text.

****** I think [[/u/AurelianoTampa]] covered most of what I would have said too, but I hear your points about the structure of the plot and agree that it's a mostly stakeless story when it starts out. It's basically an extended version of that part of superhero stories where they test out their powers. But I think it was engaging for me because it was written so well, and the implications (both for her as a person and for the world) were so well thought through and explored in the text, that I was just enjoying the sheer novelty of someone approaching an Erogame with anything like a rationalist mindset. It gets even better the deeper into it you go, and more stakes and risks start becoming explicit, but I understand if you're just not feeling it and let it go.

Adblock origin. This is an ad blocker, it blocks ads on pretty much every site you go to. It saves you time and makes your browser faster and safer..

​

Utorrent. It can be useful if you are a kid without a credit card. A good website I use is [[https://zooqle.com][zooqle.com]]. Don't buy into the fear mongering out there, most people are just afraid of what they don't understand while spreading anecdotal false stories they heard about it from some random uninformed source. Watch a youtube guide and you'll be fine.

​

[[https://libgen.io][libgen.io]]. You can download pretty much any book for free there. It can be useful..

​

Watch youtube at 2x speed when trying to learn things.. You'll get used to it and it can make boring things less boring and fun things more fun.

​

*Edit Requested from the replies.

Use Ublock origin instead. This was a typo, I'm actually using ublock origin myself, it was late and I was tired sorry.

Utorrent is apparently not good anymore. I never noticed because I use an older version of it, my bad, instead use one of the alternatives from the great replies bellow.

*** You should use uBlock Origin, as it is far and away the best adblocker available. I assume Adblock origin is trying to piggyback on its good name to sell exemptions to ad companies, or sell user data. It works by preventing the blocked stuff from even being requested in the first place, so it actually makes pages finish loading faster, unlike every other adblock I know of which just removes them after download. (Not to be confused with uBlock, which was the old version which some company bought out. The guy took the money and immediately made uBlock Origin.)

A supplemental extension, uBlock Origin Extra, also deals with sites trying to insist you turn off your adblocker to access them.

​

Don't use Utorrent, it started leaving exploits open from version 2.2.1 onwards, and in 3.4.2 literally installed a bitcoin miner. Use Deluge or Transmission, which are essentially the same thing (torrenting clients) except not bundled with ads and malware. (I use Deluge.)

​

I'm not familiar with libgen.io, but I can confirm that watching tutorials on youtube at 2x speed is a huge timesaver.

​

*EDIT: Went and re-familiarised myself with Utorrent after having stopped using it over half a decade ago, it's worse than I remembered. Also apparently in that time they bought out BitTorrent and did the same thing with that, so don't use that either.*

(he also writes very wordy Dumas pastiches in the same world, but you can just skip those) Also interesting because it is a world where magic has been industrialized to an astounding degree.

*** /How to Win Friends and Influence People/ is actually kind of good if you read it a certain way. There is a sense in which the advice is obvious, but few people actually follow through. It's stuff like actually care about what people are saying. You might try reading it and forcibly suppress the eyerolls, you would probably get a lot out of it if you can do that.

The INTJ types that hang around here have a hard time with advice on social interactions because the advice isn't intellectually interesting. That kind of practice can't be boiled down to algorithms and we tend to think we already know the heuristics. As an INTJ type who once had poor social skills and now has a wide network of friends and a much enriched life, it ultimately comes down to repeatedly putting yourself out there and attending to the needs of others. It can be intellectually engaging in some respects but not the way we initially want it to be.

But things like this will rarely get discarded, it's like Newton and physics most of his theory is still correct, Einstein made a few adjustments and added a few things, but Newtons math still works with a +95% accuracy in most cases.

Also, physics doesn't make a good analogy to social sciences. There's a replication crisis on in social science and pretty much everything is in doubt. Also, in social sciences, paradigms tend to replace older paradigms, not refine them with grater precision, as in physics.

Also also, while being compared to a crotchety old fart might be a useful rhetorical cludge, it's fallacious and I don't find it compelling. It could as easily be used in any circumstance where the new is compared to the old. Frequently, the old is, in fact, better, and the bias tends to be in favor of the new.

** [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/485510][/Nioh/]] definitely is the most-fun game that I've played in several years, on a level with /Dark Souls 2/ and /Crusader Kings 2/. [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7obqov/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/ds8ese9/][I've recommended it in the past]], but here's a supplement to persuade anyone who's heard that it has "too much loot" or "overpowered magic".

--------------

As I said previously (more or less), /Nioh/ is a combination of the cautious combat of /Dark Souls/, the flashy combat of (rebooted) /Ninja Gaiden/ and /Dynasty Warriors/, and the equipment effects of /Diablo/. Some people (/e. g./, Joseph Anderson and Bick Benedict) have complained that the /Diablo/ influence is excessive---that they're paralyzed by the complexity of judging, editing, and equipping items, and that they're annoyed by the necessity of constantly having to dump items out of their overstuffed inventories.

I really can't see any merit in this complaint. /By no means/ does /Nioh/ require the player to min-max his equipment's special effects if he wants to be good at the game. If you want to ignore your equipment's effects and focus exclusively on your equipment's level---to simply equip your highest-level stuff and sell/disassemble/donate/discard your lowest-level stuff---you can do that without putting yourself at a disadvantage. Indeed, it's actually /recommended/ that you /ignore/ the special effects on the lowest difficulty level and /refrain/ from wasting your money on tinkering with them at the blacksmith, because the equipment that you get on the lowest difficulty level (Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Exotic) isn't completely compatible (for blacksmith purposes) with the stuff that you start getting at New Game Plus (Divine) and at NG+3 (Ethereal). In my estimation, even the /most casual/ player, who shuns the blacksmith waifu as if she were a leper, can go all the way through NG+1 without trouble.

NG+2, I admit, probably /does/ have the blacksmith's "soul match" function as a requirement, and I suspect that NG+3 and NG+4 get into the territory of /requiring/ min-maxing of equipment effects and magic self-buffs---but the game is great /even without/ those difficulty levels. I've spent my 300 hours of playtime /almost entirely/ on NG, NG+1, and NG+2 (in two separate playthroughs), with NG+3 barely started and NG+4 not even unlocked, and with equipment effects and magic self-buffs hardly explored.

--------------

In a similar vein, some people have complained that the magic in /Nioh/---particularly the Sloth Talisman, which drastically slows down for several seconds all the animations of the enemy who's hit by it, making dodging the enemy's attacks much easier---is overpowered to the point of sucking the fun out of the game. This may be /close/ to true on the lowest difficulty level, but I personally think it's a vastly overblown problem. Yes, you can use the Sloth Talisman to make some bosses into jokes in NG, but you certainly aren't /forced/ to do so. In any event, debuff magic like the Sloth Talisman becomes next to worthless on harder NG+ levels (debuff durations on enemies are greatly diminished, to the point that a Sloth Talisman's effect lasts for just a few seconds on a NG+2 boss---not enough time for you to get much benefit out of it), and you'll be spending most of your time playing on those harder difficulties, so it really doesn't matter.

The combat of /Nioh/ is somewhat faster /and/ somewhat more complex than that of /Dark Souls/. If you've successfully played a /Dark Souls/ game with mouse and keyboard (ISHYGDDT), I /guess/ you could try to play /Nioh/ in the same fashion (M&K support was added in a post-launch update), but I wouldn't expect too much success.

That's badly worded. Many PC games can accept controller input, and some console games can accept mouse-and-keyboard input.

For PC, I highly recommend the Xbox One controller. To use it on PC, you'll additionally have to buy the USB adapter---or the Bluetooth dongle, if you prefer playing wirelessly (and spending money on batteries)---but it definitely is well worth the money.

Moving a bit further afeild there is isekai / isekai tensei (to another world / reincarnated in another world) as fairly popular genres, but the main problem is that almost all isekais are complete, irredeemable garbage. I would genuinely reccomend Youjo Senki (+fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record]]), and would hesitantly reccomend Overlord just for the writing quality making up for a lot, but that's pretty much it.

** For anybody looking to improve their social skills i recommend checking out RSD Max on youtube and pick up in general. (Max isn't my favorite teacher but he's a good introduction imo).

​

They are basically guys systematizing pick up. i.e how to get girls in a step by step approach.

​

With systems and rationality, it can be very politically incorrect though.

​

I mean these are guys using the scientific method to test and find the most effective ways to get more and better girlfriends.. They go really in depth, and even have proof with hidden camera footage.

​

They are literally applying rationality to make their lives better IRL. They can be pretty offensive to a lot of people though.

​

Another recommendation is a manga: Goblin Slayer.

​

It is a fantastical depiction of rational combat. I mean the author even had to put artificial rules in place so the series doesn't get boring, i.e MC can't use fire, water, or poison to kill his enemies. Before then he was flooding caves, smoking goblins out of their holes, gassing their air channels with poison etc.

​

Even now it's still fairly tactical and interesting, a few episodes ago he filled a room full of flour sealed it and lit it up causing an explosion. IDK about you but that's some very interesting way of getting around fighting a powerful creature.

​

The series itself can be very adult, i.e goblins assaulting women (I know inter species attraction is silly, but he gives a reasonable explanation i.e goblins are sort of like viruses they use humanoid females to breed), gore and the like.

​

But it's very interesting, the MC is at least a level 2 intelligence guy. He exploits his world and fights in interesting ways with tactics and strategies. Some people are going to hate it though.

​

Anyway I'll probably delete this comment in a few days because it's kind of weird xD

*** I'm autistic, and basically had to learn my romantic skills from pickup artists because the vast majority of people react with disgust to any explicit discussion of sexual conversation technique.

It's really annoying, too, because pick up artists /are/ typically sleazy. I think there's a natural [[https://siderea.livejournal.com/1230660.html][asshole filter]] going on here. Discussing how to escalate intimacy is a transgression of norms, so only people willing to transgress norms lead those discussions. (Romance novel authors also talk about this kind of stuff, but fall into an entirely separate set of failure modes.) Sictumbo's book recommendation is a good on for non-sexual-context social skills, but enforcing the taboo against seeking sexual-context social skill advice only reinforces the asshole filter and does nothing to improve the happiness of you or the people you talk to.

My advice /would/ be to avoid the kind of youtube channel mentioned above however; a lot of their advice is sound and hard to find elsewhere, but it's mixed in with a sprinkling of shit. It takes conscious effort to filter out the shit. And script-based approaches aren't broadly applicable because they depend on the mannerisms and charisma of the person who developed the script. For example, if you have social grace, you can tease people and deepen your emotional bond using words that on their surface seem insulting. (Non-romantic example would be shit-talking your brother.) But if you lack that social grace, your words just come off as actually insulting and you get xkcd strips written about you. But there's the catch: if you have the level of social grace needed to execute the scripts, then you don't need the scripts in the first place. (Also, they're closer to reality tv than to the scientific method. They choose footage that maximizes viewer retention rather than footage which maximizes information transfer.)

Instead start with the basic self-improvement checklist:

- Get fit
- Get clothes that fit
- Clean yourself up
- Conquer anxiety

This kind of advice is non-taboo and easy to find. You could follow the pickup artist technique and get over anxiety by approaching dozens of women, but anxiety is crippling in all aspects of life, so I'd recommend a more general [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_Therapy][rejection therapy]].

Then from there, seduction is basically just having engaging social interactions with escalating physical intimacy. I'll second "How To Win Friends And Influence People" as having great conversational advice. But how do you do the whole escalation of physical intimacy thing?

[[http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/sextips/][This guide]] has some pretty good advice about reading body language. And the author ran a sanity check by having several women read it and leave in-line comments, so the shit ratio is pretty low.

But an important thing I would add is [[http://terryodell.blogspot.com/2010/03/12-steps-to-intimacy.html][this list]]. It's a list of the stages of human intimacy as described by a zoologist (an actual scientist, not a webshow producer), and the linked page is discussing it in the context of portraying realistic romance in a novel. Each stage involves increasing vulnerability towards the other person. How you put this into practice is that you advance through each stage in order, looking for *enthusiastic reciprocation* before escalating to the next stage. (PUAs call this 'kino', but that's stupid terminology.)

If you're socially clueless like me, just go ahead and memorize the list. I always discuss it with my partners once we get to the heavy-petting stage. Its a simple way to bring up my social disability and lets me transition to a more verbally explicit and less body-language-focused relationship mode. "I'm not as good at reading body language as I pretended to be on the first date". And at that point, there's enough buy in from my partner that they're willing to tolerate the slight violation of their instincts. But they also come to understand their own feelings better as a result of internalizing the model.

My best friend came to me asking for advice. She has a preference for women but had dated only men. I explained to her the whole tiered intimacy thing, and the lightbulbs went off in her head. She had had these intuitions about when romance just 'felt right' and now all these inexplicable emotions became explicable to her. She's told me about how it's helped her out, and I'm really happy to have helped a friend. But at the same time, it feels like something has to be messed up with our norms if a person has to turn to their autistic friend to get actually useful social advice.

Anyways, the *TL;DR* is that the pick up artists have some taboo memes which really should be adopted by wider society, but most of their useful advice can be found elsewhere, and believing that their approach is scientific is a bit like believing that a magician really does have nothing up their sleeves.

**** Great comment, I just feel there are some things I should try to clarify.

Canned lines are mostly not used anymore, the technology advanced a lot since then.

The words and abbreviations they used to use, come from their past in forums, typing "enthusiastic reciprocation" every time you want to refer to a concept is too time consuming.

Also it's always been part of their culture to field test things before deciding if they work or not. That's exactly what the scientific method is, you develop theories and test them to see if they are correct or not.

But everything you said is correct, and the things they teach that are of most use to most people can be found elsewhere. The reason I feel the recommendation is valid is because it's in an easy form, all found in a single 'place' and it's easier to get men to do things that are good for themselves with women as motivation rather than health or well being.

*** That's not social skills, that's treating people as objects to get sex. It's fulfilling every negative stereotype that women have about creepy men.

***** Claiming to be a nice guy (unlike the assholes/Chads that are mean to girls but get dates anyway) is a fairly common defense of PUAs and related subcultures. I don't find it convincing, however, and every PUA I've ever seen came off as manipulative and self-justifying.

By the by, the framing here--that there's some sort of clear demarcation with Nerds on one side and Assholes on the other--strikes me as a pretty dangerous mental framework to build on.

****** I think it's telling that the first comment initially talked about how they will teach how to get more and better sex, and changed it to girlfriends after seeing my response. If the comment was talking about managing social anxiety, how to hold a conversation with new people, how to get over irrational fear of rejection, I would be all for it. But no, the advertising is how to get women to be glorified sexdolls, which gets rebranded almost immediately when they see that objectifying women doesn't go over well with this particular group.

Seriously, "get the women they deserve"? (From the comment two above this one) I couldn't come up with a more typical creepy, objectifying statement if I tried.

It is a recommendation. As I said, most people are not going to like it. It's a useful tool, if you are too proud to use it, don't.

That's anecdotal evidence..

Imho it's better do our own research before forming our opinions on any particular subject. As you can see most people just dismiss things outright, even here in an above average rational community.

​

In the end it's a recommendation, if some people think it's bad that's fine.

This high moral ground argument this other guy is trying to pull sounds pointless. It's a tool, some people are going to use it badly and give it a bad reputation, but that doesn't make the tool inherently bad.
