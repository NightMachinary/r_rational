  /really really hard/ space SF
#+end_quote

Yep, definitely Greg Egan, from what I've heard. /Orthogonal/ has been on my list for a while, but I haven't started it. The chief concept behind the universe there is that spacetime has a (1,1,1,1) metric instead of (-1,1,1,1). Check out the website [[http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html][here]]. There, Egan basically re-derives all of undergraduate physics in this new system to lay out what the universe is like.

Some highlights:

- If you actualize the same setup for the Twin Paradox in our universe, the traveling "twin" ages more quickly, not more slowly. [[#s][Slight premise spoilers I've gleaned from Egan's site:]]
- Two charged particles (regardless of sign) have multiple (countably infinitely many) points of equilibrium at nonzero distances. And these equilibria are /stable/. Contrast with our universe, in which two particles either repel forever or attract forever (well, until they collide). This seems to make for interesting electron lattice structures in electronics, though of course I'm fuzzing on the details.
- The speed of light is not A) a universal speed limit or B) constant for different frequencies of light. Because of B), stars look like rainbow smears instead of white pinpricks: When the star moves from point A to B, the slower frequencies emitted at point A reach us simultaneously with faster frequencies emitted from point B.

Basically, the world sounds cool as fuck. It's on my reading list for this summer.

*** I'm curious what you think would be interesting to read about that. Is it the description of space travel, how they prepare and talk about it working, how they deal with and predict potential problems, or something else entirely?

To me, it seems unlikely to make a story more interesting unless it was simple mentioning the ideas worked into the plot somehow to make it more realistic, rather than tons of detail someone might need to know if they were actually involved in it. But then again, I'm not hugely into the technical details of things like that.

******* I actually think this is usually an overblown assertion - most ecological disasters could be catastrophic (like, reset the past ~20,000 years of human progress), but they're not an existential threat on the level of grey goo or UFAI.

This is the kind of threat that I spend my life thinking about, and the best options are (1) avert disaster; (2) see 1 as it will continue to get worse; (3) resilience; or (4) run away. The problem is that as you go along each option loses more of what's valuable, so best is to have dealt with environmental problems as we learn about them. If not, at least avoid irreversible tipping points. Or at least try to have a resilient system of, say, Von Neuman repraps so you can restart from 1990 instead of 20K BCE. Failing that, hope that the problems are limited to earth and we have self-sufficient colonies elsewhere (not really an option).

As a separate issue: Domesticated meat animals have a pretty sweet gig. In principle, they don't live in fear of starving when they can't find food, getting infested with parasites, dying of illness, dying of hypothermia or dehydration, going extinct, competing for mates, being ripped open and eaten alive by large predatory animals, getting injured and slowly lingering to death over weeks... in principle they get to live full risk-free lives free of pain and suffering up until the point the gem in their palms turns red and they immediately die, again without suffering, in an instant.

In practice of course, businesses need to make a profit, and the physical welfare of animals who lack the capacity to suffer in many of the ways that humans do, is not a significant concern. So they get jammed into tiny cages, and yes I would prefer even animals not to suffer, so if I have a choice between two meat companies, one who causes more animal suffering than the other, I will choose the company whose meat has less suffering. To argue that all meat eating should be stopped on some kind of ethical grounds is to suggest that an entire species should be neglected to death, or worse returned to the wild, which is an extinction event in either case. Leaving animals at the cruel whims of nature rather than caring for them and using them to feed humans, is the /least/ ethical choice being considered.

And these arguments are why, given that kashrut already forbids hunting /wild/ animals, I feel /ethically uncertain/ about meat-eating. It's a bit like house-elves, except that we completely and utterly mistreat the poor creatures even more than house-elves.

It's not just a matter of /less suffering/, it's a matter of the fact that the animals don't actually enjoy themselves at all. I don't support shoving /people/ into tiny cubicles and extracting maximum productivity from them, so why /should/ I support doing to animals what I won't even do to people? And logically, if I want /people/ to live nice eudaimonic lives, then at least as long as I eat meat at all instead of /destroying/ the Subspecies Who Should Never Have Been, then I should probably be eating free-range meat, too, except that I can't actually afford that on a grad-student's budget.

  It's not about not getting anything out of it, IMO. It's about not wasting the bodies. We actually do have a use for this. Meat is delicious hedons to be enjoyed. I don't want to live on algae paste alone.

Our current meat supply is /not/ animals who died of old age.

Besides, you're a gorram transhumanist, or at least you're on a subreddit targeted at such; don't tell me you consider it ethical to leave the cows, chickens, and sheep /mortal/.

*************** Why would I wish the suffering of old age on an animal? Why are we talking only about our /current/ methods? I've already outlined my preference for less-cruel meats and my attempt at exerting a market pressure in that direction.

********** Whether of not he is vegetarian has no relevance to the question if we should care about other (conscious) lifeforms and their well-being. Not even to his opinion about it.

*********** Hi, you wandered in late, so I thought I'd sum up for you since you appear to have not read the relevant posts. We were engaged in a discussion of what was actually right and what was not, and I was asking questions about his beliefs and what that implied about how he justifies his morality. It was the starting point, not the conclusion. Thank you, and kindly fuck off.

************ I think that's reasonable. I maybe overreacted, people just too often use those kind of claims to downplay morality.

** [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox][The Fermi Paradox.]] I'd love for more scifi settings to provide explanations for why their aliens never made contact, or colonized en masse, or, extrapolating things a step further, converted our entire planet into computronium 500 million years before multicellular life would have even evolved

** Quantum entanglement fascinates me. The closest thing to its intelligent use was Card's ansible, but it seems to have far deeper potential for use. Especially since it's not well understood, there's room for quite a good deal of imagination.
