** Odds of winning the jackpot at the Lotto: 1/13,983,816.

Odds of winning the jackpot at the Lotto every draw for a year (the draws are twice a week): about 10^{-745}.

Okay, that's a bit low. (Edit: I dropped a logarithm somewhere, so this comment used to give a slightly more humanly relatable result. It's correct now.)

** You could always conjunct independent events till you get the right prob. For instance, the probability of flipping 70 heads in a row on a fair coin is about 10^{-20}

** How about quantum tunneling at the macroscopic level? There's a finite non-zero probability that all the atoms making you up would suddenly end up a foot to the left of their current position. Or a light year.

*** And a much higher probability (though still very small) that they end up in a configuration that isn't "you" at all.

*** there's a fun short story called gravity mine. Civilization during the degenerate era. Eventually the protagonist finds a naked quantum singularity, slows herself down, and just waits. Given enough time, complexity will emerge from the noise.

Drabblecast podcast gravity mine.

Also, royal flush = 1 in 40 million, or something like that.

** I don't have the math. But you. Your existence. Is the result of an extremely small probabilty. And I don't mean that in the "You're a special snowflake" way. I mean that in the "Holy shit, the number of variables that had to coincide perfectly to give rise to the human race is ridiculously huge" :)

Evolution is an optimization process. The probability is only ultra-low as a /prior/, /before/ you take the optimization into account. Once you do that, the probability of /something roughly like us/ existing somewhere, somewhen in the universe is... pretty high, I'd guesstimate.

**** Probability of it existing somewhere? Sure, I can accept that number being higher. But as to it happening at a specific point in space? The probability is unlikely to say the least. Like if you went on a beach to pick up a grain of sand, the probability is high that you will have a grain of sand in your hand. But the probability of you picking up a specific grain is ridiculously low

**** You sure? I know a couple of ways where OP doesn't exist.

- Improbable server glitch to make a post with relevant information to this subreddit.

- A virus going around and creating posts. While writing this post may seem likely to be sign of an intelligent AI, I can imagine a strange programmer combing multiple texts on statistics with a very good text analysis to create relevant posts. It'd be hard and blurs the line between sophisticated program and AI, but I think it's possible.

- A cat got on someone's key board and randomly pressed keys in a very strange pattern. Seriously, I've seen a cat sit in front of a computer and press a /single/ key at a time.

There's always alternate explanations. The question is whether or not they're likely enough to bother considering.

***** Can someone actually calculate the probability of a cat randomly typing the above post one key at a time? That seems like an adequately low probability event to put some things into perspective.

XKCD examines the odds of there being a literal tie in the US election. It's worth reading the last few lines at minimum.
