** This is a bit of an unusual submission. But the main characters and their noble family, though evil, has over centuries used "rational" techniques - subterfuge, diplomacy, and economic warfare - to gain advantages over the other, more warlike and honorable noble houses. It's quite entertaining to read the discussions of their house's history and the tactics employed by the main character, which are strongly in his house's tradition.

The campaign is a third-party add-on for the game Battle For Wesnoth. It can be downloaded from inside the game in the "Add-ons" section.

** Wild, was not expecting to see something like this here. For people who don't know Battle for Wesnoth is a free open source turn based strategy game. If I had to compare it to a more popular series I'd say its kind of like Fire Emblem on a hex map. It doesn't emphasize the characters as much though as there are less levels and most units aren't unique characters. Lots of small gameplay differences as well, but its a great time with a ton of content including coop/competitive multiplayer.

*** Yes, this fan campaign is quite different since it has a much stronger emphasis on individual characters (and various modifications to core gameplay/campaign persistence to enable that).

** Sounds nice, and I haven't played BfW in a while. Might check it out.
