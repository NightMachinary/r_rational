The latest chapter, "Craftsman of Destruction," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/72886791][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

** So. Riddle has friends in the French government. And those friends don't see any problem with drugging young girls to extract secrets and/or promises from them.

**** It sounds more like liquid hypnotism to me. My impression was that she was being made suggestible, rather than being made to remember something false. And while I don't doubt the compulsion is drawing the truth from her, it doesn't seem that she's saying anything that she'd rather keep secret.

** I admit to not knowing where this is going and being intrigued.

I do think that much of the first half of this chapter suffers a bit from telling, rather than showing. Much of it is summaries of activities and feelings, rather than showing us specific actions and examples that allow the big picture to draw itself. I found myself starting to skim quite a bit, looking for a bit of dialogue or action to ground me and find the thread of the story.

I am still interested in where it's going, so do keep at it :)

** Octobre, huh?

Creepy, cold, formal?\\
Like September from Fringe, perhaps?

** For as much as was made of the trauma from the duel in the previous chapter, it seems to have, well, vanished overnight. Other than a brief mention of the Goblet and Hermione's protectiveness of Fleur, she no longer seems to be troubled by it, and doesn't even bother to mention it when asked about her impressions of Hogwarts. Was she only traumatized out of fear for Fleur? If so, that's not the impression I got in the previous chapter.

Other than that, it was a very nice chapter!
