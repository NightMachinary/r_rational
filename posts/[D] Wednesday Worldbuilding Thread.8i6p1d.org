Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So, how many magic user/superpowered people can I have in a Superhero setting close to our world, without it being unrealistic that the setting is similar to our world? And what changes should be expected and what powers wouldn't let the world be like ours? (Assume details and limitations of powers are so, that the exploits don't work or aren't OP.)

The Powers would be all powered with calories (meaning food) or rarely (1 in 1000 metahumans) with external power sources.

Powers would be superstrength (like max 10t), invulnerability (like artillery shots, not nukes), telekinesis, mind reading (and like one or two mind controller), pyromancers (like a lighter worth of fire, since fueled by eaten food), flying (50km/h limit, and max 200kg), and general spiderman level of stuff.

*** None of the examples you mention seem like they would change the fundamentals of society all that much, except:

#+begin_quote
  mind reading (and like one or two mind controller)
#+end_quote

Which utterly tears them apart unless there is some kind of mundane defense against it. Information security, politics, the judicial system and so forth all need to be completely rethought if there are even a handful of people capable of mind reading/mind control.

Also:

#+begin_quote
  general spiderman level of stuff
#+end_quote

Reasonably sure this isn't what you meant, but Spiderman has limited precognition which is another can of worms best left unopened if you don't want to make it the focus of the story.

**** mind reading and mind control would be not overpowered. It would be surface thoughts (still passwords would be a problem) and mind control would be like hypnosis (the stage variant, no one can be forced to kill their kids), but still a problem. And mundane defences would be possible. (like singing songs in your mind and some would be immune, cause different wired brain or something)

Yeah didn't mean precognition, or alternate realities or time travel or clones with memories. Maybe his precognition would be more like better senses and unconscious information processing. (But his precognition is with most writers only seconds in the future. I don't know how you could exploit it, except if he is a stockbrokers and lets a gun automatical fire at him, if a condition is met, and he can push a button to sell/buy.)

But more like what his enemies can do. (Well with realistic limits, Shocker could destroy a wall, but his device would need to be recharged at some point. And probably not with devices but a superpower. ) And less stuff what Fantastic Four fight and build.

But still, I think a world with x% of flying people would have other stair cases, maybe doors on roofs. (Or less cables in the air.)

If y% of people could push your locked door open, you would want bigger locks. And if z% of people could just unlock it with their mind, you would want different locks.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8eu9f1/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dxyip5g][Two weeks ago]] I posted about how I found the premise of /Out of the Violent Planet/ to be an intriguing idea but I had no idea how to use it to create a story, so you can imagine how impressed I was when I started watching /Full Metal Panic!/ and realized the story would fit surprisingly well into that RPG setting. The Whispered and their ability to intuitively understand and build sci-fi technology make perfect sense in a world where Lovecraftian aliens speak to people randomly born psychic. Skimming the book has actually improved my enjoyment of the show because it provides ways to rationalize nearly everything that hasn't been explained.

Everyone wants to get more contact with the aliens so they can make bank, but need to keep their scheming hidden from everyone else. Suddenly all the terrorist plots, deniable ops, and private military contractors have a completely logical background to support them. Mecha is just what humans decide to build with alien tech and the Lambda Driver is a weapon aliens never thought up themselves. Even the little details like Tessa being in charge of Mythril make more sense, if we make the *very logical* assumption that she is a Whispered, since leading a mercenary company is her way of maintaining autonomy from any nation that would abduct her.

The way the show combines those elements with anime high school hi-jinks also works in light of this, since it turns the weird gimmick into a brilliant way of grounding the story in the lives of humans. That's exactly how I think the premise of the setting should be used, have the plot revolve around the people we can empathize with and get us invested in protecting the world they like living in. It isn't just a joke about fish out of water like in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck][Chuck]], it's also a metaphor for the way the human and alien worlds are colliding to create chaos. This was obviously unintentional on the writer's part, but it's the exact framework for a story I was looking for.

** In a world where magic exist, what would the body of a sentient and mobile fungal-form species (mushroom person) look like. I could make them look humanoid and hand wave the reason away but that would leave me unsatisfied and would cause me to constantly question why a fungal species specifically need 2 arms and 2 legs?

My thoughts are going down two paths. Path A is that the species is a literal fungal person (mushroom or not). Path B is that the fungal person is actually a symbiotic relationship between two species, a fungus and it's host.

Path A would be the simplest as long as there was no need to examine specifically why or how the species developed as they did. The fungal people could have eventually gained sentience and then, using magic, gained mobility by modeling other organisms to form limbs. This would eventually lead them to develop civilization and advanced technology.

Path B at its surface appears more complicated (and maybe it is) but it would allow for a way to explain how a fungal species could gain mobility and constrain them to a specific body. The fungal species is essentially the disembodied brain of its host. Through their co-evolution, the host is practically brainless giving full control of it's bodily to the fungus. Being the brain the fungus is responsible for the survival of both species.

Although Path A would make it easier to build a society however I would like, I'm not so fond of it since it doesn't explain how mobility develops naturally and allows too much variance to what a fungal person looks like. I feel like I'm left with using magic as the end-all to all questions.

I'm leaning towards Path B since it put constraints to what a body can look like and explains how it could have developed. It also allows for some interesting speculation on the evolution of the two species and of how civilization would develop through the logical progression of that evolution.

*** B makes the most obviouse sense to me, since there's a history of fungus species taking the brains of their host and making them do things (e.g. that fungus that takes over ant bodies, makes them climb to the top of the canopy, so that way they can be eaten by a bird to complete their lifecycle - at least I'm pretty sure it's a fungus, it's what the pokemon Paras/Parasect is based on.)

*** Skerples has a series of blog posts about fungus which followed path A: [[https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.se/2018/01/osr-myconids-part-1.html][Part 1 (mildly nsfw)]], [[https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-myconids-part-2.html][Part 2]], [[https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-myconids-part-3.html][Part 3]]

It's mostly written with tabletop roleplaying in mind, but theres lots of worldbuilding and descriptions of magical mushroom people.

Excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  Maybe it started like this. Food is scarce. Casting spores into the air and hoping works, but what if there was a better way? The mushroom detaches, rolls, tries to get away from the original fungus before spreading its spores. Better. But then it starts to develop chemoreceptors and tiny grasping tendrils. It can smell other food, rot, other fungi. It can roll in the right direction.

  And sometimes that's enough. The mushmice, fat mushroom caps with tiny legs, only needed to get this far before finding a successful niche. The famous gas spore is another example. But the pressure is still on for other species. They get better and better at sending mobile mushrooms. They discover that a mobile mushroom can not only sabotage other fungi, but that it can actively seek new food sources before sporulating. Competition begets improvement.

*** One way is that the fungus goes human shaped is because human shaped fungi get killed by humans less often.

**** That sounds okay. The problem I have with it is that it makes the fungiform/myconid/mushroomman (whatever I'll call them) dependent on human existence (or at least another advanced sentient species). I wanted to hypothesize a world where fungal species could evolve and become an advance race on their own.

Through your proposed method, I would effectively create another form of the modern zombies which is something that I don't want to do.

** I have a question. In this world, magic used to be known about by humanity. Then, around 6-7oo years ago a spell was cast that separated the realms. This is pretty typical so far, but my question is, if magic used to be common knowledge, what evidence of its existence would still be left in the modern day? In this scenario most magic takes the form of creatures such as vampires and werewolves. Aside from stories, which we have, what signs would be left?

*** Artifacts and structures that would be otherwise impossible to build via mundane methods. Like:

- A huge crystal ball that contains no imperfections that could have only been made with carefully controlled magic fire and repair spells

- A smooth stone castle with murals made of gemstones flowing flawlessly into each other.

- Ruins that appear to be an inverted pyramid once held up by levitation

- An abandoned city with infrastructure that hints at distributing resources from an endless cornucopia that once provided food and water for the entire city.

- A (now dead) silver tree that looks like it grew because it is roots cracked nearby rocks and upon splitting it open, there are detailed growth rings.

- landscapes twisted with the mundane effects of magic long after the magic itself disappeared.

*** Werewolves would change historical forestry.

Ancient populations would expand until they hit some natural limit. This means that any land that could get cleared & farmed with time-period's technology did get cleared & farmed. When I looked into it, I was surprised at just how [[https://islesproject.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/12000bce-present-a-brief-history-of-british-woodlands/][early the wild forests got cleared]]:

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the Mesolithic era there is evidence of the beginnings of agriculture. ... In some areas, such as East Anglia, the chalklands and the Somerset Levels, population increased dramatically, and virtually all the wildwood was cleared.

  Clearance increased during the Bronze Age (2400-750BC) to its probable height in the early Iron Age. Oliver Rackham (1990) estimates that about half of England had ceased to be wildwood by 500BC.
#+end_quote

Werewolves would change this. They'd be a smart, apex predator with a vested interest in protecting wildwoods from farming and other intrusions.

As a spill-over effect, they would have disrupted the surprisingly good [[http://orbis.stanford.edu/][road network in the ancient world]]. Instead of putting your roads through farmland, or managed forest, you'd pretty much have to have a legion carve routes through Werewolf-infested wildwood.

I expect that a legion could manage this and get the roads in place. But, once they were in place, you have the problem of actually using them. Caravans would be very easy prey for 7' tall regenerating murder-beasts.

One option would be coming to some kind of treaty with the werewolves. You could make offerings to local tribes. Or you could have a formal arrangement with the werewolf leader, should one exist. This shows up in the record as Rome making oddly favorable agreements with a Nomadic Warrior society that lasted up until 1400.

Vampires would change trade-networks.

My thought is that, before we had formal education, everyone was relying on experience and innate skill. One especially competent family member could build up a fortune. But, that competence might not pass down to their kids. So, it would be hard for one person's competence to turn into a huge dynastic merchant-company.

Introduce vampiricism, and that changes. Eventually, a vampire is going to bite one of the cleverer merchants. Time passes. And now you've got a guy who'd be smart and vastly more experienced than all of his human peers. His empire would expand up to the limit of what he could personally manage. Once that happens a few more times, you could easily end up with a network of 20 or so "Great Merchant Houses" that would outlast various kingdoms.

Those houses might not immediately collapse once their leaders died. But, they'd probably diminish to be in line with other organizations of their era.

A final change is that I'd expect to see WAY more [[https://www.britannica.com/topic/mystery-religion][mystery cults]]. You could set up a ceremony where, at the end, your God straight-up turns someone into a wolf. That would be really convincing. And, I think it would lead to a ton of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+18%3A20-40&version=ESV][religious challenges]] that would limit the spread of monotheism.

*** The thing with vampires and werewolves specifically is that vampires and werewolves and their mythology is 300-400 years old, rather than ancient. So if you want specifically vampires and werewolves you probably need magic to have stayed in the world for longer, or to explain why their mythology is so young.
