*Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid*

This is a discussion of the themes and questions concerning the *Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering*, and its dialogue, *A Three Part Offering*.

This post will list several of the main ideas which appear in the introduction as well as starting questions to answer concerning each idea.

*Strange Loops*

The first problem to discuss is what Strange Loops, or self-referential statements, can you come up with?

To help, the provided definition is that a strange loop arises when, by moving only upwards or downwards through a hierarchical system, one finds oneself back to where one started.

Examples:

This sentence has no punctuation

In this sentence, the number of occurrences of 0 is 1, of 1 is 11, of 2 is 2, of 3 is 1, of 4 is 1, of 5 is 1, of 6 is 1, of 7 is 1, of 8 is 1, and of 9 is 1.

Don't restrict yourself to sentences either! Think of other ideas such as Escher's paintings. Play around with the format of this subreddit!

This comment has one false reply.

This reply has a true parent comment.

*Recursion*

The second problem is to understand the concept of recursion. One relevant definition of recursion is:

If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to Douglas Hofstadter than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is.

How does recursion differ from the concept of self-reference?

......

*Paradox*

The third problem is to discuss the concept of a paradox. A paradox is a statement which /seemingly/ contradicts itself but might be true. Note that a paradox is not the same thing as a contradiction. Paradoxes are invalid arguments where /seemingly/ valid assumptions lead to an invalid fact or contradiction.

Types of paradoxes:

A veridical paradox produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nevertheless. Thus, the paradox of a 21 year-old man who has celebrated only 5 birthdays is resolved by his birthdate being on February, 29th.

A falsidical paradox establishes a result that not only appears false but actually is false; there is a fallacy in the supposed demonstration. The various invalid proofs (e.g. that 1 = 2) are classic examples, generally relying on a hidden division by zero.

A paradox which is in neither class may be an antinomy, which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning. For example, if the sentence “There is no absolute truth.” is true, then the sentence is itself an absolute truth.

As before, come up with a paradox and discuss the difference between self-reference, recursion, and paradoxes.

Is the idea of infinity paradoxical? [[http://www.people.vcu.edu/%7Eelhaij/GEB/Notes/Unit1/InfiniteHotel.html][Hilbert's Hotel]] is a good example of a paradox involving infinity.

......

*Dialogue*

Here are some questions on the dialogue found (and [[http://www.people.vcu.edu/%7Eelhaij/GEB/Notes/Unit1/index.html][stolen!]]) by searching through online notes on GEB:

a) To what Escher print does Achilles refer at the beginning of the dialogue (what does that print look like)?

b) What is a Möbius strip? To what print does Achilles refer?

c) What is the relationship between the hole in the flag and the Möbius strip?

d) Is Zeno the sixth patriarch or is he not? If he isn't, then why does Achilles think he is?

e) What story is recreated in this dialogue?

f) In what ways is this dialogue self-referential?

g) Do you understand the crux of the paradox (Achilles paradox) that Zeno relates?

h) Are you familiar with the Dichotomy paradox to which the Tortoise refers?

i) Is there any significance in positioning the Tortoise upwind of Achilles?

j) What (if anything) is wrong with Zeno's argument?

** Inspired by yesterday's reading, I tried to make a strange loop themed drawing myself - [[http://i.imgur.com/NVojCes.jpg][a man imagining himself.]]

Some general ideas that the reading inspired:

#+begin_quote
  Such, one imagines, was Bach's intention; but Bach indubitably also relished the implication that this process could go on ad infinitum, which is perhaps why he wrote in the margin "As the modulation rises, so may the King's Glory."

  Implicit in the concept of Strange Loops is the concept of infinity, since what else is a loop but a way of representing an endless process in a finite way?
#+end_quote

These parts reminded me of how in the Middle Ages Catholic philosophers and theologians tried to come up with proofs of God and ways to describe God. It sounds kinda similar to "trying to represent an endless process in a finite way." [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%F6del%27s_ontological_proof][Maybe it's not an accident that even Gödel tried to prove the existence of God.]] I believe that for certain types of artists the goal of their art is to describe the "unreachable" (infinity, God, Samsara etc.)

In this section there was a kinda quasi-spiritual vibe. Maybe the reason why Eliezer adores this book so much that he thinks it's "the most beautiful book ever written by the human species" is that the subjects of this book inspire the kind of feelings that are closest to what believers have when they think about God. I'm not sure if it's related, but [[https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/%7Eneum/sciandf/contrib/clari.txt][there are studies say that among mathematicians the number of people who believe in God is slightly higher than in other disciplines.]]

Russell's and Whitehead's attempt to create an artificial multilevel system to get rid of self-referencing reminds me of my own attempts to get rid of anxiety. It sounds funny, but I've had huge problems with self-reference induced anxiety. It's interesting that the same issue can cause problems both in formal systems and in real people. If I start to reference myself too much in my own thinking (like thinking about how I walk, or keep my hands, or what my posture is etc.) I become really really anxious, I become really awkward and I lose the capability to do almost anything. This was one of the several problems why I was put in a mental asylum last year. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/11/going-loopy/][Slate Star Codex further described this particular issue with self-reference.]]:

#+begin_quote
  A guy named Wegner conducted a famous psych experiment where he asked a bunch of participants to sit in a room alone and try not to think about a bear with sunglasses. Of course, that was pretty much all they could think of. They seem to have gotten into a feedback loop where “desire not to think of a bear with sunglasses” -> “thought of a bear with sunglasses” -> “frustration” -> “stronger desire not to think of...” -> “more thoughts of...” and so on.

  There seems to be an element of this in most anxiety disorders. Someone goes outside, something bad happens. Next time they go outside, they feel anxious. The usual STRONG BARRIER against conditioning upon internal experience is AWOL for some reason. The patient finds the experience of becoming anxiety very negative; therefore their belief that “going outside leads to bad things” is justified. Eventually they are so anxious about possibly becoming anxious that they just stay in their house all the time.

**** It's not a terribly /useful/ metric, given that the majority of pages have an autoproximity of 2, and many have an autoproximity of 1. I believe that every comments page on reddit has a link to itself, actually - the link just below the post which (currently) says "23 comments".

The proliferation of these small, mundane strange loops on the internet is a byproduct of how they're programmed - there's no use in having a page link to itself, but this page was created programmatically, and it's useful for "the page" to have a link from specific to general, because sometimes the page is a permalink to a comment, or a context expanded comment chain.

**** I wouldn't call them loops.

consider a "perfect" city, that is, a cartesian coordinate plane made out of roads. if you go from one end to the city to the other and back, is it a loop? is it fair to say that any given intersection is part of a loop because of this? we can imagine links the same way- each road being a link, and each intersection being a page. (only with the real internet, each page links to far more than just four others, so instead of a grid, it's more like a web. ...hence the name.)

I suppose, in the strictest sense, it is- if we define "loop" as "the end is linked to the beginning" then yes, it is. ...but only because /everything/ is linked to /everything else/ in fact, there's a game that illustrates this- N clicks to jesus- where you start at a random page and try to end up on the wikipedia page for jesus by only clicking N links or less.

** This will be my first read-through of this allegedly life-changing book, and I'm curious to see what all the fuss is about. So far I have no idea. Basically all I'm getting so far is:

- "Recursion! Paradoxes! These things sure are weird and neat, aren't they?"
- A lot of dancing around Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem without any clear sense of why it's important or interesting (or for that matter, what it even really means, or how it's proven, which is frustrating since while I'm sure some others on this sub are already familiar with this topic, I am not).
- The most famous of Zeno's paradoxes, with unfunny jokes.

** Strange loop: The idea of actually pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Holding corporations that own each other nontransitively.

Recursion always points to a case simpler than itself. It hits an end eventually, even if you're working with infinite but well-founded objects.

As for paradoxes: truth is truth and is perfect. A seeming paradox is just truth's way of pointedly telling you that your map is imperfect, your glasses lenses dirty - you need to figure out a way to say things correctly. Infinity isn't paradoxical, just so far removed from human intuition that it requires special rules to handle correctly.

  What I'm hoping gets backed up later on is GEB's claim that from these strange loops, a self or consciousness can arise. I understand what Hofstadter is saying, that an AI capable of redefining its own rules based on itself must have a strange loop involved, but that currently feels incomplete. He has the whole remainder of a book to explain it to me, but I really hope he does it.

While Justin Curry and Curran Kelleher are cool dudes and they put together a good course, don't call it an "official university course". Set your expectations appropriately: It was a summer course for high schoolers, taught by undergrads.

** I like this a lot - I've been meaning to read GEB for a while. Thanks for helping me getting around to it!

I think to a lot of people infinity and recursion seem like inherently paradoxical concepts - I've heard several times people misquote Russell's Paradox as "does the set of all sets contain itself?" This is understandable - I don't think infinity itself seems paradoxical, but the idea that something infinite can be described in a finite number of letters (such as the word "infinity" for example) can be pretty mindblowing.

I really enjoyed the discussion on the word "heterological". But it seems to me, when it comes to words much moreso than with set theory (maybe just because I'm much more familiar with words than with set theory), that the division of all words into autological and heterological is somewhat of a false dichotomy. It sounds reasonable that words either describe themselves or not - but can't we solve the paradox by simply allowing a third category, those whose self-describing status is undefined? It reminds me of a paradox riddle I've heard - "There is a village with only one barber. All the men in the village either shave themselves or get shaved by the barber. Who shaves the barber?" There, it seems obvious that even though the claim "all the men either shave themselves or get shaved by the barber" on the surface looks like it neatly sorts the men into two groups, the paradox of "who shaves the barber" shows that the dichotomy is not quite real.

Incidentally, I Googled "Sixth Patriarch of Zen" and arrived at [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huineng][Huineng]], who is apparently a very important figure in Zen Buddhism. The Wiki article is sadly lacking, but in combination with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_Sutra][Platform Sutra]] which is based on his teachings, I did feel like I learned some interesting - and relevant - stuff. Huineng was of the strong opinion that meditation should strive toward thoughtlessness, not reflection. To quote the Platform Sutra:

#+begin_quote
  In this teaching of seated meditation, one fundamentally does not concentrate on mind, nor does one concentrate on purity, nor is it motionlessness. If one is to concentrate on the mind, then the mind [involved] is fundamentally false.
#+end_quote

This is really interesting. I'm reading it as "purity of thought comes from deactivating the mind, not from concentrating it on 'purity of thought'". So basically, you have to find a trick to stop thinking about what you're trying to achieve by not thinking, a very recursive problem. My interpretation is that Huineng sees recursion as a real problem to avoid. I would very much like to hear his thoughts on Achilles and the Tortoise in the original paradox by Zeno.

** Computer scientist here. I found the self-referencing part very interesting, one thing that immediately came to my mind was Haskell (programming language, [[/r/haskell]]). By using lazy evaluation, we can make use of self-referencing in some quite neat ways.

One thing I learned recently about are Allison's Queues (good explanation here: [[http://www.melding-monads.com/files/CorecQueues.pdf][link]]). They can be used to implement breadth-first traversal without explicitly mutating e.g. a queue by creating a self referential queue. In the paper linked above on p. 5 (figure 3) there is a trace of the evaluation, note how *queue* is defined:

#+begin_example
  queue = tree : explore 1 queue
#+end_example

This might be a little into the deep end for non computer scientist but I found it might be interesting.

Does this mean life is a strange loop? You start out as not existing, then you exist and your age increases for a while, until you go back to not existing. My guess is that it isn't, since you don't have existence to look forward to after you die. In that sense, you're not really back to exactly where you started. Or are you?

** I also found it intriguing that the author connected the idea of paradoxes with the number 0. I hope he goes into more detail later on that. My own thoughts were that if truth and falsehood were compared to positive and negative numbers, then perhaps paradoxes are the 0 in between. It does not seem hard to think of some truths as being 'more true' than others, i.e., containing more true/useful information and/or less false information. And it does seem that paradoxes like 'this statement is false' contain no useful information whatsoever - so they seem rather analogous to 0.

Do you remember how it was shown that there were certain things 'uncomputable' via Principia Mathematica? Perhaps the authors of PM simply left the 'logical 0' out of their system, much like the ancient Greeks left a 0 symbol out of their number system.

I also recall (from a computing theory class I once took) Turing's proof that the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem][Halting Problem]] was undecidable. The proof goes that /if/ we could write a program A that could tell you, given a program B and some input, whether program B would loop forever, then we could also run program A on itself in certain tricky-to-explain ways and make a paradox. I remembered that even once my mind understood the proof, my heart never quite figured out why it mattered or made sense in real world terms. But now I suppose that it was just the 'missing 0' in Turing's computational theory.

Could it be that all we need for paradoxes to make sense, is to remember to include the '0' in our systems?

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing][Alan Turing]] proved in 1936 that a general [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm][algorithm]] to solve the halting problem for /all/ possible program-input pairs cannot exist. A key part of the proof was a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which became known as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine][Turing machine]]; the halting problem is /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem][undecidable]]/ over Turing machines. It is one of the first examples of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem][decision problem]].

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Copeland][Jack Copeland]] (2004) attributes the term /halting problem/ to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Davis][Martin Davis]].

*** I don't think I can do this explanation justice on why the Halting Problem or Godel's Theorem is applicable to the real wold, but to do so, one needs to understand the social context in which Godel thought up his revolutionary idea in 1931.

Before Godel, people thought that every theorem in mathematics and logic would eventually be discovered and that it was possible for any potential knowledge to be proven true or false. When Godel proved that in any sufficiently powerful formal system that there will always be true and false statements which cannot be proven from within the system. This was heart-breakingly devastating to the world at the time. You couldn't trust in the very laws of logic, the science of rational thought itself, to be capable of proving everything. Furthermore, you never could even be absolutely certain that the system was consistent. Godel proved that if a system was inconsistent (holds a contradiction), then it can be proven inconsistent, but you could never prove the system was consistent, or guaranteed to only permit true theorems. Only the fact that mathematics has not been found to be inconsistent for centuries gives weak evidence to its consistency.

The Halting Problem can be viewed as an application of Godel's Theorem to computer science, where given a sufficiently powerful computing machine such as a Turing Machine (a possible isomorphism for a mathematical formal system such as the axioms of number theory) will not be able to compute all possible functions (another isomorphism onto not all theorems are provably true in the mathematical system).

Even though I'm an atheist, I viewed Godel's Theorem as the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. With this knowledge, we have learned not everything is knowable. To be all-knowing is to ultimately fail.

**** I may not be explaining it very well, but my hope is that maybe if we just relaxed our assumption that all things must be True or False, and admitted paradoxes (aka trivialities) into our logical vocabulary, then the whole thing would sort itself out. It may have been devastating to the scientists that thought Principia Mathematica was perfect, when they learned it was lacking, but the proper solution is to accept the missing piece and go from there. Instead of proving a system is consistent, can we at least prove that it's consistent across all meaningful, aka non-paradoxical, aka "non-zero", expressions? As a theist, I posit that we just didn't understand yet what "all-knowing" meant in real terms.

******* I'd say yes, that pdf you find everywhere is so full of typos I couldn't get past half of the first page (I probably could have with an effort, but it's pretty horrible, especially for a non-native speaker).

This version doesn't seem to have any significant typos, only pictures are over-contrasted.

I don't really know what's the problem with .djvu. Standard Ubuntu Document Viewer and some Android PDF reader don't have any problems.

** I only have one qualm with this otherwise engaging book. The quintessential strange loop would seem to be... the spiral. (!) And as strange as these 'loops' may seem in certain contexts, (such as in Escher's well-known optical illusions,) a finite spiral of rules, metarules, etc. is not going to solve the problem of GOFAI, or 'true' AI. The book so far seems to hold a false thesis in that it disputes the innate connection between Life and Intelligence.

"Here one runs up against a seeming paradox. Computers by their very nature are the most inflexible, desireless, rule-following of beasts. Fast though they may be, they are nonetheless the epitome of unconsciousness. How, then, can intelligent behavior be programmed? Isn't this the most blatant of contradictions in terms? One of the major theses of this book is that it is not a contradiction at all."

No doubt that machines may have the intelligence of their author 'imbued' in them in a way, much as the Internet seems to offer 'intelligent' answers to our questions in searches. But it must be remembered that the intelligence of the machine cannot exceed that of its creator(s), for it is a mere echo, a reflection, with electronic banks of data written much like the ink in a book. While echoes may give rise to further echoes, and two mirrors may reflect one another on-and-on, this does nothing to change the nature of echoes and reflections. A self-editing program, however fun and interesting, is still neither living nor self-intelligent.

Why not? Deep Blue played better chess than its creators, Watson is better at Jeopardy than its creators, so they are more intelligent in those narrow domains. Why can't this also apply in a more general case?

**** If you don't believe as I do that Life and Intelligence are innately connected, I can understand why you might reject it as my basic premise.

The specific cases of Deep Blue and Watson can be shown to have less intelligence than that belonging to their creators. I could go into more detail on this, but for now I'll just point out that if a plow is faster at tilling the ground than the bare hands of it's blacksmith would be, it doesn't mean the plow is more intelligent, even if it can be set up to work independently for a while. Chess and Jeopardy turned out to be domains that were well-suited for the kind of sophisticated pattern-matching that computers, as tools, do a good job at.

I do expect to see a continual improvement upon the algorithms and programs that belong to computing, which will naturally render computers more and more capable of assisting in other "intelligence" domains. Watson itself seems to be helping now in clinical decision support for lung cancer. These improvements naturally flow from the progression of the science of computer technology, but they are not hard evidence to the contrary of a Life-Intelligence correlation.
