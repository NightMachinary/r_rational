***** It is weird how uncommon it is to see party optimisation, which is weird since it's such a fundamental part of MMOs. (Though admittedly no MMO will make, say, an ice build unviable for fire dungeons or anything like that).

And I think Delve's success shows there's a big gap in the market for it too.

****** Maybe it is easier to write an uberman stomping everything than good dialogue that would be absolutely necessary on this?

But Delve's success shows nothing of the kind. Isn't this recent development? Did you expect a lot of party optimization going in? Maybe when he got a support build, but this far we have had basically none of that until nosw. It has been people that have been available, and they haven't really told anyone their build.

******* I'd say you could see it as far back as the first time Rain went into a dungeon. You had a tank, two DPS mages, a dedicated support. That already puts it above most litRPG in terms of teamwork.

I remember at the time, when rain was knocked off a bridge, everyone was talking about the inevitable cliche of the MC getting separated and coming back stronger. But nope, it's handled sensibly with Ameliah instantly jumping down to get him.

******** It is teamwork, but did you see any optimization happening? Did they have many choices to choose different classes? Or did they already have a group again and then asked Rain to come too? I checked and it is the second one. They did what they did, haooened to find Rain, and took him with them. They were gonna go anyway. That is not optimization.

Managing a party is not getting into a party as a noob and get carried through the dungeon.

The build he chose did show possibilities, but that is it.

********* You're mistaken. Go back to chapter 28 when Rain, Jamus and Val first start making their plans to raid the lair. Jamus and Rain are both insisting they need a proper tank in the face of Val's typical overconfidence. So they did in fact plan out a party composition despite Rain being over three times the lair's level.

And then of course there's the fact they're bringing a light mage to counter a dark lair. The way the mages adapt their strategy to mana abundance. It's not the level of optimisation Rain is doing with Ascension, but even back there it was clear that bringing a balanced party matters.

********** Oh, they really dragged their feet about going there. I also misremembered that that we were talking about their first dungeon, but this is Rain's third o(or fourth?) already. I thought they were already at the dungeon at that point. Ok, I'll give that they did notice they need a tank after trying to make Rain go first.

That Rain did not want to go in first to die, is not what I'd call "party management". In fact it looks very mismanaged, without any leadership or competence. And they mentioned "preparation" after that, which is funny.

Val, on the other hand, just was there when they mentioned about going to a dungeon, and said his magic would be perfect. That's not optimization.

If you get your party optimization kicks about writer explaining what a "tank" is and noticing that mages are kinda squishy, great. These are supposed to be like professional adventurers? Ofc author needs to tell readers what the terms mean.

I don't mean to bash this story, I like it a lot. But definitely not for the party optimization. :D

*** I think it's mostly the fact that the author is trying to write a more real, fleshed out, slow burner of a story compared to other litrpg's but like... He's just not a good enough writer. The world-building is generic, the entire cast of characters are completely flat and literally everyone speaks in the same voice (you could basically switch around the names of characters in most dialogue at random and no one would notice.), and the main character has one of the most bland and generic personalities I've ever read. Actually I wouldn't even call Rain generic, because that word implies he has traits common to other protagonists. Rain basically has no consistent character traits, he just walks around and acts seemingly at random depending on what the story needs, usually in an eye-rolling, cringey way.

People enjoyed Delve for the cool systems and munchkinry and powers. It was always a slow-burn, but we got to see Rain consistently progress while also getting glimpses of higher power characters in action. But for like...60 chapters now, there's been 0 progression or fresh systems or anything. Just a slow, boring, poorly written story with no signs of improvement.

I decided to drop this series for good when I read a ~20ish chapter batch at once, and at the end of it I looked back and couldn't remember a single moment of enjoyment from reading basically 1/5th of the total story.

**** I disagree with... almost everything in your comment. I think SS is a fine, if unexceptional, writer who is exploring different areas with his story, which is ok and even expected in a serial novel. There's a large cast of side characters who we haven't seen enough of to differentiate, but Rain is nerdy and experimental, Ameliah is calm and competent, Tallheart is grim and terse, Val is impulsive and ambitious, Staavo is inventive and crotchety, Carten is loud and jolly, that swordsman from the last chapter is quiet and dedicated, Velika was rash and bullheaded... that's a solid cast of easily-distinguished characters right there. And then we have the fun and clearly individual side characters of Myth & Reason with their rhyming riddler schtick, Mollo who curses a lot, Dozer who is just adorable, whatever-her-name-is the terrifying Force-magic goldplate, the other whatever-her-name-is the terrifying Mind-magic gold- or platinum-plate...

It seems like you share the opinion of a lot of folks in this sub, which is "Delve stopped being interesting when Rain's numbers stopped going up." Yeah, it's not a story about the protag leveling up anymore, that's become very clear. It's a story about the development of an adventuring company now. Your second-to-last paragraph says "there's been 0... fresh sytems," when we just this chapter got a glimpse of like, 12 new classes, plus the entirely novel mechanic of crafting classes' medium/augment/discipline combinations.

It also seems from your last paragraph that you haven't been reading Delve lately. So can I infer that you just dropped in to shit on the story and air your grievances? I guess that's technically a /valid/ use of the comments section, but it's sure not a /productive/ one.

Especially this, what Rain has is essentially a mockery of democracy anyways, and he brute forces everything he suggests. Might as well just admit that he's the brain and will call the shots right now, as there's nobody else in the group competent and ambitious enough as an alternative. He can change the leadership to a democracy and guide them through that later anyways, having one or two terms to guide the company through the process at the start.

Nobody there even cared about democracy anyways as that world is used to monarchy, so why did Rain even bother with the farce? Now that I think about it, this whole setup feels super contrived and unnecessary.

If he did it later, the system has probably been tested a bit more and people have got more accustomed to it. And he might not be so strong for long. He is a support, after all. And someone could just stab him while he slept. Sharing power a bit makes that less likely too.

6 months later they are still in this camp listing the skills of these 16 new people and theorycrafting. And readers will eat it up because numbers go up.

But it is important for him to get a blue, his support power multiplies big time. But I don't think it is gonna hsppen for a while. I don't think they would be too mad for their protector to get better at protecting them and awakening more of them.

I agree with user Ternal's pirateship comment, and it's not going to be good for a long term Guild, but he'll work on it.

I'm expecting to see pushback from his brand new ideas that go against 'common knowledge' and him getting voted out for some traditionalist charismatic newcomer on the first roadblock type thing he hits. Maybe he makes a big mistake and even wants to not be in charge- but that will change when he sees that the super sure 'leaders' are way worse than his worst.

If you think educating for democracy in theory while actually falling into telling everyone what to do is hypocrisy, I'm not sure you appreciate that letting people under your leadership find their way (while still coordinating with the larger group) is /much harder/ and a totally separate set of skills than either education or basic "go there now" leadership.

** Ok, I'm cancelling my patreon for this fic. Why? I realized I hate Rain. I detest this wacky, zany little fucker, still throwing out nonsensical idioms, expressions, analogies, metaphors and proverbs *months* after traveling to another dimension and while /speaking another fucking language/.

(As an aside, I'm convinced the author is one of those monolingual cretins who can't even fathom what it's like to speak another language. Never even paused to think about it, assumes it's like using Google translate in your brain.)

I've never seen an asshole use so many expressions in common speech before! Imagine Rain going through the trouble to pick out words in another language to form sentences that are tantamount to gibberish to every other person around him. AND WHEN THERE'S NO TRANSLATION HE USES AN ENGLISH WORD, I GUESS??

And for what? So that every other POV character will roll his eyes indulgently and ignore what is in effect an imposition of his rank on his subordinates, because they can't actually call him out? Rains like, "fuck prima noche, I won't fuck your wife on your wedding day, instead I'll exploit our disparity in rank to fuck with your understanding of language as a vehicle for mutually coherent communication."

**** Overmana mostly improves memory, so Rain has a native level vocabulary, but I don't think the text has claimed he would be a native level speaker. Besides, my dad moved across the country 30 years ago and his old dialect still pops up often. It's silly to be angry at Rain for not abandoning a lifetime of idioms in a few months. I don't even think he should. Dialects are fun. Making people hear idioms for the first time is not a horrible act of cruelty.

***** I think part of the problem is that it has been a few months for rain but nearly 2 /years/ for the readers. Because not only does the author write mediocre prose and less than mediocre characterization but he takes years to do it. Like almost makes me want to read exclusively translated light novel inspired smut because at least those guys put out /content/ while writing mediocrely.

****** Yup, I think you made me realize what my actual main problem with this story is.

I've read stuff with worse prose, equally bad characters, more boring worlds, etc etc. But those stories at last feel honest about what they are. I like turning my brain off sometimes and binge-reading fast paced, fun, lower quality stuff. But not even that is possible with Delve because, 1. It isn't a fun story, and 2. The author only puts out a few thousand words per week, and half of those words are the same repetitive number crunching we've seen from the start.

The author of the Wandering Inn for example puts out 40k-50k+ words per week consistently, at much higher quality while always being a fun read. Delve puts out what...like 10% of that? So the story is not only poorly written and extremely slow, the content releases are so tiny that I can't even read it as a guilty pleasure.

******* I would be fine with the number crunching if we actually got a lot of information about the system. Like I could look at a bunch of classes and think about what I would do with that system. Half of all time spent on real RPGs is in character creation after all. But we actually /don't/ get a lot of information.

And yeah the key issue with Delve is the time it takes to put out what is essentially a tiny amount of overall content. I think of it from a Patreon angle personally. Like perhaps the story has an end date and the author doesn't have anything else in the pipe for Patreon so they have to string out the existing story over as long a time as possible to keep that sweet, sweet 4k$ a month coming in.

There's nothing in the story that is so difficult to write well, especially since the author is not a great writer, that justifies the pace of the release.

*** To some extent people try to translate idioms word for word (i used to do this myself), but that's mostly a thing with very new speakers who just don't know any of the new expressions and are translating word for word mentally anyway. Rain is supposed to be at the level of native speaker, much beyond that.

I don't even understand why the author bothered to have a separate language in the first place. Just have everyone in the new universe speak English, it's not any weirder than it being full of humans.

From an in-universe perspective, since he kinda cheated at learning the language it makes some sense he keeps adding English to it. But out-of-universe it really is annoying at this point.

As far as I know, nobody is claiming that Delve is better than Worth The Candle or Worm/Twig/Pale. Nor is anybody claiming that RoyalRoad rankings calculate quality. I would summarize much of this thread as "Delve may not be good, but it's an amateur's work" - "Delve is overrated and should be held to the standard of other Webfiction" - "Delve isn't really making that much money" - and now what I've contributed "Delve is making a lot of money compared to high quality web fiction".

My synthesis: Delve is making significantly more than it "should" as a measure of its quality, and criticizing it's quality along those lines is not unfair.

I will agree that you can explain the mechanism's by looking at its position on Royalroad etc., but excusing the quality by "you get what you paid for" fails badly.

Lackey is still "good" even if someone else is great. Personally don't like NKJ and also her genre isn't really the same as Lackey. Delve is liked literally only because there are so few crunchy litrpgs with good systems. Delve is not good. But people are starved for options of that particular story type. Also a lot of people got hooked on the early section which was quite different from the arcs people hate.

To borrow some jargon from Sanderson, Lackey and Jemisin both deliver on their promises. Regardless of if which one you like. Delve is/was not delivering on its promises. It is bad because of that. The reason it still has a big following is that people want what it promised and can't get it in many other places. Conversely you can pretty easily get high quality stories that have the same promises as Lackey if you don't like her.
