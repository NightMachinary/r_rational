** I call attention to the point that this series has lovely titles. Why aren't more titles that good? It's literally the first thing a reader encounters.

*** I am delighted that you like my titles; I feel like I should disclaim that I stole all of them from the lyrics of a Mercedes Lackey filk song.

**** I am also a big fan of the titles, they always put me in mind of this song by Michl 'When you love me least' (the chorus is 'I loved you most when you loved me least')

*** They are lovely titles but not attention grabbing ones. I appreciate them as someone who already likes the series, but if no one recommended the series I don't think I'd click on the title in some random list.

** Note that this is part 7 of a really long existing series; they are best read in order, and this one in particular won't make any sense as a standalone.
