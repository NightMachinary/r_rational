I've been thinking of doing some superhero original fiction as soon as my current writing queue clears out. One idea I had related to teleportation and how it could be abused. Let's call the character Al. Here are the rules of Al's power:

- There is no range limit on his teleportation.
- In order to teleport somewhere he needs to have a very clear picture of it in his mind. This means either he can see it directly, he is currently looking at a detailed picture of it, or he is extremely familiar with it from spending a lot of time there.
- In order to teleport somewhere, he must know roughly what direction it is. If he's lost his sense of direction (e.g. underwater, in a dark room, etc) he can't just teleport out.
- Whatever he's carrying when he teleports goes with him. I need a more specific definition of "carrying" here, but the basics are intuitive: he can take it with him if he is lifting it, if it's inside something he is lifting, or if it's on top of something he is lifting.\\
- He swaps places with an area at the far end, so there is always room for him when he arrives, but he will be unable to move if he teleports into a solid object. Losing his sense of direction at this point Would Be Bad.
- Because he swaps places with his destination, the space that he and his carried stuff occupied is now occupied by the air / water / rock / whatever that was previously at his destination. If he were to teleport into rock, lava, a roomful of chlorine gas, the blastfront of an explosion, outer space, etc, then the effects of those environments would be felt at his source. (Of course, he wouldn't survive any of those environments without appropriate gear, but that's not relevant.)
- He is shifted into the momentum frame of his destination, so if he teleports from the pole to the equator he isn't mashed into a wall by the change in the earth's rotation.
- When he arrives, his facing will be the same as it was at the source point. (So, if he was facing east and he teleported to the south, he would still be facing east.)
- He cannot take part of an object with him when he teleports.
- If he's touching it / gripping it he needs to bring it with him. In other words, he can't teleport out of handcuffs or if he's chained to a big lump of granite.\\

Yes, he can teleport straight up, to the moon, to Mars, to exoplanets given a sufficiently detailed image, etc.

If you woke up with this power tomorrow, what could you do with it? Mostly the idea here is to help me figure out where the fuzzy edges of the rules are so that I can define them more clearly.

EDIT:

- He cannot bring part of an object with him, but he can switch himself with a part of an object. In other words, it's possible for him to teleport into a wall without instantly dying -- there will just be a him-shaped chunk of concrete back at his source point.

The "needs to bring it with him" needs more refinement, because I'm fuzzy on what it means. Obviously he's touching the ground, so he needs to be able to leave that behind. He's touching the air, but he doesn't bring that. He /does/ bring his clothing. I'm not clear on whether something that's touching his clothing would have to come too.

In particular, I need better refinement on how this would interact with the "he can switch places with part of a solid object." I think this would mean that if he teleports (part of) his body into a solid object then he can't teleport out unless he can chip the material away manually.

And no, this will not be Jumper fanfic. :> (Hadn't actually thought about that movie until I wrote the previous sentence.)


** There are several jumper books that explore these ideas. Spoilers below.

...

A jumper learned how to turn the jump power "On" and keep it stuck like that, so he existed in two places at the same time. This was used to flood stuff with water, as well as drain all the air out of a sealed room. Later, a jumper learned to fly. The jumper was always familiar with their current location, so they jumped to exactly where they already where, but with a new velocity vector. This trick was also used to punch really hard.

*** Grr. I got all the way through thinking about this, got to that last sentence, and then realized that pretty much this exact thing had already been done. I didn't realize that there were books of it too -- the movie didn't explore the ability that much so I figured there were lots of bits to find. Sounds like there's less than I'd thought.

**** One book was about the jumper building a spacesuit and traveling to outerspace. That's the jumper that could create velocity. She put on her suit, flew up, and did cool things. Very good book. Lots of hard science. By the end of that book, I felt like I could build my own spacesuit. I highly recommend it. In fact, I recommend the whole jumper series, especially if you are going to approach a similar idea.

It follows almost all of the rules that you outlined above, and the author does a good job of thinking out the consequences of these rules, and extrapolating on them.

**** Alright, I'll try to keep this fairly brief.

*Book 1: Jumper*

- David discovers that he can teleport to places that he's familiar with.
- He uses this power to run away from home (where he lives with his alcoholic father).
- He steals a lot of money from bank vaults (which he only needs to really see the inside of).
- He starts "acquiring" jump sites by going to them and solidifying his memory of the place, along with taking lots of photographs and video for reference.
- He saves a bunch of people in hostage situations (terrorists on the tarmac - much more relevant in 1992).
- The NSA get wind of him, mostly through his carelessness, and try to capture him by using the people close to him.
- He realizes that he's always "resting" with respect to the reference frame of the ground following a jump, so he practices jumping away from a fall.
- He practices a technique for lifting people up to jump them - usually going behind them, getting them off balance, lifting, and then jumping them.
- He dumps a bunch of people in a lake in the middle of nowhere, effectively keeping them imprisoned (they deserved it).
- He acquires a bunch of jump sites at emergency rooms, and then trains for jumping there reflexively when something bad happens.
- He buys a cylinder of bulletproof glass and puts handle on the inside - this allows him to jump into a room with hostiles and makes them unable to shoot him even when they've got guns drawn.

*Book 2: Reflex*

- A shadowy organization drugs him during a meeting with his NSA handler, and sedates him. They get him into surgery and put a clamp on his vagus nerve that will activate if it doesn't receive two overlapping radio signals. If he goes outside the overlap zone (say, by jumping) he gets put in an incredible amount of pain, starts vomiting, and will die quickly. I thought this was a pretty clever way of turning a teleporting man into a tool. They can control where he can and can't teleport to.
- He develops "twinning" where he teleports to a place and then teleports right back where he was, as a way to get around the limits of the implant.
- Unlike with your rules, he takes some of the surrounding air with him. This lets him use twinning to flood an office building by setting his other location as in the water.
- The shadowy organization tries to capture his wife (teleportation is either contagious or learnable with enough trips) by finding a room that she frequently jumps to, and making it airtight then filling it with noxious gas so that when she jumps in, she'll inhale it and fall unconscious right away.
- The shadowy organization develops a jumper detector - it's basically a modified gravitational-wave detector that looks for a sudden change in gravity caused by someone popping into existence.

*Book 3: Impulse*

- Ten years later, they're using their powers for good - doing a lot of humanitarian stuff, occasional work for the government (extractions mostly), trying to track down what's left of the shadowy organization, etc.
- Realizing that they are always stationary with respect to their reference frame following a jump, their daughter tries changing her reference frame, and after some trials and tribulations, is able to add arbitrary amounts of velocity while standing still - letting her jump straight up in the air at 20kmph, or letting her throw a very hard punch.

*Book 4: Exo*

- Their daughter develops a one-person space agency. He goes into a ton of detail on this, which I really appreciated - acquiring a space suit, adjusting for air pressure differences, communication with the ground, etc. They deorbit space junk and put microsats into orbit, then eventually build a space colony. The book ends with Cent becoming the first woman on Mars.
- Twinning is used with low-Earth orbit to create a hard vacuum in a room full of enemies.

(I believe that most of this is accurate, but I might have gotten a few things wrong - for the most part, its a very well researched series.)

** Yeah "carry" needs some hard rules.

How much can he carry? Does he need to be fully supporting it or can he be using, say, a wheelbarrow? How about a weight too heavy to heft, or merely too awkward to balance, for more than a few moments before dropping it? For example, he's holding somebody's hand and they jump into the air.

What if that person is holding somebody else's hand?

The "momentum frame" bit needs some work as well. If he teleports into a car traveling on the highway, exchanging part of himself with the parts of the car that his standing form has replaced, one would hope he isn't immediately bi or trisected by the remainder.

Alternately, what if he happens to teleport into the edge of a baseball bat just as it's swinging to hit a home run. Does he match momentum with the bat or with the ground? Neither is going to be ideal, but think hard about /why/ either one happens and you'll have a clearer idea of how the ability works.

*** Bringing things with him:

It might make sense to reduce this to: whatever solid objects he's touching goes with him, along with all solid objects that /they/ are touching, and so on. So, his socks go because he's touching them, his shoes go because they're touching his socks, and his shoelaces go because they're touching the shoes. Non-solid objects can be cleanly delineated, so he has the option to leave them behind -- basically, when he teleported the molecules that were actually touching him would go with but none of the others.

This would mean that he needs to hop up so he's not touching the ground when he goes. It would also mean that if he's holding onto a rope which is tied to the wall he can't teleport without letting go first.

--------------

Carrying:

He definitely needs to be fully supporting it, although he doesn't need to be able to do more than heft it up. Holding someone's hand while they jump doesn't count as supporting them -- they aren't supported at all.

Although. Hm. Perhaps it makes more sense to remove the weight limit and just go with the "all solid objects he's touching"? No, then he could teleport with an entire airplane and that's more OP than I want to go.

--------------

Momentum frame:

I figure that his subconscious is really in the driver's seat here -- he doesn't consciously understand the process of teleporting and when he arrives somewhere he doesn't consciously choose which parts of the new area to send back to his source.

Given that, I think he'd match whatever reference frame his subconscious decided was the "right" one. On a planet it would almost certainly be the frame of the ground. Teleporting into free space with no visual references (or while blindfolded), he'd keep the reference frame he came from...with possibly hilarious / fatal results. In the case of the baseball bat: when he teleported in the tip of it would be sent back to his origin. It would keep swinging, so he would be hit by the part that hadn't been teleported out.

Also, teleporting around water would be interesting. Imagine that he's holding some water cupped in his hand; assuming his subconscious is driving, he could bring the water with him if he wanted or leave it behind if not. Liikewise, if he's underwater he can teleport without having to bring all the water with him because he subconscious recognizes his intent.

Of course, this opens up a new can of worms about how hypnosis and other control-the-subconscious techniques work on him.

**** If he himself needs to be fully supporting an object, his shoes wouldn't teleport with.

So if he's wearing a single piece of clothing, which extends into a tarp, and on top of the tarp are objects, what would happen?

A) The tarp is transported, the objects aren't, despite being fully supported by the tarp.

B) The tarp tears, despite being a single object.

C) The tarp stays behind, despite being clothing that is worn. The teleporter arrives naked.

D) Both the tarp and the objects teleport along. Transportation of arbitrary amounts of mass achievable, as long as a tarp can be placed under it.

edit: assuming this fails, what if you're "wearing" a zeppelin with cargo, such that it is just barely not neutrally buoyant, and held aloft by your own legs? If only part of the zeppelin's mass is "carried" by you, what procedure is used to determine it?

** First off, definitely read the Jumper series. Some my favorite novels and nothing at all like the movie. The character puts a lot of thought into doing things safely and right the first time to avoid problems like teleporting into solid objects. Given what's been spoiled so far, you might think there's not much untrodden ground, but that's what I thought about my knowledge of D&D munchkinry before 2YE came along and you've proven me wrong in the most entertaining possible way.

Re: a specific definition of "carrying". When the force he applies to an object counteracts (or for purposes of teleporting out of, say, deep space, would counteract at his destination) the force due to gravity, however briefly, I think he can be said to be carrying it. That stops him from loading a shopping cart full of stuff and popping away, unless he can lift the cart and its contents for long enough to teleport and also stops him from getting away if he is, for example, chained to a wall (since he may be applying force to part of the chain but the rest is held up by the wall which is a solid object too large for him to lift). Unless he can maneuver himself in such a way as to not touch the chain at all like maybe letting it hang at its lowest point and then teleporting out of it. It seems like a reasonable power limit while still having potential to end up broken (used in combination with the reference frame momentum trick, maybe).

Edit: also, the ground: if his subconscious is already handling the destination reference frame issues, why not let it handle the ground interface issue too? He has a body image of himself as X cm tall, and that's as far as the effect reaches (just never ever wear platform shoes). Jumper handled it by having an area of his surroundings a couple of nanometers thick come along for the ride, which would be mostly air but also a small amount of whatever he was standing on.

** With regards to what the teleporter can take with them, one could use the following rules to make it more well defined as opposed to intuitive. The more I thought about this, the rules I had to add, but I can't see anything obviously broken at the moment.

1) The teleportation works on whole, entire objects. Either an object is teleported with you or it is not. Liquids and gasses are considered to be collections of an innumerable number of teeny tiny particles.

2) The item must either be in contact with skin, or in contact with another solid item of adequate size that is itself teleporting.

If 'solid item' is too vague, we could define it more explicitly as a continuous object requiring a certain amount of force to break at any point. A very thin rope with a weak spot might then be counted as two ropes.

Similarly, two discrete, touching objects would be considered the same object if it took more than a certain amount of force to separate them. **

The adequate size rule above has two purposes. Items must be of sufficiently small size rules to stop everything in the same building / on the same planet from being teleported as well. Although rule 3 actually makes this redundant.

Items must be of sufficiently large size, to stop all gas / liquid / sand particles close to you from forcefully being teleported as well. This is important.*

*This doesn't stop really small items from being teleported. Sand/liquid/gas in contact with you or with another large item would be teleported. But Gas particles that are only touching other gas particles being teleported, wont be teleported. So you don't take a whole room full of air with you.

3) Objects that extend more than a certain distance away from the skin / centre of mass of the teleporter are not taken. Meaning that only solid objects that exist entirely within a certain volume (possibly a sphere) relative to the teleporter are displaced.

4) Any substance contained entirely within a container being teleported, is teleported as well. A container could be defined as a closed continuous surface not allowing particles of a certain size to pass through. This allows liquids and gases in containers to be teleported. Any solids of sufficient size in a container would have been teleported anyway as a consequence of the first three rules.

These rules should work if the teleporter has no control over their teleportation. The 'carrying' rule seems to arbitrary to make rigorous. The above rules should let you take another person if they are touching you and sufficiently close.

** This rule has the consequence that heavy items touching the ground wont be taken, as they are touching the ground and the force between them causes the item and the ground to be considered as the same object. If they can be lifted for just a moment (and all other rules are satisified) it would be possible to take them.

If we let the teleporter choose what to take, we can relax some of the above rules and just let the teleporter what to take. Although this may affect the efficiency of the teleporter, if they are consciously having to think about everything they want to take in order to avoid being naked at their destination.

*** I like this, these are good rules. I just lost a bunch of would-have-been-productive time looking up examples of tensile strengths, masses, sizes, etc. Thanks for that! :P

It occurs to me that a simpler ruleset would be "everything within one foot of his skin goes with him". Under this ruleset it would be hard to UNweaponize his ability; he'd be cutting chunks out of walls, floors, people, etc whenever he teleported. Combine that with an instinctive teleport whenever startled or frightened and you've got some real potential for disaster in this guy's life.

Killing him would be straightforward: handgun will do the job just fine if you take him by surprise.

Capturing him would be tricky -- hand-to-hand with him would be instantly fatal for the attacker, so you'd need to get him at range with a taser, tranq gun, etc. He can't teleport out of handcuffs, but he /can/ teleport out of any cell. You'd need to either keep him unconscious or do something like was mentioned below -- put an explosive collar on him that goes off if it stops receiving a radio signal. Alternatively, manacle him to a wall; he can teleport out, but he'll bring the manacles and a chunk of wall with him, so he's still trapped on the far end. Strap a sufficiently powerful locator beacon to him and you could pick him up again.

**** Thanks. My idea was to make rules that didn't depend on human intuition.

Teleporting everything within 1 foot could work. The most important rule imo is establishing an upper bound on volume teleported. Otherwise, as mentioned above, you could be moving entire vehicles or arbitrarily long lines of jumping humans. Beyond that is pretty much up to you.

The 1-foot rule does prevent teleporting in crowded places if the guy cares about other people. Or within 1 foot of large valuable items if he cares about collateral damage. It would also mean a bomb strapped to the body would stay strapped on. In any case, the simplicity of such a rule is good.

It occurs to me that, going by the theoretical rules I outlined above and assuming 'the teleporter can always teleport their own naked body no matter what', they would not be able to teleport out of handcuffs UNLESS those handcuffs were bolted to a wall or floor or some other item not possible to teleport.

Yes. I was actually thinking that exact thing when I wrote the bit about switching mass, but I figured I'd leave it out so as not to bias people's thoughts in one particular direction.

The smallest time that he can perceive -- less than the blink of an eye. Basically, the speed of thought.

#+begin_quote
  Could he teleport somewhere holding a grenade, then teleport back before it explodes?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Could he teleport into the sun for a nanosecond, and teleport back out, leaving a large chunk of plasma at his original location?
#+end_quote

Yes, assuming that he can accurately target the sun somehow.

#+begin_quote
  Also, how can he teleport into a solid object if he has to picture his destination? It's pretty difficult to picture the inside of a block of granite.
#+end_quote

I'm figuring it as "he can visualize the area around it and then project himself within that image." So if he can teleport to, say, a particular room then it's very easy to extend that visualization to "in this room, but inside /this/ chunk of wall here". He couldn't teleport just "down 1,000 feet" because he can't visualize that at all.

Feh. Ok, teleporting such that his head lands inside a solid object is apparently fatal. He could teleport such that the rest of him is in an object, though, in order to switch with part of its mass.

Just to make sure we're on the same page -- I'm assuming that he pulls the pin, teleports, drops the grenade, teleports out, the grenade goes off a couple seconds later when its fuse burns down. He wouldn't be fast enough to teleport between the moment that the grenade exploded and the moment that the blast front hit him, if that's what you're asking.

A human-sized chunk of neutronium weighs 10^{15} to 10^{17} kg (1 to 100 times the mass of Mt. Everest).

Earth is 6 * 10^{24} kg, i.e. 7.5 to 9.5 orders of magnitude heavier.

While the crater would certainly be pretty big, Earth would still be Earth.

Plus, the neutronium would be arriving without any significant momentum (which is what makes asteroids so deadly), so the damage might not even be that big. I'd imaging the effect would be roughly similar to flipping Mt. Everest, i.e. you'd get a big ol' hole in the ground and not much else.

I assumed it would be solid or fluid, but stable, i.e. wouldn't immediately explode, in which case you'd get a /really/ deep hole, which doesn't /necessarily/ create a volcano (I think).

If it /does/ immediately explode, it would probably expand into something at /least/ as dense as air, which'd take up at most as much volume as earth's atmosphere*.

If so, this offers extremely cheap space exploration: I don a space suit, teleport to the moon, look at a particular nebula, spend a handful of jumps getting close to that nebula, gather telemetry with my space suit, and teleport back.

You found an exoplanet? With a good image of the region, I can teleport to some spot nearby, then hop successively closer with relative jumps. If I see a place that's sufficiently Earthlike, I can investigate it further, even land. The moment I detect danger, I'm back home in a decontamination tank.

You want to set up a space station? Lift in in a helium balloon ten inches off the floor and I can teleport it to orbit. Or if that's cheating, I can at least heft 80kg chunks into space, and I can go up there with minimal preparation and cost to assemble these chunks.

I think the momentum frame would need to be defined in relation to the center of mass of the object. So, if you are falling 100 m/s and you teleport to the opposite side of the earth, you're still falling 100 m/s second and you're still falling towards the center of the earth; it's just that your velocity vector has been flipped.

Or from interstellar space -- there, it's not even a matter of safety. What are you measuring my momentum relative to, if I manage to get to the barycenter of the Milky Way and Andromeda?

For the teleporting to distant galaxies problem, it seems like you're saying I need to be able to distinguish features of a particular size to go there. I can't look at the moon and teleport there because the features I can distinguish are leagues across. I can teleport across a valley because I can distinguish features that are under a meter across. But this would place a dependency on eyesight.

Blind people can't teleport. I would be hard pressed to teleport a city block without glasses unless I'd been there before. (And it seems like you want to rule out technological assistance for this part, so eyeglasses don't let me teleport further than I could without. Or telescopes would help, at least within a few light seconds.)

Also, what about teleporting onto moving objects? If I am sufficiently familiar with the QE2's main deck, can I teleport there even if the ship is on the move? Obvious momentum considerations aside.

What about different locations that look identical?

What if I know a place very well but don't know where it is? I was drunk and wandered into the middle of a desert, had an hour of lucidity and memorized a place, passed out, woke up in a hospital... Can I teleport back?

Counterintuitively, a uniform gravitational field does not by itself cause stress or strain, and a body in free fall in such an environment experiences no [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force][g-force]] acceleration and feels weightless.

** Reference frame hacking. He's falling towards the ground for some reason - can he teleport directly to the ground without plowing into it at the same speed?

If not, can he teleport to the /exact opposite location on the planet/ while maintaining a reference frame with respect to, say, the Sun, so that he's now traveling upwards instead of downwards? And when he slows to a stop, can he now teleport safely to the ground?

If his reference frame is always going to be with respect to the nearest gravitational sink, that's going to be problematic. If he falls from somewhere and reaches terminal velocity, he can keep teleporting back up into the air, but will presumably eventually succumb to fatigue unless he can find somewhere like a giant airbag to appear above.

Hacks from density-changing power exploits:\\
- being able to cut through any form of normal matter by teleporting a hand or finger into the matter, then teleporting back out again, leaving a crudely gouged hole. He could make neater cuts by picking up a knife or a chopstick and teleporting only that part of "things he's carrying" into the target. If he can control exactly what comes with him during teleports, he can disintegrate chains, handcuffs etc.\\
- being able to place items inside or the other side of things (like containers or walls) by tying them to a thin string, swinging the string until it's horizontal, and then teleporting himself, the string, and the item so that the string penetrates the container/wall and the item winds up embedded or on the other side, with only the smallest hole in the penetrated surface to give it away. Maybe use fishing line?\\
- should he take to wearing a face-mask with an oxygen supply? It'd handle the problem with destination material getting into his lungs, provide a few minutes of air while he reoriented, and it could have a built-in mini-gyroscope in his field of view which always showed which way was 'up'. Escape any embedding by teleporting a mile up, then looking for the ground and immediately teleporting back to it. Might want to start wearing shoes/boots with shock absorbers, or an airbag suit, or something which could minimize the impact of short falls. Or just have a permanent set of emergency-services giant airbags (the kind used for jumpers) set up in a cave somewhere. Or take to wearing an emergency small parachute all the time.

(On a side note, if the material of the destination fills his lungs if he has his mouth open, does he have to block his nostrils as well?)

Wealth hacking. What's the value of genuine moonrock to specialist collectors? What are people currently paying to put micro- and nano-satellites into orbit? Would the character be interested in smuggling? How about delivering "diplomatic parcels" to embassies?

How stealthy is the character? Could they track people while staying out of sight on rooftops or other locations? If he didn't want to empty out bank vaults to make some cash, would he consider tracking drug dealers to their sources, tracking those sources to /their/ sources, and eventually seeing if they could wind up looking at somewhere with a stupidly large amount of physical cash stored on the premises? Which leads to the question of how much of a pallet of cash could he grab with a jump-in, jump-out maneuver? Especially if he seeded the area with smoke grenades first and then did multiple jumps? What if he wore a sumo suit and just teleported into the cash pile from his storage location? (Sure, a lot of cash would be chopped up, but the raw volume should bring a lot of it back. And doing it again on a two-second delay would allow the cash which had been surrounding him on the first appearance to fall into the hole he'd made, making it a target for the second trip.)

Come to think of it, I'm really liking the airbag-suit/sumo-suit thing. Automatically increase his 'displace' volume /and/ handle short falls!

**** They seem to still fetch a fair price. You'd be unlikely to get anything near full retail value, but that's not a problem if you have a significant supply on hand. Also, higher weight category diamonds fetch higher prices. You'd want to keep them small enough to avoid attention, is all.

** The ability to teleport objects you are holding, combined with the fact that whatever is there at the destination changes places with it, seems pretty exploitable.

You could hold extremely lightweight objects and teleport next to big heavy objects to move or cut through them. It could be used to tunnel your way through a mountain (just need a piece of styrofoam long and light enough).

If "carrying" applies to buoyant, inflated objects, one could conceivably use a helium balloon inflated in the desired shape and just barely heavier than air, to displace arbitrarily large structures -- entire mountains, perhaps -- lifting their rocky mass to extreme heights, etc.

*** Teleporting while holding onto a piece of diamond might be a way to fuse two or more of them together. Big gems fetch disproportionately higher prices relative to small ones, and diamond dust is actually cheap, so you could make money this way even just using diamonds from earth.

By using a glass replica of an exquisitely cut gem, you could turn raw uncut diamond into finished gems directly. Rest the replica on your hand and teleport to holding your hand directly under the bulk. (The diamond section ends up at the other location and the glass ends to buried in the raw diamond.)

You could also make some 'stamp' three dimensional shapes out by teleporting in plastic models from a 3D printer. So you could make durable, tough customized components for your workshop, and maybe even a good suit of armor. (In addition to the protection, picking stuff up with powered armor might be a way to increase teleport limits.)

** His potential as an assassin or saboteur is pretty damn extreme with the current power description. Here's a very low tech example.

Put on a protective suit. Fill a creatively-designed (so you can study it and teleport back to it) storage tank to neck-height with diesel fuel, and feed non-oxygen gasses into it. Use a drone or live video to teleport to a site. Inflate a very large airbag, drop a lit thermite charge, and then teleport back into the diesel-filled room, holding the airbag below neck level. You then exit the tank out the ladder.

Even if you carry sparks back with you, there will be no oxygen in the diesel tank to ignite, but a couple cubic yards of diesel fuel will appear at the point where you teleported out, right on top of the magnesium flare you lit.

** I think the mechanic would work better if instead of teleportation, it was the ability to switch position and momentum. Some of the rules you have are really ad hoc and not well defined as is(Like the entire handcuffs thing. If he can teleport without bringing the aor around him with him or just the air tpuchinf his skin, he'd be able to teleport away by just teleporting a thin slice of metal with him) and feel really janky. If instead he could could switch objects' position amd momentum with himself the rules would bw a lot more simple and elegant. You could restrict the amount of material he'd be able to transfer my some sort of muscle-like mechanism, that would gradually become more powerful as the story progressed, or just leave it to his own body mass(which could be exploited by becoming so fat he'd need the equivalent of a baby elephant to swap with every time which would cause a small boom any time he appeared). If you actually want to write a rationalist story and aren't afraid of newtonian physics, that would probably be the easiest way, because right now your system is so piecemeal it can't be explored or exploited properly.

**** It's the difference between switching the molecules at one location with molecules of equivalent mass at a second location, and suddenly causing molecules at one location to not exist and then exist at a second location. In the second version, at the first site you would immediately notice a drop in pressure because several mols of molecules all of a sudden left the vicinity. I'm not sure how much force it would generate, but the acceleration or jerk would probably be on the order of a punch or kick pulling matter in the area in(likely a lot larger, I haven't done the math). At the site of reappearance, it would then produce an equivalent amount of acceleration/jerk. In addition, the person would suddenly have about 80 grams of atmosphere through their body. We're mostly empty space, so initially the molecules would all fit. Unfortunately, the rapid collisions would push the molecules apart pretty rapidly. 80 grams doesn't seem like a lot, but when you have about 6 grams of oxygen in your brain trying to escape as fast as possible, death would probably be the best thing you can hope for. In the first version, you avoid all of these complications, because you can switch the momentum and position of all the molecules in the relevant area. It'd be easiest if you could have a direct mass to mass exchange because then the velocity wouldn't change, but since momentums are exchanged it would work almost exactly like an elastic collision so you can easily calculate it. This has the added benefit of being able to switch with lower or higher mass objects, the person would just be going as much faster or slower as mass was lost or gained(the exact equation is M1/V1i + M2/V2i = M1/V2f + M2/V2f, where M1i is object 1's mass, V2i is object 2's initial velocity, and V1f is object 1's final velocity). Basocally, if he changes position with a cliff, he'd suddenly be moving at an insane speed. This is the best system in my opinion, because it at least conserves energy, and has enough complexity that the main character will have to experiment a lot to understand.

****** Oh, I must have misunderstood. I interpreted the entire sixth bullet point way wrong, because I thought that you were just switching volume, without any respect to the energy of the system he was switching with.

I think it came from "momentum frame", which I mistook for just meaning velocity without any respect for mass because of the entire warp into space thing. I think I read into that that it was just gonna be positional wish fulfillment because there wouldn't be anything to switch with other than radiation and incredibly tiny dust molecules that would completely retard the speed he would be going at. In addition, the entire "Teleporting into a solid object is apparently a Really Bad Idea" made it seem as though he wouldn't be replacing the concrete with the oxygen in his blood and lungs.

Within the constraints of those rules though, I think the best thing he could do is to rapidly redefine how his subconscious defines self, because if he subscribes to the cosmic view that he is deity and is therefore omnipresent, he could functionally teleport anything anywhere. He wouldn't even be really wrong or irrational in believing that, because if the only delineation between what he can and can't manipulate is what he believes he can or can't manipulate, he is deity.

I have a block of cheese. I want to teleport half the block of cheese to a destination. I put my hand on top of the block of cheese. I teleport to the destination. I lower my hand slightly. I teleport back. Roughly half the cheese overlaps with my hand on my arrival and is sent to the original destination like I intended.

You haven't actually stopped me from portal cutting things I want to take with me, you've just delayed me by a jump and perhaps some setup time to find an appropriately sized/shaped object to cut with. I can murder anyone by holding out my fist, teleporting at them, and arriving with my hand in their chest, and chunks of their sternum and heart on the floor behind me.

Furthermore, portal cutting severs chemical and physical bonds which contain potential energy. Depending on how fine you grain it, I might also be severing nuclear, chromodynamic, or even mass-equivalency bonds when the edge of my portal blade slices off part of a particle's amplitude in phase space. I might cause /tacnuke explosions/ around me on arrival, or behind me.

  Whatever he's carrying when he teleports goes with him. I need a more specific definition of "carrying" here, but the basics are intuitive: he can take it with him if he is lifting it, if it's inside something he is lifting, or if it's on top of something he is lifting.
#+end_quote

I know you still haven't decided on a precise definition for "carrying", but: this reminds me of a scene in /The Long Earth/, which has a similar rule. Specifically, it reminded me of the scene where (extremely minor spoiler alert) the protagonist teleports while "carrying" an airship on the end of a rope, and it works.

The simplest way to do this would be to have air act as a sort of "teleport-insulator", but that would either require you to jump every time you teleport (heck, why not?) or to be able to leave bindings behind. Or, maybe, to only leave behind things that are below you?

** Possibly tie in "what he's carrying" to some level of what he psychologically believes he's carrying? I'm assuming he makes a mental decision to teleport and then it happens, so maybe those kind of barriers would help (and he has to be directly touching it? The thing about carrying things in general is how do you define where an object ends? A rope isn't homogeneous, so how would 'the universe' know where the rope ends and say a tied string begins, especially as there could be air molecules, bacteria, etc. intertwined. Let alone how you define it's boundary with another object at a microscopic level).

Uhh you say he faces the same way as the source point, but you need to define a reference frame for that (can be a secret/ties into his eventual source of power). Facing south doesn't make sense if he teleports into space, unless he literally always is aligned based on his position and direction on Earth.

"Sense of direction" is loosely defined. As in knowing which way is the Sun/the magnetic North/South? If it's something like this it'd be worth always carrying a compass etc.
