** I want to make experiments on mana now :

*Serie I of Experiences: Do mana have mass?*

/Experience 1a:/

Does mana have weight?Two box identical, one with mana, the other without. Is there a difference of weight?

/Experience 1b:/

If mana has mass, what the law of mass concentration like? If a mage sense “two time the mana” in the box, is it equivalent to 2 time the mass? Are “a lot of mana” equivalent to “a lot of mass of mana”? Draw the curve: “mass concentration” vs “mana quantity” (we need a way to measure what mana “power” is : a magical tool which stop working at a precise amount for instance) Result: with the curve “weight” vs “mana power/quantity/whatever/” we can measure simply the mana of a region with a simple balance between a box without mana and one with local mana. The curve give then a coefficient between the two values.

/Experience 1C:/

If no weight can be detected, try to detect inertia: send a high velocity bullet against the two box. Do they have the same momentum after? if no, mana have intertia. Repeat 1b to have the curve “inertia” against mana quantity. If no weight but inertia is detected, mana is not affected by gravitational force but have a mass (which sound really weird) If the weight and inertia is detected, this is an important step to demonstrate that mana is made of normal matter. Is weight and inertia are not detected, mana has no mass.

*Serie II of Experiences: What are the constituent of mana?*

/Experience 2a:/

Try to find a way to “destroy” a magical object with too much mana. can we “enchant” a gas inside a lightbulb? When we put too much mana inside the lightbulb, what is the spectrum? the same that the gas of the lightbulb or other element are appearing? If the elements in the spectrum correspond to element not in the gas, we have discovered some constituent of mana. If not but we observe some spectral characteristic, with a few quantum mechanics formula and theory, we can learn a lot about what is mana. If there is no special signal with mana, I don't know... try to find a signal in ultraviolet? in infrared?

/Experience 2b:/

Are there a way to destroy mana? is yes, can we destroy mana in a box where there is a vacuum? What happen then? are there any deposition on the box? like carbon trace. Is there any gas inside the box? Are the deposition/gas a known material or a new material? what are their properties? If mana has mass, do the mass change? Can we have a conservation law of mass with mana?

*Serie III of Experiences: What are the thermodynamics properties of mana?*

/Experience 3a:/

Does mana have temperature?

/Experience 3b:/

Does mana have a pressure? Probably not if it can pass inside solid. But artificial zones without mana exist so the frontier can create a separation. A pressure can be exerted against this “frontier” ? This pressure change in function of the local density of mana ?

/Experience 3C :/

Can we heat mana if we compress it? Is mana really like a gas? Are mana respect the law of thermodynamics? /Experience 3D :/

If mana can be made colder (with decompression for instance), does mana have different phase? liquid mana ? solid mana ? plasma mana ? other form ? can the mana be used in this form ? do they traverse solid/liquid/gas in the same way ? If heated too much, do me have a decomposition in different elements? (if mana are nanorobots, heat them and you will have the constituent of the nanorobot for instance)

After all of these experience, and a lot of work on the theory, I think a good laboratory of a few people can have a really good idea of what mana is. If quantum and statistical theory are known, the result of the spectrum and an equation of state can really show what are mana. I'm sure you will have other idea of experience.

Other random idea : what is the law of concentration of mana in function of altitude ? if mana is influenced by gravity, and pressure, these can explain easily why the concentration increases inside the planet. Do mana exist in space? launch a satellite with mana experiment on it. If mana have a spectrum, can we detect mana in the sun ? in other star ? a possible detection of life/magic in other solar system ? If mana is made of mundane element, can we destroy mana to extract matter ? if mana is made in part of platinum or gold ....

Where the energy of mana come from? Are mana radioactive? what is the comportment of mana against a radioactive material? Where can we put mana in the periodic table? What happens in a electromagnetic field ? Can we accelerate mana-particules inside a accelerator ? So many questions, so many !science! ....

**** Well, MoL's mana is very psychoreactive. It has to be, since things need a brain to think, and you need to think to cast, at least on some level (even if that level is low-level functions of a magi-beast's brain).

Since mana is psychoreactive, it does make sense that, were a super spooky wyrm exist in the Deep Forgotten Tunnels of Deepness Long Forgotten^{TM} that shat out enough mana on a regular basis that the entire planet was more or less suffused with it, it could actually be a fairly toxic thing.

Here's another question:

How can raw mana only degrade physical structures when "absorbed", whatever that means, if it functions as a sort of radiation that penetrates solid matter?

How can it be both intangible enough to just say "lol, what nuclear bonds?" and permeate stuff, yet tangible when, for lack of a better term, spiritually ingested? What sort of state-change does it undergo?

On top of that, why is it presented that souls generate mana from nothing?

Could it not be that souls have a type of metabolic function on the spiritual level, and that mana is either the or an excretion of that process?

I mean, MoL has different planes of existence. Souls could be feeding on the plane of infinite punch energy, and simply digest metaphysical punches into mana.

  The second, and probably the most widely used method, is to utilize ambient mana to augment the regeneration of one's mana reserves. This is done by slowly drawing upon ambient mana and assimilating it into existing mana reserves. In the past, this was a rare and ill-understood ability -- it is only in the last 200 years or so that mages figured out a reliable and easy-to-learn method to attune ambient mana into one's personal mana reserves. This was mostly done by closely studying magical creatures, who passively and unconsciously use this method to ‘feed' upon ambient mana. Even today, most magical creatures are still better at assimilating ambient mana than the average human mage.

**** But all radiation of the same frequency is equivalent. It doesn't matter whether your microwave oven got its microwaves from an internal or external source, what matters is how it's used.

Here, the source matters. If it's yours, it's perfectly safe. If it's somebody else's, it's safe but unwieldy. If it's ambient mana, it creates a degenerative effect in the user.

The question is why ambient mana is uniquely damaging. It'd be like if everyone on the planet had a compatible blood type, but blood plasma on its own was toxic.

The analogy of blood and plasma is actually pretty good, just in reverse: the specific form is safe, the generic form isn't.

Assembled Lego is reasonably safe, although a particular structure may or may not suit your needs. On the other hand, disassembled Lego scattered on the floor is [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-hope-you-step-on-a-lego][most hazardous]].

  A soul bond, such as that between a familiar and caster, makes sharing mana easier. Frequent mana sharing between same people will cause them to gradually get used to each other's mana, likewise easing mana sharing... though only between those specific individuals. Some creatures and bloodlines can innately use other people's mana with greater ease than normal.

** The distinction between ambient mana being used by a mind versus a machine seems pointless and exploitable. A machine is just the physical extension of a brain's ideas - the brain wants to do something, so it does it by sending signals down nerves etc. In this case though, the brain wants to do something, so it, using the body, creates a machine to do magic, and but on use the machine gets damaged, which feels weird.

Thus it seems like the entity actually doing the channeling of ambient mana gets damaged, not the intelligence behind the actual usage or the agent that the spell will actually help. So, if we make a wand-like device (maybe a mini mind bound simulacrum?) capable of executing arbitrary spell instructions as programmed by a mage using ordinary mana, the mage could arbitrarily harness ambient mana while only hurting the "mind" of the proxy.

  However, if too much ambient mana is channeled through an object too inadequate to bear the pressure, it can still break, burn or melt.

  Poorly made magic items can be quite dangerous for the wielder
#+end_quote

Plus some other likely negatives:

- inflexible (magical items usually only do 1 thing)

- harder to control (surely doing magic through the aid would be more unwieldy)

Your simulacrum idea might make a more flexible casting aid. But if you are a good enough mind mage to control your simulacrum, your simulacrum is too (and it knows your weaknesses). If it becomes insane that would be problematic. You would need to bind them very tightly to your will at the start (or use someone else's simulacrum).

Maybe. But seems hard to exploit. I think there are many possible reasons the author could give for this to not work.

  This is unaffected by the size of one's mana reserves -- those will higher reserves will simply regenerate more mana per minute.
#+end_quote

If you're siphoning ambient mana then surely larger mana reserves would benefit less from ambient mana? Or can they siphon more at once too? Still they would regenerate slower to full in places of limited but not zero ambient mana. Assuming equal assimilation rates, but maybe larger mana pools have better rates too?

#+end_quote

Does the level of mana in your pool affect the rate of mana regeneration (with or without ambient mana absorption)? For example, does it take the same amount of time to go from a mana pool being 10% full to 20% as it does to go from 45% to 55% or 90% to 100%?

#+begin_quote
  If separated from the soul it has been attuned to, personal mana will rapidly degrade into ambient mana -- which seems to be the default form of mana when not attuned to anything. This makes attempts to create an external storage of personal mana doomed to failure. Regardless of the method used, the mana will un-attune itself in a matter of minutes.
#+end_quote

Since the mana remains attuned to you for a brief period, could you re-absorb the mana before it un-attunes itself (for example while imprisoned, you could dump most of your reserves, to make it seem to your captors like you have nothing left, then pull some or all of it back into your pool)? Would this be a faster absorption rate than your safe absorption rate of ambient mana?\\
What if you build a box (or bag or jar or whatever, simply to keep the mana from floating off, not to stop it from un-attuning), or rather several (let's say X) boxes. You fill X-1 boxes with mana, then before box 1 can un-attune, you re-absorb the mana from box 1 and push it into the last empty box. Pull from 2, put it in 1, pull from 3 put it in 2, all the way to pull from X, put it in X-1. Since your own passive mana regeneration is still going, you eventually fill up your own pool in addition to the boxes. You'd be limited by how fast the mana un-attunes, and how fast you can move the mana around, so you won't exactly be doubling your pool size. But by essentially "juggling" mana, you can have access to (X-2)*(amount of mana stored in one box) additional mana attuned to you. Mind you, this setup with the boxes won't exactly keep you mobile so it's not battlefield practical. With a bit of setup time, it should be good for (depending on whether you can directly pull from the boxes while casting) 1 (assuming you can pipe it directly into the spell) or 2 (empty your pool, refill it from the boxes, empty it again) good strong surges of magic.
