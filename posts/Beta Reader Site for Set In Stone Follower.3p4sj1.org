Once again, I've changed how I'm moving forward with beta reader assistance. Because Google Docs does not allow me to create a secure password protected document where I generate a password and can distribute it to individuals, I have chosen to return to a tool that I understand. Wordpress.

Wordpress also fails to allow me to appropriately password protect beta reading documents, but I can simply delete the documents later.

This time around, the story will be split into chapters by scene, as opposed to by hook. The edited backstory is up, and so is the first scene.

In essence, [[https://betareadersite.wordpress.com/][this blog will be what gets published.]]


** That doesn't make sense.

You shouldn't need

#+begin_quote
  to create a secure password protected document
#+end_quote

in Google Docs. When you first create a document, it gives you the option to share it with whoever you want through their e-mail addresses and share it with only these people. Alternately, it should allow you to create a 'shareable link' where you can PM it to only the people you want to see it. In essence, unless you are worried about needing to block someone from the document in the future, it should be fine to use Google Docs or is there some factor I'm not aware of when using Google Docs?

EDIT: Also how will this blog stop Amazon from screaming at you for releasing the book for free somewhere on the web?

Amazon doesn't care if the book is available elsewhere unless you put it in Kindle Unlimited. If you're in KU they expect exclusivity, but they don't care if it /used/ to be available online. As long as he un-shared the Google Doc, it's not an issue.

*** What I wanted was password-only access. Nothing else. I can't get that, so I will use what I know.

As for Amazon, I will delete the Beta reading content before I publish. The original blog is a rough draft. Amazon only cares about currently available content being priced lower than them.

****** I'm not talking about the war. I'm talking about the setup that allows a war between Earth and Mars to wipe out the solar system. Even if they were both North-Korea-like totalitarian states, they would have backups in the outer system and huge secret farm habitats set up as boltholes for the elite. And North-Korea-like totalitarian states wouldn't have the surplus resources to have run the colony project in the first place, so there's no way they'd be monolithic and centrally controlled enough to pull off that "no farms in space" nonsense.

After two hundred years, with technology that can drill a hole through the moon and build viable generation ships? They'd have permanent self-sufficient colonies with hundreds of millions of people on every ball outside Earth's orbit, and probably Venus upper atmosphere as well.

The story as a whole is incredible. It's tight and realistic. The backstory is fifties pulp.

******* Thinking about it, you might be correct about it being silly for humans to only be able to survive on Earth and Mars in the Sol system. Earth and Mars were trying to establish four self-sufficient independent colonies. Why would they do this, if they were interested in strictly controlling all off-planet human activity?

It's far more likely that we're looking at a Fallout-like scenario. Post apocalyptic. Perhaps Albert has received crude, weak radio signals from Earth or even Mars, or found humanity struggling on Earth as well, and is trying to help them.

I'll try to give it some deeper thought.

******** There could be any number of reasons for the lack of interference. The colony could be a more distant one rather than the closest. There could have been a number of failed colonies, and interstellar colonization could have turned out to be harder than expected. They could have ended up at a different system than planned. Space is /huge/.

Really, these kind of backstory details don't need to be exposed at all.
