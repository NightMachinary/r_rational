Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Here's a recommendation: The *Steerswoman* series of books by Rosemary Kirstein.

It starts out starts out looking like a relatively normal fantasy adventure with the first twist being that the main characters are two women, one being from a quasi-rationalist order that are have a spiritual duty to finding and spreading the truth (which includes that they have to answer any question asked of them truthfully, as long as every question they are asked is answered in turn) and a sort of barbarian nomad woman. The second twist is one that most people should pick up after fourty pages and is fairly simple but I won't spoil it because it's still fun and the story only gets better after an interesting perspective shift on the whole setting.

**** It's not dead but it is stalled. The bits that are out are thoroughly satisfying and have excellent characters and worldbuilding. The central mystery is a little frustrating to have unsolved and the conflict (between the Steerswomen and the Wizards) which begins to come to a head as a result of the story is a little frustrating to have unresolved. But the books can each stand alone; it's a series, but like the Vorkosigan series, not like Kingkiller or A Song of Ice and Fire.

** Continuing my weekly read-along review of Luminosity: up to about Chapter 14. Spoilers below.

--------------

I think between chapters 6 and 14 is when all the Bella-as-human romance stuff happens, and it's pretty bleh, to be honest. That isn't to say it's not realistic and rational: it definitely is, it's just... well, if you were confronted with an attractive person who you know is magically bound to love you forever and can make you immortal, at which point you will be magically bound to love them forever, and you genuinely like them, it's like.... okay, of course you'd go with that.

Not to say I didn't enjoy it, I loved how when she was pretending to be Edward's girlfriend at school she was describing all the things she did and then the line was something like "and then all of a sudden I realised I wasn't pretending anymore". It was really sweet and beautiful.

But I'm still going to whine that there's very little in the way of romantic conflict, and I'm not sure I see them growing and changing. Bella avoids conflict with Edward by being Logical and Rational at the problem ("oh, well, if we can't bone until we're married, I'll put up with it and let's get married ASAP"), which is great, but idk, I don't see growth yet.

There's the whole scene where she was kidnapped by James that I really enjoyed, how she got out of it so cleverly.

--------------

But yeah, still loving the book (it's one of my favourites after all), but it's more urban fantasy than romance. I think we're still looking for a good rational romance (though I can and will and continually recommend the TV series /Jane the Virgin/).

** I stumbled across a fun cultivation / system Isekai fic: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31837/everybody-here-is-a-cultivation-idiot][Everybody here is a cultivation idiot]]

It's more fun and enthusiastic than rational, though it does kinda deconstruct and semi-justify the common trope of "why was the Isekai protag the first person to think of doing something obvious" - because, well, in this case it's something of a cultivation MMO, and these "obvious" things are built-in methods for PC equivalents to quickly gain power. Also, it hasn't been explicitly stated, but I'm pretty sure the system makes the NPCs slightly stupid (and hence the title).

One downside: everyone (and I mean everyone) seems to talk like a texting zoomer. The narration is lackadaisical but ok (the author needs to learn that not everything you worked out for the system needs to be put to paper), but the dialogue reminds me of what happens when people start speaking in Twitter memes.

** *Ward*, the sequel to *Worm* is done now. It's very good in a lot of ways, but still flawed. The characterization in Worm was great, yet Ward's is still much better. Ward's pacing problems are even worse than in Worm, but in new, more nuanced ways that make them even more aggravating. And the focus has changed significantly, which will leave a lot of fans behind.

If you enjoyed Worm for the clever interactions between simply drawn powers, you won't find any of that here; powers still behave in a consistent manner and interact properly, but none of them have simple explanations like "Controls bugs" or "Sensory deprivation smoke," and the details of power interactions matter a lot less when your main character has to solve most things by punching them. If you enjoyed it for epic monster fights and play by plays of combats, I can't tell you whether it's gotten any better, because I found it dull both times around (but I can at least tell you that the biggest monster to punch is smaller in Ward).

If you enjoyed Worm for parsing Taylor's self-oblivious and extremely biased point of view, you'll probably enjoy Victoria's shaky self-awareness and half-constructed attempts to be impartial even more, but if you didn't notice that part of Worm then you're going to be missing a huge chunk of this story. And as I mentioned before, the characterization really has grown, so if that's what you're here for, you'll have a good time - Breakthrough are much more believably real, traumatized people, especially compared to the Undersiders who mostly exist as one or two character traits drawn to a maximum. I was impressed the first time around when Wildbow would spend an interlude writing a convincing POV of a dog, but now his writing has the nuance to characterize as just much difference in thought process just by using people that lie within human norms.

The biggest problem with Ward though is the pacing. After spending several arcs slowly working through characterization and inter-character conflicts, Wildbow folded to fan pressure and started smashing people into combat trial after combat trial. After the first one, they rarely have the buildup time they need before the punching starts. And many of the combats go on until the fans get bored of the excessive slog of combat, then rather abruptly stop, only for the slow inter-character part of the work to return until some segment of the fanbase gets bored of it, and then suddenly lurching into more superpowered fistfights. I'm obviously on the side that it'd be better if it stuck to being mostly character-based, but the sudden lurching back and forth between the two modes didn't do a service to anyone.

** This is an upsetting post to write; I've been procrastinating starting it for a couple of hours. For a couple of years of my life, it would have horrified me to learn that I would wind up writing this post. I intend this post as a public service, not as an act of spite. This is a strong disrecommendation of a work by an author I greatly admire.

Ward, the long-awaited sequel to the classic web serial Worm, finally ended early on Sunday morning. *I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone read Ward.* Spoilers abound for both Worm and Ward.

The most positive thing I can say about Ward, in the context of a recommendation, is that if you're a Worm superfan with lots of time on your hands and you're desperate for more canonical source material to draw off of, well, okay, it makes sense to read Ward the same way it makes sense to read Weaverdice sourcebooks. You'll probably want to pick and choose which aspects you take from it, though, because Ward isn't a good story. It's awful, in the sense that it inspires awe how badly it fails as a story. It has many good little snippets of ideas, but it has no idea how to put them together into a functioning, coherent whole.

It's baffling coming from an author whose breakout work, Worm, left me under the impression that he's among the greatest storytellers of our time. People have various complaints about Worm, and some are legitimate criticism that would ideally be fixed in a future draft. But these problems are all small, petty, easy to work past to appreciate a well-told epic. They're /nothing/ in comparison to the problems that define and pervade Ward. Ward's problems aren't subjective quibbles with how clearly some scene was written. They're basic errors in the writing process, problems that create other problems everywhere, problems that touch everything else in the story, problems that have metastasized to the story's outline and style. The story is fundamentally and fractally half-baked.

Because I had so much faith in the author, thanks to Worm, I was not one of the many people who left early on. Although there are strange and unwise choices made even in Ward's introductory pitch, I don't think the people who left early on were right to do so, at least not for the most part. Early conversations on Ward were dominated by misguided and flatly wrong complaints. For example, there are problems with Ward's choice of protagonist, but her specific identity isn't one of them - she's a finely-sketched character, and the hatred certain sectors of the fandom had for her from the start was ridiculous and frankly pathological. So I stuck with the story, all the way through. I gave the author credit. I enjoyed the good parts, and I gave the bad parts the benefit of the doubt. But by the last quarter of the story, it became obvious that, as a whole, it wasn't going to come together quite right, and in the last few weeks I realized that it was actually going to be capital-B Bad, not just substantially suboptimal.

The real glaring problem with Ward's choice of protagonist, incidentally, /is that she's a returning character from Worm at all/. That sets a tone. Of course a Worm sequel would feature some returning characters, but Ward doesn't just feature some returning characters. It features /mostly/ returning characters. Any arbitrary character who appears in an important role is likely to be a returning Worm character. There are brilliant new characters and ideas all over the place - but they're subservient to the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfJRm0WssOE][nostalgic fan service]]. It may sound strange to make this complaint about a sequel, but Ward isn't the kind of sequel that follows the same protagonist and concerns itself primarily with continuing the same character arcs. It's another epic written in the same setting, a sequel for the /world/. But Ward doesn't have a serious interest in that world; it has a serious interest in throwing things we know at us.

The world /ended/ in the last act of Worm. Ward is a post-apocalyptic story. But Ward doesn't /want/ to be a post-apocalyptic story. It wants to be reheated Worm leftovers, and it doesn't particularly care that Worm's setting was already torn down and replaced by something entirely new; it has no interest in developing or exploring the world in which it's set. Its story beats are exactly the same kind of story beats that Worm had, likely because many of them are literally unused notes from Worm. It reuses them all the same, drawing no meaningful distinction between before and after /the fucking apocalypse/, as an event in characters' lives. We hear it said explicitly that the apocalypse killed something like 90% of humans and something like 99% of parahumans. But the actual story certainly doesn't act like it; /the fucking apocalypse/ never stands in the way of bringing a character back from Worm. Even among those characters that Ward newly introduces, almost all of them are primarily defined by trauma they underwent /before the fucking apocalypse/. It's unusual and noteworthy for characters to have dead loved ones, in a setting that, even /before/ the fucking apocalypse, had Endbringers and similar threats that were introduced as routinely killing large fractions of the superheroes (stakes that, in retrospect, seem essentially arbitrary and made of cardboard).

In the first few arcs of Ward, it set up numerous conflicts, threads, and questions that made good use of the setting it inherited from Worm. But somewhere early on, Ward got into its head that worldbuilding is masturbatory nonsense for rationalist nerds (which is a shame, because Wildbow excels at it when he's trying, which he usually is), so it dropped all of these threads; nothing was honestly examined or went anywhere. Instead, Ward concerns itself first and foremost with characterization. That's the defense that Ward's proponents generally give, that the issues with every aspect of the actual story are immaterial, because it's such a good character piece and that's what it was trying to be. But I'm going to say something that I think would surprise a lot of people: /Ward's characterization is not any better than Worm's./ (In fact, it's meaningfully worse.) It spends more time doing it, and that's not the same thing. An addict's house may be full of syringes, but that doesn't mean she's better at using them than a nurse. Ward spends much of its nearly two-million word (!) duration on highly introspective internal monologues and inane navel-contemplating small-talk between characters; after a point, it's just polishing something it's already completely worn away. The excess time spent on characterization directly takes time and thought away from worldbuilding, which in turn directly undermines that same characterization - any person exists in a world, and Ward effectively doesn't have a setting at all, instead operating on vague context-free feelings, moon logic, and authorial fiat.

This is an aside, but I blame a large part of Ward's disdain for worldbuilding (also known as "being set in a world that attempts to make sense") on Doof! Media. In the months running up to the start of Ward, a popular liveblog-type podcast called "We've Got Worm" sprung up and became extremely influential in the parts of the fandom closest to Wildbow; he even became a frequent listener and participant in the post-podcast discussions. It was well-produced and well-done all around, and in a very difficult-to-replicate way, it brought a fresh perspective and fascinating analysis to Worm. But the host responsible for much of this, Scott Daly, was very much of the mindset "well, I don't care about worldbuilding, because I'm not some fucking nerd, I'm here for all that other good stuff in writing, like character arcs". That's a valid lens for an individual reader to take in a project like that, but Wildbow wound up hearing a /lot/ of Scott. I mean, the guys make a long professional podcast devoted entirely to relentlessly praising a particular artist; it's not a surprise that the artist would wind up hearing a lot of it. And then, when Ward started, the We've Got Worm guys moved onto Ward, and the podcast became something very different - much less meritorious, but still very popular, effectively a glorified recap podcast endlessly pumping out content each week just describing what happened last week. And it became a literal feedback loop - Wildbow hearing a constant drone of "you're great, you're perfect, I love this unconditionally, you're so good at characters, your shit is golden, but we don't care about worldbuilding, Wildbow, I love this, we don't care about worldbuilding at all, we're not fucking nerds, Wildbow, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all..."

I don't think it was ever quite fair to label Worm "rational fiction", because that's not a label the author selected, but in contrast to Worm, Ward is as far from the virtues of rational fiction as a story can possibly get. Characters' motivations exist only in isolation; characters can't have interesting plans to achieve their goals because there's no real framework in which such plans could exist or make sense. Effectively every important antagonist is a strawman, not a real person, and when they have a point, the story sees that as a mistake and corrects it as soon as possible by adding complications to make them unlikable and obviously wrong.

*** I think it's really unfair to say that Ward being a more heavily character-driven piece was just because Wildbow was blindly following a flattering podcast. Twig was /entirely/ character driven and was written with the explicit goal of helping him improve at that style of writing, so it seems clear to me that he always intended to write something else that placed a much stronger focus on character relationships and growth.

You're also attributing a great many things to him trying to please the audience when there's no real evidence that's the case for most of them. For example, the specific character death fakeout you cite looks to me like something planned rather than a hasty retcon, especially considering he /does/ talk about how the audience influenced him in his retrospective and he never mentions that incident, nor does he mention doing anything as drastic as a straight up retcon. Not to say the audience didn't influence him, as he very clearly states it did, but my impression was that the audience reaction changed what elements got focus and what fell by the wayside, not that he was rewriting whole plots and characters due to feedback.

You've written... a lot, so I can't really give each of your points the attention they deserve, but I will say that your overall review comes across as hyperbolic, to the point of straying towards personal attacks on both the author and the segments of the fandom you don't like. I understand if Ward wasn't your thing, you're clearly not alone in your view, but there's a difference between something not being to your taste and something being objectively flawed. I feel like you're ascribing a lot of the latter to the story in places and ways where it's very much a stretch (such as your reading of the antagonists, of plot or character inconsistencies, of the protagonists capabilities etc.) merely because the story as a whole turned out not to be to your tastes. I hesitate to say that you're manufacturing flaws, but there are definitely cases (such as the fact that you don't think anything bad ever comes from how Kenzie is handled) where you have to take a VERY warped view of things to make the claims you're making.

And regarding the negative tone of Wildbow's retrospective, I suggest you take a look at his other retrospectives. He tends to be very highly critically of every one of his stories as soon as they're finished, only warming up to them much later on. The tone he strikes here is frankly pretty in line with how he viewed Pact and Twig immediately after finishing them, something that he himself notes. It's really not indicative of the quality of the story at all, it's just the sort of relationship he tends to have with his work.

***** Yes, but the /specifics/ of those changes is what I'm talking about and what the OP is jumping on. The only concrete admission he makes of something being changed is the therapy and some worldbuilding being neglected in response to criticisms about pacing. I'm not saying that's the only thing that got changed, I'm saying that's the only thing you can /point to/ and say "That there? That only happened because he was listening to fans."

The OP makes bold, sweeping claims about things being all the fault of how fans reacted and him listening to them too much (such as the one fake-out death), but there is /no evidence/ for those claims aside from an admission by Wildbow that he thinks he listened too much and did make SOME adjustments as a result. You can't blame anything you didn't like on the fans, nor can you say how much or what specifically got changed, excepting that therapy and worldbuilding fell by the wayside due to pacing concerns. Anything more than that is pure speculation.

If anybody has criticisms with the story they should feel welcome to make those known, but to wrap those criticisms in some bullshit narrative about how "the fans made him do it" is both deceptive and insulting. He wrote the damn story, if you don't like what he wrote then say that, but don't say the reason you don't like it is because he can't make decisions for himself when that's just not true.

The above review sort of presupposes that there are several specific things that are definitively different than they would have been if the fans hadn't said anything. Even if you say "but the fans aren't responsible for those changes, Wildbow is because he's still the author," you're still assuming that /those specific changes were made at all/.

No one's denying that the audience had some influence, but the review seems to be implying that Wildbow straight up resurrected dead characters because the audience didn't like it when he killed them off. With claims like that, the statement "Wildbow is entirely responsible for his writing decisions" comes out sort of damning, because it comes with the implication that he was making those decisions in a bizarre and irresponsible way. That's why I take issue with those claims when they're made with no real evidence.

I don't think that any specific changes were made, other than the ones he explicitly stated in his retrospective, but rather that he wrote the story based on assumptions that didn't pan out. e.g., the "fake-out death" wasn't a retcon, the set-up just didn't come across like he thought it would so the execution fell kind of flat, but it wasn't some hasty reactive change.

****** The therapy. Apparently, going by the retrospective post, Wildbow wasn't originally planning on having Jessica yeeted out of the plot by the portal bombs, but rather settled on it as a solution to audience griping about the therapy premise. In retrospect, that makes a lot of sense of the weird arc anticlimaxes, which essentially started there - if you look at the first arc, you can see that Ward's original intended arc structure followed up battles with therapy sessions, and once the therapy sessions were removed, it had a lot of battles that just end on weird hanging notes. When conceiving of Jessica's inclusion in Ward, Wildbow also wasn't planning on the plot reflecting nearly so badly on her as it did, which is responsible for a lot of thematic self-contradiction.

Actual good advice would be, Ward has a divisive ending and the fanbase is conflicted on it's overhaul quality. You can read if you want but there's a significant chance you'll not enjoy it, like a large percentage of it's readers.

*** That's not to say that there's no talent on display in Ward. Wildbow is still Wildbow, as depressing as it is to see that he's capable of failing so catastrophically at the thing he's known for, telling a story. There are many fascinating and/or entertaining elements in Ward, both fresh ones and recycled ones from Worm drafts; I usually enjoyed reading it. The main cast is memorable and compelling in the same way that the main cast of Worm was. There are chapters and even whole arcs that could easily be highlights in a much, much better story. But as a story, as a piece of art, it falls flat on its face, continually noncommittally jerking between one stupid and contrived soap-opera-ish and/or shonen-ish plot point and another. In many, many ways, it's the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy of Worm.

There are many lessons to learn from Ward's many failures. Chief among them, though, I think is this: /the writer of a serial must keep the audience at arm's length/. Ward's key problems are all rooted in this: Wildbow either overreacting in one way or another to audience feedback (bending to bad audience feedback, for example, or retaliating against audience feedback), or else being bizarrely oblivious to how something would be read because he'd grown overly reliant on constant audience feedback and his ability to project himself into the head of a reader in advance had apparently atrophied. (Indeed, Ward is /generally/ less concerned with projecting itself into people's heads than Worm - interludes aren't used in the same way, and as was mentioned earlier, antagonists are strangely hollow caricatures.)

There's a dichotomy in writing between "architects", who plan out stories in considerable detail before actually writing them, and "gardeners", who only have a few general ideas for future direction and, for the most part, just see where writing takes them. I've long favored architect-writing over gardener-writing, but Wildbow is, by his own admission, a gardener. I think Worm is an argument in favor of that style of writing; he really makes it work there, building a single strong narrative thread with many strong interwoven threads over the course of an epic despite constant improvisation. Ward, on the other hand, is a strong argument against. The story doesn't know what it's doing. The story doesn't know when it introduces things what it plans to do with them, and because of this, it isn't committed to doing /anything/ with them. And because it's not committed to any plan, it's /particularly/ vulnerable to the gusts of whims of audience feedback.

Ward is the kind of story that mentions its predecessor's protagonist about a dozen times in two million words, even though she dramatically ended her story /as the very public savior of humanity/, because it's afraid that readers will take it the wrong way and assume the old protagonist is coming back and taking over the plot again.

Ward is the kind of story that spends much of its first few arcs setting up a thematically-juicy antagonist faction in a political intrigue story, except that the antagonist is substantially /correct/, and it doesn't like the implications of that, so it gradually demotes them all the way to joke antagonist status, including them in the story's finale only so that they can be publicly defeated via one stupid child losing a public debate with another stupid child, at which point everybody claps, like we're actually reading a straight-up STDH.txt post made to dunk on the opposition or something. Lazy, lazy, lazy. (Incidentally, if you've been suffering through the end of Ward, as I have - can I offer you [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/618861167640576021/704019068188885042/Inspirational_Gimel_Meme.png][a nice meme]] in these trying times?)

Ward is the kind of story that devotes a lot of thematically-central setup early on to the idea that the cute child Tinker teammate is extremely dangerous and deeply unstable, and overworking her is really really bad, both for her and for everyone else. Then, the protagonist spends the entire story overworking the cute child Tinker teammate to solve every single problem in ridiculous deus-ex-machina-y ways, nothing bad ever comes of it, and the protagonist isn't even particularly framed as in the wrong. It's like if the Ghostbusters crossed the streams /all the time/ with no repercussions, except that crossing the streams is horrific child endangerment.

Ward is the kind of story that abandons a central component about a quarter of the way through the story in an attempt to satisfy ambivalent fans, accidentally thematically inverting the entire story, and then proceeds to flounder for the entire rest of the story because it jettisoned a key piece of the story without actually becoming a different story. (I didn't actually find out about this one until the story ended, when Wildbow released his retrospective on it, but it fits well with the pattern I'd already noticed, and more importantly it explains a lot.)

Ward is the kind of story where, in order to fight the popular idea that she's stupid, the protagonist is always right, to the point that she might as well have Tattletale's power in addition to her own, because she's continually coming up with absolutely bullshit transparently unsupported hypotheses that we're supposed to immediately trust as author fiat because they never turn out to be wrong.

Ward is the kind of story that, over and over, like clockwork, gives large-scale story arcs /extremely/ anticlimactic endings, because whiny fans treated tension and stakes as writing flaws and the writer was desperate to win their approval back just for a moment with a cheap quick rush of "yay we finally solved the long-running problem".

Ward is the kind of story that gives a secondary character a dramatic, wonderfully-executed death at the hands of a fresh, fascinating, brilliant antagonist, but then the fans throw a collective bitchfit that pierces the heavens, because the character who died was a fan-favorite from Worm, so he brings the character back a few chapters later, literally doing what a facetious meme had suggested, reasoning that we hadn't seen the body, even though /her death was from the perspective of an alien with local omniscience in charge of blowing her up/. The bullshit-soap-opera-retcon-resurrected fan favorite then proceeds to kill the interesting new antagonist who had originally killed her, in order to secure cheap cathartic revenge on the fandom's behalf.

Ward is the kind of story that brings the supporting cast from the original back a few arcs in, in an attempt to stir up fandom interest, except that it brings them back as antagonists, which contextually makes perfect sense, except that the fandom apparently is really uncomfortable with it, because they always liked sweeping the old supporting cast's severe moral flaws under the rug, so, in a /further/ attempt to suck up to the fandom, the old supporting cast stop being antagonists and completely inexplicably insinuate themselves into the new supporting cast, in a way that is not at all a natural story or character movement but entirely comes down to fanficcy "I want them to be happy and fake-date each other" audience appeal.

Ward is the kind of story that thematically hinges on its protagonist having been raped by a (different) fan favorite character from its predecessor, except that the author is sufficiently squeamish about writing rape that he doesn't realize until about halfway through (a nearly two-million word long story!) that a significant contingent of readers /don't even understand that this or anything like this happened/, to say nothing of the readers who've bought into some excuse for it. By the end of the story, the word "rape" still hasn't been used in-text to describe it, only in out-of-text discussions, even though the story visibly became much heavier-handed about conveying the point. It's as though a long time ago, the author internalized someone's advice that he shouldn't write about rape, but it somehow got contorted into being a mere taboo on the word, or of getting too direct about it, and not on things like /writing a protagonist whose character revolves around the time she was raped/.

Ward is the kind of story where the world is literally physically falling apart, and it seems strangely apropos because the story's narrative coherence is also falling apart. Ward is also the kind of story where the world literally physically falling apart does not matter at all.

**** Ward is the kind of story where its final boss is Super-Saiyan Contessa trying to blow up the Earth, and that final boss is defeated by the always-right protagonist having a clever plan that's only clever by author fiat and looks suspiciously like exactly what Super-Saiyan Contessa would want her to do. Thinker powers only exist as tools of author fiat, even when they're in Super-Saiyan form.

Ward is the kind of story that spends its last arc trying as hard as possible to convince the audience that the protagonist's final stroke of brilliance is pulling a fucking Jonestown and persuading or "persuading" hundreds of people to simultaneously cease existing. It accomplishes this by spending tens of thousands of words having the protagonist say things like "it sure sucks that my plan to beat Giga-Contessa is to kill myself and make hundreds of other people kill themselves too, but it's just gotta be done" and "say, you there, have you agreed to my Offing Yourself Plan yet? it's vitally important that you give up on life and die immediately, even if I have to force you!" and "whelp, what I'm doing is like a cross between the way Hitler committed genocide and the way Hitler killed himself, hmm, oh well, still gotta do it", while having other people say things like "aw, geez, Victoria, I don't want to die, also, I'm a big mean uglyface" and "okay, I guess I'm really depressed lately, so it's probably okay if you throw me on the suicide pile" and "I'm trans and really dissatisfied with my body so totally, go for it, it is okay for me to die". The author was then absolutely dumbfounded that people straightforwardly interpreted the text as written, and didn't telepathically pick up on the moon logic he'd actually intended wherein all of the words meant different and unrelated things and just what the fuck am I even reading why did we do this

So, uh, anyway, he quickly ran some damage control where he immediately clarified what the plan actually was in the very next chapter, and, surprise, it was yet another in Ward's long line of tremendous anticlimaxes. Whoopee. The final anticlimax, actually, which was what finally broke me and turned me over to Team Ward Bad.

Ward is the kind of story where I only gave it so much credit and read it through all the way to the end because I had so much deep respect for Worm, and Ward is the kind of story that retroactively makes me respect Worm less, like it was some kind of fluke, or maybe I was even delusional to think it was so good. I still love Worm, I'd still argue its merits, and it's still reshaped me in many ways that are arguably for the better, but Ward is the kind of story that makes me regret that I ever read Worm, because it led me to spend two and a half years of my life hanging on every word of Ward, which, in retrospect, as a complete picture, is shit. If you read it now, you would be bingeing it, not incorporating it into your regular routine, so it wouldn't be quite as heavy of a blow to you, but still:

Ward is the kind of story that makes me feel a moral obligation to warn others about it, to dissuade others from making the same mistake I did by wasting my life and mind reading it.

Although he didn't frame it as negatively as I am here - he discusses a mix of positives and negatives, which I think is fair - in [[https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2020/05/03/ward-off-a-retrospective-on-a-sequel/][Wildbow's retrospective post on Ward]], he seems to acknowledge it as primarily a failure; he accurately recounts many reasons that the story turned out as badly as it did. I think that that's a very good thing. It gives hope that /Ward/ is the fluke - that Wildbow /is/ still a great writer, coming out of a horrible period, and that he will write great works again. That the dream of Worm isn't dead, that the bad habits that made Ward Ward aren't permanent atrophy of Wildbow's writing skill, and may even be cast off immediately.

If you're a Worm fan with time on your hands and you're sad that you have nothing to read, I present this recommendation to you: if you haven't yet, read [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/][Pact]]. I'm less than halfway through it, but I started a little while back, and it's wonderful. It's scratching an itch for me, a Worm-like itch, that Ward never did. It doesn't seem to me that its poor reputation is at all merited; any criticism you've heard about it is either wrong ("it doesn't care about its characters") or a good thing ("for some reason it keeps being exciting"). The end of Ward was enough of a mess that it derailed my readthrough of Pact, draining me of the mental/emotional energy required to read another story simultaneously. But now that Ward's over, I'll resume Pact in the next couple of days. I'm quite excited for it. Given what Wildbow has said about his enthusiasm for writing in the world of Pact, I'm excited that his next project is set there, too - although I think I won't read it until it's finished, and given that it'll apparently be a shorter work than usual for Wildbow, that shouldn't be too difficult.

TL;DR: read Pact, not Ward

I absolutely loved the first half of pact, but I felt like it sort of fell apart in the last half. Combat was designed to be very hand-wavey in Pact, and it really hurt the tension when things came down to the wire.

***** What about the criticism of Pact that it is relentlessly, inescapably depressing to the point that the most the character achieves is dying while /only/ the town he lives in is destroyed? And yes, I realize the in-story reasons why this would happen - but to me this just means that the setup for Pact is chosen in a way that its eventual conclusion is inescapable, and predictably, it is not escaped. The story is literally saved by the barest of margins by throwing in a character that is too relentlessly happy to be ground down into depression by the time the story ends, then turning him into a bird before he can break completely. At some point the main character gains a new trauma that /invalidates a previous trauma/ because their life story is so full of traumas that you literally can't add trauma without colliding with the trauma that's already there. (I think this is where it crossed into farce, for me - Wildbow literally had to put the MC into a superposition of traumas to fit more trauma in!) I don't get how this is supposed to be fun, and I regret finishing it.

***** I stopped keeping up with Ward about two arcs before the end, I will get around to reading it sooner or later. From what I've already read, a complaint I agreed with was that it felt like the Wardens get stupid and incompetent whenever Victoria is present but somehow fight off numerous threats off screen. I don't actually fully agree with your complaint about the death fakeout (which you think is a retcon) there was hints as to what was happening in the scene with the fakeout but I think it could use more.

As for Pact, Twice as it was originally being written I thought Pact was too much of a depressing slog, and I set it down to later binge read and catch back up. Back in terms of rereading... for Worm/Ward I've mostly reread interludes and not the main story whereas with Pact I find both interludes and main story worth rereading.

I think the world building in Worm works because wildbow rewrote the precursor story multiple times, whereas with Ward he didn't want to work through the implications of the post apocalyptic setting. Pact has a setting much closer to the regular world and it benefits from having a highly subjective magic system.

***** I didn't really like Pact, but it was still better than Twig, which in turn seems to be better than Ward? The fact that the author appears to be getting worse with each story would not suggest that he has hit a dip, but rather that he struck gold at first and has not been able to replicate it.

In fact it's a little strange to see you contrast the sensible world building of Worm and suggest Ward was in some ways a reaction to that, when Pact felt like wildbow was deliberately trying to do an anti-Worm. Pact is a world where nothing makes sense, its impossible to predict how things will play out based on facts you have and there is constant arbitrary bullshit to explain how the plot proceeds. I should mention that the story was always presented with this upfront, so my comments might read harsher than they intend; wildbow is ultimately able to weave his story around this restriction in Pact. Still, a frustrating read.

I think this is a thing people are probably underestimating. Web fiction is, in general, gets much less editing that traditional published stuff. Look at, for example, the absolutely rampant spelling errors in /A Practical Guide to Evil/. Your first draft is never your best draft, so it is entirely unsurprising that going from your pet project you work-shopped over years to something you're putting out in close to real time results in a drop in quality.

I wish wdbw wasn't so die-hard on always churning out content. He's going to burn himself out. I don't even mean the "not enjoying work" type of burnout, he's simply going to start committing more and more literary sins as a necessary consequence.

It's simply impossible to create something like Worm at the pace that he /appeared/ to have created Worm.

Double that if he keeps giving a shit what people think of his work. I don't want to harp on him, but its been obvious from reading his reddit posts that he takes some things *way* too personally. Examples: Sleeper, Browbeat, Parian's true power, "how far are we into the story" questions, [[https://www.deviantart.com/lonsheep/art/Parian-s-True-Power-735083730][the "low effort" art debacle]], etc.

Its human, but its clear that his relationship with the fandom is ultimately not good for him or for his fans.

I enjoyed Ward. It wasn't as amazing as Worm was, but it was definitely worth the read. Partly that's just because Worm managed to pull off truly epic stakes and a satisfactory resolution in a way that very few stories manage. But all of the low-level detail - interesting superpowers, detailed characters with their own motivations and backstories, and combat scenes that were more detailed than I personally cared for - were pretty similar.

I think I could honestly recommend Ward to people as "If you liked Worm, you'll like Ward. Maybe it's not quite so amazing".

Ward just has this grim hopelessness that Worm didn't. I mean, yes, Worm had moments at which all looked to be lost, but Ward (especially the second half of it) /is/ those moments, with very little between.

And judging by the ending you describe, the last arc is even grimmer than the rest of it. As much as I don't like quitting a story this close to its end, I think I might just give this ending a pass.

******* I doubt I will. And not just because of the hopelessness. Although, at the point I left off, any ending that /doesn't/ feel hopeless is probably going to feel cheap. Ward's last arc doesn't start off with a Helm's Deep kind of hopelessness, where /if they just make it to the dawn of the fifth day/, as hard as that may be, there's rescue coming for them. It's a "Wow, it's going to take a serious /deus ex machina/ to rescue them from this," kind of hopeless.

But, even if I were to take your assurance that it ends on a hopeful note, without pulling something completely unforeshadowed out of its ass to accomplish it...

There's a problem with sequels that retread the ground of the original. That is, if your protagonists deal with a problem once, and succeed, you can leave the audience with a sense that the problem is dealt with. If they have to deal with the same problem again, you can never be quite sure.

This, I think, is the problem with having the MCU movies deal with the end of the world every week or two. Or having the Star Wars sequels deal with a resurgent Empire (by a different name). It all just leads up to a kind of fatigue: Okay, they've dealt with it /this time/, but we know something just as bad is going to happen again.

I think Worm did this very well: Every time a new threat came to Brockton Bay, it threatened the town in a /different way/, with a "save the world," extinction-level attack only really appearing at the end.

Ward started out so /well,/ in this respect. It dealt with the aftermath of the extinction-level attack, on personal, interpersonal, and societal levels, and found a lot of interesting stories to tell.

...But then it went full apocalypse again, only even more hopeless, this time, and I just don't see the point in finishing it anymore. Because averting one apocalypse feels like your heroes have saved the world, but having to avert a second means that you only feel like they've saved the world /for now/.

Having to play a second game, to win the the same stakes all over again because you'd only thought you'd won them in the first game, cheapens the first game, and gives you no reason to believe your win will be real this time either.

And that's not really the sequel I want to read, just like I'm about done with the MCU, and just like I'm probably never going to watch the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Because why ruin the ending of the (much better) original, by retconning the victory at the end of that story out of existence?

*** I enjoyed Ward, and I would have read it anyway as I'm a diehard Worm fan, but I agree with most of your points. :/ The interludes of Ward were its best parts. From memory, the interlude with Rain, Kenzie, Dot, Dauntless, Simurgh, Fortuna, Valkerie were /really really good/. And the epilogue chapters with Riley and Five were excellent as well. But Victoria herself, and the main story (which is really hard to summarise) was not interesting.

This is a stark contrast from when I read Worm when I had to force myself to be patient during the interludes cause of how much I was burning to read Taylor chapters again.

I felt the biggest weakness was how the whole story (IMO) was setup to be different from Worm. Taylor was a victim of bullying, she was odd looking, she had a weird and gross power but she used her intelligence and diverse powers to take down traditionally OP Brutes by just constantly escalating. Taylor was a Chaotic Good villian.

Whereas Victoria was a popular, beautiful blonde, a traditional-ish flying brick power, she mostly fought Masters and Thinkers and was constantly trying to deescalate a situation in a mature way. Victoria is a Lawful Good hero.

She only became slightly more interesting when she visited Shardspace and came back slightly unstable. An emotionally mature grownup did not make for an interesting story about superheros. The fight sequences were also pretty hard to follow, too. Seeing flying bricks beat up bad guys works well in comics and movies, but not so much as a POV story. The opposite is true for Taylor's powers.. I imagine it would be almost impossible to describe her powers in a movie format well, but in written text it was just /incredible/.

Do I emphasize character moments over world building in my analysis? Yes, because I find one thing more interesting to talk about than the other. Do I think it's bad to have different priorities in your approach to fiction? Of course not! Everyone has a lens through which they observe a story. I can only talk about it through mine.

But more importantly, I think this idea is also incredibly unfair to the author. Wildbow knows and understands more about storytelling than I ever will. Regardless of what anyone thinks of the successes or failures of this most recent story, I think he's proven that he's a truly brilliant writer.

It's ok to not like the book, but to assume that my show (which I can assure you is not nearly as big as people seem to think it is) and me specifically somehow singlehandedly caused the author to abandon all his understanding of storytelling, world-building, character and plot to chase after what *I* most enjoy about narrative is giving me way too much credit and not giving him nearly enough.

I interpreted what they said more as acknowledging that tour podcast was so well made it sweeped up much of the fandom and curved all discussions and opinions towards yours. Couple that with the fact that you are more interested in and draw more conclusions from characterization than world-building, plus Wildbow both enjoying your work and being influenced by his fanbase (that has been strongly affected by you) and you get Wildbow writing a story where he focuses so much on trying to write excellent characterization that he has less mental energy or care left over to polish the world-building.

Or at least that seems to be the thesis.

I personally don't think that any such effect is strong enough to warrant talking about, and I also never saw you causing even anyone else to disparage amor care less about Worm's world-building.

That said, I had issues with Ward's world-building ever since Prancer, Moose and Velvet were still having to /illegally/ smuggle /weed/ after the apocalypse. But those issues were overshadowed by the good stuff, and I still immensely enjoyed both Ward and We've Got Ward.

Anyone can give him advice, good or bad, but he's the one who chooses whether or not to take it. Someone else's good review or my bad review doesn't actually make Ward good or bad. But it's still clear that the fandom /influences/ Wildbow, and I think it's pretty clear that, over the course of Ward, you were by a /significant/ margin the loudest, most devoted, biggest-name fan. You have a whole show about how the story's going. Lots of people listen to it, and lots of people with money pay you for it. I think it's silly and more than a little misguided, but lots of people recommending Worm and/or Ward recommend your podcast alongside it with similar fervor - some people even recommend Worm and/or Ward /with the specific clarification that they're only recommending it as context for your podcast/. I think it's well worth mentioning you as an important and influential figure in a long review of Ward - particularly as I think the areas where Ward is most consistently lacking correspond to the areas you pay less attention to.

"Fan criticism" probably doesn't even come into play: what's important for drawing in new readers is whether the initial uninformed impression catches and holds their interest.

Some might wonder if it's intended as a slur. Some might wonder if the author is intentionally playing with double meanings, writing an urban fantasy story as a thinly veiled allegory about the experience of being a homosexual. Those kinds of false impressions can easily put people off of reading a story - even people who would otherwise have turned out to be avid fans, many of whom might even have turned out to be /good/ fans by your standards, i.e. not the kind with opinions that you judgmentally disparage as "low quality low involvement."

At this point Wildbow is an experienced author. He understands the importance of choosing words that accurately convey what he /intends/ to convey.

He changed it after /a single chapter/ despite having worked on the story for six months before publishing. On this point, I think we can be pretty sure that Poof was his first choice for Reasons. It is hard for me - actually, impossible for me to believe that he spent that much time developing the story but came up with a more appropriate title within a two-day period after posting the first chapter. That would be extraordinary.

You're talking about readers who aren't familiar with his work and probably haven't read the story (low involvement) making judgments based on a passing glance at the title (low quality).

Many, many decisions could alienate new viewers though, and it's up to a confident author to be alright with that. You won't grab every new reader. And you shouldn't, because you can't please everyone, and we wouldn't want the product to be diluted.

I looked a bit deeper into his reasoning, and WB said that as a heterosexual man he does not feel comfortable making a stand here. I respect that.

**** Sorry for dumping this wall of text on you, I kinda started writing and then it ran away from me.\\
tl;dr: I definitely felt more grounded in Brockton Bay than I ever felt in the Megacity. But I think that was a deliberate choice by the author.

--------------

In Worm, we spent a lot of time in the city of Brockton Bay. Taylor was connected to it, via her father, who was deeply invested in its docks and the workers there. Later, she came to run her own territory. We know stuff about the city's infrastructure, the trainyards, the docks, and an airport are mentioned. Through all this, we learned a lot about the layout, the geography, the history of the place. Wildbow even told us about the demographics, the shifting landscape of gang influence, and the effect the economic downturn had.

And, crucially, since Earth Bet is "basically the same" as our world, where we don't get any explicit word from the author, we can assume the world is the same as ours. Brockton Bay will have a collection of smaller towns and villages surrounding it, where people grow food, which is processed somewhere and shipped to the town. Steel is probably produced in Detroid(?), computers come from Silicon Valley. It all /makes sense/.

--------------

In Ward, I couldn't tell you /anything/ about the layout of the Megacity. Granted, it's spread over multiple dimensions with portals making normal traversal dangerous to impossible, but still. It's 50 million people, somehow spread along the East Coast of the United States, somehow spanning the distance from north of Boston (where Brockton Bay is /probably/ located) down to New York City, in a single stretch of urban sprawl.\\
I couldn't tell you anything about its infrastructure. The place fundamentally doesn't make sense (more on this later), how did people build skyscrapers in a post-apocalyptic universe? There is no heavy industry to produce steel and concrete in the amounts needed for construction on that scale; there aren't even any mines mentioned. The city doesn't feed itself either, we get explicit mentions of that multiple times. They tried to set up farming communities, but these are currently in open revolt, refusing to sell their wares to the city.

All this has two possible explanations. What LHC seems to believe, is that Wildbow suddenly forgot or stopped to care about how a civilization works. He wanted to write a superhero story, and superheroes need a city to save, and thus he sat down a city onto the green fields, without caring about how it could've gotten there.

There is another explanation, and even though it's more complicated and somewhat handwavy, and which I nonetheless prefer, is that it was a deliberate choice by Wildbow. What I think it comes down to is this: Wildbow wanted to protray a society where everyone had gone through heavy trauma. Out of 500 million people in Northern America, only 50 million are left. On average, every person in there has lost 90% of their social circle. Sure, in practise it's probably unevenly distributed because people were evacuated together while some places were just annihilated alltogether, but still. Noone made it through Gold Morning without losing /someone/.

In the aftermath of that trauma, people wanted nothing so much as to go back to how things were before. That is a common reaction to trauma, people trying to pretend it didn't happen, or that it happened but it's over now. And that's why they built a facade of a 21st century American city, with fast food and skyscrapers. Corners were cut, infrastructure was neglected, and hundreds of thousands had to live in tent cities during winter, but they had a City to look forward to.

Of course, just as trying to forget your trauma instead of dealing with it is unhealthy, the city was never viable. Food shortages even with regular aid from neighboring worlds, riots over labour rights, no clear law system, rising tensions between capes and normal people... The city could never have worked out, even if all the transdimensional threats hadn't been there.

--------------

There are also parallels with our main character: Victoria is projecting a calm, collected facade, even though she's such a mess that just /thinking/ about certain topics will lead to her spacing out for minutes, to such a degree that other people notice.

Just like the main characters, just like society itself, the city had to go through a long, arduous, and painful process of acceptance and recovery. Humans made their peace with capes, collectively forgiving them for their failings We end the story with people mostly abandoning the idea of the Megacity, and moving into smaller settlements, which might eventually become self-sufficient.

The aforementioned sense of disconnection, of floating in the void, which this description of the city created in the reader, is something Victoria experiences a lot. She often comments on the fact that, as a flier, she is mostly isolated from many of the problems that plague common people, like traffic and portals cutting off regions and the armed bands of looters. Victoria's connection to the "normies" faces a lot of challenges through the story, it's why we have [[https://old.reddit.com/r/WormMemes/comments/e36h1s/i_did_not_feel_much_bad_about_that_guy/f91w5pf/][this hilarious list]] of "Victoria, Cape Dictator" jokes.

That's why the end of Ward is so perfect, suicide implications aside.: It puts a capstone on not just our main character's story arc, but it also ties off the /other/ half of this world.

In short, the city being an illogical, impossible potemkin village was a deliberate choice to mirror our main character's

***** Brockton Bay never felt grounded to me. It always felt like this weird otherspace pegged onto the US. Its location is uncertain, the layout of its titular bay relative to the ocean confusing, and its origins infeasible given its absence in Bet and the lack of need for an additional city that size in that area.

I think BB is well built as a scene in itself rather than a part of a well-built world, but Ward had lots of well-built scenes like Hollow Point, the Fallen settlement, Earth Nun.

But even if you call BB good worldbuilding it's only the focus in the first half of Worm, and once you're out of it it's like it's not even there anymore.

Whenever we left the City in Ward, it always felt like it was still there connected because a lot of effort went to talking about how it was physically and diplomatically tied to the other Earths and different parts of Gimel.

**** There's a chance I'll catch flak for this, but Amy in Ward is not the same character as Amy at the end of Worm. Spoilers for both ahead.

I don't know if it's Wildbow not realising what he'd written Amy /as/, or if it's a counter-reaction on his part because of how much she's been woobified in the fandom, but her character in Ward literally, entirely revolves around wanting to rape Victoria. It's disturbing, uncomfortable to read about, and just makes me scratch my head.

I'm not trying to excuse what Amy did to Victoria in Worm -- rape or no rape, it was still /horrific/, and her running away instead of fixing what she did just makes it worse. But, compare:

Amy by the end of Worm:

#+begin_quote
  âThink back to the time in your life when you were strongest,â Panacea said.

  I did.

  Not a time when I had the Dragonfly or the flight pack. It was when I was fighting the Slaughterhouse Nine, Alexandria, Defiant and Dragon.

  âTimes when you were most scared,â she said.

  The same times.

  âI think those are the times when you're most like you. And it sucks, I know. It's horrible to think about it like that, because at least for me, it wasn't a time when I liked myself. Just the opposite.â

  âBut you came to terms with it.â

  âI owned that part of me,â she said. âAnd I can barely look Carol and Neil in the eyes, because of it. But I'm secure in who I am, and I can do this. Healing people, being a medic for the people fighting on our side.â

  I nodded.
#+end_quote

Amy in her first Ward interlude:

#+begin_quote
  Amy tensed, fists balling up, tattoos tight around her bones. âI wasn't me. I was fresh off of having my fingers eaten, my home destroyed, my life overturned. Bonesaw tried to break me. She tried to break Mark. I wasn't me. Victoria wasn't Victoria.â

  Jessica didn't interject.

  âWhat we did together doesn't count,â Amy's words were more a plea than a statement. âNot when we weren't ourselves.â
#+end_quote

By the end of Worm, after two years in the Birdcage, she's accepted what she's done, and she claims her actions were completely her own, a result of who she was. She's still bad, she's still a monster, but she's a /human/ monster, not the caricature we see in Ward; who thinks to herself she's never done anything wrong or selfish and literally spends 90% of her on-screen time trying to rape Victoria. Just.. what.

Weirdly enough, Wildbow kind of does a 180Â° on Amy by the end of Ward? Not completely, or even that much, but when we see her in the final arcs, she's (for some reason, not at all built upon or expanded) accepted that what she was doing was horrible, destroyed the patch of Victoria's skin she's been keeping in her bra (what the fuck?) and vowed to never use her power again, all after thirty minutes of forced therapy. During her epilogue, she's convinced by Crystal to move to Earth Gimel's Europe, so her and Victoria don't run a chance of seeing each-other again. That's a better ending than Taylor got.

I pretty much felt the same, but Amy gave a rather convincing explanation when Victoria asked for her help with the dreaming death virus.

Basically, after she fucked up Victoria and couldn't put her back the way she used to be, that was the /first time/ Amy discovered a limit to her power. Up until then, /whatever she wanted/, she could achieve with merely a thought. Make her adoptive mother treat her like her actual child? That can be done with brain rewriting! Make her sister reciproke her incestuous crush? Just a touch away!

When Dean talks to her after the Undersiders rob the bank, she says she /hated/ that she didn't let a kid die because if she made just /one/ mistake, people might /finally/ give her a break (the fact that that expectation is largely self-imposed shall be left aside for now).

And now? She finally has that limit, something she /just can't fix/. It lets her realize that yes, she /has/ done something monstrous and the consequences are inevitable.

Except, two years later, Khepri takes her and places her next to Victoria's mangled form, and she fixes her.

And Amy immediately goes back to how she was before. Her power could do anything, she could to whatever she wanted, if she let herself. That's literally what she tells Jessica Yamada.

The turning point only comes when Hunter titans, removing any chance of Amy fixing her ever again.

--------------

I think these are all character traits that are consistent between Worm and Ward. Her constant struggle with having almost absolute power, her unwillingness to own up to things she did, and an ability to warp the facts to paint herself as the victim.

****** The problem with that is that Worm never hinted that Victoria being dropped next to Amy after Gold Morning would reverse her character arc. It was left as a hopeful ending to Amy and Victoria's story, where after accepting that she is a bad person and what happened is her fault, Amy is given a chance to undo her greatest crime.

Now, if Ward had actually explored the effects of this on her psyche and what it did to her development, then that would be interesting and explain her actions to the readers. Instead, Ward spends about 1,500,000 words pretending that she's the same character as in Worm before revealing how different she really is, and it isn't even until ~95% of the way through the story that we actually get this explanation at all. By this point, it's too late. Not only is it too late, but it actively undermines the ending of Worm (as do many other parts of Ward).

And considering that the second main theme of Ward (after 'recovery/overcoming trauma') is 'taking responsibility and becoming a better person', taking a character who had done exactly that by the end of the first serial and have them throw away all of their character progress so they can serve as an antagonist undermines one of the most significant parts of Ward as well. How are we supposed to laud the main characters for striving to overcome their flaws when we know that they could suddenly throw away everything they've achieved for no viable reason because the plot demands it? How are we supposed to celebrate the victories of the main characters when we know that the main characters of the first serial achieving those same victories just a couple of years earlier were immediately undone so Ward can have some conflict?

One thing I did dislike somewhat was Sancia's powers. While overall the magic system is strong, I felt they sometimes seemed like "here is this problem I made up, see how she is clever for finding the solution I made up".

****** I read the first couple of chapters a while back and dropped it. Somehow despite the author literally writing the OG Hachiman insert fanfiction, his voice seemed lacking when I read it originally. Does it get better after a couple of chapters?

Also if you want recommendations, here are a couple more politically focused fics that I've enjoyed. They're not solely focused on politics, but the background is political enough that it works. These are pretty popular so there's a good chance you might have read some of these. Hopefully at least one is something you're unfamiliar with.

#+begin_quote
  This Romance of the Three Kingdom's SI is a decentish fic that does a good job of scratching the political intrigue itch. SI is the eldest son of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shao][Yuan Shao]] (Benchu) and is thrust directly into of the most volatile periods of Chinese history. Its biggest flaw is that it's too short, but thankfully it's still ongoing and we can see how the story develops. Tthe story does a fantastic job of balancing between giving the SI the ability to have a significant impact with keeping the SI from being too OP.

  This is my favorite Code Geass fanfiction in existence. It's also high up on my list of favorite fanfics of all time. It does a great job of taking the simple premise of a Lelouch who didn't get himself exiled and runs with it. Lelouch does his best to use intellect to navigate the intricacies of Britannian court politics. At times it can get a bit Lelouch OP, but if you can get past that flaw, the story is a delight to read. Special shoutout to the Milly chapter. The author does a great job of capturing her essence and I always have a smile while re-reading that part. It's sadly abandoned, but what we have is beautiful.

#+begin_quote
  This story does a fantastic job of toeing the line between uplift fic and political fic. I have a healthy amount of cynicism regarding uplift fics since they tend to be extremely unrealistic. The SI often is greatest engineer/scientist to ever live who also has perfect memory of every useful piece of historical science knowledge possible resulting in what best can be described as uplift porn than anything resembling a story.

  Thankfully this story does a great job of being fairly realistic regarding what a single human with very little power in the grand scheme of things can accomplish. Skagos improves, but it doesn't become the center of all human civilization. The political storylines tend to be more background, but when they are front and center the storylines are quite well written. Abandoned, but worth a read for sure.

#+begin_quote
  This is a really fun fiction. The SI merges with the President of the Irish Free-States pre-WW2. With what power he has, he does what he can to prepare the Irish nation for what's about to happen. This includes basic war prep, implementing new economic policies, improving Ireland's development, immigration policies, ect. It toes the line between uplift and political. The biggest criticism of this fic is that it seems to stick to a historical deterministic perspective. That whatever the SI does, WW2 and the genocide of the Jewish people is inevitable and all the Si can do is minimize the devastation. Other than that, it's still a fun fiction that takes a perspective that's not often seen. You also get a really interesting view of Irish history and political issues of the time period. Author gets deep into the details.

Not very rational or munchkinry or scientific but a good read, treats magic as both cheap cast spells and has moments of True Capital M fullblown Magic.

It's half lit rpg with only levels and skills, no number fudging or grinding thou so its in the sweetspot between boring and unpredictable, skills are awarded on slow progression of class actual expirience, a bit on plot luck, stronger skills come from merit and novel situations.

It's also unusual for being almost entirely mosaic novels; more integrated than short story collections but with various authors (GRRM and his old RPG group; he was the GM and is the editor) writing different pieces. The early books are a series of trilogies; the first two books of each trilogy are primarily setting pieces, consisting of vignettes about various characters which also set up the conflict and circumstances in the background, and the third brings the conflict to a head and has almost all the chapters pointed toward the climax and resolution. The series has always taken place in real time, so the lengthy pause (1990-2008, IIRC) and rebooted series changed a lot about the world (and the writers); it's not quite as good.

***** [having read up to ~ch40]

It's clear that the author doesn't have that level of knowledge himself, which means that the things he says are flawed in many ways. Let me point out some of the mistakes he makes

- He describes entire crowds as the same person

  - This is common in chinese webnovels, where the crowd acts as a single character. This emphasizes that only people with a personality stand out, and the only people given personalities are main characters, or the people they interact with. This is reasonable in real life in china, because of their culture of not standing out when they are not in positions of power, but it's stretched thin in the scenarios of the story.

- He doesn't understand other professions

  - The MC 'gambled' and won a Gu. The host of the shop was angry that somebody won. Absolutely wrong. Gambling shops run off the payments people make - the shopkeeper already made 60 spirit stones off the MC and he can use this as publicity to attract more customers, to give him more money. The Gu was inside a stone, and the shopkeeper didn't know if it contained the Gu. He never really 'owned' the Gu, since he already decided to sell the stone. If anything, he should be overjoyed.

- He consistently makes suboptimal decisions because he refuses to be kind

  - This can be excused away by his callous past, but this does not make him a competent character, nor make his decisions correct.
  - E.g. He had a relationship with his brother which he could've used to gain resources, but he cut it off for no benefits. The MC began in a position of relative power over his brother, and if he had extended kindness to him then, he would've benefitted for a long time.
  - I haven't read far enough to see how it ends up, but where I stopped the MC had antagonized or made an enemy of almost everyone who knew him, except the barkeeper. Some were necessary as part of his plan, but he needlessly antagonized the people in power (the people protecting him from being instantly turned to mincemeat by aforementioned everyone). Emphasis on 'needlessly'. If his '500 years' makes him capable of perfectly predicting people, then he should know how to wrap everyone around his pinky. But either he doesn't (bad decision making) or he can't (he isn't that smart and instead it was just plot armour all along).

It doesn't matter how 'smart' the MC is, if the author isn't as knowledgeable. Writing a character smarter than yourself is /hard/ and if you do it wrong, then it won't be rational.

Let me give you a counter example, The King's avatar suffers on point 1, but succeeds on points 2 and 3. The author genuinely understands the stuff he's talking about. He still tries writing a character smarter than himself, and there are artefacts from that, but they're tiny in comparison to reverend insanity. To put into context, TKA has an academic character, and even though none of the other characters are academically inclined (which means the author likely isn't either), the actions and words of the academic seemed perfectly consistent with how I'd expect a real academic to think.

Or take Way of Choices for example. I haven't read it in a long time, but it presented a smart character without overstepping his capabilities.

Reverend Insanity is solidly better than average, but a rational fiction it is not.

****** The gambler was angry because he consecutively won and that he was running out of prizes.

He cut off most relationships because they weren't useful for him as they would take too much time to develop and he needed to leave the village soon due to the wolf tide. He wanted to leave as quickly as possible to capitalize on his advantages from reincarnating before there were too many changes due to the butterfly effect.

I understand your hesitation to continue with the story but I would really recommend sticking with it. Maybe you can look at the manhua, if that easier to read(up till its updated at least). But trust me on this, it is some of the most rational fiction I've seen. It does state that mobs become dumber as they increase in number which is true to quite an extent.

More importantly, the philosophy of the series really shines through after a few chapters. The mc is a perfect mc for this type of world, where an individual can go against a community's decision, and the philosphy and world-building built around that is amazing. I love how it explores how sects interact with demonic cultivators and its take on philosophy is really amazing, sometimes more subtle.

Edit: Please do respond

10/10 maybe a bit slow to start. Everything becomes 10 times better after he leaves the village so please read at least up till there

** Good fics or similar works to The Count of Monte Cristo? (My own recommendation would be the anime adaptation.)
