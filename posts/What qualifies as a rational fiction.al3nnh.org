I know the examples. But how do you "bound" it to an information theorist? For clarification, consider the hypothetical:

"One has been able to come up with a literature parsing engine using some form of highly advanced NLP. You are allowed to use high-level speech as input to this engine in order to make it categorize the entire published library of human-kind and one of the parameters you want is that the piece of work is rational. You could say that a certain set of rational books as exemplary inputs might do the job, but what if you need a more specific definition."

I've gone through the previous subs, and I've yet to come across a well-bounded answer for this. That being said, it's not as if the other genres are well-constrained.

Note: I'm looking for a one-level deeper analogy which considers the case of "Every story qualifies as a piece of rational fiction and projects thoughtful behavior relative to its original author. A language parsing engine wouldn't necessarily be able to differentiate between an agent in a story coming up with actions vs an agent coming up with a story with actions".

I don't agree. An author might intentionally write a story that does not qualify as a rational fiction despite being very rational themselves. I suspect this is rather common actually.

An irrational author might even write something that qualifies as a rational fiction without quite meaning to.

******** There is plenty of good fiction that simply isn't written to be rational, and that doesn't necessarily imply inability to do so on the author's part.

For example, fantasy stories with soft magic systems such as Lord of the Rings. I am sure many of the authors of such books could write a hard magic system if they were interested in doing so.

Some people also don't count Worm as rational because it tries to construct a rational powers system for its predetermined setting of Superheroes vs Supervillains rather than construct a setting based on the existence of powers. Though I don't quite understand or agree with that perspective.

Although Ward seems to be less popular than Worm with the [[/r/rational]] community (for what I think are fairly petty reasons - the protagonist is less of a stereotypical ratfic protagonist than Taylor in terms of personality), it seems like it would actually be /likelier/ to qualify as rational by this standard - the superheroes/supervillains dynamic seems to be breaking down now that the factors enforcing it have changed.

******** Categories of rational story, fitting whatever definition of "rational" you want to use: - written by an author who wanted to write a rational story - written by an author who didn't want to write a rational story, but did anyways - written by an author who didn't consider whether or not they wanted to write a rational story

The same categories apply for irrational fiction.

Thus, we have a 2x3 grid of

#+begin_example
    [irrational, irrational]
  x [wanted to and did, didn't want to but did, didn't consider wants]
#+end_example

Whether a story is rational or not is separate from whether or not the author intended to write a rational story, much the same as whether someone intended to write a work without with or without using the letter 'z'. The story has a 'z' in it no matter what the author's intent was.

** Okay this is entirely outside my wheelhouse- you want some kind of machine-learning implementable definition of rational fiction?

I don't know if that's really possible even in the abstract. Ratfic isn't really a genre, it can cross virtually any medium- it's more like a tag on existing genres. The only shared quality is that the character's behavior seems thoughtful and informed, given the rules of whatever world they exist in. You could do some kind of parsing for written speech and thought that have higher "Thoughtfulness" scores, I guess? Beyond that, a certain amount of genre-awareness seems pretty common, maybe you could cross-reference against tvtropes articles to find significant matches?

*** "Okay this is entirely outside my wheelhouse- you want some kind of machine-learning implementable definition of rational fiction?"

Yeah. I was trying to rethink everything I've read in HpMor and all of the others as being -rightly captured- some kind of machine learning process.

I'm trying to model the feasibility/practicality of Hierarchical Temporal Memories and this seemed like a fair thought experiment.

What you're suggesting in terms of "cross-referencing" and "thoughtful" and "informed" is really what's bothering me. They almost feel like the *Words of False Comprehension*. I mean I get the idea. But when I'm thinking in terms of agent behavior, I can't quite mark a tipping point apart from this that some models are simply more accurate in such portrayals than others. Which I presume you've defined with the "Thoughtfulness" score.

***** I'm just going to try and pen down my dissection to the problem, or at least what I've gathered till now:\\
The agents in HpMor act in order to achieve a certain end-goal.\\
Compare that to an agent of a different fictional narrative where they act in a certain way which doesn't really convey a targeted end-goal, but rather suggests them being part of a plot device by which the Author is trying to capture/project/portray a certain insight/philosophy to their story.\\
Therefore, a rational agent(a character in a story/author) acts towards an intended end goal, whereas an NPC styled agent/story reacts to the happenstances about them which don't really seem to have an endpoint, or the way that brings forth the endpoint seems convoluted and too deus ex machina-ey.

****** I don't know think I quite understand what you're trying to say. But a rational fiction is supposed to be that a rotional/NPC styles agent who, with the information he has and his personality as previously established, makes the choices that he makes naturally, not to advance the plot forcefully. A more common rational story that we usually encounter on this sub is that the agent is rational, and he is supposed to make the rational decision with the information he has, but some stories do not take into account personality, emotions when those decisions are made but they still seem to fit the mold. I don't know, the requirements for rational fiction are not very rigid.

** You have posed this question in a weird way. it seems you are two steps further in your thought process than where your understanding of definitions are. You are asking the question in terms of Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Hierarchical Temporal Memories when you should be asking it in simpler ways. What about the standard definitions of rational fiction are you not understanding, or do not satisfy a coherent idea to you?

**** *The Intention* To create a coherent interesting story in which a protagonist overcomes obstacles in a way devoid of cheap author tricks. Where cheap author tricks can include the protag luckily stumbling upon an item or person that they need or the protag remembering something integral to the plot, before unknown to the reader, that they were told as a child. There are lots of these tricks out there and I'm sure you can think of more of them.

*The Realization* Lets observe hpmor. We know exactly how the protag processes information (We are given a list of books from which he references). The protag will not have any 'secret knowledge' by which to judge things that are unknown to the reader. The actions of the protag are completely understandable if we know how they think and what input is given to them.

Another way to think about it. is a rational protag can be seen as a function f(x). If they are truly rational we can understand that function and when given input 'x' from the environment (literary universe) it is entirely possible to know what the outcome of the function is before the author writes it.

I could probably whittle this down a lil more if you want, but thats all imna write for now.

Categories like “games” and particular genres of fiction don't tend to have some single qualifying metric. What we consider ratfic just has to resemble other ratfic closely enough that the comparison doesn't seem like a reach.

**** "Every story at least makes sense to the author." Is exactly the kind of optimistic overestimate that comes from somebody who hasn't read enough stories. The driving force behind rational fiction is that, if you take a vanilla story, no bits and bobs, and then run a simple sanity check on it, /it will fail/. There are very few stories that are internally self-consistent in a way that suggests the author seriously comprehended what they were writing in its entirety. And if we check back in on reality, that fits our intuitions - a novel is a /really large/ piece of information. You couldn't ask an author to recount their own novel word-for-word, and they wrote it, so it makes sense that they encounter problems with scale and consistency.

(I understand the assertion that "every story makes sense to the author" - you're saying that, if it hadn't made sense, they wouldn't have come up with it. But you have to understand that creativity in humans is /a lot/ like the generative processes neural networks engage in - until we refine our criteria of a valid output to include certain parameters, our output won't be consistent with those parameters. If the act of writing is divorced completely from the act of scrutinizing writing, then it makes sense that stories won't hold up to scrutiny. They weren't made to.)

New Criticism founder I.A. Richards once postulated [[https://sites.google.com/site/rushblugerman/i-a-richards---four-layers-of-meaning][four layers of meaning]]: literal context, mood, tone, and intent. These were framed from the perspective of the critic - for the typical author, these proceses are unknown to them, and thus largely automatic. However, while mood, tone, and intent are all greatly important to a story's critical reception (think of all of the accolades a novel gets where it is described as "thrilling" or "deeply symbolic") and thus authors learn how to communicate with them, the literal meaning of a story is often overlooked. This leads to lots of popular stories that are really good at eliciting emotions in readers but not very good at convincing readers of their reality, in the same way that a textbook presents its own contents as reality.

That isn't to say that popular stories have no logical consistency, just that their authors aren't optimizing for logical consistency. Rational fiction doesn't really propose optimizing for logical consistency either - instead, its main goal is to eliminate the /most common/ and /most stupid/ ways that stories become logically inconsistent, by plucking a lot of the low hanging fruit. The most naive way to do this is to read through the story, one event at a time, and ask yourself "does this make sense?" the same way that a hungry youtube theorist would ask the question, and then give the story element a pass if it survives five minutes of scrutiny. For more important elements, bump that level of scrutiny up to ten or twenty minutes, because those are the parts of the story attention is going to naturally be drawn to. Rational fiction as defined in the sidebar is a bit more advanced - it gives a set of heuristics for asserting rationality that will work unaccompanied by this kind of scrutiny (although, of course, you should still think things through anyway).

I hope at least one of the definitions there (or their aggregate) answers your question.
