** I'm not familiar with the abbreviation - what does "SI" stand for?

EDIT: Oh. I knew the term, but not the abbreviation for it. All that was coming to mind was "Singularity Intelligence", "Systeme International", and "self-injury", none of which seemed to fit. Thanks!

*** Self-insert. As far as I'm aware, it's gone from meaning a /literal/ self-insert into a fictional setting, though it certainly can be, to imply something more like portal fantasy that happens to be fanfiction.

Usually I see "SI" to mean a traditional self insert, with "SI OC" meaning a non-author (but otherwise "regular") person inserted into a story.

***** Not quite. The OC part of SI OC does stand for original character, but generally it just means that the author has inserted themselves into a character that wasn't originally in the setting.

**** I personally would prefer for SI to mean both, does this work?

SI=author as character is in the fiction

** Fun start, but the in-progress mark comes before anything really interesting has happened. Better to leave it alone and come back if / when it's a decent length.
