**** I'd give it another 10 chapters, if it doesn't grab you by then, maybe look for something else. The story does get better as it goes along, but saying "you need to read 100 chapters to know if you like it" isn't useful advice.

**** It really is.

I, personally, enjoyed it even back when there were only a couple dozen chapters. The translation quality falls off a bit after chapter 79 (when the original translator was bought out by the publishing company), and so I hadn't read much of it since then.

That said, I just caught up after noticing this post. The second story arc, starting around chapter 100, looks to be significantly better than the first. The first arc contains a lot of worldbuilding, and a relatively low-stakes academic rivalry plot going on alongside. The actual story seems to start shortly after that, and it's... really quite something. Unfortunately, that's also around the point where the translation ends.

Fortunately, the translation is going at a regular pace, and there are, at present, /2187 chapters/ actually written. If you want to wait for a completed story, there'll be a lot of waiting left to do... so if you're not convinced yet, you may as well wait for more translation.

** Good timing. In chapter 111 we see the first flickers of what was described in [[/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/][this review]]. The cultivators in any other xianxia novel would say, "The muggles are on their own. Might makes right." Here, the cultivators willingly sacrifice themselves to save innocent lives.
