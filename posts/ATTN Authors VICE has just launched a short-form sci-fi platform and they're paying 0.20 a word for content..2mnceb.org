** Fuck, now I *have* to write that Roomba story.

In all seriousness, at first glance this seems pretty cool, but how do this stack up against other ways of making money with short fiction?

*** Not great. Only 52 submissions accepted a year. Word length limit: 2000.

On the other hand, if you have an in with the editor (like the people who will actually be accepted will) that's a few hundred dollars for maybe a couple of days hard writing and editing...that you have almost zero chance of earning by emailing that address.

Hmm.

So really, more of a standard open-call (slim) chance to get published than a way to make real cash monies fast.

Just as impossible. But do it anyway. But don't quit your day job.

That depends on how big Terraform gets. At 0.20 a word and opening with huge names like Doctorow and Sterling, things are looking good. If you get published by them (and they earn a strong reputation) than you have a very nice credit to put on any CV you send to a publisher when you try to get your novel published. It could, potentially, help. As a way to eventually make money by writing novels.

No one makes livable money writing short fiction.

(and actually, even income from novels is very rare, but at least that's in the realm of possibility)

** Is there a way to get an RSS feed of "Terraform" without the rest of "Motherboard"? The whole feed is too much content for me.

edit: Got it [[http://motherboard.vice.com/rss?tag=terraform]]

** I'll have to think on this. Normally ideas are cheap and it's all in the execution, but I'm not sure that I have any ideas in my scrap pile that can fit into a story of 2,000 words or less. Maybe I'll dust off one of my old stories about a fiction-writing robot, but that might be a little too meta.
