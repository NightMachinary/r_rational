** I think that the high volume of rationalist fanfiction is a natural growth of a new genre. There are a lot of existing fantasy/scifi works that are viable targets for fanfics, and so these are the low-hanging fruit. That someone is doing the labour and picking these low-hanging fruits is a good sign, it means there's pent-up demand for the material.

I think the next stage of the growth of the genre will happen when the fanfic readers/authors age a bit, and start writing /for real/ (TM). There are early signs this is already happening - I like to think [[/u/salaris]] (Andrew Rowe), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][ShaperV]] (E William Brown), [[/u/FekketCantenel]] (Fiona van Dahl), [[/u/Raelifin]] (Max Harms) are the leading edge of rationalist authors. Other authors ([[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12130438.Dennis_E_Taylor][Dennis Taylor]], Brandon Sanderson?) are +stealing+ reusing the best ideas from rationalism and incorporating it in their works. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll see the genre grow, change, and be incorporated in more works.

*** One should also not forget Sturgeon's Law, that 90% of everything is crap, other genres just make this slightly less obvious because they are popular enough that you don't hear about quite as much of the terrible stuff. You should expect that the more popular something becomes the more the refuse simply doesn't come to your attention.

*Man Booker leans literary/historical, the Pulitzer is for works 'preferably dealing with American life' and therefore wouldn't include much fantasy, and I'm sure I'm not an outlier for not checking the Nobel list for pleasure fiction reading. On the other hand, loads of great fantasy has been exposed through the Newberry, Hugo, Nebula, Locus, World Fantasy Award, etc., which are varying degrees of mainstream but admittedly not as well known as the three mentioned.

*** Thanks for the shout out!

While I do draw some of my inspiration from rational fiction personally, I think there have been some other lines of genre development that are producing similar results. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_fantasy][*Hard fantasy*]] as a genre predates the more recent concept of rational fiction, and shares many of the same characteristics.

Sanderson isn't stealing/reusing rational fiction ideas - his works predate them. (Elantris was published in 2005, and the Mistborn trilogy from 2006 to 2008. HPMOR started in 2010.) And Sanderson wasn't the first to write in this style - his "Laws of Magic" just popularized the idea.

I actually see this as a good thing - Sanderson's works predating/paralleling the development of rational fic just helps put more content out there that's going to be inspired by similar ideals.

I've drawn some influences from both Sandersonish traditional fiction and rational fic; I'd say that Forging Divinity was primarily Sanderson-inspired, whereas Sufficiently Advanced Magic was highly influenced by things like HPMOR and Mother of Learning.

All my books also draw from my background as a Systems Designer. My books are set in a universe I've been using for tabletops and LARPs for the last two decades. The cosmology iand some of the magic systems are drawn from those games, although the more recent one in Sufficiently Advanced Magic is more JRPG inspired. I'm also a professional game designer, and gaming is a big part of what has influenced the clear forms of progression and challenges in my writing.

You can see other people with gaming inspiration that write similar works - Maoyuu, Rokka no Yuusha, and Log Horizon, for example, all have similar elements to rational fiction, but they seem to draw primarily from gaming as their inspiration for this kind of rational/internally consistent style.

I'm digressing a bit here, but my core point is actually that I think there have been parallel developments that have led to similar styles of fiction.

Sanderson embracing the idea of hard magic systems and internal consistency has done a lot for popularizing these concepts in the fantasy community - which is a good thing for rational fiction, because rational fiction is extremely similar to what Sanderson is writing and popularizing.

I mentioned Sanderson because [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31176804-snapshot][his most recent works]] feels very much ripped from the pages of Mother of Learning or similar time-loopy stories. That's why I referenced Sanderson - not because I think his older works are the slightest bit rational, but because his latest works feel like a departure from his style, maybe into rationalism.

There's also a rising bubble of /consistent/ literature, namely the genres you mentioned: JRPG, LitRPG, Hard Fantasy, etc, where the universes are designed to have internally consistent rules. Sanderson is famous for this and his laws of magic. In these genres, authors agree to give up rule-breaking in exchange for credibility; the magical universe JK Rowling designed is silly and falls apart under scrutiny, the story only survives on the strength of the cast, the magical universe of Sanderson's cosmere is interesting, even devoid of a cast.

*** Whoo, I got a mention!

At least in my case, you've got it pegged. I started with fanfic as a teen and used it both for therapy purposes and learning from beginner mistakes. On that foundation, I've written ten novels (published two). Across everything I've written, the thread has been rationalism, because it all has to make /sense,/ as OP laid out. I see lots of my generation's writers going through this same growth process, and it's a lot of fun to participate in.

#+begin_quote
  when those same friends *attempt to search for* more rational stories, they're suddenly waist-deep in countless HP/Naruto/FiM fanfics, most of which are incomplete or abandoned.
#+end_quote

(Bolds mine.) I'm seeing this as the central issue, really. Anytime you get into a new genre/medium/fandom/whatever, there's a lot of crap to sort through. What help are reviews, recommendations, and favorites/awards lists. (Oh, hell, I just realized that there's no rationalist fiction award. That would be a start. (edit: [[/u/vakusdrake]] has the right idea.)) Those things will come up in Google once they're established; until then, when getting someone into the genre, you might tell them, 'Don't bother with Google; check [[/r/rational]] for more.'

(semi off-topic) As for the point about overpowered rationalist characters and 'giving Sauron the Death Star' --- am I the only one recently getting a hankering to just write straight-up wish fulfillment and competence porn? I haven't gotten around to brainstorming any yet (I still need to write a trilogy-closing novel in which someone is going to be slowly and +un-+half-willingly turned into an alien needle spider), but I think about it every time everyone talks about how all fiction needs conflict and suffering. Why can't things just be beautifully nice?

(P.S. my favorite 'giving Sauron the Death Star' example has to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][rationalist!Animorphs]], because I'm starting to think their Visser Three is unstoppable)

**** The first thing that comes to mind when I think of overpowered protagonists and wish fulfillment is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9912044/1/Hope-Through-Overwhelming-Firepower][Hope Through Overwhelming Firepower]]. It's a worm fic that imports Taylor's different power from a universe where the power scales are so much larger than Worm's that Taylor really faces little threat. Admittedly, the power is crippled when she gets it and needs to repair itself, so at first Taylor's 'just' a very powerful Blaster, but she quickly gets stronger and just as quickly tries to figure out how she can use her powers to help. When I look back on it, though, despite the fact that Taylor never /really/ feels like she's in true danger, I generally think of it as a fun romp that didn't overstay its welcome.

Another thing that comes to mind is One Punch Man. As a premise, by all rights it should be boring. "Invincible guy who kills everything he fights in one punch". What can you do with that? Do you throw enemies at him who are too fast to hit, or something? But the setting only affirms Saitama as invincible, instead focusing on his inability to get proper recognition for his heroic works or the struggle of the side characters who, while strong, can face true danger so long as Saitama's not there to insta-win the fight.

If I may get analytical, I would guess that when people say conflict is needed for good stories, it's referring to how conflict draws outcomes into doubt in meaningful ways. When whether your protagonist will live or die depends on whether he can win the fight against Evil Monster Man, your immersed self isn't confident that the protagonist will survive, and the future is cast into doubt. For something like One Punch Man, once you're invested in Saitama getting the recognition he deserves, and Saitama then goes and does another amazing thing, the immersed you wants to know but can't be sure whether Saitama will get recognition. For a peaceful story, then, what you first need is to immerse people in the story, and then you need to find a way to draw the future into doubt. An easy option for this is research and experimental results, if the protagonists' plans depend on the experiment working out one way, you can build up tension and anticipation for the result just the same as if there was actual conflict and struggle.

***** The One Punch Man analogy is actually very good. I think you capture it well.

If challenge isn't going to be the main point of the story, there has to be some non-violent conflict that the plot turns on.

This is like playing a tabletop roleplaying game with a group who has optimized for combat. If you want something they can't just steamroll, make them do some things subtly or with intrigue.

** Well, I think for some budding rationalist authors early in their writing attempts, a pre-established world to play in to work on the rationalist aspect of writing is a great starting place. A perfect example is Alexander Wales who wrote Metropolitan Man and Branches on the Tree of Time as rational fanfiction, but has moved into world-building fiction like Glimwarden, Shadows of the Limelight, and a few good original world short stories.

One of the major flaws in your theory is simply that you are primarily looking at free online works of fiction which obviously is going to bring in a fair number of budding authors with little editing. If you do the same with almost any other genre, the free online material is going to have a notable quality drop and probably have more examples of fanfiction. That's not a disservice to any particular genre it is just the nature of online writing.

*** That's fair. For the genre of RF, it seems like most if not all /explicitly rational/ works are in the “free online” category - but this is likely tied in with [[/u/Afforess]] 's point that rational fiction is a very new genre, and currently we're witnessing the growing pains of its development.

As a separate, but related point: in my mind, Metropolitan Man stands somewhere close to the border between rational fanfiction and original rational fiction. Wales didn't take an existing /story/ and add in rational characters/elements; he took a few well-known characters, added more rational thought processes and motivations to said characters, and then wrote an entirely original story around them.

Maybe that's simply the difference between /good/ and /bad/ fanfiction (which seems supported by Yudkowsky's Rules of Fanfiction), but when so much fanfiction falls into the latter group, perhaps more categorical distinctions (or, as [[/u/FekketCantenel]] suggests, some specific RF awards) are needed.

** Regarding your second bullet point, I think we have a phrase for this- /If you make Frodo a Jedi, you must give Sauron the Death Star/. Powering up the protagonist is one thing, powering up everything else to match is another.

A second problem is the /sustainability/ of conflict. Two people with clubs, and two people with guns, are equally balanced conflicts, but the latter will still be over much faster. The best example, I think, is /Rules of Wishing/. Alladin, Jasmine and Jafar are all savvy enough to roughly match each other, but since the powers quickly escalate to WMD levels, it's all over in a couple of "moves" anyway.

** The claim that it's a writing cop out to use someone else's world for a rational fic is ridiculous--in fact, it's the opposite. In an original work, if it's found that such-and-such a plot point is irrational or dumb, then the author can shrug their shoulders and unilaterally change the rules of the world to avoid the issue. When using someone else's world, rather than ducking around the issue, the writer is more often than not forced to explain why it's consistent. This may result in minor alterations or reinterpretations, but it's vastly more intellectually honest than being able to define the world from the start. It invokes the imagery of a physicist struggling to explain the phonomenon around them, and not painters slapping paint wherever they damn well feel like putting it, even if it clashes.

Consider Metropolitan Man. If this were an original rational work, with a freakish alien coming to earth with the powers of a demigod, is there any guarantee that it has a weakness, let alone a magic rock? Does it follow from that simple premise that Superman must have an easily applied Achille's heel? I don't think so, and discovering that he was weak to copper would be considered incredibly narratively lazy and convenient. But Alexander Wales wasn't working with just his own world, he was reconstructing someone else's, and so he was forced to explain why Kryptonite was a thing.

Given the premise of "Superman exists, and his greatest ally is a reporter and his greatest enemy is a businessman and his greatest weakness is a green rock", Wales was forced to constrain his work within those sharply defined boundaries. There can be no cop-outs, no asspulls, no deus ex machina where it would come in conflict with the basic premise. An original work can redefine the premise at will. A rational fanfiction has no such flexibility and is thus anchored by its original canon, lest it cease to be Superman.

I disagree. While I wouldn't reach so far as to call it a cop out (though we've all run across some works that cop out /hard/), I think it's much easier to write something in a world that's already been made for you. Like.../orders of magnitude/ easier. This doesn't mean writing a good story is easy. But it's definitely less work, both from a creative and actuary standpoint.

The internal conflicts within an existing world propel the writing forward in a way that is much more difficult in your own world.

  Fanfic authors use the fact that they're building off of well-known canons to completely skip any significant world-building or character detail. Not only does this naturally exclude readers who aren't as familiar with the original canon, but it seems like a bit of a writing copout - the fanfic author is essentially piggy-backing off of the “heavy lifting” of the original canon.
#+end_quote

Point, but this is essentially the same thing that new writers in established IPs (comics, movies, any other collaborative work on a single canon) do all the time. Any author writing in a genre using tropes is doing this too, to a greater or lesser extent, and I've seen fanfictions with better character development than published novels. To be derivative is to be human, fanfiction just embraces it as a contraint and jumping-off point.

#+begin_quote
  Related to the above, because these rational fanfics often don't have the same “meat” (character development, fully fleshed out rational worlds, etc) behind them as their original counterparts, they usually end up abandoned. I've found very few rational fanfic stories that are actually finished.
#+end_quote

Counterpoint: Stories go unfinished all the time, both in and out of the set of rational fanfics. When something's released serially online as it's being written, of course you see more examples of abandoned work, and it just happens that "released serially online" is the usual medium for ratfic.

What you're talking about is nothing new. It's the logical result of the principle that 90-99% of everything written is bad. It's part of the growing pains of a new genre. When very few people write in the style, someone who likes the genre quickly runs out of their 1-10% slice of goodness into the morass of poorly-conceived, abandoned, and badly-written work out there. I know this, because I've written a few poorly-conceived, badly-written, and ultimately abandonned bits of ratfic. Writing is /hard/.

Fanfic itself is smack-dab in the middle of this. The sheer accessibility (to writers) and availability (to readers) of the genre means that people tend to see the 99% of awful fanfic much more clearly than the 1% of good stuff. Ratfic, insofar as it overlaps with fanfic, is tarred by this as well. This isn't a judgement, just an observation. Fantasy and sci-fi went through the same crisis over the last half-century. You've got Heinlein, and then you have the pulp magazine featuring an alien robot kidnapping a naked woman. You've got Ursula K. LeGuin, and then you have muscly orcs kidnapping a naked woman.

So, yeah. I'd argue that you're essentially right. The high volume of bad things tarnishes the good things by association. The bad things are mostly fanfic, because that has the lowest barrier to entry, just like bad fantasy tended to center around a few archetypes, or student films fall into the same traps of bad cinema over and over.

However, I'd argue that it's a bit silly to try and do anything drastic about it. Any step we take to "curate" the volume of rational fiction means raising the barrier to entry, which is unfeasible and contrary to the point. Writers get better by writing, so let them write. We could start petitioning writers to start removing records of abandoned work from the internet, I guess, but that's a lot of work that fixes the symptoms, not the issue.

I think the trick here is basically: wait, and write. Sometimes someone new will write something really cool, even if it's abandoned. Someone else might be inspired by that, and write something they actually finish. That has new ideas that get disseminated. And so on. Eventually, the cream floats to the top. Removing milk doesn't get you /more cream/. The only way to do that is to keep adding, and keep churning. (I don't actually know how cream is made)

So, ways to improve: provide mentorship and community to people who want to write ratfic. Allow discussion of new ideas, and embrace both originality and iterative improvement on that which has come before. Make writing /good/ ratfic more accessible rather than trying to make writing /bad/ ratfic less accessible.

It looks like the rest of the community has weighed in with basically similar points, but this is my take on it.

** I think part of the reason that there are so many rational fanfictions as opposed to original ratfic is that it's easier in many ways to make a rational fanfiction than it is to make an original fiction. It takes much less work overall and I think we can all agree that writing rational fiction at /all/ takes more work than the average story.

It's easier for me to look at Naruto and say "well, of course chakra gundams make no goddamn sense based on the rules established!" than to create an entirely new world with a consistent set of rules and lore that manages to still be entertaining. Fanfiction makes writing overall easier (not that writing good fanfiction is easy but, outside of hardcore AU's, the canon provides a framework for you to "lean" your work against.)

** TL;DR: I think the more the merrier, and we have to live with consequences if we want to read more good works.

Think of it as a lure. When genre becomes popular, more people who like to write and create just wonder about, and then may try their luck and ultimately, whether their fruits of labour of (writing) love are good or not, they will learn, and possibly spread the word further.

Problems is, when genre has famous independent works that you can count on fingers of one hand, it shows its infancy. When the volume of written stories is high, probability of writers with good potential popping out is higher - and *we want that*.

You seem to criticize /bad/ fanfiction stories. But it doesn't have to have anything to do with worldbuilding or lack of it. You can take a EU and play with it - and your protagnist may as well bulldoze trought obstacle, or hit a wall devised by great antagonist, that will end up in high quality confrontation. Setting place for such events also takes certain skill, if you want your alterations to the universe to stay within predefined limits, especially if the changes are subtle. It's just different type of skill than playing a god and starting from scratch.

But is it something bad, that authors skip the 'design from zero' phase? I think not - this is not a defining characteristic of a good story - even badly written one, with lot of mistakes from lack of experience can be entertaining, no need to thwart further efforts. Quite the contrary, I think - because writers need to practice on something. *Constructive criticism needs source material*.

If anything, more threads akin to worldbuilding should appear here, like 'applied rational villainy 101: guide to creating conflicts and escalation', or 'how not to OP'.

But statistic is a bitch: It is unavoidable, that at some point there will be flood of low-effort stories, and *you can't do anything about it*, because where there is no will (hence low-effort, no low-quality, that's the effect, not the cause), there will be no learning.

In the end we will point out and promote good works - so writers coming across new challenge will instantly see the better material - and I think this is exactly what this subreddit is about.

** So i know its kinda offtopic but i dont think Worm, Mother of learning or Practical Guide to Evil ever were specifically meant to be written as "rational" fiction described in the side bar.

Those 4 rules are basically rules of ANY good book and adding an additional label to them as rational fiction irks me because then most of well made fiction would be rational. In most good books things dont happen from nowhere. In most books characters act on their beliefs and values as it humanizes them and consistent rules are almost a must, really. Ofcourse it varies from book to book but they are the general things you could find in any decent one.

I am glad the authors get the recognition they deserve as i have enjoyed their works and i wish them luck. Sorry for the offtopic but it always annoyed me and i wanted to get it out and the thread seemed somehow aproporiate.

On to the subject of your question its the same with everything. Majority of fiction is crap, you just dont see it because it filtered by publishers, reviewers and popularity. its just especially evident on internet because everybody and their mother, aunt, uncle, daughter and nephew can make an account of fictonpress, royalroad, wordpress, wattpad and start writing from the get go if they have anything of an artistic bone in their body or just enough of willingness to put these hours in. Its not always good and is mostly atrocious because they have never attempted writing before or learned anything worth noting from school.

I have to disagree here - rational-ising /Star Wars/ would make it a /different/ movie, and probably not a better (more enjoyable, culturally impactful) one. "Rational" works of Lovecraft... wouldn't work. /Discworld/ is, for want of a better word, antirational and all the better for it.

Sure, those four rules are key for realistic fiction aiming to evoke particular responses in the reader - but it's certainly possible to write excellent fiction without them.

*** Well, if you agree with [[/r/rational][r/rational]] 's 4 rules as being the criteria by which we judge fiction as rational or not, then Worm, MoL and PGtE are pretty clearly rational fiction, regardless of whether their authors explicitly intended them as such. I think this is fairly true of any genre - if we came up with some explicit criteria for Romance books, for instance, and someone wrote a Fantasy book that hit all those criteria, then we could certainly also consider it a Romance as well.

If you DON'T agree with the 4 rules, then what criteria would you use? If rational fiction just consists of works whose authors have decided to self-label them as RF, then the genre is more or less completely subjective, and the rational fiction label has no meaning.

And I fully agree with [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] 's point - you may tend to enjoy novels that follow those 4 rules, but those rules are clearly not the “basic rules of any good book”. /Lord of the Rings/ hits maaaaybe two of those rules, yet it still seems pretty well regarded...

**** So, for me 2nd and 3rd rule can be summarized by "Have good characters". A good character in a novel/book shouldnt be treated like a plot point but like a real human being in the story with his own worries, desires etc. and 1st and 4th rule is basically dont do "deus ex machina" although the 1st ones goes for consistent characterization too.

Ofcourse some books may follow it to some larger or smaller extent in which case for example a soft magic system wouldnt be exactly "rational" but usually it still avoids deus ex machina to not undermine narrative tensions and still follows certain even if irrational and not logical rules so the reader knows what to expect to some extent.

And maybe not all or even most books follow those 4 rules to every letter but i guarantee you that it would still be quite a lot of fiction and suddenly the genre of rational is incredibly big.

On the other hand the definition of rational is very broad also so i guess it encompasses a lot.

This can be contrasted with Two Year Emperor, which revolves around a rational character in an explicitly D&D world, completely beholden to the literal D&D rules.

Worm has some rational moments, like when Skitter tries to use her powers efficiently, but much of Worm is only rational in the trivial sense that any character who says "I'm doing this for a plan" is rational. Cauldron, the Simurgh, and the conflict drive are, from a Doylist view, completely arbitrary, even though Cauldron claims to have a plan and people acting because of a conflict drive are technically acting for a reason.

This is made worse by the propensity of both the author and fans to explain away random inconsistencies and random arbitrary character actions in Worm by invoking one of those.

Fan explanations in general are also a problem, even when they don't cover one of those. It's easy to invent a reason why some character does something, which is consistent with the story, but is not stated in the story. That doesn't make the story rational.

Apparently the fireball spell [[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271708/A_brief_history_of_the_fireball_in_fantasy_games.php][predates even D&D]]. But my broader point is, presently the fireball spell has expanded well beyond D&D, and is used in all sorts of other media (books, movies, games, etc). Same with many of the other spells in MoL. So while I agree that D&D is an influence on the work, it's certainly not D&D fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  Cauldron, the Simurgh, and the conflict drive are, from a Doylist view, completely arbitrary
#+end_quote

*Worm spoilers below*

...

Are they? Cauldron's drive seems completely logical to me.

Their founders discovered early on that Scion was actually an extra-terrestrial being with the power to easily demolish all of humanity on a whim. So their motive is the destruction of this entity, and the protection of the human race - very similar to the clearly RF premise of Metropolitan Man. They attempt to accomplish this by artificially creating more powerful parahumans, to either find a specific power that can destroy Scion, or create a fighting force strong enough to take him on. That isn't a fan rationalization, that's all explained in-story.

The Simurgh admittedly may or may not be rational - we just know very little about her motives and end goals, because we know very little about her in general. But just because something is /unexplained/, doesn't /necessarily/ make it irrational. Her actions have been mysterious, but not inconsistent (something along the lines of Dumbledore in HPMOR, at least until we find out more near the end of the story). I'm holding out judgement until Worm2 on this one, but even if we regard her as irrational, she's an extremely minor part of a very rational story.

I'm not sure we'll be able to change each other's minds here, but I do think that if you discount even Worm as not rational enough for the RF genre, then you're restricting RF to an /incredibly small/ selection of works.

I do generally agree with your last statement though - the rationality of the story should be decided solely on what's presented in said story, not on the invented explanations of the readers.

Why does that not count? It wasn't from D&D, it was from an earlier and completely separate war game - a game that was itself based in the LotR setting.

I'm looking at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] 's generally agreed upon four criteria of rational fiction here. Cauldron's actions had plausible reasons behind them, they were driven into conflict by their beliefs, and they attempted to solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. This isn't just a matter of the story saying “Cauldron's actions were necessary”, and the reader taking this as fact.

#+begin_quote

I'm not. I agreed that the Simurgh /as presented/ is not logical. However, (a) the story is not complete (Worm2 is slated to start around the end of this year), and as the characters actions haven't yet been shown as /irrational/, there may yet be motives revealed which clarify things on the reader's end, and show that her previous actions had plausible reasoning and logic behind them; and (b) the character is very minor, and contrasts with 99% of the other characters, whose actions /do/ have plausible reasons behind them.

You seem to be confusing “rational characters” with “characters acting like 100% logic-driven robots.” Characters acting emotionally (such as Alexandria deciding to out Skitter in the heat of the moment) means they're written as human. It doesn't mean the story's not rational. HPMOR had plenty of side characters responding in emotional or irrational ways, and Harry himself didn't always make the best decisions - the point is, those actions had clear, plausible reasons behind them, and were consistent with the character's personality/beliefs/etc. Not every character needs to always make 100% optimized logical decisions, in order for a story to be rational.

Again, just because a plan is miscalculated, doesn't mean it's not within the realms of RF. Characters are allowed to make mistakes or decisions that are not completely optimized. HPMOR's Harry makes multiple mistakes or miscalculated decisions (I only keep using HPMOR as an example because its a work widely agreed upon by the community to be RF). The important distinguishing factor is that the decisions had plausible reasons behind them and were consistent with the character's thought processes.

They can also apply their knowledge/resources intelligently without necessarily applying them in a 100% optimized fashion. Just because Alexandria didn't take every possible precaution when constructing her Skitter-threatening plan, doesn't mean she was holding the idiotball.

#+begin_quote

Also, Alexandria's mental processes are offloaded to her shard, which prevents mental influences from affecting her, and should also allow her to remain clearheaded right until she actually goes unconscious.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Why does that “seem very weak”? The more the public perceives they are in danger, the more likely they are to run into the protective arms of the government (or other powerful “protective” forces) - that's some classic /1984/ logic. And what better way to create the perception of danger, than to release a few criminals that are dangerous, but nowhere near on the scale of some of the bigger threats?

It would be like the US government secretly releasing some dangerous criminals from a specific foreign nation into the streets of the US, in order to increase public support for a war with that nation. Is it the best approach? Maybe, maybe not. Is the reasoning at least /plausible/, is it consistent with the organization's beliefs/values, and is it an intelligent application of resources (even if it's not, in your mind, the /most/ intelligent application)? Yes.

I think that last point is really where our entire disagreement boils down to. Based on what you've posited, I think we're in agreement that Worm hits criteria 1 (characters do things for /plausible/ reasons), 2 (factions are driven into conflict based on their beliefs and values), and 4 (the world has consistent rules).

It seems like your argument with why Worm isn't RF, boils down to your opinion that the work doesn't hit criteria #3 - more specifically, that the characters' application of knowledge/resources isn't /intelligent/.

On that point, I'm not sure I can convince you. IMO, RF characters (particularly non-protagonists) can solve problems through intelligent application of resources/knowledge, without being /the most intelligent/ characters. Not every character in HPMOR is Harry or Quirrell, and even /they/ make suboptimal decisions.

As for Alexandria:

- Her mental processes might have been offloaded to her shard, but just because those thought processes were unaffected by /outside/ suggestion, there's nothing in the text to say they weren't affected by her own emotions. Alexandria had almost never been in a situation where she was in /actual mortal danger/, so it seems perfectly plausible to me that she would panic when choking to death. And that's not a fan theory, it's simple human nature. The fan theory would be assuming she's /not/ subject to normal human emotional distress, because there's no textual support for that.

- “Just suck on a blowtorch” doesn't seem like a great solution. Alexandria was inside a secure and high-tech government facility, surrounded by a fairly ruined city (this is post-Leviathan, post-S9, and post-Echidna). There's nothing to suggest that she would know where to, or be able to, find a blowtorch in the short amount of time she had.

- There were already live bugs making webs in Alexandria's lungs; traveling out of Skitter's range wouldn't make a difference. The fact that Skitter's power continues to work while she's unconscious, was only brought up in the text in relation to Tagg (who didn't have bugs in his lungs, but couldn't escape Skitter's range in time), not Alexandria.

Mother of Learning uses lots of things that are de-facto specific to D&D. At some point, using lots of Tolkinesque things would make something a LOTR fanfic, although there may be less kind terms used than "fanfic".

2YE is a clear D&D fanfic. It specifically takes place in a D&D world - it uses and relies on not just the spells and items, but also the underlying rules and systems of D&D.

MoL does not have an underlying D&D system. Most elements of MoL are /not/ present in or related to D&D. And most of the MoL spells that are in D&D, are not /specific/ to D&D.

#+end_quote

No, they don't. Both works are rife with character choices based on implausible or nonexistent reasons (for example, about 100% of the character choices in SW ep1). Both works have some characters driven primarily by the fact that they're “good” or “evil”. And the world rules are not at all consistent - force powers and spells vary wildly (in both ability and power) across the series' spans. Note that this doesn't make them /bad/ stories, it just excludes them as ratfiction.

But most relevant to this conversation, characters in HP and SW don't often solve problems through intelligent application of resources; they mostly solve problems by stumbling into the right place at the right time, or by believing in themselves or thinking happy thoughts (ex: Harry's patronus in book 3).

It's also a question of degrees. Do 100% of the characters in Worm solve problems in the 100% most optimal way, 100% of the time? No, but then neither do characters in HPMoR or Metropolitan Man. Do /most/ of the characters in Worm solve problems in intelligent ways, /most/ of the time? Definitely.

I don't know that there's much more to discuss here - you clearly are holding firm on your opinions, I don't think any arguments I could provide will change your mind. But considering the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community widely considers Worm as ratfic, I feel justified referring to it as such in my original post.

That's true in a trivial sense. The character wears shoes, shoes are not original to D&D. However, a lot of the fantasy elements are from D&D. (Whether it's "most" depends on how you count, of course.)

Any fandom has fans who say "the characters in this fandom are solving problems in intelligent, although suboptimal, ways", and can give a plausible-sounding argument for that. Allowing very suboptimal solutions makes the criterion very subjective.

Also, the Patronus was established as depending on thoughts, so using happy thoughts still counts as rational. It's not as if he was told to make it work by reading a formula and he made it work using happy thoughts instead.

I could say the same thing about Worm powers. (You could argue any specific example, but a Star Wars or Harry Potter fan could argue any specific example from those fandoms too.)

#+begin_quote

I suspect that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] considers Worm to be ratfic mostly because 1) Taylor munchkins her power (a rational element, but not the whole of Worm), and 2) Worm appeals to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] readers in other ways, and because of the halo effect they then see it as rational.

I count major/foundational story elements - of which there are almost none. The magic academy setting is unrelated to D&D. The idea of a looping copy of reality is unrelated to D&D. The magic system is not the D&D magic system, even if it uses some spells that are also in D&D. The characters, locations, and overall story are not from D&D. Some of the creatures are in D&D, but others (like the spiders, probably the most important nonhuman species) are original. You would need an incredibly broad and vague definition of fanfic to apply that label to MoL.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

First, that criteria is already somewhat subjective, as it depends on the interpreter's idea of "intelligent application." Second, I'm not allowing for /very/ suboptimal solutions, I'm allowing for /slight and occasional/ suboptimal solutions. Again, I would challenge you to find /any/ work (particularly a long-form one) in which no characters make suboptimal decisions.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Well, you didn't address two of my main points (multiple decisions that clearly didn't have plausible reasons behind them, and the existence of "good" and "evil" factions), so those series already wouldn't be considered rational regardless. As for the power systems, Worm powers are very specifically described and quantified (Taylor can control bugs at this specific range in these specific ways, with clearly defined limitations). In SW, Jedi fight in classic knight style with minimal force power usage in the orig trig, yet in the prequels fly around like acrobats and throw around the force like it's going out of style. R2D2 somehow loses his memories and his many tech tricks (like flying) between 3&4. And there's no in-universe explanation given for any of these inconsistencies. I'm not sure how you can seriously categorize consistencies of the power systems of HP or SW (soft-magic systems) with that of Worm (a hard-magic system).

D&D is a rules system. It doesn't have story elements (although some D&D-based settings do), so a D&D based fic inherently uses non-D&D story elements. That doesn't disqualify it from being a D&D fic.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Worm doesn't have prequels, so it doesn't have this problem.

If a fandom contains many separate works written years apart, some by different people, there will be more inconsistencies. A reasonable definition of a rational work should consider this when determining what level of inconsistency disqualifies a work from being rational.

I'm pretty sure you can find Star Wars fans who can go on in detail about how 90% of those really are very plausible. And the remaining ones just disqualify it from being 100% rational, which nothing is anyway.

Despite terms such as "dark lord", Vader and Voldemort have motivations for doing things other than "I'm evil and I like to do evil".

And unlike 2YE, MoL doesn't use D&D rules. Thus, as it lacks what you consider D&D's defining feature, MoL simply can't be a D&D fanfic.

Based purely on information from the original work? Not likely. And "I'm /pretty sure/ you can find fans to explain how /some/ of those are plausible" is not exactly a compelling counterargument in general.

Not the characters I'm thinking of. As presented in the films, the Emperor has no real motivations other than to grow the power of Evil (aka the dark side). And even if you accept Voldemort as nuanced, plenty of his Death Eaters, like Bellatrix, are clearly just straightforwardly Evil.

"Is a rules system" doesn't literally mean "contains only rules". It doesn't contain story elements, but it does contain other things than rules, and those are common in MoL.

It points out how "is plausible" is pretty subjective once you make allowances for things like "isn't optimal".

#+end_quote

The enemies in Star Wars and Harry Potter are not /in general/ motivated by a desire to do evil. Finding specific characters who are doesn't change this for the same reason that finding specific characters who are insane doesn't.

I'm also skeptical of equating "liking power" and "evil for evil's sake", unless you want to disqualify Worm because of, say, Heartbreaker, or even Scion (who could be considered either insane or evil by human standards).

I don't think there's much point continuing on this one. We clearly have two different definitions of fanfiction: I posit that a fanfic includes /key elements/ from a specific source material, whereas you seem to be arguing that fiction becomes fanfiction when it includes an unspecified amount of any elements (major or minor) from another work. Since we can't find common ground on the definition of the label, there's no point in debating whether that label applies to MoL.

At this point, you seem to be arguing that SW and HP /do/ fit [[/r/rational][r/rational]] 's criteria for RF, so I'm not sure what your actual point is. Are you suggesting the criteria are wrong and/or subjective and/or meaningless? If that's the case, again, no point in continuing to debate whether Worm is RF, if we don't agree on a fundamental level what RF is.

They and Worm are both rational if you interpret the definition loosely. If you interpret the definition tightly enough to exclude them, Worm would be excluded too. And I favor the tight definition.

********************* I think there's a line between accepting Worm as rational, and including SW/HP/etc in the genre.

Also, with your "tight" interpretation, even most of the genre's defining works, like HPMOR, would no longer count as rational (as they include characters that clearly act suboptimally, for example).
