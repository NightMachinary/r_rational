** (If anyone else is confused by the two comments on this thread being "really fantastic writing" and "horrible mess of typos", I had a look, and it's somewhere in the middle. The writing looks pretty meh to me, and there are occasional typos of the sort that I would characterise as "the author's English is fine but no-one has edited this")

*** I think "occasional typos" is really too optimistic. Typos and other mistakes are near constant. Nearly every paragraph contains a few. Quite a few typos, but worse than that is the poor grammar. Lots of sentences where the order of words is weird, or where idiom is used incorrectly. The story is parsable, but in many places it takes effort. The actual act of reading becomes a chore and not something enjoyable.

The strong part of this story seems to be the worldbuilding. The premise is interesting. I didn't read for enough to see where it's going, but it is a strong start.

The characters aren't very interesting. The MC doesn't really have personality. His only emotion is anger and he does not seem to have any goals or desires. The father is even flatter. The mother has only two scenes in the chapters I read. In the first she is kind and caring, in the second cold and hateful. No explanation given.

Maybe my judgment of 1/10 was harsh, but this story really is quite bad.

Edit: First few sentences edited for clarity.

My impression wasn't this extreme, but I hardly did a comprehensive survey. There are certainly a significant number of typos. Perhaps our difference is that I classed awkward grammar as poor quality writing rather than as typos. Certainly it's bad enough that it would annoy me as I read it.

***** Yeah I'm guilty of sloppiness myself there. What I should have said is that nearly every paragraph contains a few errors. All typos are errors, but of course not all errors are typos.

****** Sounds like we pretty much agree then =). It's not very good, I'm certainly in no hurry to read it, but it's not quite just a ball of typos glued together with grammar mistakes.

*** The author has stated a number of time that this is basically a first draft, and that significant editing will be in the future, as someone who has read it, I think the writing is passable for a royal road entry, and certainly not 1/10, maybe 6/10, as there aren't any glaringly bad grammatical errors (which aren't unheard of in RR).

** I checked the story some time ago, dropped it because character observes evil and atrocious acts one after another, and is never able to act on it properly. It seemed that author was planning to do it indefinitely without any change.

** Wow. This story is a horrible mess of typos and ungrammatical sentences. It's barely readable at all. This is exacerbated by a stilted style and painful dialogue. To cap it all off the protagonist is rather unsympathetic (his only emotional response to nuclear war is "glad I'm out in the wilderness").

1/10. Trash in every way a story can be trash. Do not recommend to anyone.

**** Honestly, most of the stuff on royal road seems to be quite bad.

You already mentioned Mother of Learning, but that's a great example of a great story. In general the stories that rise to prominence in this community tend to be quite good, or at least enjoyable. Of newer stories I'm a fan of Marriage and Monsters.

***** On this forum it's Mother of Learning and Worth the Candle. I read about 100 chapter of worth the candle, stopped because it was a self-insert male power fantasy.

****** Worth the Candle is kind of a subversion of the Harem/Male power fantasy trope, it pretends to be one on the surface, but a good portion of the MC's motivation is that he hates that he is a part of it, he finds the idea of a harem titillating in only the barest sense and hates even more that the 'God' of this world would create people as playthings for him. On an even deeper level is that all of the 'Fawning' females are deep and complex characters of their own, any lack of depth you perceive is likely due to the MC's own misconceptions and abysmally poor social skills. Yes it /is/ a Male power fantasy, but if read properly it is a critique of the Male power fantasy in a fantastic way.

****** Well now I'm curious, how do you like Mother of Learning but dislike Worth the Candle for being "male power fantasy?" The former is playing the trope pretty straight while the latter is subverting it.

******** Right, but he explicitly picks one who becomes his girlfriend. The character actively acknowledges the "harem" set up and gets pissed about it. Isn't that how you subvert the "male power fantasy?"

****** A big central point of WtC is that the main character is furious at the entity who put him there and gave him all the power.

How about HPMOR, Worm, Marriage & Monsters, Crystal Society?

** Really fantastic writing, really a cut above nearly everything on royalroad except a few select works (Mother of Learning, Good Student, Wandering Inn- though I stopped that one).

Author has taken a hiatus recently due to medical issues, but he seems active and I'm hopeful he comes back.

*** To say Good Student and Wandering Inn fantastic is pushing it. Well, in term of writing skill, Good Student is good. Not fantastic, but good. You need to read more fiction on the platform so you can find a really good one. Try Scourged Earth, a solid middling (I rated it 2/5 due to grammar mistakes, even when story is solid 4/5). Then try Eagle's Flight, which is my personal favorite. I'd read everything that has perceived quality between these two, ratfic or not.

Now that got mentioned, how's the story fare against ratfic criteria? I enjoyed a small number of fictions that's the opposite of ratfic. Reading idiots acquiring unearned power-up is a guilty pleasure of mine. But I try to not read more of them, though. I might actually feel guilty if I do.
