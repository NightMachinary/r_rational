And /that/ was more about her just not recognizing Kael in between the years they haven't seen each other. It was mentioned in chpt 83 that she recognized him since and tried talking to him. Though I can definitely see her outright kidnapping Kana.

Also, I don't think Panaxeth helped Red Robe for the majority of the loops - if it was capable of editing temporary markers into permanent ones, it'd be doing a whole lot more muck-ups. And it probably couldn't contact Red Robe until he was good enough to access the room with the Controller. At least until that point, Quatach-Ichl is still the most likely one to have helped Red Robe.

If we assume that Zorian and co are doomed to fail, which seems likely without out of universe knowledge that he's the protagonist of a story, then the outcome of Silverlake not taking the deal is that the invasion proceeds as plan and the primordial is released regardless. At least this way she has the chance to influence events positively, find a way to renege on the deal somehow, or, minimally, survive where she otherwise would not have.

Though to be fair, Silverlake was always portrayed as a self-obsessed schemer.

Do you think Red Robe is actually dead? It would feel like a bit of a let down, but Silverlake as the Big Bad could also work. Her character has been given a lot of development and we know she's a fearsome opponent, even without the assistance of a primordial.

I don't think he's dead, since that wouldn't allow for any resolution to who he is. Panexeth may have made the same deal with him, but RR probably did leave the loop, because the gate was barred.

RR bailed too early. He was never enough of a threat. His mystique kind of lost importance after Z&Z could take on Quatach-Ichl. The mystery stopped mattering.

(Especially as the scale exploded and the whole “closed circle mystery” aspect where brute-forcing the problems was impossible and the real strategy was to build versatility and understanding of what's happening collapsed. I feel like the way we timeskipped over the two biggest chances to focus on character-building again in the last few chapters is really indicative.)

I mean, it's still a good story, don't get me wrong, but the first act was up there with the potential to be one of the best time travel stories I'd ever read, while at this point it mostly just feels like a decent one.

If anything it'd be easier to reproduce that outside the loop as that was before Zorian and Zack learned the vast majority of the valuable information and skills they now possess, and even assuming RR made it out, he did so with hugely outdated knowledge of Z&Z's capabilities (they weren't even collaborating at that time).

Prior to Silverlake's defection the invasions would have been pretty easily dealt with.

Nope, because they lost all the tactical information the aranea matriarch had collected when Zorian's memory packet decayed, and the enemy is going to be able to summon powerful demons outside the time loop. Information collected since then is incomplete since it doesn't account for Red Robe's actions, assuming he's still alive, or the demon summoning.

Rather than betraying the rest of them, I suspect that Silverlake actually used her expertise in dimensionalism and apparent knowledge of primordials to finagle a way through. And I honestly couldn't blame her- the alternative was a form of death by erasure. I can't vouch for her sense of loyalty, but she might be capable of more easily ending the restarts now that she is outside of them.

********* This is just speculation for my part, but I have a hunch that the time loop is a mechanism for draining the primordial's power. It's a built-in function of his prison.

Also, we don't really have a clear idea about the true number of restarts that have occurred. It's entirely possible that in aggregate, the loops are still taking place for a substantial portion of the month they are supposed to emulate. Or even, that the end of the loops coincides with the end of the month itself.

We'll just have to find out. There isn't enough information to make any kind of accurate prediction.

Also, the summer festival is supposed to coincide with the alignment, upon which the loops would have been initiated normally. For some reason, the loops happened a month early. I'm not sure why (perhaps because the primordial was going to be released before the alignment?) but I would wager that this is a contributing reason for the instability of the loops this go-around.

The regular method depends on having a soul-less body outside the loop. Only the original looper (Zack) can exit using that method.

RR tried it while not having left his body vacant on the outside to be reclaimed. Which is the same position Zorian and the temporary looper find themselves in which is why the primordial offered to "incarnate" them, that is manufacture a body for their soul outside the loop.

​

This tracks with what Zorian said about their options where he was pretty sure they could get their souls out this loop, whereas a walk out solution was low probability but probably also possible with sufficiently advanced bypassing of the intended system.

I was really torn between wanting to see how they would capture each piece of the key within a month and actually seeing the story progress. On one hand we would have gotten to read some cool battle scenes but, the story already has plenty of those and it is certainly better for the story to progress.

This totally leaves room for a sequel right? Zach and Zorian can leave the timeloop, maybe with others, and then the next story will be about capturing Red Robe and Silverlake and stopping them.

It would be more of a portrayal of the results and consequences of the main story -- a sort of fourth arc where we see how the various characters are dealing with things, how the setting reacts to everything that had happened, that sort of thing. Not quite slice of life but definitely not as ‘epic' or long as the current storyline.

And that was Zorien acting alone. Now that they've got an absolutely massive team shutting down the invasion by getting their country's military at the issue early should be even easier.

And that's not even considering the vastly improved level of skills that everyone who's used the timeloop has, along with the knowledge of foresight.

Based on feats, Zorien at this point in the time loop would probably make short work of Red Robes by himself, or at the very least be able to hold his own until a whole team of archmages could take him down.

Unless new players show up like gods and angles who start fighting directly I don't see the invasion being much of an issue. Maybe Panthrax could pull something, but the author's already stated in the comments that the end of the third arc is going to be very shortly after they exit the timeloop. Maybe if there was a full fourth act already worked into the plot, and not just something the author decided to tack on to show the aftermath, I would see something like that happening.

There's no reason to believe that team evil won't be just as well informed as Z&Z once the time loop ends. And without future knowledge, Z&Z aren't enough to turn the tide on their own. As good as Zach and Zorien are, they are both nothing compared to a QI that's been given adequate warning against them. They're barely able to beat him with tons of allies and ambush tactics on their side. Turn the tables the other way and they die very quickly.

Or silverlake, who's far more ruthless than either of Z&Z. She'd be happy to work with QI and would have no qualms with doing whatever it takes to win. It's a whole new dimension when Zorien can't move freely because Kirielle has been kidnapped.

Just adding Zorian or Xvim to the time loop is a massive change, to say nothing about dozens of loopers, many of whom are major players in their own right. Already a small-scale conspiracy with Zorian and Stellar Spear that Strikes into the Heart of the Matter is enough of a problem that he decided to abort the time loop. What happens when the spiders are just one of hundreds of groups the time loopers bring into play? The board is completely flipped. The only way I could see them actually failing at this point is if Panaxeth pulled some stuff, which he very well might, especially with Silverlake in play. But since this is the end of the story I doubt the author is going to do the whole "Then Panaxeth wins!" thing.

​

I disagree with QI being some sort of unstoppable threat though. They have several methods of dealing with him now, at least temporarily, and they've successfully gotten the crown at least three times, though based on the way it's talked about in the chapter it seems to suggest that they've done it far more often.

It follow steps I didn't expand as to why I can say Panaxeth implied so. But basically, the possession process that must be undergone by all non-true marker holder is terribly difficult. Even if the body they're trying to possess is their own, which has one-of-a-kind compatibility, they already has a soul in it. On top of that, they themselves are soul without brain, bound to be unthinking and unfeeling. Imagine a chance of an unthinking soul possessed a perfectly healthy occupied body, I'd like to think it's infinitesimally low.

That's why, toward all non-true marker holder, Panaxeth offered to incarnate: no need to bother with possession process, your survival guaranteed, just like the holder of true marker.

The good news is that the project to physically step out of the time loop should be unaffected. If Panexeth has the ability to kill people directly, he evidently didn't bother to do so for the rest of the loopers. If the gate is effectively rebarred, this would be the method they have to use now. Harder without Silverlake, but potentially the inclusion of the crown used by Zorian would make up for it.

The main objection to RR being (person of your choice) was that the marker alteration project always seemed an extremely difficult task, and RR was a pretty lousy mage. The marker is confirmed to be a tough nut to crack in this very chapter. However, Panaxeth pretty much solves all the difficult parts for the Red Robe. I remember Zorian though RR was strangely invested in optimizing the invasion. Well, it is explained if he was recruited by Panaxeth from the very beginning! It also means that RR can be anyone, even the Boranova guy.

The cataclysm which turned fertile land into desert might have been the first large issue caused by SG degradation. The primordial who was tied in the capital tried to escape the prison. Situation went nuclear. SG was given for Zach family safekeeping, not to be used again.

The cause behind the weeping could have been Panaxeth (he needed to wipe out the Noveda family which allowed SG started again). SG is apparently assists in the escape in some sort of fashion. Since he is flesh-warper, he could easily create toxins/infection to set up the stage for current events.

RR is weird. He couldn't enter the space if he was using modified marker (unless Panaxeth pulled him into that space). It does not make any sense to be any other that primordial puppet (to coordinate ritual to free him besides other things).

** I don't want to hold back my praise for this chapter after my criticism in two separate occassions, because this chapter is GREAT! We are aware of two things, the time pressure against temp looper and Silverlake inevitable betrayal. This chapter capitalize the two brilliantly! Starting with establishing the undercurrent of unease at Zorian-Taiven-Kael fun little excursion, strengthened by after mansion orb creation by Silverlake. We are primed for whatever author decided to give us about that issue. Then come surprise Panaxeth. Silverlake timely betrayal not only allowed us to say, "Curse you Silverlake for your ...," but also elevated the tension of time pressure, from previously unease to panic and helplessness. From previously only affect the temp looper, to now also affect the two controller. Brilliant!

Saw several spelling mistakes, but eh, what are they in front of great writing?

With this, the first part of the next chapter would be most awaited/wanted/anticipated. We will demand resolutions for following issues, (1) Will controller, especially Zorian, have issue leaving the loop even with most assured method, namely having the key and possess their old body? Panaxeth claim of him not being able to leave alive was ominous. (2) Will boring a dimensional passage through Panaxeth's prison still a possible avenue? Previously it is stated with 30% success chance. It was before we know Panaxeth is watching closely. (3) Will the escape of temp looper still possible at all? Silverlake's gone with her ability to make soul-perception potion. With no means of training, temp looper are doomed.

And we're curious about the following issue: (1) What will happen with Silverlake inside the time loop? Become a meat puppet at the next restart? (That if Zorian and Zach could not escape at this iteration, forced to try again, or simply decide to do so) (2) Did Red Robe really gone? Not even outside time loop due to Panaxeth doing? (3) Is Panaxeth acting as Guardian of the Treshold? Gate being made from mutilated primordial with nearby primordial acting as guardian is interesting prospect.

Thank you author for this chapter. I count 2 hours of entertainment from reading this chapter, participating on simpler comment, and writing this comment. I believe I will find pleasure from participating on more weighty comment for hours, if not days, to come.

** So I wanted to talk about this passage:

#+begin_quote
  People who had zero experience with soul magic would find it impossible to get good enough at it to survive the soul transferal and successfully possess their body. People who were well versed in soul magic, even before the time loop, would probably be annihilated by the originals if they tried to possess them. Aside from Zorian, only Kael, Xvim and Lukav had a good chance of pulling that off. And Xvim, much like Kael, has already ruled out the idea 'stealing his own life away from himself'.
#+end_quote

At first I was wondering about Alanic and Silverlake not being included, but then the second sentence registered as "If they were too good at soul magic before the time loop, the original was fully capable of terminating the copy trying to take over them". So if I read that right, this method is only realistic for people who honed their soul magic skill sufficiently, had room for significant improvement, and had a base that would lend well to quick improvement, right? In which case I guess it makes sense Alanic and Silverlake would be out but Kael and Lukav would be in (and Zorian too, of course). But why not Zach? I thought he was also working on his soul magic over the many restarts.

Also, I kinda didn't see Xvim as the type to refuse getting out of the loop for non-pragmatic reasons.

Did blood magic/ingrained magical abilities also have some way to be carved into the soul too, by the way? It kinda seemed to me, in previous chapters, that Zorian and Zach were leery about it because it would affect them through subsequent restarts, but in this chapter it just said that the enhancement rituals would be anchored onto the user's mana pool and life force, both of which I'm pretty sure recover to normal every loop.

Other than that...the twist at the end was great. Glad to see Panaxeth wasn't able to create an immediate game over, even while upping the ante like that. Though by the same token I really wish Zorian could've fished more information out of it - like what exactly it wants to /do/ when it came out, and what guarantee it could give to Zorian that it wouldn't kill him when it's free, if Zorian had actually agreed to its deal.

*** That paragraph took Zorian bias, so it's natural for Zach to be excluded since Zorian think Zach is the holder of true marker. He wouldn't need possession method. His body would be empty. If that paragraph didn't take Zorian bias, yes, Zach will have a good chance of surviving the possession process.

Xvim would see little benefit getting out of the loop. The knowledge of loop existence and imminent Cyoria's destruction is minor convenience. He would think that his greatest contribution is helping Zorian inside the time loop.

About enhancement being reset, I think, that's because there's unknown variable before them being etched on soul. Them not being satisfied resulted said enhancement reset between restart. That's why Zorian is leery; what if experimental enchantment satisfied those variable, so that he must live with it? I guess, advise from Morlocks allowed him to rule out some of possible variables; allowing him to practice more extensively.

  This was where blood magic came into play. It allowed a mage to anchor the spell not only to their mana reserves, but to their life force as well. The resulting connection was deep and potent - potent enough that the user's descendants had a chance to inherit the ability in question as a bloodline.
#+end_quote

Said this chapter, so it already sounds a lot like a bloodline to me. I'm just fuzzy on the distinction whether it can only be considered a "bloodline" only if the soul is involved (i.e. it won't be a "bloodline" for Zorian/Zach/Damian but it would be considered one for their descendants that inherit it - which kinda brings up the question of how it manages to touch the children's soul. Something during conception?), or if the form it's shown as-is in this chapter is already considered a bloodline. Which should mean that a reset would wipe out the newly gained abilities, I think, since it was established before that a reset restores the life force to a before-timeloop normal. Which in turn made me wonder if they couldn't have set aside the last three days or so of each loop to actually do heavy experimentation, instead of just Zorian learning the theory work.

** Just started reading this last week and caught up last night on 89. I have some theories but not sure if they have been discussed so I figured I could post them here so I can be told that this has already been discussed.

TL;DR at bottom

Basically I think a angel set the marker on Zach and gave him the blessing for a larger mana well along with detailed instructions he should do along with the locations of the keys and their function. At some point his actions in a loop brought RR into the loop as a helper/friend (Zach and Veyer had very similar family situations, it makes sense that Zach would have approached him early on and befriended him.). The goal of this from the angel was to prevent the primordial's release.

Support of this:

Zach's large mana reserve has been mentioned as a curiosity but no explanation has been given, but QI's explanation of his large reserve seems to be the same story. He was given a larger mana reserve with no negative shaping impact. It was pointed out that Zach's huge mana had no negative impact on his shaping and that there was no evidence this was a family ability.

The angel put the marker on Zach to stop the primordial from getting released. Why go about this round about way of stopping it? It was said by Alanic that angels are tied by rules and can't always do the most obvious or direct path of action but that you have to trust they know what they are doing. Any more direct path of stopping the primordial is restricted to them so they placed the marker on Zach exactly a month before the predicted release to give him the most time to figure out how to stop it.

The angel clearly prepared a path for Zach by telling the people with the Ring to hand it over. Why would he do this one thing and nothing else to help him? He didnt. He probably at the beginning told Zach everything he needed to know about the loop and what he needed to do. He knew that he ahd no access to Zach in the loop so he prepared him as best he could. When they discovered the Sovereign Gate they made a point of mentioning how little they knew and how impossible it all was without that knowledge. Every time they discover an artifact or marker function they realize it would have been helpful if they'd found it in a earlier loop. I think we will discover Zach was given detailed instructions on how to get the keys once he lets Zorian into his mind.

Why does Zach's memory suck? He got betrayed by his 'friend' and that's why he (subconsciously) doesn't trust Zorian to look into it

QI had a memory of getting his blessing for his mana increase. Zach doesn't know why his is huge. Why doesn't Zach remember this? Because RR erased it from his memory. Why did he do this? Because RR is a bad mind mage. He erased everything about himself, and any details he had in his mind about or from the angel.

I suspect prior to his memory wipe, Zach was able to gather all 5 keys easily at the start of a loop. When he still had the instructions in his memory from the angel. The instructions included details on how he could retrieve the items, how to extend the length of the temporary markers, and all the other details Zorian and Zack frustratingly mention they wish they had an suspected were possible. Its possible much of this information was actually in the Orb but was emptied by RR when he left the loop himself. He then used those to train and figure out a way to stop the invaders. (this is why Zach instinctivly figures out how to use them all so much easier than Zorian, hes had them all in his possession before along with instructions on how they work) At one point he started using the crown to bring in more support and one of the people he brought in was RR, his friend Veyer, not knowing he was a cultist. Together (with anyone else he brought in) they tried to figure out how to stop the invaders while RR secretly supported them to perfect the invasion. Once RR had what he needed (probably the requisit mind magic ability learned from the cranium rats), he revoked the markers of everyone else Zach brought in and erased Zach's memory of himself, the loops they shared and any instructions from the angel and put some sort of geas on Zach to subtly direct his actions into not trying to stop the primordial's release

TL;DR: Angel prepared Zach extensively for time loop. Everything they worked for they achieved in hardmode, Zach was able to very early on get all the Keys with the angels directions but was still in the loop trying to figure out how to stop the primordial's release. Once RR was brought in via the crown, and achieved the required skills, he betrayed Zach and wiped his memories of himself and the angels instructions.

** The situation is so fucked up. From what Panaxeth said (assuming no lies) it seems they cannot leave "alive" aka with their bodies. So I assume their souls can leave. For Zach no issue (has soulless body), for Zorian ethical conundrum (most probably will merge both souls), same situation for Alanic, others cannot leave at all...

Assuming they leave at this very moment their best course of actions, damage control, would actually be to try to outrun Silverlake to QI and join him, help with invasion with condition that no primordial is summoned. New series of splinter wars and massacre at academy seems to be favorable option to primordial getting free. That is assuming QI would prefer new splinter was without primordial to just new splinter wars. Which I assume is the case, because I doubt that he would be willing to serve anyone, otherwise it's just nearly invincible threat for the future.

If they leave now, don't join QI and Silverlake gets chummy with QI they are fucked, so fucked. It's essentially goodbye to all their friends and family and constant pursuit from 2 nearly ageless beings. Like if they don't know where QI's phylactery is or they can't soul jar his soul they are permanently screwed.

Assuming they don't leave loop now - by that they merely lose support of woke Alanic outside loop. They should figure out how to deal with QI permamently - aka find where his phylactery is. Otherwise they stand 0 chance. Actually Silverlake on her own vs Z&Z is not that scary. It's QI that brings the real danger. So once they get a method to deal with him they should be safe.

I don't think RR was brought in by QI. It seems plausible to me that in one of initial repeats Zach decided to actually watch the ceremony in which Panoxeth is released and Panoxeth saw a chance and went for it. Panoxeth partially copied Zach's soul mark onto one of the cultists with promise of strength, wealth, etc... So I assume RR is woke outside the loop, thought not sure if with a separate body.

Also it seems plausible that outside the loop they might get some support from celestial beings - angels, maybe some god will appear.

Anyway so many possibilities, so many unknowns and I'm so hyped for the continuation.

** Why did the angels start the time loop knowing not only that it was damaged but that the primordial responsible for the time loop was the same one being released? Were they really that desperate to overlook such an obvious point of failure.

Something tells me that it was activated by someone else, but the evidence points to it being the angels (forewarning the Sulrothum & Zach's blessing). Maybe Panaxeth just took an opportunity to hijack it...

In ch60, Zorian & Zach saw an orb of blood that reacted when the ritual failed. Maybe Panaxeth used this as a vector to communicate with Red Robe once he got a temporary marker? Xe made a contract with Red Robe, who was committed to freeing xem anyways. Panaxeth used what little control he had to let Red Robe leave the loop as the "controller", which barred the gate. When Zorian & Zach unbarred the gate, Panaxeth took the opportunity to recruit another lackey to ensure his freedom.

Though, that brings up another mystery. What does the repeated attempts to unseal Panaxeth within the time loop (which IS Panaxeth) actually do? Does it damage the time loop? Does it temporarily release Panaxeth until the safeguards shut the loop down?

For an example I hope is sufficient, the sentence (fabricated on the spot):

#+begin_quote

pulls up the same kind of gut instinct judgment on "wants to", even though it's a little bit more apparent here that it's the wrong tense. (Or at least, I hope it's apparent.)

"You will never get out of here alive without me," it told him. Its voice acquired a human-like quality by this point, and most of the eyes were gone. "The other person didn't either."

Im reading a lot of comments taking this to mean he said no to the help, then tryed to get out and died, but how does that play with the Guardian saying that the controller left the loop? If he did scape with help from the primordial that frase is still true, and makes more sense in the story, even having RR still in the loop makes more sense.

He needed Panaxeth in order to leave with his own body intact though since the Red Robe in the other world still had a soul. Also, Panaxeth never said that he killed Red Robe, he simply said that Red Robe didn't escape without his help. That could be interpreted as Red Robe dying or as him accepting Panaxeth's offer.

Panaxeth didn't bar the gate. The gate is barred as a natural result of leaving the time loops.

** My thoery: the ritual freeing the primordial actually taints the gate, this caused the gate to activate, the primordial choose a "champion" who didn't actually have a marker at all but who he was resetting manually, that he would release into the real world after his training bringing a savior to the cult of the dragon who would grow it and help course correct it towards whatever long game he has in mind.

When zorain stopped the the ritual the one time it actually killed red robe, explaining why he was so weak to lose to a gun, so rather then risk redoing his training again with the loop ending rather soon the primordial simply took his prophet to the real world with the power he had thinking it was worth the risk he was underpowered.... It wasn't so now he needs another high risk prophet to guide his cult towards his exit play and silver lake was a fine choice for that offer.

His head rolled around at impossible angles, rotating a full 360 degrees, his entire torso squirming and bulging as if something was trying to burst out of it.

  He had a very bad feeling about this.

  "What the hell is happening?" someone asked behind him.

  "I don't know," Zach said, frowning. "This has never happened befo--"

  Everything suddenly became quiet. At first Zorian though Zach had just stopped speaking because he noticed or realized something important, but when he glanced towards him he found Zach gone.

  Everyone but Zorian was gone. It was just him, a madly twitching Guardian of the Threshold and a quiet, featureless black void all around them.

  He immediately tried to return to his body, but failed.

  Shit... Well, at least the Guardian of the Threshold was starting to calm down. He was twitching less, and no longer twisted him head and limbs at impossible angles. Maybe--

  A multitude of eyes suddenly snapped open all over Guardian of the Threshold's body, blinking rapidly for a few moments before focusing straight at Zorian. Each one was different. Different sizes, different color, different internal structure. Some of them had multiple irises. Some of them glowed. Some of them were multifaceted, like those of an insect. Some of them made his mind feel numb just looking at them.

  Taiven gave Kael a strange, possibly disapproving look.

  "What?" Kael complained, chewing loudly. The sound it produced reminded Zorian of someone eating a raw carrot.

  "How can you eat that thing?" she asked him.

  "It's really tasty," he told her matter-of-factly.

  "It's a wild root you washed in a nearby river," she protested. "That cannot possibly be safe or hygienic. Plus, I can smell it from here and it doesn't smell like something you should be eating..."

  Kael gave her a challenging look before biting into the root again and chewing even louder.

The best plant I can think of that fits the description is dock. Grows in a clearing, big yellow root, edible, smells bad, and I imagine it'd be crunchy. The only thing it doesn't fit is "really tasty", though it probably is an acquired taste. Also, those things are a pain to dig up. Maybe magic helps. Huh, I never thought about it before, but it totally makes sense for Kael to know a spell for digging up roots.

*** "Next Silverlake" as in "a skilled mage" or "an antagonistic, selfish asshole who almost literally sold her soul to an immortal godmonster"?

That said, I think Kirielle is going to become a mage if nothing fatal happens. She's very interested in that, and Zorian is more than happy to teach her. But that's for the future, and I don't see any reason at all why they'd try to use time dilation to train her of all the people instead of letting her progress in the normal world.
