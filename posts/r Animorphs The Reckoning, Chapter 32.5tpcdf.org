** David, a great hero motivated by his devout love for his loyal pet snake, loyal pet hermit crab and loyal pet iguana (all sadly and tragically deceased) steps out into the world and onto the pages of history prepared to protect animalkind from the greatest threat they face: humans stealing their DNA to engage in shapeshifting.

I do like seeing these motivating scenes for the minor bad guys, even if David was a gigantic douchebag in canon and may still be in this story.

*** As someone who has never read canon: Who is David and how does this chapter relate to his canon version?

Edit: Going purely by the wiki David got thoroughly fucked for the crime of being a teen that lacks self awareness and humility.

**** Aaaaaand trying to blackmail and murder the main characters. Personally, I remember the David arc because it was the first Animorphs book I read, and it was one of the only arcs in the series that spanned multiple books.

This chapter does not relate to canon, except for the mention that David has a pet who dies tragically.

****** While it's perfectly understandable that he should react negatively to the situation, he went to the extreme. Tried to sell out to the invaders, and when that was thwarted he tracked down each of the animorphs and tried to kill them. He killed (or dumped the already dead body of) Jake and Rachel's comatose cousin and took his place. Brushed off the apparent deaths of Tobias and Jake, because after all he hadn't killed a /human/, but a bird and a cat. Dude was twisted in the head and utterly selfish, and not even in a smart self-serving way.

** Not sure if it was intentional, but this chapter felt much more flowery and stylistic than the rest of the story. A bit jarring, but I think it fit the character pretty well. Keep up the good work.
