*** I think it was the way it was presented.

It was obvious he was alive, but, usually, we get a sudden appearance by the "dead" character, followed by a chapter or two of flashbacks.

This sort of interlude chapter is not usual in manga, and managed to evoke a bigger reaction.

Tl;dr I think it was medium awareness, and not the plot twist itself, that was surprising
