So the internet exists, and Jianxiang was returning home to her siblings.

Then instead of all that risk for the seventh beanie baby, why didn't she just call Sohu and tell her what happened? Then Sohu could make a beanie hexagram, do whatever bit of applied kabalah was needed to make sure the two hexagrams were metaphors for the same thing.

Are phones not reliable enough? Not secure enough?


** Probably not secure enough. Even telepathy can be intercepted by the likes of the Other King. Beanie Baby portals are only useful if they're absolutely secure - it costs the likes of the Other King or the Drug Lord very little to make a heptagram of their own, if they know the arrangement (and can set up a trap to catch a teleporting Cometspawn). The Beanie Babies are rare and difficult to get hold of at a moment's notice, which is why the system works at all, but even so Jianxiang must expect a trap whenever she uses this method to get around.

** It's not entirely clear that hardline internet access would be a virtue inside of NORAD, and more complex ways of maintaining access to other people would work (wifi or 3G, for instance, appear to not be available).

*** There's gotta be a way to communicate over vast differences if you are a Cometspawn though, right?

**** I don't know, Comet King seemed to lightning bolt around to have conversations, so nothing easier than that appears to have been available (at least 30 years ago or thereabouts).
