***** I was confused by the wording but I think what it means is this: a truce implies they are a threat, or in some way equal, or can restart a fight they can win. He views the truce not as any of those things, but as a stay of execution.

So he won't move his forces forward, but when he does he'll steamroll them regardless of what they have planned.

** Even now we know not what the Dead King wants. Dominion over all those who live cannot be an objective for the dead king, as along with his advance, heroes against him will inevitably spawn. The more land he takes, the more the story turns against him. He cannot appear invincible, yet if he advances now without Malicia being the light that the story shines on, he will be.

And so we come to his parting lines. The man who leaves *nothing* for providence to shine through is now taking a risk. A calculated one, but a risk nonetheless. Why now? What chance does he have now that might not come again? And towards what end? Everyone is asking about what the Bard wants, but what does the King of Death want?

**** That was Catherine's hypothesis before Tyrant's whole trial. Now we know that Bard tried to get the Dead King out and end him with the weapon. DK found out early, and he sued for peace halfway. If his goal is to continue existing, even after the weapon is non functional he would still sue for peace. Because invading more than he has done in his entire history would be the start of a story. A dark story of death ravaging the lands, and the band of heroes emerging from that crucible would be able to end him with the force of the story alone. Hence why he called this a risk. He wants something else.

****** If he wanted to destroy the Weapon, he would never have sued for peace initially. The weapon was a check that the Bard wanted to use to permanently kill him. Now the heroes don't /know/ how it will act if they use it, so they will be reluctant to use it.

I think there's something down south that he wants to get his hands on. Potentially in dominion lands. The hint with the Grey Pilgrim's origin was a blatant one. Previously if he had continued conquering, the Warden of the West would be forced to use this Weapon and that might have killed him. But now that the weapon is sort-of out of commission, he feels that he has some leeway to conquer until the place that he wants to find.

****** See, that's the thing. Evil doesn't "Win" in creation. Good Guys Always Win. Black held off the tide that came against Praes for 20 years with his conquest, and yet Callow is no longer under Praesi occupation.

Catherine is very good at twisting stories, and even when she kept winning, she did have to deal with a lot of losses as well. Also helps that she is no longer named.

I definitely think that this is a "chance". A potential win for his "Step 1". He can conquer deep enough in order to get something that he wants, potentially from Dominion lands (the hint at Grey Pilgrim origins was also given). The conquest might all be towards that end.

******* I think there's another rule that's even stronger than "heroes always win" and that's "villains always believe there's some way for them to win" even if their victory condition isn't total domination.

The Dead King knows that the Bard will always try to kill him and that one day she will succeed if allowed to keep trying. He waits for a perfect moment to counterattack, but if he doesn't take those perfect moments he has resigned himself to lose and die one day, something he is incapable of doing.

******** This is definitely a good point, but even then I don't think conquest of the entire continent would be the "Victory" that he would be after. Sure he can enjoy it for a while, but that way is just an inevitable band of heroes springing up to end his tyranny.

Like Black did, he can try to keep a lid on it, but only for so long. And Bard was not even involved with a majority of the heroes that Black put down initially. Against the Dead King, the Bard would be out in full force, and if DK goes for the conquest route, he would be handing her so many threads towards his end on a silver platter.

Maybe a cat does him in in the meantime and the heroes were unnecessary.

Ok, in slightly more seriousness, I think the idea is that the bard has already had her hero's journey and come out too powerful to do it again, so she won't have providence on her side next time around. And Namaseh is careful enough that he can't be beaten without it.

*** His ultimate goals remain a mystery, though it seems to center around escaping the Gods constraints, but his immediate goal is pretty clear: he wants to remove any potential threat. The Bard's plan failed and the Choir of Judgement is either temporarily or permanently knocked out of the game. Not to mention Malicia needs him more than ever and has convinced half to League to side with her. If he waits, he might never get another set of circumstances so heavily weighed in his favour.

A new opponent /might/ appear, but the current crop is too far below him to be any real threat. And if he waits, he only lets his enemies grow stronger or the Brad to come up with another plan or Judgement comes back in force. And he might become the "ultimate" villain, but between him and Malicia he'll also have killed enough people that there won't be enough people left to oppose him ever again.

It's a risk, like he said, but a calculated one.

That's not what's going to happen is it? Every single crusade against the Dead King failed because they were fighting on his home turf after he had withdrawn his invasion. Even now you saw during previous chapters that the Alliance couldn't agree whether to pursue him to Keter or to let him retreat.

All he has to do is to offer peace, and the grand alliance crumbles due to the lack of a uniting factor. They might turn their eyes to Keter, but that's a dead end story wise, as it will be "peace offer rejected, heroes out for blood" which ends like all the prior crusades. Or they might turn to Malicia, which gets them out of DK's hair.

This entire trial came about because Cat needed a reason to keep warring on Keter. A reason justifiable not just politically, but in story-form.

Triumphant conquered the whole continent and yet there were still people left to oppose her. People specifically created by providence to deal with her and her armies. The same is going to happen to the Dead King, if he conquers the whole continent. Which is why I don't think that is what he is after. This is indeed the risk he is taking, that slight chance of overreaching in his conquest which might allow the Bard another in to story-kill him. But there is something which he seeks that is worth the risk. He hasn't had this much free reign for conquest since Triumphant. He wants something from down south, mark my words.
