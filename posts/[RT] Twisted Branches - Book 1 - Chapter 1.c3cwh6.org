** I started reading it, but apparently the author's re-writing the novel to have fewer POVs? Anyway, the transition between a set of fairly major scenes (preparing for the second trial to the second trial itself) was really poorly done and things just got super, super confusing so I dropped it.

*** Given your comment is on here and not the relevant chapter, I'd like to ask:

Did you read the story on here or Royal Road? I'm assuming it's the latter since you know why I'm rewriting it.

If that's the case, do note, the transition issue was rectified within a couple of days following reader feedback. I hope I did a good job of fixing my mistake.

If it's still not up to par- I guess I still have a long way to go and thank you for your feedback.
