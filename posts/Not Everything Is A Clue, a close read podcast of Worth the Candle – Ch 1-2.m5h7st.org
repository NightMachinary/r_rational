** Fun podcast, it's funny the things that they infer from the early parts of the story that turn out to be, well, maybe not fully correct.

Could I clear something up that's not a spoiler and will hopefully prevent a bunch of speculation about something that they misinterpret? There's no meaningful connection between the placement of the stats and the placement of the skills. The skills are mostly ordered so that the physical skills are at the top, mental in the middle, and social on the bottom, but that's the only real pattern. If woodworking was at the top instead of one handed weapons, or even if the skills were completely shuffled, nothing would change mechanically.

*** That is a spoiler. I remember there being a connection and I remember eventually noticing the discrepancy of my assumption on my own. There's no reason to warn a new reader about it.

As for the reason why it is an even remotely meaningful spoiler, the only thing that truly reveals that this is a mistaken assumption is when said skills change. Spoiling this might make something like that happen a bit less surprising.

** I already wanted to beg them to do this, but I didn't because WtC isn't finished yet.

What are the chances that the story won't be finished before the podcast reaches the current point?

At the rate they're doing things they're set to get to the current location in 3 years, so I think it's very likely, unless they dramatically increase their rate or Alexander Wales stops writing for an extended period of time.

That's sort of happening though, right? No update since Thanksgiving? Do we know when the hiatus ends?

***** The last update was in December. Lately he has slowed down a bit, but it's not on hiatus I don't think.

****** Iirc he's in the US and had to watch that country tear itself apart with covid and all its politics stuff. Not a good environmemt for keeping a clear head and pushing through work, especially given how depressing some of the recent parts of the story have been alone.

******* I don't want to speculate too much, But in the presidential election in 2016 he abandoned a story he felt was too “real” if that makes sense. It's totally fine if he wants to take it slow to avoid burnout. Also, SAD.

****** Has he really slowed? In my experience he writes roughly the same amounts of chapters per month and the delays are due to how many chapters he decides to post at once. The last badge was quite large.

Absolutely. It's been last year things started to slow down. For your average writer it's still an okay speed, I think (going by the chapter spreadsheet the chapters coming in a few days were at a speed at roughly 400 words/day - before that he was at well over a thousand if my memory isn't going completely bonkers)

******* Oh, that could be possible. I hadn't kept track of that. Though I'm pretty sure I saw him say something about him slowing down for a bit over the summer.

** Is this podcast not generally available like their other podcasts, like the Bayesian Conspiracy? The website seems to only list it on Apple Podcasts (for reference, I use an app called Pocket Casts and can't locate it on that).
