** I'm three-quarters of the way through my second reading of (the four completed volumes of) /[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=157898][Look to the West]]/, an alternate-history book based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales][a British prince]]'s being exiled to North America and subsequently usurping the British throne.\\

[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=354968][The in-progress thread for Volume Five]]

/[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps][GURPS]]/ is, in my opinion, a very cool roleplaying game. It's generally intended to be more realistic than the abstractions of, say, /Dungeons & Dragons/ or /D20 Modern/ (though the GM can always allow "cinematic" optional rules), and has [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books][many dozens of comprehensively-researched sourcebooks]] (with [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/biblios.html][bibliographies]]!). Probably the most impressive /GURPS/ sourcebook is /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/vehicles][Vehicles]]/, which provides ludicrously-detailed instructions on writing up game statistics for just about any conceivable vehicle. /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Space][GURPS Space]]/ includes a method for randomly generating an alien species (both physical and mental characteristics) /and/ a process for randomly generating /an entire star system/ (not just the presence or absence of planets and moons, but their temperatures, atmospheres, available resources, populations, government types, constructed facilities...). /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/thaumatology][GURPS Thaumatology]]/ includes guidelines for making magic systems of many different kinds, or just modifying the existing one in minor or major ways. The list goes on...

** Non-fiction:

I have been reading the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit][Power of habit]] by Charles Duhigg lately. I liked how habits are described as automated executable programs. From the first few chapters..

#+begin_quote
  "This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future."

  "Over time, this loop---cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward---becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerges. Eventually, whether in a chilly MIT laboratory or your driveway, a habit is born."

  "Habits aren't destiny. Habits can be ignored, changed, or replaced. But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit---unless you find new routines---the pattern will unfold automatically."

  "Habits never really disappear. They're encoded into the structures of our brain, and that's a huge advantage for us, because it would be awful if we had to relearn how to drive after every vacation. The problem is that your brain can't tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it's always lurking there, waiting for the right cues and rewards."

  "This explains why it's so hard to create exercise habits, for instance, or change what we eat. Once we develop a routine of sitting on the couch, rather than running, or snacking whenever we pass a doughnut box, those patterns always remain inside our heads. By the same rule, though, if we learn to create new neurological routines that overpower those behaviors---if we take control of the habit loop---we can force those bad tendencies into the background, just as Lisa Allen did after her Cairo trip. And once someone creates a new pattern, studies have demonstrated, going for a jog or ignoring the doughnuts becomes as automatic as any other habit."

** I recommend the science fiction/mystery comic Private Eye by Brian K. Vaughan, Marcos Martin and Muntsa Vicente.

It's set in 2076, in a world where everything on the cloud was leaked, and as a result there is no more internet, and people are extremely private with their lives and even their identities. They even wear masks at all times in public.

Professions that are liable to infringe on people's privacy, such as journalists or private detectives, are either extremely regulated or outlawed, and the story follows one of these, an unlicensed journalist.

It's also an experiment (thus far successful) into online, self-published, DRM-free, pay-what-you-want distribution, [[http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/tpeye][here]].

** A couple threads ago I recommended a few Game of Thrones fanfics. I'll post them here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614734/1/In-Good-Company][In Good Company]] is by far the best. It's mainly a character study that focuses on Stannis and his strained relationships with his family in an AU where he stays in King's Landing as Master of Ships instead of spending all his time at Dragonstone. Unfortunately a deadfic, but still worth reading what's there IMO.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11605215/1/Hear-Me-Roar-The-Lannisters-in-the-War-of-the-Ring][Hear Me Roar: The Lannisters in the War of the Ring]] is an interesting one. It's a crossover with Lord of the Rings where the Westerlands and the Lannisters suddenly get transported into Middle Earth and get involved in the war. It's not complete, but it updates often.

I think other people here have recommended Oh God, am I the Mannis Now? and I second that. It's a decent SI fic and the main character tries to industrialize the Stormlands a bit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10379763/1/And-The-Giant-Awoke][And, the Giant Awoke]] is a fic where Tyrion escapes to Essos and uses his brains to become rich from various enterprises. It's a decent munchkin fic, though sometimes it seems like things go a bit easily for him.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48797][Westerosi Internet]] is a pretty hilarious set of crackfics with the premise that it follow canon exactly except that the characters have Instant Messaging and the Internet. The character interactions, especially with Tywin, are pretty hilarious.

As far as more general fanfics go (i.e. no munchkinry, crossover, or SI), [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/317779/chapters/511035][No Featherbed for Me]] is decent. It's an AU where Gendry is the first son of Robert and Cersei so no war happens. It follows Arya growing up and dealing with the difficulty of being forced (as a woman) to act like a medieval noble lady. This one is complete.

** Manga/Anime:\\
/Berserk/

Dark fantasy. Torture, gore and sex. The holy trifecta of my (probably immature) tastes. Berserk delivers all in spades.

Berserk is one of my favorite things ever. It has compelling characters, a great world and what I find to be a feature rather than a norm, rather clear and well drawn action scenes.

I recommend the manga over the anime as the anime was probably low budget and 30% of it just stills of the characters with no animation. The manga is ongoing since 10+ years and the volume is quite dense. The manga also starts off much more slowly than the anime.

** If anyone wants to watch an incredibly fun TV show that's like the fusion of The Princess Bride and Monty Python, then you totally need to check out [[http://www.hulu.com/galavant][Galavant.]]

It's not rational, per se. In fact, it's actually quite silly. But it's also very witty, incredibly genre-savvy, and as you go along you find yourself rooting for the heroes and the villains alike because you can't bring yourself to truly hate any of them.

Oh yeah, and it's also a musical. But with legends like Alan Menken and Glenn Slater behind the music, the quality of it is superb. I can't recommend the show enough.
