  Harry Potter
#+end_quote

I don't think this counts as 'anime', but as always, there's /HPMOR/ and its many, many, many spinoffs. /Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/ and /HP & the Natural Twenty/ aren't explicitly rationalist, but fall somewhere within the same sphere.

/HP & the Prince of Slytherin/ and /Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches/ both fall into a /ton/ of bad HP fanfic tropes (Occlumency wank, Slytherin wank, Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived plotlines, etc), but they do a sufficiently good job of rationalizing canon and fanon alike that I'd call them 'rational' or quasi-rational. I'd say roughly the same for /Harry Potter and the Game/, once it hits its stride.

#+begin_quote
  Bleach
#+end_quote

There isn't much. We've had brainstorming on the subreddit before, and someone here is trying to write rat!Bleach, but, well, writing is hard and ideas are easy. Outside of explicitly rationalist fanfic, I suppose there's Rihaku's /Bleach Quest/, which rationalizes Bleach canon (especially Aizen) from Uryuu's point of view.

#+begin_quote
  Naruto
#+end_quote

Just off of the top of my head, we have: /The Waves Arisen/, /Lighting Up The Dark/, /Marked for Death/, /Team Anko/, /Shikamaru vs the Logical Fallacies/, /Chiaroscuro/ (sort of), /In Fire Forged/, /The Need to Become Stronger/, and... probably something that I'm forgetting.

That just makes them rise up on the deconstruction \ worldbuilding scale, what does it have to do with rationalism?

/Witch-Stealing/ was an outright crackfic, with too much wishful thinking poured in and with a generic foolish Dubmledore.

/Prince of Slytherin/ was mostly fine, but it too had some drama \ conflict balls.

  Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches
#+end_quote

I didn't think this one was that rational at all, however, what I did like about it was despite how OP harry is, he still gets outsmarted by his antagonists. The author does a good job at keeping all of his characters smart and consistent enough to be able to predict other characters actions and take steps accordingly. [[#s][For example:]]

** Naruto:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][/Time Braid/]] --- one of the best [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][resetting time travel]] stories I've found so far (inb4: underage sex criticism);
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds][/Black Cloaks, Red Clouds/]] --- well written but in a gritty setting;
- [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][/The Waves Arisen/]] --- a well-written rat. \ munchkining story;
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][/Marked for Death/]] --- I've only read the starting chapters so far but it looked like a promising story back then;
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-naruto-si.380860/][/Shinobi, The RPG/]] --- IIRC, starts good but eventually turns into a crackfic;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11267384/1/Chiaroscuro][/Chiaroscuro/]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715/1/In-The-Blood][/In the blood/]] --- these have been positively mentioned here before (haven't read them myself yet).

Harry Potter:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/Natural 20/]] --- well-written HP Ã— D&D, the author has [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork][shown their work]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/Well Groomed Mind/]] --- HP joins VD /without/ the story deteriorating into slashy teenage romance drama;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die/]] --- interesting and well-written story, even though the protagonist is not perfectly rational (he makes do with what he has, even when it'll be harmful to his long-term mental well-being);
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][/On the Way to Greatness/]] ;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][/Forging the Sword/]];
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][/For Love of Magic/]] --- Harry's into experimentation, research of magic, etc. Has smut and wishful thinking though;
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][/Applied Cultural Anthropology/]] --- the first 9 chapters that I've read were good.

** I am [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mortality.36749/][currently working on]] a Worm/Death Note crossover. It's not rationalist, but the characters are largely behaving rationally and in their own self-interest, thinking through things before committing to action.

If you decide to read it, I will warn you that, while the main functionality of the Death Note is the same (write a name of someone whose face you know and a circumstance, they die in that circumstance if plausible and of a heart attack if not), other rules of the note have changed to fit the story I want to write. The Death Note is a great plot device, but it wasn't perfect for what I wanted to do.

I have written down the rules I'm using, I will not show them because trying to figure them out is part of what the exercise is about.

** There are several good rational Naruto fics, of which sadly I know only one complete one: The Waves Arisen by wertifloke (who I am about 75% on being a pseudonym of Eliezer Yudkowsky). The incomplete ones I like are called Lighting Up the Dark and In Fire Forged.

** I'm working on a rational Bleach fic! I have a full plot and all chapter outlines completed. Chapter 1 is done, and I'm about 60% along with chapter 2, which happens to be longer than usual.

I haven't posted it here yet, mainly because the title isn't finalised. I will most likely be posting chapters 1-5 together, once I get to that stage.

Judging by your username I'm guessing that out of the anime you listed, you're most interested in the Bleach one! You can expect it to be out in a couple weeks to a month. I'm cautiously optimistic that my fic will not disappoint you.
