Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I'm making a small video game, and I'm looking to include game theory minigames in them where the player competes against an AI. I've already included Prisoner's Dilemma with unknown and known amounts of rounds, and Rock Paper Scissors.

Are there any other games that aren't immediately obvious for the player to get the optimal strategies, aren't too difficult, and are fairly straightforward to implement?

*** One option to go for is a game where there is a simple optimal strategy, and the player can force a win from the starting position - but the AI will force a win if the player gets it wrong.

Example; there are three piles of objects (numbering 20, 32, and 17 objects per pile at the start of the game). Each round, each player can take between one and three objects from any single pile, and no pile is permitted to contain less than zero objects. The player who takes the last object from the last pile wins the game, the human plays first.

** If you're anything like me, you get distracted by Things. Two productivity apps that I find useful are Cold Turkey and Freedom.to. Neither can do everything that the other does (CT blocks apps, Freedom.to syncs across all devices and even works on your phone), but CT is far less expensive, if you want just one and you don't need anything on your phone.

**** I don't read nearly enough so for me reading a book would be more productive than whiling away hours and hours playing /disco zoo/ on my phone. (Thankfully I got diamond trophies for all the animals so the game is complete and I'm free of that ball and chain... and then I started playing an RTS game called Anikaps which is really, really good)

no i'm not bitter that i spent two months playing Disco Zoo at all hours why do you ask?

****** It's terrible but I am finally free of it after getting all the diamond trophies and it's not been updated in like 4 years so I should be good thank god.

But actually it was a fun and funny little game that was good to play while listening to podcasts or watching TV.

******* I'm surprised that the diamond trophies are actually obtainable. Were I an evil game designer (and what other sort is there, that makes these kinds of super addictive games), I would work very hard to make the final tier of trophies look possible to obtain, but actually just beyond the reach of an above average player, and so keep people at it forever.

******** Nah, you just need to get a certain number of mini games completed to go up a trophy level. There's a little bit of randomness but not enough.

I was quite shocked too, they had "discobux" you could buy with real money and spend to speed up construction or get more turns on the minigame, but I ended up with a pretty large supply of them just from normal gameplay.
