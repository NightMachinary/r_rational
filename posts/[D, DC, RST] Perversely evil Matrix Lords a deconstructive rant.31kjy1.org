He doesn't seem to have access to /reality/. Let's say he wants to find out how things /really/ work: he can't do it! He never has access to a level of reality to whose causal interactions all other levels reduce.

**** That's what I was trying to get at when I commented that we don't really know what the Wode will allow. From the description, I agree it's unlikely he'll ever get to reality, but is there any reason they wouldn't allow him a world indistinguishable from reality (i.e. causally consistent and based on the real world so that he can "find out how things really work")?

Again, for all we know there's been some apocalyptic event making simulated life preferable or other reasons that make their system sensible- I say this because like I said before, their system doesn't make much sense, but since it's also not very fleshed out and there's a lot of room to allow a utopia, I don't think it's safe to jump to a dystopian scenario.

/But/, we observe that the reality around us is causally consistent and runs on rules, rules which allow us to plan our lives and engage the world according to our own desires.

The nasty thing about simulations is that they appear causally consistent... until suddenly they're not, and it turns out that your reality can be altered according to the whims of some /agent/, who is suddenly directly interfering in your ability to live life as /you/ want to rather than as /they/ want you to -- and who is often interfering with agents other than you.

Then in the Outside, you have to scrabble day and night to get enough food to survive, and it's even less tasty than your standard gruel. And the best part is, this is /easy/ to simulate.

** Interestingly, I /just/ had this conversation online, literally five minutes ago. The person in question was asserting that a positive Matrix was more likely than a negative one. My answer to that was:

--------------

I would say it's much MORE likely for an evil/negative version to happen. Of all the worlds where Matrix pods come about, more of those worlds are negative than positive. In order for a Matrix system to be positive it needs to be built by people with good intentions, who keep the hardware and software from being backdoored while it's being built, it needs to remain in the hands of the creator (or other good people), and no externalities can come up that would interfere. Mess up any one of those ingredients and you have hell. Also, there's no way for anyone on the outside to tell conclusively what's going on inside, so there's no way for an outside body to provide oversight. If you doubt this, google for "Thompson Unix hack" and click the top result. Short version: Ken Thompson was one of the guys who invented Unix, the operating system that basically the entire Internet runs on. For a few years there he owned the entire Net because, when he sent out the tapes, he put a self-replicating Trojan into the login program and the compiler that you would use to create a new login program. There was no plausible way to detect it or get rid of it, and the same would apply to a Matrix pod.

--------------

I guess the real questions are

1. Do people know it's a simulation and why/how? (Might be "because they went in voluntarily", which is fair.)
2. Is there actually a way to get out from the inside? It doesn't seem plausible on the face of it.
3. Why is the Matrix Lord evil? What's his motivation / what does he gain?

** I can agree with your assessment. I think it's something that's easier to say than do, however. Although, even forgetting that, the biggest reason for that occurring, I believe, is the desire for a satisfying narrative. And the concept of a "virtual" reality of all play and no work goes against a number of ingrained cultural beliefs. We are taught that you can't ever get something for nothing, that hard work leads to results, and that being lazy is frowned upon (Sloth is one of the seven deadly sins, that's how ingrained our loathing for laziness goes) So when you have an author who wants to write about a virtual world, they can't have everyone all pleasant and happy. Or, if they do, the outliers of what you were proposing tend to rise up against them, for the sake of the narrative. And the exit door? No source of conflict if people can freely exit your virtual world. I mean, what? You're going to rebel against the tyranny, when people who hate it can just GTFO? Plus if you start to just emulate the real world in the virtual world, it can get rather boring. The only reason the Matrix wasn't boring is because we followed the story of people that "broke" the game. The rebels and the "administrators" of the system. It seems like a fairly boring place for your average schmuck.

TL;DR: Narratively, you need a source of conflict. It's hard to have a story that focuses on a virtual world and tearing it down, if said world has an escape button. Plus our society doesn't like to reward easy things (for obvious reasons)

** It depends on people's ability to rebel. If you create a matrix and 5% of people rebel and try to get out that could be bad if they have any ability to get out, less so if the Wode can just lock them down.

They may have worked out that the decrease in happiness of those 5% is less important than, say, consuming 4000% more resources when 5% get out. The rebels can cry themselves to sleep on their bed of attractive sexual partners, alcohol, and luxury bed linings.

But if 5% out meant a 200% increase in resource usage but 5% rebelling meant a 1000% increase in resource usage then it would be better to let them leave.

This works out well for /Perfect State/, in which the whole situation is implied to be a result of resource crunches (or possibly of the utilitarians adding people until their extreme resource efficiency became necessary anyway). Of course, you'd think there would still be /some/ arrangement or compromise that could be negotiated with the 5%. From the perspective of a powerful overlord, cooperation and negotiation are just the /lazier/ things to do, provided only that the rebels want something /other/ than to totally destroy you.

If you made an arrangement then if there was a large scale cultural movement to take advantage of that arrangement or compromise then your resources could be overtaxed. Better to just deny everyone so that no precedents can be set.

The arrangement or compromise could be extra computational resources to entertain people.

It's very context dependent on the matrix. There's no certainty that cooperating is better than defecting when the users have little ability to punish you. If they can actively rebel then sure, compromise may be necessary, but if you have strong control why not just oppress them more?

My first google check shows that their main concerns are the many dollars being transfered to poor Americans, and second that it leads to a weakening of the moral character of Americans.

[[http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/08/why-welfare-mimimum-wage-make-it-harder-for-poor-americans-to-succeed/]]

They first complain about the sheer cost of the proposals, then about the damage in standards that causes.

I could even imagine a Matrix Lord saying something like that.

"Fifty years ago, President AI Model X77787 declared “War on Unhappiness.” It sounded great to me.

I was taught at Ganymede, “We're a strong stellar power. All we have to do is give the people a little freedom, and then use that good will to create social structures that will lift people out of unhappiness. Government sponsored reality programs programs for the strong and less random mind fuckery by our conflict AIs for the weak."

It seemed to work. The unhappiness rate dropped from 17 percent to 12 percent in the programs' first decade. Unfortunately, few people noticed that during the half-decade before the “War,” the rate dropped from 22 percent to 17 percent. Without big government, Humans were already lifting themselves out of Unhappiness!

Despite spending an astonishing 22 thousand sun hours, despite 92 different reality programs, unhappiness stopped declining. Government's answer? More reality!

Cyborg King, Z., Io., chairman of the House Reality Committee, points out that government measures “success” by the growth of programs: “based on inputs, how many people are in reality, how many programs are we creating, how many people are we putting on these programs -- not on outcomes -- how many people are we making happy? ... Many of these programs end up disincentivizing happiness -- telling people it pays to be unhappy because then you're more likely to be let into reality!

That is a great conceit of the central planners: thinking that only government prevents humans from being unhappy. But the reason Americans don't cry all the time is competition, not government minimums.

Competition is what really makes the humans happy. It doesn't much matter that the law says that competition can lead to up to a 90% drop in life quality. Only 4 percent of human workers are at that life quality. 95 percent make more.

The free market will sort this out, if politicians would just let it. Left free, the market will provide the greatest happiness to workers, employers and consumers, while allowing charity as well.

It would all happen faster if politicians stopped imagining that they are the cause of everything.

I mean, consider the example of Eaturbrainz, the star of many of our reality tv shows. Would he really be as happy if there wasn't so much competition and social injustice for him to complain about? Competition brings him happiness.

*** I think it depends what. Most video games don't make you earn the "privilege" of staying alive enough to play at all, you know. The kind of survival game where you need to spend effort finding food, clean water, safe places to excrete, and shelter against the elements is a fairly unique, isolated genre of game-play.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a useful approximate model here, though I think some of it's in the wrong order. Most people place a strong but ultimately ascetic/utilitarian/dry /need/ on safety/security: they feel a /need/ for their environment to be secure enough that they can plan what to do and carry out their plans (see: Lord Vetinari of Ankh-Morpork). Then comes satisfying the basic needs of physical existence, which can be done sparingly or with finery, as per preference. Then come (very roughly) the individual's social (and sexual) needs, to be entangled in positive relationships with others, and then comes the individual's need to apply their abilities in interesting ways.

Ultimately, as you move /up/ the hierarchy, you're moving from basic needs, from which people derive little happiness but whose deprivation makes them utterly miserable, to higher desires, which are often said to make life worth living, but whose deprivation actually has comparatively /little/ psychological toll. The further down something is in this imaginary ranking, the more worthwhile it is for society/technology/whatever-the-hell to just go ahead and supply it; the higher up, the more people should earn it for themselves, since they'll undoubtedly care about the /how/ rather than just the /what/.
