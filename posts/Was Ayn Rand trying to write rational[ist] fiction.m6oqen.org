Let it be said that I don't endorse Ayn Rand's philosophy or morality. Her reasoning took more than a few wrong turns and her (metaphorical) moon rocket missed the target completely and crash landed in the middle of Cloudcuckooland. But was she /trying/ to do basically the same kind of thing as writers of rational(ist) fiction do?

** I think there's a really big and often unacknowledged difference between “rational fiction” and “rationalizing fiction”. Rational fiction is, basically, about problem solving. Often involving critical examination of biases and preconceptions. Rationalizing fiction is about trying to justify why the way you already believe is right would solve the problem.

Rand wrote fiction that took the things she already believed, and concocted a world in which they were not only true, but absolute. Atlas Shrugged is an entire novel length version of someone at a party desperately telling you that “no no, in /this/ situation, my horrible ideas /work/!”, while everyone tries to escape.

**** Allegory is an explicit rhetorical device in which you use a fictional world and series of events to say something about different real world things. Gulliver's Travels says a lot about what Swift thought of society without him /literally/ claiming that tiny men or talking horses are a thing.

What Ayn Rand did instead is concoct a contrived, realistic sounding series of events to hold up as a mental experiment that proves her philosophical points. The problem being, of course, if a mental experiment is actually just a deranged fantasy that would never in a million years come to pass, it's worthless.

** She's writing in a tradition sometimes called utopian literature.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_utopian_literature]]

More' /Utopia/ was the origin of the tradition, but basically you comment on society by inventing a society in fiction. Sometimes the invented society is a utopia and you contrast it with real societies, and sometimes it is a dystopia as a warning. Rand did both, a dystopia and then a utopia embedded in that.

If you're interested in the method but turned off by Rand's ideology, Jack London does something similar in /The Iron Heel/, and Bellamy's /Looking Backward/ is pretty damn fascinating, it was a bestseller in around the turn of the (19th/20th) century and inspired mini utopian clubs and societies to spring up for a while.

Here's some utopian lit to chew on if you're interested, they're all pretty short and readable, though obviously not modern.

[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624][Looking Backward]] - Kind of hard to describe politically, sort of a state-oriented capitalism. Really gets at the period, though, and is pretty fascinating.\\
[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1164][Iron Heel]] - London was a Marxist and this is a capitalist dystopia.\\
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_from_Nowhere][News from Nowhere]] - A less over-the-top socialist utopian novel, and kind of helps you to understand the context that Marxism came out of (really ridiculous exploitation in factories, among other specific abuses). Less heavy than Iron Heel, which is pretty over the top.

If you're OK with something a little more challenging, Bacon's [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2434][New Atlantis]] is a scientific utopia, but in the early modern period science was considered 100% compatible with Christianity, which makes for pretty weird reading. And More' [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2130][Utopia]] is really worth reading, though you might need to get into the context of the time a little (he talks about sheep for a big chunk of the beginning of the book, but enclosure of common land was one of the hot political issues of that day).

** No, she was writing a novel as a hash function for a remarkably thorough, expansive and consistent philosophy of human life. Dislike that philosophy all you like, but the sheer amount of information encoded in her books is impressive in it's own right. But in aiming for that goal, her writing is very much, I don't know the term, mythic descriptive? Characters aren't intended to be "realistic", they're intended to demonstrate guide marks to decode the philosophy. The villains all hold idiot balls because naming and explaining those idiot balls (and their real life parallels) is most of the point of the work.

To the extent that there is a connection to this community, it's that Methods of Rationality has a lot of that same energy. Imagine if EY had spent 10 years obsessively perfecting MoR.

*** Judging from her comments in interviews, I believe you may be reading way more into it than was actually there.

I think the major attractions of Rand's books are how they can be used in a shallow way to attempt to rationalize and defend self serving and self centered ideals. Rand gives people a way to believe that 'I've got mine, screw you' is somehow the height of moral conduct, and gives them a way to idolize themselves as one of a few people in society who actually matter while everyone else is some sort of useless taker.

There's a certain kind of person who wants to benefit themselves at the expense of others and think they're better than everyone else. Rand gives them a way to do that without feeling bad about it like they would under any other moral system. So they flock to it, not because the philosophy has any value or truth, but because they want it to be true.

***** Randian fantasy presents its great men heroes as solely responsible for their own success and the entire rest of the world as trying to leech off of their brilliance and hard work.

It glosses over the reality of the world, which is that nobody is personally responsible for creating vast wealth and tremendous advances. The founder of a successful megacompany makes billions, but they don't do it by doing all the work themselves. They hire people to do work, tell them what to do, and then steal a portion of the value of that work for themselves.

Then there are all the debts that these supposedly self-made figures owe to society and are completely blind to. Their successes wouldn't be possible without the creation and maintenance of the society around them. Who educates those workers they need? Who pays for the roads that bring them to work? Who ensures they and the protagonist aren't murdered by marauding bandits?

Rand's idea of the man who stands alone and owes nothing to anyone is an ignorant and fantastical myth. The real life equivalents, the world's megarich CEOs and investors, they got their wealth by making money off of owning capital. They are parasites who live off the labor of others, not men who have somehow produced billions of dollars worth of goods with their own hands. Many have done legitimately useful work, but not work worth billions of dollars.

Nobody can do that all by themselves.

They love the Randian myth because it enables them to think their wealth was a result of their own work, and because they can use it to pretend to moral indignation about how society is stealing from them when it expects them to pay taxes.

It is willful ignorance based on a desire to find some ways to see themselves as the heroes of their own story, as oppressed by the rest of the world.

Notice how you wrote 6 paragraphs, without citing a single specific example? That's one of the many tells that you're going entirely on N+1th-hand attacks, that mostly hadn't even read her in the original, and were written in bad faith besides.

******* Here are some excerpts from John Galt's very long speech in /Atlas Shrugged/. It seems to me that (1) this speech is intended as a statement of Rand's own position, and isn't some sort of fantastical exaggeration, and that (2) it very much does present Randian heroes as solely responsible for their own success and the rest of the world as trying to leech off their brilliance and hard work, and that (3) it very much does argue for a position of total selfishness (and calls that morality). In what follows, my own comments are in italics inside square brackets; everything else is Galt. I'm using [[https://amberandchaos.net/?page_id=73][this copy]] of the text of the speech; of course if that's a wholesale fabrication then my evaluation will be nonsense, but I don't think it is.

"I have stopped your motor. I have deprived your world of man's mind. [...] I have withdrawn those who do [live by the mind]. I have withdrawn those whose mind isn't [impotent]. [...] We have left you free to face [...] a world without mind." [/I don't know whether the total number of people in Galt's Gulch is stated explicitly, but it can't be more than a couple of thousand and my impression is that it's rather less. So, according to Rand, the world is brought to its knees by the removal of at most about 0.02% of its population; those are *the* men of the mind, removing them means "a world without mind"./]

"We have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always been the givers, but have only now understood it. [...] You have nothing to offer us. We do not need you. Are you now crying: No, this was not what you wanted? A mindless world of ruins was not your goal? You did not want us to leave you?" [/Once again, Galt's no-more-than-~1000 pals are *the* givers, and the rest of the world has *nothing* to offer them. The rest of the world has been leeching off them, and now that they're gone it lies mindless and in ruins because of their absence./]

"Do you ask what moral obligation I owe to my fellow men? None -- except the obligation I owe to myself, to material objects and to all of existence: rationality. I deal with men [...] by means of reason. I seek or desire nothing from them except such relations as they care to enter of their own voluntary choice. It is only with their mind that I can deal and only for my own self-interest, when they see that my interest coincides with theirs." [/No moral obligation to anyone else, other than to be rational. No dealings with others except for the sake of self-interest./]

"If you desire ever again to live in an industrial society, it will be on our moral terms." [/Without Galt's 0.02%, it is impossible for an industrial society to exist. Again: if this isn't the entire rest of the world leeching off their brilliance and hard work, what is it?/]

"Accept the fact that the achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life" [/However could anyone get the idea that Rand's works promote self-serving and self-centred ideals?/]

Now, it /is/ true that Rand had a word or two to say against the idea that your success is purely your own. But ... well, here's Galt again. "When you work in a modern factory, you are paid, not only for your labor, but for all the productive genius which has made that factory possible: for the work of the industrialist who built it, for the work of the investor who saved the money to risk on the untried and the new, for the work of the engineer who designed the machines of which you are pushing the levers, for the work of the inventor who created the product which you spend your time on making, for the work of the philosopher who taught men how to think and whom you spend your time denouncing." So far as I can tell, nowhere does he (or she) acknowledge that the industrialist, the investor, the engineer, the inventor, or the philosopher depend on anyone else's work for the pay /they/ get; but the /little people/, the ordinary people working in the factory, why, we've already established that they have no minds, and the injustice is that /they/ are being paid for the genius and hard work of the Randian Heroes.

A couple of paragraphs later, she makes that more explicit. "The man at the top of the intellectual pyramid ccontributes the most to all those below him, but gets nothing except his material payment, receiving no intellectual bonus from others to add to the value of his time. The man at the bottom who, left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing to those above him, but receives the bonus of all of their brains."

To be clear, I'm not claiming that there's nothing /else/ in Galt's speech, or in Rand generally, than a call for selfishness and a declaration that a tiny handful of Great Men, owing nothing whatever to anyone else, are responsible for all the good things in the world. But those things most definitely are in there.

******** Disclaimer: Kind of drunk. Apologies if this was less than coherent.

Credit for looking at the actual text. That speech /is/ sort of the summation of a lot of her philosophy. But you're ignoring over a thousand pages of context. Let's start with your initial points, about the small population. Warning: spoilers will abound.

The working title for Atlas Shrugged was "The Strike", but really, there are two or three strikes happening simultaneously. The big one that drives the plot is John Galt headhunting particularly talented individuals, and convincing them to stop offering their intellectual abilities on the market. These are the people who get the offer to move to the gulch. Numbers are not given, but the gulch boasts a population large enough for some people to make a living as stage actresses or philosophers. A few thousand is probably a good approximation. AS was written in the 40's, when the US population was about a third of it's current total, so lets inflation adjust that to 10k. So that's Elon Musk, and the 10k closest people to being Elon Musk explicitly dropping off the face of the earth.

Do you think they talk to no one? Their employees, their friends, their families all know that some mysterious stranger talked to them for a few hours, and then they decided to abandon modern society. This is the start of the second "strike", which isn't as explicit. Hundreds of pages in the book are devoted to describing the chilling effect on the rest of the populace that arises from the double-whammy of Galt sniping geniuses and the general rise of what we might call Woke Classism. There's a growing sense that the game is rigged, and regular people who are decent and hardworking pick up on it and just... marginally and less marginally pull back their efforts. Why put yourself out there with a suggestion or idea or solution, when displaying ability just gets you more responsibility with less reward? And so the more insightful employee doesn't volunteer to do what needs to be done, or go above and beyond, or apply for that promotion... but the incompetent social climbers, the people who want power for the sake of power, are /thrilled/ with the lack of competition.

There's a scene in the book when things are starting to get really bad. Dagny is the COO of Taggart Transcontinental, a railroad corporation. She's been driving herself to exhaustion trying to keep things functional, and gets hit with some critical mechanical failure which can't be fixed due to the breakdown of normal parts supply (the device which sorts trains through the terminals, iirc). She calls a meeting of her mechanical engineers to ask for alternative solutions, and they all just stand there. Why put themselves up as a clever, competent employee, when that will just earn the ire of the Woke Classists, like Dagny's brother, James, the CEO? Dagny ends up calling a rival company right in front of them to ask if she can rent a competent engineer. The line is something like "We've finally fallen so far that I don't have a single mind left at Taggart Transcontinental." At least, no one is /willing/ to step up and stand out by saving the day.

And this goes down even further. There's an infamous sequence with the tunnel explosion. The lead up to it involves like 20 pages of railroad employees quietly understanding that what is being asked of them is /stupid and dangerous/, but no one being willing to say that to a (weak) political power. And so ensues a comedy of responsibility-dodging and buck-passing that leads to a major disaster that kills scores of people.

So it's really not just "remove a thousand geniuses". It's that plus "a national culture inimical to usefulness, productivity and rationality". Rand's argument wasn't that removing them was sufficient to collapse society, but that the heroic efforts of the 0.1% more competent people might have kept the disaster going /even longer/, as shown by Dagny and Hank routing around socialist edicts to try to keep portions of the economy afloat. Rand's argument here is essentially accelerationist.

#+end_quote

This would require a few thousand words to get into on it's own, but for now I'l just say that Rand's definition of "selfish" is bizarrely narrow to a native English speaker. This is a total rejection of moral black checks, and anything that can be logically construed to require a moral blank check. In Rand's terms, if you harm none and pay your own way fairly and honestly, that's sufficient for being a morally decent person.

#+end_quote

Did you actually read the speech, or just scan through it for lines that seemed open to attack? Huge portions of the book (and the speech!) are devoted to arguing that those moral terms are technical requirements for industrial society. She would argue that this applies to the meanest idiot alone on a desert island just as much as some brilliant genius in a modern first world country.

  "Accept the fact that the achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life" [However could anyone get the idea that Rand's works promote self-serving and self-centred ideals?]

There's a line of questioning I've asked a few times in various places, and never received a good answer. In terms of moral obligations, at what point /do/ you actually get to just be happy? Do you believe that you have a requirement to help others? Are you doing so right now? Do you believe you have a moral right to happiness, or to seek happiness? Even while children are starving in Africa?

It seems to me that there are two actual answers to this line of thinking (almost everyone who even considers this sort of thing seems to just stop thinking about it out of some desperate survival instinct). One is the enslavement of all to all, a sort of nightmare, Rawlsian Repugnant Conclusion. The other is to say that everyone's happiness is their own burden, and any help they give to others must be voluntary (and so, by their own reckoning (this would also be a long essay on Rand's use of "value" and "sacrifice"), in their own self-interest).

On a final note, thank you. I haven't had cause or opportunity to think about a lot of this stuff in a long time. Trading walls of text was a fun past time. Thanks for inspiring me to do it again.

#+end_quote

Fair enough. But I don't think most of what Galt says makes sense if interpreted as being about the "other" strike, the one that arises from lots of sub-Gulch people being so offended by "Woke Classism" that they refuse to do good work any more. He says that "/I have/ stopped your motor", that "/I have/ withdrawn" those who live by the mind. He talks about the terms on which those people might be persuaded to return to sharing their productivity with the world as a whole. None of that makes any sense if applied to millions of ordinary-but-clever people across the world whose despair at "Woke Classism" has made them reluctant to work well. All of it makes sense if applied to the ~1000 people Galt has persuaded to run away to the Gulch.

(Pedantic note on population: AS was published in 1957, when the population of the US was about 170M. It's now about 330M. So less than a factor of 2. But let's stick with your numbers: 10k after adjustment to the present world population. In other words, about one millionth of the population.)

#+begin_quote
  Did you actually read the speech, or just scan through it for lines that seemed open to attack?
#+end_quote

Yes, I did actually read it. No, I didn't just look through for things that seemed open to attack. But yes, I /did/ look for things in the speech that make the particular points you were claiming Rand never makes; I don't see that there's anything wrong with that.

As to the actual point I was making there: if I've understood your response correctly, you're saying that Galt is saying not "if you ever want an industrial society again, you will need /us/ and therefore have to abide by our terms" but "if you ever want an industrial society again, it will need to be built according to our moral principles because that's the only way to build a moral society". I don't think that's credible at all, for two reasons.

First, look at how that paragraph begins. "In the name of all the producers who had kept you alive and received your death ultimatums in payment, I now answer you with a single ultimatum of our own: Our work or your guns." What's at stake, according to Galt, is "our work". That seems to me to fit my interpretation much better than it fits yours.

Second, the argument you say Galt is making /is not in any way credible/ and I think that should have been obvious even to Rand (in the real world) and Galt (in her imagined world). We have /had/ an industrial society. It's worked pretty well. And it /wasn't/ run according to strict Randian/Galtian principles. Sure, in AS we're asked to suppose that it's all gone terribly wrong; but even if so, in both the real world and the world of AS industrial society was built and sustained for many years on terms very unlike Galt's.

#+begin_quote
  In terms of moral obligations, at what point /do/ you actually get to just be happy?
#+end_quote

The argument I think you're making here is based on a very debatable premise, and one that I /think/ Rand would have been quite cross about. Namely, that somehow we know from the outset that morally speaking there /is/ some point at which you "actually get to just be happy". I think Rand would have said: morality is determined by reason, and the proper moral values are whatever they are, and the way to find out whether we ever get to just be happy is to work out what moral values are dictated by reason and then see what the consequences are.

Of course, if you hold that moral values are subjective -- that somehow we /choose/ our values -- then it is eminently reasonable to say "we should choose values that human beings can actually live by without going mad", and then you might indeed take "actually getting to just be happy" as a requirement. But I'm pretty sure Rand would have thought that was an appallingly wrong way of proceeding.

Personally, I don't care what Rand would have disapproved of and I am something like a subjectivist: I think we do in some sense get to choose our values, though we don't get to choose what human nature is like or what world we're living in, and therefore some sets of values we might pick have predictably awful consequences. I would distinguish between values simpliciter and moral values in particular; what I value /morally/ is something approximating to "the greatest good of the greatest number", but my moral values are not my only values, I also value (e.g.) taking care of my family and having fun; for good or ill, the things I value are many and varied and don't all pull in the same direction, so I end up compromising: I devote some of my time and effort and money to the general good (at least as I see it), and some to my own selfish enjoyment. I don't see any reason why there should be any point at which I literally stop caring about the world, nor any point at which I literally stop caring about myself, so no, I never get to /just/ be happy (nor ever get to /just/ work for the Greater Good and ignore my own needs and wants), but in practice it turns out that I can do quite a lot of good and have quite an enjoyable life and take pretty good care of my family and so forth, and I don't see why I should assume that -- the world being what it actually is -- anything better than that is possible. Note that this is /not/ either the extreme case of "the enslavement of all to all" /nor/ the extreme case of caring only for one's own happiness. I would find either of those rather monstrous.

********* The whole setup is twisted to absurdity in an effort to create a world where a small group are the only people who are useful. In any reasonable reality employees who refuse to be useful like that group of engineers get fired and replaced. Fired employees don't eat. Therefore employees largely agree to do their jobs. It's that simple. People aren't useless because if a willingness to do their work doesn't come from any inherent motivation, it comes from being coerced into being useful.

Capitalism is not a nice system, but it does strongly incentivize people.

Characterizing the vast majority of society as unwilling to do anything useful because they're not rewarded for it is ridiculous. They're rewarded with food on the table and roofs over their heads.

As for Rand's moral line of argument, there are obvious issues in application with a moral philosophy that can and often is interpreted as 'Everyone's happiness is their own job, so if I've got what I want to be happy even at the expense of things you need to live, screw you.'

To put it another way, people use it to ignore the problem of externalized costs. To ignore the reality that civilizations are fundamentally cooperative, and calling exploitation a moral good is deeply problematic. Societies that embrace the pursuit of personal desires regardless of the cost to others create underclasses, suffering, and instability.

Then all the elites who were 'just pursuing their own happiness' while leeching off the labor of everyone else eventually wonder why they're being led to a guillotine in front of cheering crowds.

Societies that embrace the pursuit of personal desires regardless of the cost to others create underclasses, suffering, and instability.

It's actually a proposed /solution/ to externalized costs and exploitation. This is stuff Rand spends /hundreds/ of pages on. You're criticizing a caricature forged in such ignorance and bad faith that it's completely unrecognizable. "Not caring about Ayn Rand" is a perfectly valid choice, but being deeply invested in this kind of untethered, anti-outgroup propaganda is no way to go through life.

I'm not sure what argument you're trying to make, here. Of course if the engineers weren't paid then they would have no incentive to work. But they were paid, and they needed the money to live, so they had every incentive to work. Capitalism, not communism. (Which you've confused with socialism, which is not remotely the same thing. And the USSR wasn't even well executed communism, it was authoritarianism that claimed to be otherwise for legitimacy.)

I'm not going by the bad faith interpretations of Rand's opponents. I'm going by the common interpretation of her advocates. The economic elites who love Rand because they want moral justification for telling everyone else it's their job to be happy, even if those elites have created a system of grinding poverty for everyone else by their efforts to accumulate all the wealth for themselves. Plus all the people who dream of those elites, imagining themselves better and more valuable than everyone else.

That would be the ridiculous imagined 'exploitation' of a group of elites who feel they're responsible for the vast majority of wealth creation in society and should be rewarded according, ignoring the vast amount of labor done by everyone else.

The truth is that the people being paid less than what they're worth in a capitalist system are the laborers, and the capitalist class skims off the value of their labor for themselves. Randian fantasy reverses the direction of exploitation, allowing elites to attempt to justify a 'poor me' defense and grub for ever larger portions of an economy they contribute little to.

Sorry, I dashed that off pretty quick. I'm not going to get into the entire edifice of No True Socialism, but Rand was very much inspired by what she saw in the USSR. It's a common trend in real life economies that egalitarian rhetoric and socialist/communist policies result in marginal (and not so marginal) economic pullback. You seem to think that something like the bare threat of starvation will force people to keep being maximally productive, but this is completely disproved by countless historical examples. Plenty of people, even in full capitalist societies, do just barely enough to not get fired, and when everyone else is doing the same thing, the bar can drop unsustainably low with shocking ease.

It's not ignored. It's fully acknowledged. The issue is that is also demands that you admit that the Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and Elon Musks offer vastly more in the voluntary agreement of their employment contract to their marginal employee than that marginal employee offers back. In an actual corporation, the owner builds a vast fortune by taking a small sliver of the marginal productivity of many employees, in exchange for access to the productivity multiplying engine of the corporation.

They're paid exactly what they're worth in a capitalist system, because non-capitalist systems don't even have a coherent notion of "worth".

Reversing the direction of traditional exploitation is just Nietzsche's Slave Morality. Reversing it back again is /still exploitation/. And Rand's whole /thing/ is that no one should exploit /anyone/, that it should be mutually voluntary trades all the way down.

It's fairly common among Libertarians and Republicans with Libertarian leanings, or just Republicans busy making the case for eliminating the regulation of business, cutting social spending of any kind, and slashing taxes on the wealthy. The interpretation of Rand I'm describing to you is a core driver behind the 'caveat emptor' and 'everyone is responsible for pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps' arguments necessary to pretend to rationalize these policy positions, which are otherwise indefensible.

  small sliver
#+end_quote

Businesses parasitically take as much of the value of an employee's labor as they can get away with. They don't nobly keep the share to only what the owner(s) need to survive.

Owners and CEOs don't actually add all that much value to a company. Sure, Bill Gates and Elon Musk are decent engineers, but there are plenty of decent engineers who will work for $100,000 a year. What they're really paid for is owning capital, not delivering value with their own hands.

Elon can't make a billion dollars of cars all by himself, and if he isn't doing the work himself, why should he get so much of the profit from it? Why does he deserve more than the engineers who design the cars, or the people who actually build them? The difference between them and Elon is that Elon ponied up the investment capital. Not because he provided some great and worthy service to humanity that couldn't be offered by anyone else.

#+begin_quote
  And Rand's whole thing is that no one should exploit anyone, that it should be mutually voluntary trades all the way down.
#+end_quote

This is a fundamental mistake. As sad history has proven over and over again, voluntary agreements can be highly coercive and exploitative. Whole sections of contract law had to be invented over the last ten centuries to even begin to curb the sorts of abuses that desperate people could be compelled to agree to because they had no alternative. That an agreement is voluntary is only the beginning of an analysis of whether we can justify enforcing it, not the entirety of such an analysis.

If no examples of voluntary but exploitative arrangements are coming to mind, consider people who signed up to be serfs, or indentured servants, or sharecroppers because they had no alternatives. And those offenses against equity and human dignity are only the beginning of the horrors that wealthy and powerful people inflicted on the desperate with 'voluntary agreements' to expand their wealth and power.

******* You seem very stuck on this idea that anyone who has actually read the text will surely agree with you. I have read Rand, way back in college for ethics classes two decades ago. I recall writing a paper ripping apart her issues and looking for a few pieces that might be salvageable. There wasn't much. You'll forgive me if specific plot points don't come to mind after all that time. They were rather forgettable.

Have you listened to her interviews? I found them rather illuminating as to her actual beliefs, without all the intermediary messiness of the fictional framing device getting in the way. Her essays were similarly useful.

There are plenty of inflections points where people can reasonably disagree - I have a few myself. But hating Rand as a meme is ten thousand times more common than disliking Rand for what she actually argued, and I simply don't believe you that you read her. Every flag you throw up says that if that college paper story is even true, you googled and paraphrased a few criticisms which fit the pattern I mentioned above: bad faith personal attacks cribbed from bad faith personal attacks, cribbed from bad faith personal attacks.

Sorry, but this is all really obvious if you've actually read the books. Call it /unrealistic/, or the byproduct of trauma from the USSR, or a PSA on the consequences of 50's meth usage, but your description of her philosophy simply does not jive with the actual depictions of her heroes and villains, like James and Dagny Taggart, or Francisco. She had plenty to say about the proper functions of government (Rand supported quarantines!), and how certain functions might be handled otherwise; that's a huge part of the Gulch arc. Feel free to disagree that her ideas were optimal, or worth pursuing, or even baseline minimally workable, but insisting that she just never even considered them is pure ignorance.

I'm perfectly fine if Batman punches Condiment Man, a criminal by whose standards somehow "rob banks with ketchup" is an idea that makes sense, and there's no more depth than that to it. But I'm certainly not going to take Batman as a guide to how to handle crime and justice in real life (in fact, one might argue it's a problem when the character takes itself a lot more seriously while not expressing any deeper idea about the same issue, because /now/ it seems like it's saying something important when it's really no less childish than a guy in a bat suit fighting a guy with a pressurized mayonnaise tank strapped to his back). The problem is, if your fiction is supposed to work as a mental experiment that makes it clear /why/ your idea on how to run society is better than others, it should actually show us a realistic slice of what society looks like.

******** To steal your analogy, Condiment Man is /clearly/ an allegory about totalizing pathological obsessions, and we can tell this by all the time spent discussing and defining his totalizing pathological obsession, and the flaws in thinking that are involved. This works as an allegory because real people experience totalizing pathological obsession, and it's useful to define and describe it without the messiness that comes with trying to psychoanalyze your brother, who suffers from totalizing pathological obsession.

Complaining that this work is unfair to Condiment Man because it doesn't give him credit for his activism on behalf of the whales, or because he's an unrealistic character, is somewhere between "missing the point so badly that your English teacher will fail the paper" and "insane troll logic".

The point of Rand's idiot balls is that they're real ones that real people hold, and it's worthwhile to examine them and their consequences in isolation. Being a human endowed with abstract reasoning, you're supposed to be capable of drawing lessons from those examples that can be applied to other contexts. If you want to criticize those lessons, go read the book and do so. But this criticism is just nonsensical. It's like complaining that O'Brien from 1984 is a strawman.

But I'm not too interested in reading more Ayn Rand myself right now, to see if you're right. My epsitemics are fine (I think) and whilst I'm sure it would be insightful, she's so incredibly polarizing, that her insights can't be easily discussed with others.\\
I think that's what Wales laments in that interview.\\

She's been dead for forty years.\\
Maybe in another forty, she'll stop being so triggering.

On the other hand:\\
Many people read Ayn Rand when they are young.\\
Atlas Shrugged is probably the longest/densest book many young have ever read and the most philosophical, too.\\
Any philosophy at all, will improve (and sometimes temporarily or permanently destroy) the thinking of someone who's previously been untouched by higher-minded thought.\\

** Yes.

Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is a precursor for modern Rationalism, and Atlas Shrugged is for all means and purposes a 1950s era version of HPMOR.

Of course the philosophy itself is clunky as hell and full of holes, and the writing is poor: but please remember that she wrote it in 1950s way before modern Rationalists were even born.

She was basically like Wright Brothers of objective philosophy: knocking together a crude contraption of wood and glue that barely took off the ground, but was a proof of concept that made modern jets possible.

She effectively provided simple, but inescapable arguments that allow an ordinary person to dismantle spiritualism, existentialism, nihilism, religion, Marxism, and most importantly, Kantism.

With that she laid down the groundwork for modern Rationalism to be built on.

IMHO, it is good to read Ayn Rand as a teen to "scrub your brain" and get yourself rid of stupid cultural memes, and THEN you are ready to tackle Rationality as it is modernly conceived by people like EY.
