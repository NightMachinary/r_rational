Then someone in the cult noticed Veyers was a bit too good and mindraped him, getting the marker and meddled with it until he got it permanent.

Then Zach needed to be dealt with, and the best way would be to wipe the memory. It needs to be wiped from the stuff Zach used to get Veyers into the loop.

The temporary loop clearly has to have been used, only one could have been the original looper, Zach. So Zach already has known about at least some of the artifacts.

Zach kinda has to be the original, because if RR was original, there would be no need whatsoever to make Zach permanent. Only other reason of Zach being permanent would be if someone completely different was the original looper and he tested the thing with Zach, who they believed would not be a threat and RR stealing the loop from that different guy then.

******** I've been thinking that the Marker duplication is due to an aspect of the Marker itself, and that the main thing QI did besides the attempted merge was temporarily suppressing the soul-protecting reset aspect of the Marker. If it wasn't for QI doing that, Zorian would not have gotten the 2nd flawed Controller Marker.

As to why I think Marker duplication is an aspect of the Marker, it's because I think Zach's doubled mana capacity is because the Marker uses itself as the base to merge the Controller's original soul with their loop soul.

Also, is anyone else besides me going to be annoyed if after everything, it turns out that Tesen was RR? As long as he was downplaying his abilities to let Zach beat him up occasionally, it makes a lot of sense, but feels unsatisfying. Tesen would have had a far easier time getting access to the Royal Treasury for the Dagger (for the presumptive soulkill), could have foreknowledge of the Sovereign's Gate, could easily use his status to forge alliances with the high ranks among the Dragon Cultists and the Ibasans. And access to the Ibasans means access to QI means access to the Crown, which is probably necessary for temp soul markers, and he definitely had access to Zach, who was also probably necessary. Also he could have kept Zach in a coma for the first 6 loops after Zorian's inclusion to the loops.

The impression I got was that the reset was working properly, which is why the reset happened as soon as the marker registered that it was taking damage. I guess the restart could have timed out normally, but having that happen right at the moment that Zach and Zorian needed it would have been a pretty big coincidence.

#+end_quote

Could you explain this? Not sure I follow. Are you saying that the marker has some ability to merge souls because when Zach entered the loop, his marked real soul merged into a "templated Zach soul" inside the time loop? I actually have my own (completely unsubstantiated, probably wrong) theory on Zach's mana pool, which is that unlike most people he is a vanilla human with no soul modifications. I imagine at some point soul modifications were a fad and everyone was making shifters, empaths, etc., and along with that there were a bunch of inefficient trash mods like "slight boost to eyesight" that everyone and their mother had access to. These all spread throughout the population and, in their passive state, are soaking up the average person's mana reserves without them noticing. In this case, the unmodified humans are the ones that would have the largest mana pools. I can also see this playing into who gets to use the Sovereign Gate - the gods might not even consider people who were "tainted" with primordial essence, so the Noveda's (who possessed the gate for a long time) would try to keep their bloodline pure.

#+begin_quote

I hope he's not, but I still hope they discover a reason to slap him around. I vaguely remember QI calling Red Robe a brat or something as he was about to soulkill the aranea, so I was kind of assuming that Red Robe would be a kid. I guess even Silverlake would be a punk kid to a thousand-year-old bag of bones though, so that probably doesn't mean anything.

********** The reset did happen properly, but I figure without QI there actively trying to mangle Zach's soul with a merge, it would have happened a few seconds faster and without Zorian getting a Marker. One of the Marker's stated functions is to trigger a reset before any major damage can happen to the Controller's soul, if QI was inhibiting the protection, it makes his contribution greater and the replication of such a feat much more difficult. If all QI did was smash Zach and Zorian's souls together then it makes it seem easier for people to get Markers, even if it probably has a low success rate.

Zach's mana capacity per chapter 62:

#+begin_quote
  I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too... convenient to be natural.
#+end_quote

So, at some point before he was aware of his capacity it seems to have been doubled, and the mostly likely event was his entry into the Gate. Zorian didn't have any grasp of his initial reserves at the start of the story, and he was a much better student than Zach. Max reserves are roughly 4x initial reserves, which brings Zach to where he was at the start of the story.

And the most likely mechanism for merging the Controller's loop soul and original soul isn't the Guardian of the Threshold, but the Marker itself, which has several functions, many of which are still a mystery to Zach and Zorian. All the Guardian has to do is place the Controller's original soul with the Marker inside their initial loop body, and the Marker should take care of the rest, duplicating itself and then using itself to merge the two souls into one cohesive whole. Although as I write this I am wondering if I'm flawed in my reasoning since it doesn't assume the Controller's loop soul to have a Marker already, and the world inside the Gate should basically be a perfect copy of the world outside.

********** Exactly. For anyone else who had trouble remembering this part of the story, it's back in Chapter 4:

#+begin_quote
  "Ah, whatever," said Zack, rolling his eyes. "It's not like I'll be dead for good."

  Zorian looked at Zach incredulously, not really understanding what Zach was getting at. The lich seemed to understand, though.

  "Aaah, I see," the lich said. "You must be new to soul magic if you think this makes you invulnerable. I could just trap your soul in a soul jar, but I have a much better idea."

  The lich casually gestured towards Zorian, and he suddenly felt his entire body freeze up as if it was encased in some alien force. Another wave and Zorian was hurled with great speed towards the shocked Zach, where he painfully slammed into the other boy. They both ended up on the ground in a tangle of limbs, and Zorian was relieved that at least the unknown force paralyzing him was gone.

  "It doesn't matter if your soul can be reincarnated elsewhere if someone mutilates it beyond recognition before it gets there," the lich said. "After all, the soul may be immortal, but no one said it cannot be altered or added to."

  Dimly, Zorian could hear the lich chanting in some strange language that definitely wasn't standard Ikosian used in traditional invocations, but any curiosity about this was washed away by a wave of pain and unidentifiable /wrongness/ that suddenly slammed into him. He opened his mouth to scream but then his world suddenly erupted into bright light before suddenly going completely black.
#+end_quote

He's very intentionally trying to merge Zach's soul with Zorian. This is also reviewed when Zorian talks with Zach in Chapter 7, which reveals that Zach spent some 7 months in a coma, and:

#+begin_quote
  "It's just that it wasn't only my body that was affected -- my mind has been a little spotty ever since I woke up."

  Oh no...

  "I don't remember how I started this time loop," concluded Zach, confirming Zorian's fears. "Or whether it was me who started it in the first place. My memory is full of blanks like that at the moment. I'm hoping it will all come back to me but..."
#+end_quote

Zorian is not brought into the loop by some soul magic getting thrown haphazardly around a battlefield. Quatach Ichl intentionally muddled their souls together, with the goal of confusing soul magic that relies on Zach's marker being exclusive (like the time loop, or a lich's phylactery.

They might have found out that it only works during the planetary alignment and with most of the family killed in battle and the rest dying to the Weeping they might have chosen Zach as the next looper.

We dont really know how many years/decades/centuries the gate was in the posession of the Noveda family, so they might have been using it already a few times but I still think it is unlikely that the gate was created by the Noveda family.

*** The theory I put forward (and it's not disproved; Zorian is still just speculating) is that RR didn't modify the temporary marker, but rather used compulsions to have Zach keep re-applying it to him every six months. Which could also neatly explain why he exited once Zach became aware of him and hostile to him: he couldn't 'recharge' any more without subduing Zach and performing further mind magic, which he failed to do.

Either way, though, we don't have an answer as to why the Guardian treated it as a full Controller marker and let him out of the loop.

Here's another idea that builds off your theory, although even I don't find this idea likely: RR never found a way out of the loop. He was able to confuse the Guardian enough to bar the Gate, but finally could not exit the loop. From a dramatic prospective, this idea would be so anticlimactic that I find it totally unlikely.

They'd still have a lot to deal with post-loop though, so it wouldn't be /that/ anticlimactic. The threat of RR has given ZZ focus and they've both benefited tremendously.

Also, I would expect the cautious Zorian especially to behave differently when faced with permanent death outside the loop, and the battle would be a lot different if he chickened out and didn't participate. If the fight at Cyoria or Iasku takes too long, you run the risk of one group reinforcing the other. If things go pear-shaped you risk fighting a lich, demon(s), a bone dragon, and maybe a fully transformed Sudomir all at once or close together.

Without RR the loop works as intended: it lets the loopers to study mission critical scenarios and figure out the best points of attack. For example, the fight at Iasku is completely avoidable. You can assassinate Sudomir and raze the mansion with artillery spells.

That's why there has to be RR to make things interesting: he takes out a big chunk of information about mission critical events and makes this information unknowable within the loop. Without him even extra cowardly Zorian can prevent the primordial summoning. I don't think Zach would ever shy away from danger and he is the big gun. Now, if Zach doesn't get out of the loop, things get interesting, but that's unlikely.

tl;dr: there has to be RR in the final month for literary reasons.

Also, I forgot that Zorian has simulacra anyway, so his courage level is pretty irrelevant.

The main point of my comment is that the loop is not a perfect simulation, the main example being the connection with other planes. They also have the soulkilled entities back in play, the marked people would evaluate risk differently, and they may also lose the brand when they exit the loop, which would open up other possibilities(can't think of anything helpful right now... maybe better relations with the Ghost Serpent). There could be other differences we don't know about.

But there may be workarounds for that. Eg unlike the Controller marker, the temporary marker presumably does not embed itself into every part of the target soul; it's designed to be removed. So, presumably it's possible for RR to deliberately remove it during his last month, ready for the Controller to bestow a new one, thus maintaining continuity.

#+end_quote

er... no.

You are kinda forgetting that the gate recreates the whole world from the template /including creating new souls/. That's why the limitation was placed in the first place, these new souls are eventually destroyed. According to the guardian killing off one month deviation from the original is not considered morally wrong. I don't agree personally, but that's what the story says and we gotta roll with it. That's the whole reason this 6 month-limitation exists in the first place. Cheating it with something as /trivial/ as simply overwriting is uncharacteristic of the guardian.

With that in mind, here's what the loop does:

#+begin_example
  take a snapshot of the world
  take the controller's soul out of their real body
  while the controller is inside:
      recreate the physical world
      populate the bodies with new souls that are not marked 'soul kill' # soul eject is a better term
      insert controller's real soul into their body
      iterate temporary markers
      insert passengers' souls into their bodies
      try:
         run a month
      except:
         something goes really wrong with the controller's soul or some primordial shit shows up
      finally:
         pluck the controller's soul out of their in-loop body
         if a passenger's marker has more time scheduled: 
            pluck the passenger's soul out of their in-loop body
         collapse current iteration # every soul not taken out is destroyed
#+end_example

This means we never remove temporary markers, we only apply them. Instead we just discard expired passengers just like we discard any regular one-monthers

Besides, it's just basic security. You do not mess with your Master branch! You only apply small patches to it. Should something go /really/ wrong with the gate, worst case scenario the real controller does not return and becomes a meat puppet.

Remember, anyone who lasts longer than a month is considered a person by the Guardian's algorithms, and thus the Controller effectively kills a person by using the ability; the Guardian simply disavows responsibility. The six-month limit is just meant to discourage the Controller from doing that; they're already going beyond what the Gate itself is allowed to do. Not letting the copies escape to the real world is the critical bit.

Incidentally, I've wondered before whether Zorian might be able to point out to the Guardian that since he became a person due to (the programming errors of) the Gate, the Guardian has some responsibility to help him survive.

*** Well, the temp marker theory was discussed around the time we learned about it.

There is a theory that Veyers is Red Robe. My objection to that is that pre-loop Veyers has no skills whatsoever to manipulate something as complex as a marker, even if a temp one is less complex than the original. And he doesn't have the potential to learn anything that complex in the extra 6 months that the marker would give him. I mean, his specialization is fire magic, something completely different.

My theory was that Zach in an attempt to stop the invasion alerted some top Cyorian official, that also happened to be a to cult member. Now /these/ people are skillful mages, so potential to manipulate the marker is there. And they have a motive not only to unleash a primordial, but to do is as smoothly as possible. After all, their target is mind controlling it, so naturally they are seeking all the chances to raise probability of success and survival.

Now, Veyers being a spy for the cult offers another vector to Zach but that ultimately leads again to the very top cultists. Veyers is a link, just as Zorian said.

I guess something normal Veyers did in the original version of the month leads him to Zach. Maybe he confronted him, seeing Zach as the reason for his own failure and then something made Zach spill the beans. If this happened with any consistency, he had to be removed.

edit: you know... after reading this chapter I kinda start to think this very plausible! That remark Zach just made about the losers' solidarity. They had A LOT in common in that, Boranova was the biggest loser of his class, and not entirely his fault. The unruly bloodline talent kinda made things hard for him. I can see Veyers seeking to punch Zach in the face, similar how Fortov seeks Zorian albeit for a different purpose. Sure, Zach would enjoy being prepared and kicking Veyer's ass... once. Twice. Thrice, maaaaaybe? Somewhere down the line I see him trying to figure this out and then sympathizing for the guy.

**** The main problem that I see with that theory is that Zach doesn't seem to have the ability to grant temporary markers in the first place. If the ability is granted by one of the Ikosian artifacts, then at some point Zach must have had that artifact. No easy feat, as we have seen, and Z&Z speculated that the artifact to grant temporary markers is the crown that Quatach Itchl keeps on his head. So, did he lend Zach the crown, when Quatach Itchl doesn't really trust the Cult of the Dragon Below? Seems unlikely.

The other option is that the ability to grant temporary markers is inherent, Zach learned it, and RR made Zach forget it. Possible, and the more likely possibility, but given RR's displayed level of mind magic I'm still unsure.

Thinking about it more, maybe Zach was taught spells by the person who gave him the marker intended for managing the loop. What if Z&Z are wrong about what the dagger and crown do, and the abilities are just spells that need to be taught? RR could have stolen those from Zach's mind, wiped them (because wiping memories seems to be about the extent of RR's memory manipulation), then left Zach to his own devices?

Seemed inconsequential at the time when the crown was basically just a part of the lich's costume, but may be relevant if they just have to get their hands on it.

And Zach has some black blades, and Alanic a golden orb, and Xvim the magical prowess to go toe-to-toe with the lich in Chapter 60.

Gettingthe crown would be difficult and risky, but seems doable, especially if they can get support from a large battle group again. Finding the lich early would likely be an important step.

***** What if Zach originally had the knowledge about the locations of the artifacts? After all it is possible he had worked his way into the Cults ranks to steal magic/abilities at one point probably to gain access to those artifacts. Considering how Zach played various people and factions to learn new tricks he otherwise would have been unable to and some of his quite reckless past action sin loop subtlety isn't really his first choice with situations.

Veyers is likely a link in all of that and a key incentive may be the crown and dagger being both easy to access through the (tenuous) relationship between the Cult of the Dragon Below and Quatach Itchl. With the right deal I suspect the Lich would be willing to borrow the crown especially if what he thought he could gain from the deal outweighed the losses.

This sort of involvement would give access to the artifacts and also lead to a perfect situation for a cult member to find a way to trick his way into the loop especially if Zach had given him extra time via the temporary marker to find a way to prevent decay and trick the guardian into thinking he was a controller, two separate functions which may very well be connected such that fixing one may fix the other depending on what variables encoded in the markers are used to indicate status.

I may or may not keep to my original theory that Zach knew things about the loop, but Red Robe was able to acquire the crown and dagger for him to give him those abilities.

I definitely started assuming as of last chapter that Veyers and Zach got along (sympathy, doing badly in school and having your house legacy stolen by adults? It's a one-two punch), Zach told Veyers about the time loop, and Red Robe heard about the time loop via the lawyer, and then did whatever.

I guess it depends on what kind of "mundane" divine magical ability the crown might have.

If they knew about the loop, then upon entering it they have no knowledge what iteration is it, 1 or 1000. So if they subverted the loop from the inside on iteration 1, they should make some attempts on iteration 500 (or whatever iteration we have now, I forgot). This is where they should get busted.

*** I've argued it as an altered temporary marker in the past, but without any certainty. Age of Gods magic was kinda shitty, the modern shaping skills and structured magic seemed like they might have the ability to alter a temporary marker in a way that was never actually intended to be possible.

Still, even if they're right this chapter and it isn't Veyers, but rather someone else using an altered temp marker, that raises a few important questions.

Applying temporary markers should be a privilege of the Controller, probably with the Crown. Unless QI somehow had a hack for the Crown that allowed him to apply a marker despite not being the Controller? And in that case, why wouldn't he just apply it to himself? They could be wrong about the Crown being necessary for temp markers, but then what?

There's also the question of how anyone would know that they were inside the Loop to start experimenting, which still makes me think that someone intentionally activated the Gate a month early. Even if, as Silverlake implies here, that specific knowledge relating to the primordials would give easy, irrefutable evidence of the time loop, that still doesn't give whoever RR is much opportunity to set things in motion if they only found out while inside the loop.

If the Dagger allows Soulkill to be used, maybe RR has links to the Eldemar royalty somehow? (The Dagger is in the royal treasury in the capital.) Alternatively, RR wasn't able to access the dagger at first or didn't know what it did.

Soulkilling Veyers and wiping him from Zach's memory only makes sense if as either a red herring (which itself was nigh-indiscoverable) or to prevent Zach from determining RR by interacting with Veyers. It would kind of make sense if these things happened at two different times, first the memory wipe of Veyers from Zach's mind, and only doing the Soulkill of Veyers much later on when RR got the ability to do so.

It's notable that while Veyers has indirect links to the Dragon Cultists, he still should not have had easy access to the signature "red robe" unless he was a mage of Zach or Zorian's skill, since as far as I can remember those are hidden under the defenses of high-ranking Cultists.

*** One possibility I'm thinking of is that Zach was introduced to RR as a potential teacher, through Varys.

Earlier in the time loop, Zach told everyone he was a time traveler, tried to learn about every classmate, and was also trying to master combat magic. He must have needed powerful teachers but doesn't mention specifically who taught him yet- just that being who he is, people are happy to work with him. It's possible that while befriending or getting to know Varys, he meets RR. Zach lost his house, Varys is being usurped from his- there's some common ground there. Varys maybe gets in better terms with Zach and they decide they can help each other's house, so he introduces Zach to a powerful person... whom also turned out to be a high ranking member in the Cult.

RR is skilled in mind and soul magic, as long as you don't compare to Zorian. RR learns of the time loop because he reads Zach's memories, and sees the potential of getting in and furthering his own ambitions- among which is a successful assault on the city during the planetary alignment. After RR sets up (whatever it is he does to get into the time loop), RR wipes Zach's memories of him, his knowledge of how the loop works, and Varys. As extra measures, Varys is soul killed as well so there is no way Zach could coincidentally lead himself to RR again.

Perhaps Zach told Veyers of his plan to use the Sovereign Gate, Veyers shared it with a contact in the Cult of the Dragon Below, who saw an opportunity for him or herself. So RR knows he or she is probably in the loop from the beginning.

** Hey, here's a possible cause for concern: we've been told about RR attacking Zach at the very start of the restart, apparently having rushed over without doing much beyond putting on the robe, presumably to take Zach unaware.

Except that we know from Kael's examination of the aranea that the restart doesn't begin at the moment Zorian wakes up. It begins at something like 2am. Wouldn't RR have tried to make use of that? If he could have attacked while Zach was asleep, his ambush would have actually succeeded.

Is it possible that it didn't really happen the way Zach described? He's the only source for the event, and we /know/ that his memory has been altered by RR before. And he hasn't let Zorian examine his mind since then.

I think it's pretty clear that the guy still in the loop and working with Zorian /is/ Zach. A disguise would slip eventually, over the years they've been working together, and the combat skill and mana reserves he's displayed make it pretty clear IMO that he's the real deal.

But after thinking about it on my second read through, I'm putting less weight on that idea. His concern about Aranea or others he missed at their colony, in the chapter Soulkill, seems fully genuine, which makes me think he rushed there almost as quickly as Zorian, and thus he must wake up pretty close to the same time as Zach and Zorian. It seems feasible they're in a kind of culture where there's a certain typical hour for waking up.

It's pretty hilarious that Zorian only got up at that time because of Kirelle, since he likes to sleep in normally.

It's not about the timing, it's about Zach becoming a monster who thinks nothing of beating someone in general or even just Tessen in particular to a bloody pulp. That could psychologically screw with him when he gets out and turn him into an actual murderer. Zorian expressed similar concerns about himself, that's why he didn't want to ambush and mindrape all the specialists on his list to get their secrets and abilities.

In other words, if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.

** Man. And people complained about a chapter without a lot of action for the last chapter.

I feel a bit foolish that I dismissed mucking about with the temporary marker so early as a possibility for entry into the loop.

We've just recently had confirmation that the Sovereign Gates' safety measures are already obsolete in the face of modern magic. Red Robe taught himself unstructured mind magic just to mess with Zach's mind without triggering them, and that Quatach-Ichl bypassed the "soul-fuckery detection" function to do the soul meld as a matter of course.

This miiiiight also explain why Zorian was able to use the soul marker divination to find Zach but Red Robe appeared unable to find Zorian: there's a "stuck" identifier value in Zorian's damaged Brand copy that matches the same identifier on Zach's, and a differing value is enough to make it impossible to use as the key to find another matching marker. Or maybe despite it being possible to wreck whatever makes it actually temporary, the temporary mark might be nearly completely different from the Brand. Though not different enough that it precludes using the loop excision ability (which makes sense if it's tied to an item anyways).

PS: I only just now, writing this, realized that nobody103 has said repeatedly that names are phonetic, and based roughly on Croation. The 'h' in Zach isn't decoration. His name is probably pronounced /zatʃ/ (zatch). I hope I get "mind: blown" comments so I don't feel alone in this.

***** I'll admit I didn't keep up with [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s MoL discussions lately, but back when I did, there was the following theory: the time loop is one of the safeguards of primordials' prisons, such that if a primordial is ever released, it initiates the restarts and tasks the Controller with stopping it from happening.

Of course, it needs to be reconciled with time loop's mechanic as we know it now. Since there's no real time travel going on, this system wouldn't be able to /prevent/ the primordial from being released, only triggering after it already happened.

Perhaps there's a copy of the world constantly running in a parallel dimension, one month ahead of the "real" one? But it would be imperfect, with no access to astral plane, which makes it dubious as a security feature. Hmm...

As a matter of fact, it probably isn't the primary intended purpose of the time loop, as The Guardian of the Threshold doesn't mention anything of the sort in [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/55/Mother-of-Learning][Chapter 55]], saying that the time loop's purpose depends on the Maker and the Controller. I'm thinking that /if/ it is used as a primordials' prisons' safeguard as well, it was supposed to be operated under gods' oversight, and since they have disappeared, it activated, but picked not a person suited to the task, but somehow marked based on inheritance (?), and didn't explain itself.

** So, here is my thought with the 'Redcloak is a modified temporary marker user' theory: How the heck did he get the /temporary/ marker. Immediate answer is that Zack, as the probable original marker owner, gave it to him. Well, how did he do that? Current speculation from our protagonists is that one of the seven Items probably grants that ability.

...which implies that Zack, at a point in time when he was much weaker in magic, somehow got access to this Item that he currently doesn't know how to access.

...which would imply that after after he Temporary Marker'd Redcloak, he lost the memory of how to acquire the Item. Presumably it's something rather straightforward once you know how to do it, otherwise this weaker Zack wouldn't have been able to. The protagonists just need to figure out what Zack used to know, and they could probably acquire a powerful tool (bringing some of their friends into the loop temporarily, for example)

Actually, here's a bit of wacky speculation: Zack acquired the information on how to obtain this Item through some sort of interaction with Veyers. Maybe his unique knowledge of fire magic was involved in some way. Maybe Veyers' House knew something that Veyers found out about. Maybe he had some diplomatic route to an Item. In any case, in this speculation Veyers is /not/ Redcloak, but when Redcloak was convinced there were other temporary marker users in play, he acted to keep Zack from setting up any temporary marker users in the future: 1) "Soul-kill" any people he thought might be temporary marker users. 2) Wipe knowledge of the Item from Zach's mind, along with knowledge that might lead to him reacquiring it, such as talking to Veyers again. 3) "Soul-kill" Veyers so Zach couldn't accidentally run into him again.

Doesn't even need to be full-blown mind control, which IIRC is pretty hard to do. Just convince him to bring someone he trusts into the loop, Neolu for example, and use transformation magic to appear as that person to get the mark. Then blank Zach's memories so he forgets that he did it.

Zorian seems to have powered up way too much in arc 3, compared to how long he has been in the timeloop. Around 7 years since he started looping, he transformed from a first circle mage, to someone who can apparantly rival Silverlake, a century old witch.

Earlier in the story he admited that without the time loop he would never become an archmage, but now, 7~years later, he can pretty much break any mind shield, cast an invisible magic missile, ward better than a century old witch, create war golems, and who knows what else. In my opinion he progressed way to fast, compared to what I remember of the MoL lore.

Going from my memory here, he used his first 7 months before Zach woke to get better at schoolwork, and didnt really progress much overall. Then he spent some time getting to the level of a academy graduate, when he leaves Cyoria after Arc 1. He then spends a few months with Alanic getting the basics of soul sense. Then the next year he focuses on mind magic, getting to be absurdly good after around 4 years in the loop. He also starts diving into golem making at this point. Going from a novice to someone who can make war golems in three years of unfocused study.

Where in all that could he have gotten the skills to rival someone who has hundred years of experience in magic in general.

***** The mind magic and war golems are less of a hurdle than you think. Remember that he has an innate talent for mind magic due to being an empath, so his rapid progress there is not a surprise.

For the war golems, he took advantage of dozens of professional golem makers work. He spent huge sums of money going to many different golem makers having them refine his designs over the loops. Let's say he bought 1 month of polishing each from 5 pro golem crafters every loop. After 12 loops, that's 5 years of pro-level research and design.

***** I'm sure you're tired of people disagreeing with you, as I see all the replies are, but I have to contribute. I do have the benefit of rereading the whole thing (and then the world building blog and all comments... just that fixated) just about 8 weeks ago, so let me go through these.

#+begin_quote
  Shaping skills gives no bonus to mind magic, soul sensing, or warding.
#+end_quote

Firstly, there are specific shaping exercises for mind magic, as well as soul magic and warding. Zorian may have a special bloodline ability that makes it intuitive, but his mind magic is still basically the same unstructured mind magic a non-bloodline mage could use, just improved hilariously by his clear sense for minds. Shaping exercises should almost help his ability /more/ than they would structured mind magic (there's a chapter where Xvim helps him with mind magic shaping by dispelling Zorian's mind shell and following it up immediately with a stunner, so Zorian has to train to instantly reform his defenses; I believe it's the same chapter that mentions Zorian finding a book with mind magic shaping exercises that he starts doing).

All shaping exercises help with all other shaping a little bit (this is mentioned very early on: that just doing the basic three---telekinesis, light, and fire shaping---improves a modern mage's foundation for all magic), but raw mana shaping and sensing improves all other shaping much more substantially, and Zorian has also trained that under the tutelage of an archmage, and by using incredibly expensive and rare potions to speed it up (mostly one based on the grey hunter that gives him its magic sense, to improve his ability to sense his own magic while doing raw mana shaping).

And don't forget that there's a lot of time we don't really see, and he's the kind of person who will spend his downtime waiting for someone doing shaping exercises. The benefits of which also carry between simulacrums, because it's still the same soul. Plus, he's had more than 30 days per loop (59, and up to 74 recently) for quite a few loops now.

Warding is just a normal branch of magic, though I can understand any confusion because it's so often used through spell formulae, which are also how magical tools (like golems) are made. But most spell formulae are still deeply connected with normal spell casting skills. Fundamentally, they are mostly used to maintain and enhance a spell that's cast into them: they act as more complex, harder to create, but much more potent and enduring invocations (also understandable confusion, since chapter 11, Limiters, published some... +three years ago?+closer to five, was the main time that was covered in detail, and it's quite explicit that improved shaping spells make for improved magical objects).

As for the timeline, he doesn't merely get better at schoolwork in the first period, or improve to graduate level, he gets to the point where he meets Xvim's insanely high standards on both the telekinesis and light shaping exercises and games the loop to get accelerated, apprentice-only instruction from Ilsa until he learns to teleport (when he starts this he believes he's already good enough to test out of the academy, which in the real world at least often implies more raw ability than completing ones courses), a skill that seems to be far ahead of typical-graduate level.

Now consider the main ways he rivals Silverlake: he's able to bring massive combat golems with him only because he has the divine relic orb, and he's better than her with wards (it's likely that his disadvantage using a small portable wardstone vs Silverlake's permanent ones is matched by his wards being defensive and hers offensive). Wards are actually one of the important components of golem making (half the reason golems are useful is that you can completely cover them with wards powered by ambient mana), which is adjacent to his core interest in spell formulae, and one of the areas he's had at least an actual year of hyper speed advancement via hiring and rehiring some of the best warding experts across the entire continent with his bottomless wallet and carrying journals across restarts. Hell, it's entirely possible that the specific blue-print for that stone he uses to beat her wards is something made as a collaborative effort by dozens of top experts in Altazia, and it's pretty much explicit that at least parts of his golems are too.

On the other hand, his alchemy abilities may be impressive, but they're not even in the same league as someone who's made a potion of unaging, and we know little about her ability in soul magic, divination, transformation, and many other fields.

And truly, age isn't everything. Xvim is only a mortal, but was able to block everything Quatach-Ichl (a thousand +year old gods-touched lich) threw at him.

+Though uh, perhaps in support of your point, Silverlake was there for the coming of the Ikosians. She's probably over 400 years old.+ One more edit: I had a sudden doubt and looked at the chapter itself: "When I was born the covens had already been on their last legs," so that actually puts a ceiling on her age, rather than a minimum.

His skills /don't/ rival Silverlake's in her fields of specialty: potion-making, pocket dimensions. And what he does know about pocket dimensions, he learned from her.

Combat magic isn't her thing, presumably not something she enjoys, so when she's out in the middle of nowhere, with her home practically undetectable, known only to a few, and protected by heavy wards, she doesn't spend time on it. She's easily good enough to fend off tourists, and isn't picking fights with anyone powerful.

*** Zorian had advantages over those seven years that other mages wouldn't:

- One-on-one instruction from multiple Academy staff.
- Mentoring from an archmage whose approach was basically focused on preparing others to be archmages. You don't need perfected shaping skills in order to be ordinary, after all.
- Functionally unlimited money, allowing an unusual degree of experimentation and practical experience in fields such as alchemy and golem-crafting, plus no need for a 9-to-5 to support himself. Consider: Edwin came from a family of golem-crafters and was obsessed with the subject, but couldn't afford to actually make any designs himself, and he wasn't initially able to understand part of Zorian's blueprint as a result.
- Access to many restricted or outright illegal spellbooks, from the aranea and cultists and various other sources.
- Advanced tutoring from mages on Xvim's list.

And remember how Zach said that with his approach to learning combat magic, you tend to die a lot? Outside the time loop, most mages probably either have safe careers, or short ones.

ETA Also, Zorian's wards didn't necessarily have to be /better/ than Silverlake's, he just needed to stalemate her. And his mind magic is easily explained: first, it's an innate gift, and secondly, unlike most humans, he used the loop to get actual thorough instruction in how to use it. His mastery of magic missile was a deliberate choice as a result of his low mana reserves; Zach has much more overall combat skill, just focused on much more powerful spells that would drain Zorian too fast to be worthwhile. Plus, mentored by Xvim.

If Zorian and Zach fought, those invisible magic missiles would splash off Zach's shields, and Zach would quickly pulverise Zorian's shields in return. Zorian is probably too skilled to be easily taken by surprise, but fighting at Zach's level he would quickly run out of mana.

ETA 2: It probably doesn't hurt either that Zorian uses mind magic to memorise things perfectly. You and I might need to re-read a book, he just creates a memory packet.

*** He can break any mind shield from non-psychics who can't reinforce their mental shields given a couple minutes to work without interruption, the invisible magic missile is a party trick, he's better than said witch in an area she doesn't specialize in, and he commissioned the design of the war golems rather than design them himself.

In addition to the increased pace of "and we spent 5 restarts doing stuff", another poster said that Zorian is better able to take advantage of the time loop the better he gets. At the start, he basically just followed an average student's path. Go to class, learn spells, work on shaping, read. As he gets better and he no longer needs to do that routine, he becomes able to find ways to repeatedly make literal tons of money, offer that money for normally prohibitively expensive tutoring, spells, and magic items, take what would normally be incredible risks for huge rewards, and more recently use simulacra for a variety of purposes. He seems to be progressing extremely fast compared to how he was simply because he is progressing faster, and it's all explained. Had he tried to pursue the path he has taken in this story, he would have permanently died to the Sword Divers, or in an assassination, or after doing the soul separation awareness ritual enough times, or somewhere else.

*** He has far more help and knowledge than he would have without the loop. Just like Daimen had the skills for the Gate-Spell but lacked the spell itself. In the MoL world people lack knowledge but once you have that knowledge acquiring the skills is rather easy. And especially in the last few months he has been using simulacrums to solve some problems. Think about the defense spell in the previous chapter that was created with his individual shaping excercises in mind. He didnt even create the spell himself, he paid experts to do it for him. Learning that spell afterwards is easy. And you shouldn't forget the extra time in those time dilation chambers they found, making every month into 2-3 months.

I dont really find that strange. Once his shaping excercises reach a specific point, learning new skills is supposed to be easy in MOL Universe.

That's assuming that the primordials are outside the loop. Which I think is a reasonable assumption, because if the gods were capable of routinely creating and destroying them, they wouldn't have needed to lock them away in the first place. And if even gods can't deal with primordials that way, I doubt that the Gate can.
