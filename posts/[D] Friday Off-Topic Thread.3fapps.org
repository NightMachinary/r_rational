Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Seriously, is there a name for this bias? If it is a bias? It's one of the most frustrating things in the world. I mean, where does a statement like this /come/ from?

  It seems like Eliezer has convinced a ton of nerds (I hate the word but let's roll with it) that they can succeed in writing fiction by applying this one weird trick. But you need much more than that.

wtf is this shit? There's not the faintest attempt at trying to support this claim. It's an impression based on the commenter's own inventions. And no one calls him out on /making shit up about other people that makes them sound worse than anyone actually has reason to believe./

Then you have this wild and confusing generalization:

#+begin_quote
  A general failing of HPMOR and most 'rational' fiction is they suffer from the same plot railroading. Instead of starting with a world rules, characters, problem, and unbiased evaluation of what happens they generally try and fast talk their way into some predefined plot.
#+end_quote

like he's read it all, and like that's some kind of problem of rational fiction instead of shitty amateur fiction i mean srsly wtf

And of course the coup de grace:

#+begin_quote
  I think it's tapping into a rich market, that of people who believe they are much more rational (read: smart) than the broader herd. The conviction is already there.
#+end_quote

This kind of thing is all over the place in so many contexts, not just this one instance, which isn't particularly bad. It just baffles me how people think it's okay to make this stuff up, and why so many people go along with it.

** I went to an orchestral concert last night, and while I enjoyed it (mostly modern pieces mixed with the music of early 20th century iconoclast composer Charles Ives), it got a standing ovation. Pretty much every play, concert, or performance piece I've gone to in the past few years has gotten a standing ovation.

The cause of this is standing ovation inflation. I think it's the same reason that the United States has a tipping culture; it was just something that happened for good service, then morphed into the standard, and now when you don't tip someone, you're not making a stand against the shifting social landscape, you're just an asshole (or you're both). And for standing ovations, when everyone else is standing you don't want to be the only one sitting, so there's a strong social pressure to just stand up and clap politely, because you were probably going to stand up anyway to get out of the theater.

I hate that social stuff. So much of it seems like a pervasive, necessary evil in my life. I am sociable, in that I can pretty easily navigate my way through these hoops. I just wish there were a way to opt out of some of the dumb stuff that society does without having some negative impact on me. I want to be able to say to people, "No, I don't want to have dinner with you, because I prefer to be alone" instead of having to invent some excuse or needing to give some assurance that I still like them. I want to be able to leave a friend's house by just saying, "I've extracted enough joy from this encounter, to the point where I think there's probably going to be diminishing returns, hope the same is true for you". I don't really have a meaningful way to accomplish this change that I want from the world, especially given that communication seems detrimental in this case (because it would make me look either weird or assholish).

I've been on the other side of this when the choir I'm in puts on a performance. I'm not sure if it's because of inflation or if I just never got it in the first place, but I get mildly annoyed at standing ovations.

I mean, we're good, but we're not /that/ good. There's no need for an entire new level of praise for our performances that sets us apart from merely clapping. (Individuals saying they enjoyed it and thanking us for the performance after the fact is very appreciated, though.)

*** I have been having a strongly different reaction to you in response to a similar type of signalling. For a while now I've been participating in Toastmasters (public speaking practice group) in order to strengthen what I perceive as lacking public speaking skills / confidence. In Toastmasters... or at least the group I am in... Everyone claps. For everything. Everyone introduces themselves every meeting, even if everyone already knows each other - and at each introduction, of every single person, everyone claps. Each prepared speech is introduced - everyone claps. Each prepared speech ends - everyone claps. Every unplanned speech - everyone claps. Every award or whatever - everyone claps. No matter how well or dismally done a thing is, there is applause for it. When we welcome a new member to the club, we all line up and continually clap at them, only briefly stopping one at a time while they shake hands with us.

I thought recently, that I really ought to be resenting this for pretty much exactly the same sort of reasons you describe here (waste of my time, signaling where all inputs lead to same signal seems pointless?). However, I don't actually feel that way about the clapping, and it's taken some thought to try to isolate why that is.

There are a few things going on here emotionally for me:

Firstly, from the recipient perspective: being clapped for by everyone, grants a sort of assurance and trust to what the reception will be to whatever you say or do. This means that you don't feel the social pressure to worry constantly about being perfect - no matter how much you screw up, you know that your immediate reception will not be jeers or otherwise anything other than supportive applause. You still may get meaningful criticism and nonpositive feedback later, but the immediate reception always being applause removes a hugely disproportionate feeling of anxiety from public interactions. It's tremendously relieving. Even though it may be false. Even though people may not really 'mean it'. Whatever - the emotional effect of certainty of immediate reaction is real, and extremely comforting when speaking, for me at least.

Secondly, from the applauder perspective - clapping is essentially signalling 'I am part of this group who clap at and support even the worst of us'. It's probably an ingroup signaling thing. As a signalling device in constant use through the meeting by the entire group, it has almost taken on ritual significance - like the liturgical responses to prayers, or similar religious effects. Doing it over and over again becomes less effortful and feels more meaningful each time it is done in a meeting, sort of.

I don't think I am expressing this whole thing very clearly but the thing's really weird and difficult to explain, and I don't think I entirely understand my own affection for the practice. I am pretty sure that if you described the clapping habits I describe above to me before I went to a single meeting I would think of it as a weird, pointless waste of time, but now I actually really like the practice.

***** For each prepared speech we have 2-3 minute evaluations (that are also done as public speeches in front of everyone, and likewise applauded). These evaluations include both praise and criticism, for whatever virtues or flaws your speech happens to include, with specific directions and constructive advice. For the evaluations and brief unprepared speeches, to get detailed feedback you have to talk to people during the break or after the meeting - though we also vote for a best speech in the seperate prepared/unprepared/evaluation categories each meeting as well. Also, there are paper slips everyone is encouraged to fill out to give their opinions of each speech anonymously as well. Finally, you get some speech statistics at the end of the meeting for each speaker too (length of speech from the timer, use of 'ah' and 'um' etc from an 'Ah counter', and good/bad grammar use from the evening's grammarian)

The fact that I am being evaluated and criticised feels a lot less threatening when I am speaking, if I know that I am going to be greeted by applause even though I know intellectually it may be false applause, and the actual out-loud evaluation will be delayed until later on. This is pretty 100% irrational but the emotional reaction exists anyways.

*** My reason for not standing up at a performance is follows: the purpose of a standing ovation is for the audience to show the performers their appreciation for the performance. If I stand up all the time, the signal is now meaningless. I've gotten looks from people as if saying "you're a dick for not standing," but the opinion of a stranger I'll never meet again holds little weight.

In the US, workers who receive more than $30/month in tips can be paid $2.13/hour. Yes, if the amount of tips is low enough, their employer is supposed to pay them more so that they do make the federal minimum wage of $7.25. So I could make a stand and not tip, but the restaurant and waiter will more likely interpret this as me being a tightwad ("f!@#ing cheapshake asian at table 2 didn't leave a tip") than taking a social position.

At the end of the day, I have a more fulfilling job and am more financially secure than my server. In terms of utility function, $1-2 means more to them than it does to me, so I just go along. Is this rationalization?

The problem is signal transformation. It starts with people standing to show strong appreciation. Then it becomes standing to show regular appreciation. Then it becomes standing to not signal disdain. So if the accepted interpretation of sitting at the end of performance instead of standing with everyone else is that you didn't like the performance ... then that's what you're signaling, in spite of what you might hope you're signaling.

** I've started noticing how the tiniest differences in introductions can completely change how I read a story. Recently, the link to [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/muse.shtml][Muse]] billed it as "rational horror", and then I noticed horror stuff starting from basically the start.

The same thing happened with [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/?xcbv][The Cambist and Lord Iron]], "A Fairy Tale of Economics." I started looking for fairy tale elements, which I found.

Comparing that to when I read [[http://web.archive.org/web/20090414062819/http://www.asimovs.com/hugos_2009/Truth.shtml][Truth]], or novels like The City and the City or Ancillary Justice, where I knew absolutely nothing (beyond the fact that they were award winning) about them, I think that even the tiniest bits of information about a story can reduce my enjoyment of them.

What are peoples' thoughts/experiences on this? Do you like to go into a work with fresh eyes, or do you want some form given to your expectations beforehand?

EDIT: I suppose I should add my own counterexample, since I have it. I watched "Divergent" after hearing something like "It's not which traits you /have/ that determine your house, it's which traits you /value/". I think this improved my enjoyment of the film by quite a bit.

Meanwhile, Pettigrew is a sink of vices: not ambitious, cunning, intelligent, studious, hard-working, or loyal, and he was simply bold enough (not brave either) to stab his friends in the back like that.

So ... I don't know. I think it helps to know that you're reading a tragedy while you're in the middle of it, because otherwise the ending might leave a bad taste in your mouth.

This allows it to scale from 2 players, all the way up to 6, without decreasing each player's playtime proportionally as in almost all other turn-based games. (Near the maximum number of players, you may need to reshuffle the discards, which is about the only scaling time penalty.) Larger numbers of players are slightly less fun in that it's much harder to keep track of what everyone is doing, so there is less potential for interaction, but that's true for basically all games.

The other things that I love about Race are that it's near-infinitely replayable (the game throws a huge amount of randomness at you, and gives you the tools to deal with that randomness, so there's a vast number of choices you have to make in each game, almost all of them relevant; about the only irrelevant choices that ever come up are treating duplicate cards as money) and that there's a special rule for 2-player games. Even when games scale down to 2 players, they are often best with 3-4 for greater interaction, but Race's Advanced 2-player rules make it strongest, I think. They allow each player to perform 2 actions per turn, so you get to focus on the actions of your opponent and have more options to respond (since the number of combinations of 2 actions is greater).

Also, Race has a small box, which I dearly love. (Many games follow a trend of having large boxes even when the game pieces don't occupy nearly all of that space.) Sleeved, I can fit the first arc into Race's core box, and AA into the expansion box. It's very portable.

One of my fondest Race memories is when a couple of friends were talking about the game of AA we just played, and they agreed that Military strategies were basically dominant in AA; I disagreed, and proceeded to beat them with a Produce/Consume strategy in our very next game.

I /want/ to like Eclipse, but despite multiple games I haven't been able to get into it. I haven't been able to see how to get any good at it. Usually when I'm terrible at a game, that motivates me to play it more, as long as I can see how to get better. Maybe it's just because I always play with a friend who is absolutely bonkers insane good at Eclipse (now I know what it feels like to play against That Guy).

For deckbuilders, Dominion's core set left a bad impression on me (I thought there wasn't a rich set of diverse strategies), but I played once with expansions and liked them, so I should probably acquire them. The deckbuilder I play is Ascension, which has had many new sets. Notably, its iOS implementation is astoundingly good (best of all boardgame implementations I've seen; Carcassonne and Waterdeep are close). In addition to a high level of polish, Ascension iOS moves /fast/ when you crank up the animation speed to maximum. I wish all computerized board games would follow the same philosophy: provide an option to reduce animation times for experienced players.

***** One of my prouder gamer accomplishments is that I was involved with the demo game that 'pitched' /Race for the Galaxy/ to the eventual publisher (Jay Tummelson). I desperately wanted that game published. Still play it, waiting for the Xeno expansion.

My favorite recent games (and one sentence pitches) are

*Eclipse* -- Managable Space Opera

*Mage Knight* -- Start as a demi-god, conquer a land in 3 days. (Great solitaire, too!)

*Sentinels of the Multiverse* -- Co-op superheroes dripping with theme

*Coup* -- Bluffing game reminiscent of the old Eon game Hoax (but it works).

*Pandante* -- Poker + Coup: Your hole card's suits grant special powers. (Can be played for money or as a game)

*Baseball Highlights: 2045* -- A full game of BB in 6 cards. Manage a season in 60-90 min. I played a 28 player tournament of this (using 7 sets) and it was a blast. (Obviously that took longer).

*Quartermaster General* -- Brilliant WWII game in an hour (6 players). Each player has 8-12 pieces and a deck of cards.

*Too Many Cinderellas* -- Inspired Minimalistic Game from Japan. Remind the Hungover Prince who he met at the ball. (This one is literally 18 cards and 9 chits).

*Machi Koro* -- Settlers w/o the board (the expansion adds a dominion like element). (Good with children, but not to young).

***** I think the reason you don't like Eclipse as much is that you place a high priority on strategy / game theory and winning the game: your RftG story is about disproving your friends' assertions on dominant strategy; your concern about Eclipse is that you don't do as well as you think you should, especially in relation to your friend; you wish Dominion base set had a wider range of strategies.

Part of the draw of Eclipse is that it is manageable space opera. It's not a monster like Twilight Imperium that will take the whole day and exhaust everyone by the end. In Eclipse, you get the narrative space aliens expanding, meeting, and inevitably coming to blows. There are laughs and groans as someone takes the technology that someone else really needed. There's the multiplayer diplomacy of convincing people that someone else is in the lead. Someone tears their hair out because their missiles all whiffed and now they're staring down a lot of plasma cannons. Or someone buys wormhole generators and now my border has gone from chokepoint to exposed flank.

I don't care if I win Eclipse. In fact, I don't care if I win any game against my friends as long as my friends and I are having fun. I think that's the reason I like Eclipse more than you.

I like different games for different reasons. Some games make me feel smart (even if I'm not doing anything particularly clever). Some games are just instant fun with your friends.

So I wish people were more specific than "what's your favorite game?" They could be asking, "What game might I not have heard of that I should check out?"

*** Many Christians write off the Old Testament as a matter of their theology. Basically, when Christ came along, he changed all of the rules and Judaism was superseded by the Christian church with the New Covenant. So when they say that the Old Testament doesn't matter ... they're talking about one of the core assumptions of Christianity. The Old Testament /doesn't/ matter. Christ was essentially a reformer, not to mention the son of God, and he fixed everything that was wrong with the Old Testament. The Old Testament is still important, since it documents a lot of good lessons, but /the rules it set out no longer apply/.

Nah, the New Testament has three or four passages indicating that homosexuality is sinful, and one even says that they won't inherit the kingdom of God. It's a bit less ambiguous about it than the Old Testament.

Essentially if you start from that premise, and see it the same as if you straight up murdered another adult, then doesn't matter if you have a different opinion, that can't be allowed and it's their duty to stand up to it.

Not saying all people think like this, but I know that at least my friends understand the "pro-choice" viewpoint, they just think it's irrelevant.

I think the loves can mostly be reduced to chemicals in the brain; they are (non-permanent) neurological conditions.

**** I probably do need to probably put up a 'synopsis' page which tells about stuff, problem with original fiction is that you can't just build off the foundation of an established universe.

The story is, roughly, as such:

On a gas giant planet where continent sized chunks of stone are held aloft in electromagnetic equilibrium, human nations cling like insects to the back of the floating stone. How people came to this strange world has been lost to history following a devastating war many centuries past. As the civilisations of Aeria creep towards industrialisation and try to explore the world they find themselves in, old prejudices and conflicts begin to flare up. The Amat Empire, one of the largest nations of Aeria and home to the only mages in all the world, is sliding towards a war that might threaten to shake the world apart.

That's my rough "for this post on reddit" synopsis, I'll edit and clean that up before I make a page for it on the site, but I will get to that as well as updating the index page.

In terms of rational(ist) themes, I strive very hard to make sure no characters are holding the idiot ball. Aeria is a fantasy steampunk world, so I don't want to name names or explicitly reference real world studies. This makes it a bit less obvious, but the characters all still try to behave in a manner that makes sense to them, no one does anything for the plot, and I do sneak in some rationalist thinking methods when I can.

** Opinions on the Cecil the lion issue?

(Prepares for downvotes)\\
Personally I think it's grossly wrong to destroy a man's life because he killed an animal. No matter how special the animal was or how endangered the species is. Lion hunting was allowed, he did pay money for it. (legally or otherwise)

Does it really make a difference if the lion was 'allowed' to be hunted or it happened to be the country's top attraction?

Keyboard warriors have now ruined his life over no grounds. This is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Tripathi][Boston Marathon]] thing all over again.

Palmer lives in Minnesota (same as me) so this has been getting a bit more conversation here, and while I can agree that a man's life probably shouldn't be destroyed so casually, he really should have been smart enough to see the potential consequences. Suffering the consequences that he had to have known were a possibility is ... well, he's the one who rolled those particular dice.

And in this case, there's not really much question. This /isn't/ a witch hunt, because that implies we're looking for a phantom, or picking people out with no clue whether they're the guilty party.

*** I firmly disagree with your stance on the issue, but I am also sympathetic for the Minnesotan hunter. Maybe he's a dick, but he's not morally at fault for what happened, as far as I know. Cecil's death was awful, for several reasons: he was private property of humans who wanted to keep him alive, he had sentimental value for them, the hunters should have known better, etc. But the hunter being torn apart over this on social media is not responsible for it. He was essentially a tourist with a gun. He had gone on similar hunts many times before, legally and to no harm. I am inclined to believe his statement that he had no way of knowing the crew he hired this time were shoddy and unethical. They are the ones at fault here; they were the experts and they were competent enough to know how to do their jobs properly.

I fear, for instance, that future humans may undertake terraforming, directed panspermia, or sentient simulations without giving much thought to the consequences for wild animals.

****** I don't really care about animal suffering.

That is, I acknowledge that animals have some capacity for suffering, given that some of them are sentient (if not sapient). And all else being equal, I would want to reduce suffering.

But with that said, it's low on the optimization totem pole for me. I eat meat. I mostly eat free-range, cruelty-free meat, but I /do/ eat meat, and my choice of which meat to eat is far more about feeling good about myself (or just improved meat quality) than it is about reduction of suffering.

So I don't care about the suffering of animals I have no connection to. Even among those animals that I /do/ have some connection to, I don't care about the suffering of all of them, only the ones that I like. (There's a deer that comes and eats stuff out of our garden. There are birds that wake me up in the morning. There's a white cat that harasses our cat. There are mice that my cat brings in, sometimes still alive. None of these animals do I care for.)

So without that emotional connection towards all animals, all I'm left with are strictly logical arguments in favor of caring about them in some sense other than their utility towards humans (whether that's research, aesthetics, their role in the biome, meat, companionship, etc.). The problem is that none of the strictly logical non-utility arguments in favor of animals really compel me, in part because of the lack of wide-scale emotion.

I don't think this is an ethically satisfying answer, which is why I'm hesitant to give it. And it's a conversation I've had with my grandfather-in-law (an ethical vegan) a few too many times.

The sole economical value seems to be in ... what, the ego boost of killing a lion? The entertainment of the hunt? The trophy of having its head on the wall (which requires a bribe to customs)? And the lion itself had /far/ more economical value than what was paid for the hunting trip, both in the form of scientific research and tourism.

And this is often the case when people talk about the environment; it's privatized profit and socialized losses. A factory pollutes the air, lowering the quality of life in everyone who has to breathe in the smog. Farmers dump pesticides and fertilizers into the rivers, meaning that we can't eat the fish there anymore.

This is /most/ of what people get upset about. There are going to be people like PETA who think that pet ownership is tantamount to slavery (or alternately, PETA wants attention/money and that's how they get it). But most environmentally conscious people (and I say this as someone who has met hundreds and hundreds of environmentally conscious people) just care about there being some balance between the private profits and social losses. Most of them (including myself) would argue that we're currently /way/ too far on the private profit side of things, even after a fair amount of successful action over the past few decades.

The second balance is between short-term and long-term. Short-term, it makes sense to fish the oceans clean until there are no more fish left. Long-term, /that's idiotic/.

**** A couple of reasons:

- The lion had a name and had already been humanized to some extent. It was a known quantity to a variety of people who cared about that sort of thing, and there were a ton of pictures taken of it which were ready to go for both media and social media purposes. If this had been some random lion, the headline would be "Lion poached" which isn't a story. "Cecil the Lion Killed" /is/ a story, especially with accompanying details (all of which exist thanks to the fact that the lion was a research subject). All that information gives the story meat.
- The hunter was found out. "Minnesota Dentist Kills Cecil the Lion" is an /even better/ story than "Cecil the Lion Killed", because it compels us to learn more about both lion and hunter. Once we've learned about them, we're more compelled to share, which in the digital age makes the story spread like wildfire.
- We exist in a time of wealth inequality and some general dissatisfaction. The average person sees a rich guy spending their yearly salary to go shoot a defenseless lion in Africa and gets /pissed/, not just because that (humanized) lion was killed, but because of the waste of money. Hunting big game is already typical rich guy shit anyway, the kind of thing where you think ... alright, you spent /that much money/ that basically did nothing but destroy value in order to stroke your ego. This feeds into the general sense that rich people are basically pricks who don't give a shit about the world; it confirms biases.

So really, the story has all the elements necessary for outrage culture to get spun up and working in full force. There are enough twists and turns that the story has some meat, which is good for more cycles than it would otherwise be. There's also not that much consumable news going on right now; the media (and social media) works on a constant content-delivery schedule, so they need /something/.

Like you said you're not a heat guy, but if we are assuming climate change is man made, over other factors, what are the other factors what are their magnitude, is there damping in the system. Kind of basic questions when you step back and try to look at the big picture. There's lots of mixing problems and stratification that make it a dedicated field of study but I'm looking to see questioning criticisms I remember from my youth have been anwsered. That all the experts in the industry of climate change agree on climate change /shrugs/ political spiders.

I don't think I have to justify asking questions or consider myself silly for wanting to see the data when all the experts in the industry agree on the industry. My experience mostly is there as background for understanding how to apply a statistical model and a good basis in basic physics, which is really all you need other than time and interest to swat up enough information to ask interesting questions. I think we disagree on that, or you are assuming because I proffered some academic credentials that I assumed they were directly applicable, maybe I should have bothered to explain it'll be a good challenge and a fun thing to stretch my brain around /shrug/

That said I respect your taste in authors.

Good day.

When I said "cuteness = waifuness", I was trying to put the concept in terms likely to be understood immediately by a frequenter of an imageboard. Pre-timeskip Hyuuga Hinata is more or less the archetype of "cuteness" in this context, for a better mental image. "Cuteness" and "hotness" are rather mutually exclusive.

cuteness is mostly a personality property, while hotness is mostly a property of looks. technically hotness\attractiveness could be effected by personality but they don't imply anything specific. so the only way i could see the two properties as mutually exclusive is if its based on your personal taste, by which cuteness is a turnoff.

#+end_quote

They aren't /completely/ mutually exclusive--post-timeskip Hinata is, say, 4/5 on cuteness and 3/5 on hotness. However, pre-timeskip Hinata is solidly 5/5 on cuteness and (being rather young) 1/5 on hotness, which is why she's the archetype of cuteness only in her younger form. The point is that post-timeskip Hinata's hotness and cuteness /detract/ from each other: I'd be reluctant to impose myself on an innocent-looking person, and I'd likewise be reluctant to consider an attractive, strong-willed person to be needing protection.

#+begin_quote
  cuteness is mostly a personality property, while hotness is mostly a property of looks.
#+end_quote

I'm considering /both/ the mind /and/ the body to be components, here. Pre-timeskip Hinata is cute (innocent, requiring protection, etc.) /both/ because she's young and round-faced /and/ because she's timid.

I don't think she really became any more strong willed, just more of an adult. And that too only actually made it so when she thought it was basically the end of the world she managed to confess to naruto. other than that i don't think her personality really changed that much.

well, i could see how you would claim the ideal form of cuteness and the ideal form of hotness cannot be held in parallel, but that is not quite what i would call mutually exclusive :P

And that still seems to based on personal taste and what you consider to be cute\hot, as i don't think the properties you mentioned are the only accepted form by which something could be cute..

anyhow now that you clarified that you didn't -really- mean that the properties are mutually exclusive i think the situation is clearer to me..

** I went to GenCon this weekend, which had greatly accelerated my excitement for the board game that me and my friends are designing and making. Based on the categories I've seen at gencon, it's a tile laying resource management game, and is space themed.

We've got one prototype of the game that I laser cut from wood, which we managed to get a couple of people to playtest here, and who actually liked it and wanted to keep playing, which is an awesome feeling.

If anyone here is interested, we're hoping to have an initial print and play (though as advance warning, it's a hex based tile laying game, so print and play will involve a semi-decent time effort for cutting) available within the next week or two, and any feedback is highly appreciated, especially with any broken game mechanics that we've missed (like the infinite resources trick that one of our testers last night found)

** I believe the following is attributed to Blaise Pascal:

God either does or does not exist. Let's say we can either believe in him or not. Case Y: we believe in him. If God exists, then yay!, eternal paradise. If he doesn't exist, we lost some Sunday mornings or something. Case N: we don't believe in God. If God does exist, then an eternity of pain and suffering. If he doesn't exist, then nothing happens I guess.

The difference in utility function of maybe eternal paradise versus maybe eternal torment is so great that it's better to believe in God than not.

Response 1: Seriously, the reason you're going to believe in some supernatural divine being is this mercenary calculation? You're hedging your bets in case God exists? Won't he think that's a bit disingenuous?

Rebuttal 1: Note that careful wording of the last paragraph. The argument isn't that you should believe in God because of some calculation, but that a person who does believe will be better off than someone who does not. You can find a separate reason to believe. After all, humans believe in all sorts of stuff. To quote Terry Pratchett:

#+begin_quote
  HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.

  "Tooth fairies? Hogfathers? Little---"

  AS PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE LITTLE LIES.

  "So we can believe the big ones?"

  YES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.

  "They're not the same at all!"

  YOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET---Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.

  "Yes, but people have got to believe that, or what's the point---"

  MY POINT EXACTLY.”
#+end_quote

Response 2: There are more than two possibilities. Maybe the Christian God does exist. Maybe he does exist but humans have really garbled the translation. Maybe he doesn't exist but some other diety you should be worshipping does, and he'll get really mad at you for following a false god. Maybe multiple dieties aren't mutually exclusive.

Rebuttal 2: The cost-benefit analysis still points to following the subset of religions that maximizes probability of heaven (or equivalent) minus probability of hell (or equivalent).

#+begin_quote
  ^{4} I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north---an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, ^{5} and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, ^{6} but each of them had four faces and four wings. ^{7} Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. ^{8} Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, ^{9} and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.

  ^{10} Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. ^{11} Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. ^{12} Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. ^{13} The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. ^{14} The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.

  ^{15} As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. ^{16} This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. ^{17} As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. ^{18} Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.

  ^{19} When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. ^{20} Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. ^{21} When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

  ^{22} Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. ^{23} Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. ^{24} When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,^{[b]} like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.

  ^{25} Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. ^{26} Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. ^{27} I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. ^{28} Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.

  This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
