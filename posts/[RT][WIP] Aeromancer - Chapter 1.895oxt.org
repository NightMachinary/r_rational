** One comment I wanted to add - having the main character's last name be "Tutt", unless it's supposed to be a direct reference, threw me off a bit, since that's the last name of the MC in The Good Student.

*** Ah no, that was not intentional. My naming convention comes from two different pharaohs (Seti and King Tutt), as my original name for the story was going to be The Chronicles of Pharaoh, but my friend said it made her think of an Egyptian story so I scratched that and went with Aeromancer instead.

*** I object to this on the grounds that suddenly waking up blind would seem unlikely, so if I woke up and couldn't see anything I /would/ likely think I was in the dark for a few moments.\\
If the room I was sleeping in was really dark to begin with then I might think I was blind for a fair bit longer.

*** Thanks for the comment! Though picture this as a rebuttal: someone goes to the hotel for a day and they wake up in the middle of the night. Their first impression is that they are at home, rather than a place they are only spending the night.

In the same way, I view that groggy moment of wake-stasis to be something where the character isn't as focused as us readers.

** A promising premise, and an overall well-written chapter. So far, so alright, but nothing that would knock me off my feet yet.

That said, I remember my feelings on the initial chapters of Mother of Learning were similar. So I'm eager to see where this goes.

** I didn't really like this chapter. Trying to figure out why...

I'd say the chapter lack a proper structure on most levels. The chapter has an okay high level structure (protagonist introduces the world, meets the counselor, talks to the bully guy, gets the "Got your eyesight!" Call To Adventure), but each scene and dialogue is unstructured.

Ideally, each scene should have a setup -> build-up -> payoff curve on a fractal level (as in, a curve for the scene, and inside of the scene a curve for each exchange, and inside of each exchange a curve for each line of dialogue). But the scenes are all setup and no payoff.

The scene with the counselor sets up that the protagonist is special somehow, but doesn't pay off by explaining how (it says "the bully is afraid of you", but that's not satisfying, it shouldn't stop there). Same thing with the scene with the bully: the protagonist leaves with as much information as he started with. I'm not sure if the dream scene fits into my explanation, but I'd say it lacks build-up and structure: the sequence is just "confusion, confusion, confusion, HEY NOW YOU HAVE NO EYES".

Overall the chapter is really confused; I'd say you are trying to fit too many concepts at the same time without developing them, because you're trying too hard to subvert every possible expectation. For instance, the "what is a billion seconds" exchange feels like it's just trying to make you expect the "slacker protagonist turns out to be genius at math" trope and immediately go "nope, gotcha!", and the exchange has no point beyond that.

(keep in mind that I'm no wildbow, this is me doing very amateur literary critique; if someone with more experience writing/critiquing comes by, feel free to correct me)

*** Thanks for the critique and for typing up your thoughts! I'll ponder on the conversational payoffs that you mentioned, as I've never heard of that before now.

I would like to address the math part, as I don't think it was building up to a math genius trope, but rather relayed that the counselor believed that numbers shouldn't be the absolute gauge for a power (where it was established that the MC was left wanting in that department).

** Interesting first chapter. Does he have emotion affecting wind? It's something he wouldn't notice on himself, and if he doesn't notice it he wouldn't control the effect, but anyone else hit by it would presumably be much better sutied to see the effect. And if other people knew, Aiden would be more wary of the guy who casually throws out emotion affecting abilities.

** At the very least in its current state I don't see why this would be posted on rationalist fiction. As far as we can tell, the counselor is irrational. Either he has a good reason to recommend to main character or he doesn't, but if he does, keeping everything a secret seems pretty bizarre. The dream event is a completely random incident that falls outside of the world that has been described. There are no significant indications that anybody in this is a rational actor so far. Maybe once there is more meat to it this will become a great rationalist fiction, but at present I don't see how it could possibly qualify. With that said, it seemed reasonably well written if not arbitrary.

** Interesting! I look forwards to future updates.

I think my main critique would be that I feel like I lack reason to care about/be interested in the protagonist. The counsellor scene felt like it was setting up some interesting/impressive quality of Seti, but it cut off too early, implying the existence of some interesting quality but not actually talking about it. And in the rest of the chapter, Seti seems fairly unimpressive and a bit of a dick. This feels like a bit of a showing vs telling issue, we've been told that Seti has something interesting about him, but not been shown enough evidence of this that it feels compelling.

** I was captivated by the counsellor scene.

Could you consider starting with the office door opening, asking for Tutt, Seti? The stuff before that doesn't add much, that we wouldn't learn in the dialog. Because honestly, I wanted to quit after the first sentence. And that would be a shame.

Maybe add a sentence how he is waiting nervously/annoyed on a chair in front.

Also, I guess he makes CO or a similar gas.

**** immunity to his own magic? i doubt a pyromancer would get burned by a candle.

but honestly i skipped stuff in the beginning, because it was boring, so didn`t read that.

maybe just lack of oxygen... or as a level one he produces only air with low concentration of whatever and a little higher concentration if he wants to annoy someone.
