My favourite is arcanine the 6200miles in a single day and night To me that translates to 6200miles in 24 hours roughly that's about 416 miles per hour! Or aprox 670km/h! For a period of 24 hrs straight!


** The only explanation that makes sense to me is that Pokedex entries are all written by 12 year olds with more enthusiasm than scientific accuracy.

** Personal favourite is Entei, with "when it roars, a volcano erupts" combined with "one is born every time a new volcano appears" leading to exponential growth in Entei population, as well as totally contradicting the game's lore.

Also, Slurpuff's "Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human's" really does make it look like some kid is just slapping giant numbers on these without thinking.

*** No the roar could erupt an already existing volcano rather than a new one!

*** Causation is backwards. Entei mate and bear children in the vicinity of active volcanos due to the minerals released by volcanic eruption being necessary for ordinary entei development. That is to say, volcanos cause entei, not the other way around.

*** And definitely also check out the Pokemon Battle Royale series by TerminalMontage and the accompanying explanation videos by Lockstin & Gnoggin. Those use a bunch of stuff from the pokedex as well.

** There's some calculation out there that uses the fact that lanturn light is visible from the surface as little pricks of starlight to show that it's releasing more energy than the entire universe or some shit.

Also there's this fic that's more like an alternative version of it, though in the summary it says 'expanded': [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6161819/1/Pokedex]]

** My favorite goes to Alakazam which is said to have an IQ of over 5000. I can't help but imagine that there must be secret cities managed and by cabals of alakazams who have decided that humans thinking that they are in charge are the best way to use them.

** If Alakazam was really so smart, they should be used to improve society. Any rational characters who don't have a plan of "1) get alakazam, 2) make it do all your plans" kinda fail. ;) They can also see the future, which should also be used productively.
