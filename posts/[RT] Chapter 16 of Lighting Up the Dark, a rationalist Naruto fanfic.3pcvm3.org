** I am reminded of an episode of Merlin where Arthur "passes a test" by showing that he is willing to sacrifice himself by choosing to take both cups (one of which is poisoned) in order to save Merlin.

My reaction to this was "wait a minute, Arthur is a potential king, and is extremely valuable to the country. Merlin is at this point a nobody. I could just as easily argue that Arthur is making the /wrong/ decision by deciding to die honorably rather than sacrifice his honor to benefit his country (by not killing off a king).

If Naruto is exceptional, he could legitimately claim that he'd be better off saving himself rather than saving multiple bystanders. And he has every reason to believe that he is exceptional; he knows he's very intelligent and he has the fox inside him.

(Of course, deciding to save himself instead of other people is very prone to motivated reasoning, but it's not inherently motivated reasoning under all circumstances to believe that you are more valuable to the village than other people.)

Naruto could also reason that sacrificing himself is harmful to his team and that since he is supposed to be especially devoted to his team, he should save himself. In fact, if the loss of efficiency from making his team get another member up to speed is large enough to statistically cause the team to fail to save enough people, it may be a better idea, period.

(Also, you'd think Naruto would figure out that this is a genjutsu, even though it's harder for him to figure it out than for us. Since sacrificing himself to take out the threat would prove that he has the traits that ninjas would obviously test for, having it turn up at just the right time is unlikely if real but likely in a simulation. So he's in a simulation. I am reminded of a sci-fi story where a character is given a lecture about how unlikely it is for a meteor to hit the spaceship, but what to do if it happens. All of a sudden it's announced that a meteor has hit the ship. He stays in his seat on the grounds that if having a meteor hit the ship is unlikely, having it hit the ship right when they would test people's knowledge of meteors is doubly unlikely.)

*** Ooh, detailed analysis.

In regard to the decision, I think there's an identity component as well as a utilitarian component. I think a lot of people, while preferring survival over dying, would also have a strong aversion to the idea of living the rest of their lives with a self-identification as someone who sacrifices lots of innocents in order to preserve their own life.

I see Naruto thinking "I am superior to these people in both moral and practical terms", but I don't see him thinking "I should let dozens of people die because my life is worth more than theirs", even if it's an objectively correct decision.

As for the genjutsu element, bear in mind that he doesn't know in advance that self-sacrifice will actually be necessary. He is bad both at losing and at modelling the possibility of loss against an unknown opponent. And in the moment where he is forced to decide between self-sacrifice and survival, he is in no position to analyse the situation on that abstract a level.

If anything, perhaps he should have seen through the genjutsu out of genre savviness, but that's a superpower that kicks in only erratically.

Yet in standard Naruto, Itachi killed his whole clan on Konoha orders. Being a killer of your own clan has got to be at least as damaging for your self-identification, and it was still expected of him.

True, but while that makes Naruto's decision /a/ right decision (since it's the best that can be expected from him given the circumstances), it doesn't make that decision the /only right one/. Does the grading guide for the test say "oh, also pass anyone who refuses to sacrifice themselves but gives a rational reason why that refusal helps the village"? I guess that's possible, since we haven't seen the grading process yet, but that would make this fanfic very unusual compared to pretty much every piece of media that contains such a test.

Although it would be interesting to see someone refuse to sacrifice themselves, based on rationality, and fail the test simply because they are smarter than the test writer, something that happens to children in real life too. Incidentally, this also shows the folly of having a test that you can fail based on a single question; that's pretty much always a bad idea because someone's performance on that test can be affected by unpredictable factors.

(Then we could have Naruto thinking that having to sacrifice himself is not a test because if it was a test, it's obviously a poorly designed one....)

I wouldn't consider Itachi representative of anything, since he is a prodigy in every conceivable way including ability, duty and ethics (his one weak point being the truly idiotic way he handled leaving Sasuke). Likewise, IIRC the orders were mostly Danzō's work, and there's no reason to believe that Danzō cared what would become of Itachi long-term.

I think this is most likely what would happen. As in a regular army, I imagine that a low-rank soldier acting against orders because they thought they knew better would be condemned even if they were right.

I suppose that in a /smart/ army, they would be punished, and then quietly promoted at a later date.

If the test consisted of a superior saying "sacrifice yourself", refusing to do so would be disobeying orders. But if the test consists of "sacrifice yourself when the circumstances are right" and the test writer mistakenly believed that the circumstances were right, but you know otherwise, refusing to sacrifice yourself would be /following/ orders, not disobeying them.

If your superior tells you "shoot the guy in the front", because he has bad vision and mistakes a tree for a soldier, shooting the actual front guy is not disobeying orders.

Your superior may well know a lot that you don't, such as the fact that the tree really /is/ an enemy soldier, and they may want you to obey orders and attack before the enemy realises you've seen through their Transformation Technique.

******** I think that's fighting the hypothetical. Assume that the superior just told the soldier that order and didn't give him any more information, not even nonverbal information such as pointing.

The key idea is that the order /inherently/ contains a demand for observation and interpretation. Not only is it not disobeying orders, it isn't second-guessing your superior either. You're not thinking "my superior asked for X, but if he had known what I had known he wouldn't have asked for X" . You're doing exactly what was asked of you.

And the test is supposed to test that the ninjas will sacrifice themselves when appropriate. The test writers are not telling them what situations are appropriate; it's something they require the test takers to figure out for themselves. A test-taker who correctly figures out that sacrifice is not appropriate therefore has passed the test. It's stupid to pass someone who sacrifices himself when inappropriate and fail someone who only sacrifices himself when appropriate.

(If a ninja is told to deliver 2+2 shurikens, and the person asking believes that 2+2=5, but doesn't indicate that belief in any way, is the ninja second-guessng his superior if he only delivers 4?)

***** There are a couple of problems with this perspective. First, the ninja of any given country are its most powerful military force, and can assassinate any civilian leader as easy as breathing. It would be much easier for them to function as a military dictatorship that controls the entire country and its resources, with the same bureaucratic toolset as the one currently used by the Daimyo.

Second, if the military exists to exploit the civilian population, they are terribly inefficient about it. They obtain money from "ninja missions" and the civilian government rather than direct taxation. They limit their resource and recruitment pool to the contents of their one village. They rely on independent civilian traders to ensure that the village has the non-military resources they want, including any luxuries they may wish to enjoy during their time off. They submit to oversight from an authority that isn't competent in their area of activity (see Sand having to revise their entire recruitment and training policy after the Wind Country Daimyo cuts their budget). They do not benefit from any greater rights than the civilian populace, not even shopping discounts. And so on.

Why would this be easier than letting some civilian handle all of that bureaucratic mess for them? As long as the Daimyo /knows/ that they will be assassinated if they mess up, everything works out perfectly for the ninja. They get paid just for existing! Oh sure, gennin have to do worthless missions for PR purposes/to build character, but they're only gennin.

Of course this breaks down for the Wind Daimyo, who indeed would have been assassinated instantly... unless, of course, he's powerful in his own right. This is a rationalist fiction. Why are you assuming that the ability to perform landscape redecoration makes you more powerful than the most capable politician in your entire country? You can fix this by saying that the Daimyo has his own personal ninja army that is loyal to him and him alone, which is not too far from canon given the existence of the Land of Fire's 12 ninja daimyo bodyguard (who even tried to stage a coup against the Hokage if I recall)

No, the /real/ problem with Naruto canon is the fact that a few individuals have the power to destroy entire armies. There isn't even any point in having armies if that is the case. But if you even things out a little, everything else can be made to work.

#+end_quote

Two reasons. First, the Daimyo have different priorities. They may choose policies that indirectly go against the interests of the ninja (say, heavy investment in vocational training that ends up reducing the number of potential new ninja). And attempting to enforce fine-grained policy control just with the threat of assassination is inconvenient to say the least.

Second, the Daimyo may not be competent. We know the Wind Country one isn't, and frankly none of the others strike me as cunning, resourceful leaders either (the Fire one just makes me think of a placid turkey).

With direct control over the government, ninja can choose to appoint competent proxies who serve their needs without the need for threats.

There's also the "full resources" thing. As it stands, ninja get what the Daimyo gives them, plus what they earn from missions or obtain through their own activities. A military dictatorship would be in control of the country's full resources and able to reallocate them however it wishes.

#+begin_quote
  Why are you assuming that the ability to perform landscape redecoration makes you more powerful than the most capable politician in your entire country?
#+end_quote

Again, it's a big assumption that the Daimyo must be "the most capable". Rationalist fiction does not preclude things like hereditary rulership in a medieval society. If it did, you'd end up having to redesign human civilisation from the ground up to remove all the daft bits.

Even if he were, capability only goes so far. The Daimyo has no leverage over a group capable of landscape redecoration - he has nothing they cannot take, he has no allies that can threaten them, and if he uses his position to deny them legitimacy, they will simply turn around and remove him in a formal coup.

The only option that springs to mind is a large, powerful standing army loyal to the Daimyo alone. But even that won't work in a realistic setting. The ninja are naturals at spying, assassination and guerrilla warfare, and they operate from within a vast forest with a base hidden enough to avoid detection from /other ninja/. They can outmanoeuvre any conventional army, and cause it to disintegrate by eliminating the chain of command.

Edit: hm, some more text just appeared in your comment.

This, of course, runs into its own problems. For example, where does he recruit his elite ninja bodyguard? Is it from the village he needs protection from? Or worse, from another country's ninja village? Are they trained outside any village, and if so, how can they hope to stand up to professionals with generations of expertise behind them?

It's not optimal, sure, but neither is having to do it all yourself. If you had to choose between becoming the dictator of a country yourself, or being paid to lead the military, which would you prefer? I think the latter would be a nicer job, myself. It makes sense if you think of the Daimyo as a figurehead, and given the fact that Danzo at least mind-controlls the Daimyo with Koto-amatsukami, that's not an unfair assumption.

Yes, the wind daimyo and people being incompetent is a valid counter argument. But in a rationalist fic there's nothing stopping you from just boosting people's rationality until this is no longer a problem.

I feel like you're arguing this by looking at the Naruto world and pointing out all the things that are nonsensical, while forgetting that you can do the exact same thing with the real world. In the US, congress is run by incredibly insane/incompetent people with an approval rating of approximately 2 (two people, that is), and yet they maintain power over the military despite not having any military ability themselves. Any ninja from the Naruto world would find that completely unbelievable if they read about it in a story. They would throw away the book in disgust and mock the author for writing something so patently unrealistic.

********* I think one or both of us are losing track of what we're disagreeing about here. My original point, vis-a-vis AugSphere, was that the Leaf military was a real military, because if it were a "bunch of murder-hobos" or a de facto dictatorship, it would be a very poor one. Are we still arguing about whether the Leaf military is plausibly a self-serving organisation that exerts indirect control over the government to its selfish benefit, or is it something else?

This is the point that makes me think we're talking at cross-purposes. I've been giving examples why, based on Narutoverse canon, it is implausible that the ninja are completely self-serving and yet do not choose to assert direct control over the Fire Country government, and thus why we have to assume that Leaf is in fact a loyal military. It's not an exercise in pointing out the nonsensical elements of the Narutoverse for its own sake, but rather of elements that become nonsensical under the conditions of a certain hypothesis being true.

In regard to the Congress example, well, yes, there are nonsensical things aplenty in the real world. But we can't merely say "there is nonsense in the real world, therefore we should be free to accept a hypothesis that results in nonsense in the Narutoverse".

The Leaf in canon is for a great deal self-centered and self-serving, with a good deal of corruption (danzo etc.) and with the Daimyo being portrayed as weak and mostly inconsequential. The ninja villagers literally never act on behalf of civilians unless they're being paid to do it, so I can't call them a military. On the other hand, the Leaf is also portrayed as mostly idealistic and wanting to protect civilians (much like they would want to protect children), but this is much less the case for other countries.

********* Tech levels. I have a whole screed about this in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/17/Team-Anko][chapter 17]] of Team Anko, but I'll cut and paste the most relevant bits here:

--------------

The tech level in the Naruto-verse is bizarre, and it's a big enough mess that I figure I better explain what I'm doing to make it make sense.

If you [...[[http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/8327][click this link]]...] you'll see part of an interview with Kishimoto (the creator of Naruto) where he states that /"Actually, the world of Naruto doesn't differ very much from our present time. TV, refrigerators and air conditioners exist in the world. The only exceptions are weapons and explosives, which I've decided to set in a much earlier era. That's why you don't see firearms."/

Among the things we do see are: TVs, VCRs, wireless headset radios, references to cell phones, computers, and satellite dishes. And yet, no firearms or non-chakra explosives.

This is baloney. Technology doesn't work like that; you can't drop out part of virtually every scientific field, wave your hands around, and say "well, no one thought of it." Even if you could, it wouldn't work: if you have satellites (for the satellite dishes) then you must have rockets. Rockets are effectively giant bombs that go off slowly, so if you have rockets then you have explosives. Even if you never got into space development and so you never came up with rocket fuel, if you understand science enough to build things like batteries for cell phones then you understand it enough to make high explosives.

In a world where ninja are a thing and go around intimidating and assassinating people, civilians are going to look for an equalizer, and if explosives are a thing then non-ninja are going to weaponize them for their own protection, so guns and explosives will exist. If guns and explosives exist, ninja would carry them---sure, jutsu and explosive tags let them do the same jobs without the equipment, but (a) there don't seem to be any jutsu with the same kind of range that a sniper rifle gives you, (b) guns don't require you to burn your own chakra, and (c) a chakra sensor ninja or those with various bloodlines can spot an explosive tag by its chakra signature. Landmines and IEDs have no chakra signature. Since sealing scrolls are a thing, there's no reason each ninja wouldn't be carrying an entire platoon's worth of heavy ordinance, just in case it was useful.

--------------

Then you run into issues with the economics. Start with the fact that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/19x2i5/basic_economics_in_the_narutoverse/][the currency doesn't make sense.]]

Move on to the issue of earnings. As far as I can tell, Konoha makes its living purely from the money from ninja missions. My understanding is the money gets paid from the customer to the Hokage's office and then a part of it is paid to the ninja in question -- basic taxation. All good, makes sense.

Here's the thing: you want to make money? There are better ways than getting a fraction of a percent of your population to get hired to kill people. Off the top of my head:

- Storage seals

These are little scrolls that work like portable holes. Put lots of stuff in them, it weighs no more the scroll itself. Ninja run ridiculously quickly -- I've seen estimates that some of the more powerful are traveling much faster than sound. How much money could you make just shipping goods around at high speed?

- Summoning

Ninja who have signed a summon contract can summon that kind of animal. (Toads, dogs, slugs, hawks...) You can choose the specific animal you want to summon (e.g. Gamabunta, Gamaichi, etc). If that animal isn't available, they can send another of their kind or a group in their place. Summons can carry gear. The animals can also [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Reverse_Summoning_Technique][summon their summoner]]. I can't find the reference right now, but my understanding is that when a summon is released it goes back to where it was.

Okay, great. We now have a teleportation system. Here's how:

1. Anko is in Konoha. She summons a snake (call him Bob) and leaves him there.
2. Anko goes to, e.g., the Fire Daimyo's court. She summons Bob, gives him a message, and unsummons him; he appears back in Konoha and gives the message to the Hokage. The Hokage wants to reply, so Bob summons Anko, gives her a message, and then she bamfs back to the Fire Daimyo's court.

This combines really well with the storage-seal cargo-transport mentioned above.

- Fuinjutsu traps

A storage seal can't store people, but a [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/F%C5%ABinjutsu_Trap][fuinjutsu trap]] can. Lovely! Now we can ship tons of people around using our summon-based messaging and cargo transport.

- Civilian missions

There are jutsu which, e.g., [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Water_Release:_Wild_Water_Wave][create hundres of gallons of water]] in few seconds, or [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Multiple_Earth-Style_Wall][create elaborate structures]]. These could probably be used for irrigation and construction as well as face-stabbing. How much does it cost to build a large office building or temple? Totally making up a number, let's call it 50 million ryo to pay for a crew of laborers for weeks or months. Suppose the Hokage said "Hey, for 5 million ryo we can have the outside of that up for you by tomorrow." A few million ryo is the price of an S-rank mission, which are incredibly dangerous and likely to kill some of those very expensive and hard-to-train ninja. Why do crazy hard missions when you could just build stuff?

Long story short: there's no reason Konoha should be making money from military missions. There is /way/ more money to be had in commerce.

This is all off the top of my head. Point is, nothing about the Naruto universe makes sense. Their economics are broken, their currency is broken, their politics are broken, their technology is broken, and so on and so on.

On technology: Ok, yes, you're right, Naruto tech makes no sense. But I can still defend it a little bit: In a world where ninjas exist, there's less demand for weapons amongst the powers-that-be. In the roman empire, they invented the steam engine but never used it because they already had slaves, and when the calculator was invented the initial reaction was that there's no point because people can do math in their heads anyway. To add to this, going from "no modern weapons" to "modern weapons that can kill ninja effectively" takes several steps, which means that every intermediate invention will be regarded as useless much more quickly. So while Naruto tech levels are silly, it's not /entirely/ baseless.

No, they are funded for a large part by the Daimyo, as evidenced by the Kazekage complaining about having his budget cut.

Yes, but only elite ninja can do those, and those might be more valuable if employed to kill other elite ninja. And heck, who's to say that this isn't being done regardless? The great ninja villages have 5k-10k ninja each, but we never see that many. So it could well be the case that at any point of time 80% are away on 'missions' to do precisely this, and the story focuses on the rest.

Almost everything can be explained in such a way as to make the Naruto universe mostly work. Ok, tech levels have to be tweaked, but it's mostly workable. But a single ninja like Madara being able to single-handedly defeat every ninja army in the world at the same time?

Destroys any ordinary setting you might come up with.

I can't agree with you here. Modern weapons are simply too useful outside of combat. Let's review:

- Explosives: clear a stump on your farm; cut through a ridge to build a road; logging; building demolition to clear the way for new construction
- Firearms: God's gift to hunting for all those rural types. Also, since the entire world seems to be full of bandits, merchants who can't afford / don't want to pay for ninja escorts will probably want to have some reasonable self-defense option. Also, the Daimyo might well fund it so that he can equip an army that has even a remote chance against ninja, just in case they ever try something.

Modern weaponry would develop for civilian purposes and later be adapted to combat against ninja.

This was exactly my point. Give ninja some storage scrolls, have them use those scrolls to transport cargo. Although, since you bring it up, is it ever shown what the limiting factor is on making storage scrolls? My impression is that it's the time of the maker -- the materials are relatively cheap and available. Is that wrong? If not, storage scrolls should be a major export, especially if they can produce them in various sizes and maybe come up with a variant that only works a certain number of times..

Even [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release:_Earth-Style_Rampart][Earth Style Rampart]] and [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release%3A_Earth-Style_Wall][Earth Style Wall]] are only B-rank.

Well, let's look at the historical evidence. How many thousands of years did China have gunpowder and rockets without turning them into guns? I'm not actually sure, but it was a really long time.

But if we say that ninja get enough money to get whatever supplies from the civilians they need, what benefit does more money get them? Money is only as valuable as the things you can buy with it. The most valuable thing in the Naruto world is military power.: A country of ninja that spends time irrigating would get instantly crushed by its neighbor that spent its time practicing combat techniques instead. (I'm assuming here that you can't just turn any civilians into ninja) Of course every individual ninja would benefit from selling its services purely to enrich themselves, but that's why all the succesfull countries punish leaving the village without permission by death.

Not really relevant. Ancient China was a bunch of uneducated farmers with rudimentary technology, whereas the Elemental Nations feature civilians with motorboats, refrigerators, and cell phones. That implies a really impressive level of mass education, technical sophistication, and mass production ability.

Militarily effective guns are easy to make if you have access to a machine shop and some decent explosive material for the propellant. The Elemental Nations definitely have access to the former. The only reason they don't have access to the latter is "because Kishimoto says so." As soon as you posit a rational EN, that excuse goes out the window. Suddenly there are explosives and therefore there are guns.

#+begin_quote
  Irrigation or swift construction of mud houses is not enough to get you out of a military race to the bottom.
#+end_quote

Point of order: although those are called 'Earth whatever', the pictures show that some of them are actually stone. Hardly mud houses.

Primary point: The real world has somehow been neither a military race to the bottom, nor a single mass war for all of history. In fact, many times it's been the countries that focused on civil and political development that out-bred the military ones. Look at Rome -- it's debatable exactly why they were so successful, but some candidate reasons are:

- Religiously and politically tolerant, so people and even nations frequently petitioned to join
- Science and technology development were rewarded
- Excellent road network, allowing for fast movement of trade and ideas. [1]
- Excellent health and hygiene, greatly reducing deaths to plague

They also had some kick-ass soldiers, but so did the Persians and various other nations. Despite all sides having strong military they were not all locked in constant war.

[1] The Roman roads were de iure military (built to allow rapid movement of soldiers) but de facto civilian as they were used far more often by civilians than soldiers.

I think that the comments in that thread cumulatively resolved that:

- A mission is normally carried out by a team of 4 so you need to divide by 4 to find out how much money the ninja actually gets from one.
- The village probably takes a big cut of the gross in taxes (rebuilding villages is really expensive)
- It is unlikely there are enough D rank missions for a ninja to be able to do a constant stream of them, and available statistics show /orders of magnitude/ fewer missions than 200 a year
- It is not true that low rank missions all take a day or less
- Even if 1 ryo = 10 yen or 10 cents, the value of 10 yen or 10 cents depends on cost of living and isn't constant (and Tokyo has one of the highest costs of living of anywhere, so thinking "what would 10 cents buy me in an average US state" would lead you to overestimate how rich ninjas are)

******* It gets worse when you realise that before the village era, clans apparently lived independently, and did not mix with ordinary people. So there's no historical precedent for them serving civilians either.

Here's one possibility: Hashirama wanted a village system to stop the clans fighting. The best way to stop the clans fighting is to give them a common goal, ideally a common goal that isn't a common enemy (since that just means you're fighting /different/ clans). Serving civilians is a common goal, and one which can absorb as much by way of resources and attention as you have to throw at it.

Perhaps the true purpose of the Kage is to preserve and further strengthen this tradition in order to maintain peace between the clans. Thus in Leaf you have Hashirama, who began the whole thing. Tobirama became Second Hokage pretty much by default, but shared Hashirama's goals. He then chose the (loosely speaking) pacifist Hiruzen over the warmonger Danzō. Hiruzen then chose the pacifist Minato. It may be argued that along with strength, dedication to the village ideal is the prime requirement according to which a Kage chooses their successor.

Of course, then this noble plan runs into human nature, plus the generations of feuding and hatred haven't gone anywhere, and you get three Great Ninja Wars. But if you look at it as a conscious choice of moral ideals over practicality, it might just be believable.

The first village (or a coalition of clans within a village) to permanently stop with the bullshit missions and dedicate all the resources to war preparations is going to out-compete everyone else. Then someone else will follow suit, lest they be annihilated, and so on.

The system is not stable in the least, and, given that we're talking about ninjas here, someone would have jumped down the slippery slope long ago. The threat of mutual annihilation in Elemental Nations is supposed to be realised by each village having a biju on hand. And yet that doesn't stop world wars from happening every generation.

The first village to stop with the bullshit missions and dedicate all resources to war preparations is going to be seen as both a heretic and a threat by all the other villages, which would have every reason to band together to destroy it. It was emphasised back when Hashirama was advocating for the village system that no village can withstand a coalition of the others.

In regard to system stability, it is worth acknowledging the significant role of belief in impeding optimisation.

Here you're judging them according to 21st century Western morality. For the majority of human history, children were expected to do the same jobs as adults as and when their physical and mental development allowed. In many societies (primitive ones are the most obvious example), being ready to fight for the tribe would be a central rite of passage, and would thus be undertaken by children in order to be acknowledged as adults. In the Narutoverse, children are fully capable of serving as effective ninja at twelve, and it probably seems strange to deny them the chance to use their skills for the good of the village.

*** Also, quoth the Naruto wiki, the Sharingan sees through genjutsu by detecting subtle irregularities in chakra flow. At the points when his Sharingan was active, Sasuke was variously enjoying one-point focus on Itachi, listening to Sakura's argument on why he should not do the thing he most wants to do in the world, and being about to sacrifice himself. None of these lend themselves to noticing subtle details of the external environment.

The other thing is that this sounds like an ability you need to learn how to use, rather than merely "oh, you're an Uchiha? Have free genjutsu immunity". How do you know what a subtle irregularity in chakra flow looks like? If you notice it, how do you know what it signifies?

** Hey, really cool that you're writing again! And nice to see the plot picking up its pace again.

Though, if you would like some constructive criticism for the previous chapter especially: You could work on setting the scene/mood etc. more during scenes. Right now I'm getting the feeling that the story jumps a bit too much between scenes, making it feel disjointed. Esp. w.r.t. character viewpoints shifting (You should never show what's in anyone's head other than the viewpoint character, and it should always be clear who the viewpoint character is.) Just my two cents.

Anyway, I'm very interested in seeing where this is headed. Can you believe that the thought that all of this was a test didn't even cross my mind until after reading the comments? I must be tired...

I think I skimp on the scene-setting as overcompensation for the opposite - spending too much time on detail that slows down the plot and is more interesting to the author than the reader. Anyone who's into their worldbuilding constantly runs that risk. That and I'm probably in a rush to get to the parts I most want to write.

As for character viewpoints shifting, that one's trickier and I'll have to think about it.

- A member of Akatsuki...
- was injured to the point of death but not actually dead, yet no one was pursuing him...
- ignored a group of genin and civilians on first glance...
- when he finally did decide to attack, it was with a slow attack that would have been useless in a ninja battle.

This is a test. I'm just surprised they're bringing the civilians in on it, but I guess it makes a good drill.

** I dropped this story at chapter 4 at the bath spying scene. For a supposedly rational fanfic the one in a thousand chance? of dispelling a transformation seemed way too much of a coincidence. Why was he naked anyways when the transformation was dispelled anyways? It never worked like that in the original story, it makes no sense. The entire scene was just comedic relief fluff.

My question is does it get better? Can anyone tell me if things get more serious and rational in the coming chapters. If your going to call your story rational it better be rational and not filled with comedic nonsense like this. You've already primed me for a rational story, which increases my expectations and as such I'm harder on the story when it betrays the expectations I've set. I'd love to know that this is a one time thing so I can continue reading.

There were also scenes like the already mentioned bath one, where extremely unlikely events were happening in attempt to make the story funnier. Another such scene was how Naruto and Hinata not only fell on each other cliché anime style, but also somehow kissed while doing that (and the whole section that followed with Naruto explaining the situation to a doctor as well).

Eh, bringing the same HPMoR that you've mentioned earlier as an example, its author was prone to changing various parts of the story when the community was pointed out to him the problems. It, for example, would've been a much more crackier story with scenes like the ghost busters one left intact.

I don't think a few lines or a paragraph of humour is a problem as long as it does not undermine the feel or flow of the current scene, and does not cause problems for the story like the bath scene did. Tastes will differ, of course.

I'm /really/ uncomfortable with that kind of retcon. As a reader, I hate the idea of having a version of the story in my head, only to subsequently discover that it no longer exists and I must either systematically update my thoughts, impressions and reactions to the new version, or be permanently out of sync with that story's "canon". Maybe there are times when it's the best thing for the story, but I'd prefer to save it as the absolute last of last resorts. (also, for all the flaws of the bath scene, the hospitalisation contingent upon it does contribute to the story in important ways, by affirming Naruto's hitherto unseen bonds with the people around him, and setting up for his further relationship with Hinata, so I can't just go back and cut it out)

The course I attended was [[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/european/about-us/use-your-language-use-your-english/summer-school-2013][this one]]. It was actually a course for literary translators, and involved group translation of set texts with in-depth discussion (as well as lectures and other useful events). If you happen to be a translator working in the UK, and can find next year's version of this course, I would certainly recommend it, but otherwise I'm afraid I can be of no help in this respect.

In terms of other writing resources I've seen recently, the only one that springs to mind is [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Eliezer Yudkowsky's essays]], which you're probably already aware of. Sorry I can't be of more help.

The incident in the baths did serve a purpose however. It allows readers familiar with the original series to realize an important difference between Kyubi and Kyubei: The Kyubi grants physical resistance to injury and absurd regeneration powers, while the Kyubei only makes the natural healing of the human body more efficient.

*** In regard to the chapter you found objectionable: thousand to one chance, yes, guilty as charged (though, to clarify, that was the chance of breaking the transformation AND not breaking the clone, rather than just of breaking the transformation). Naruto's nakedness, on the other hand, is entirely logical and does not break any kind of rationality. He was naked when he used the Shadow Clone Technique (what with being in a public bath and all), so his clones are also naked in their non-transformed forms.

As for the fic in general, yes, things do get more serious overall. No, this does not mean there is no more comedy. I firmly believe that comedy can belong in any kind of fiction as long as it is done properly. I've never heard anyone say HPMOR was not a rational fic because it had comedy scenes.

As for whether this fic becomes more rational, that's not something I'm in a position to judge.

If you want to take another look, try the next arc, Chapters 4 to 8 (you actually dropped it at 3). It's more serious, though not without humour, and I think more representative of the feel of the rest of the story than the first 3 chapters are.

**** Ah I didn't realize that he used the clone when he was naked, that makes sense then. That brings up the question of why didn't he make the clone when they were discussing the plan earlier, so it would have clothes. I am kind of against comedy in general (aside from black comedy) so that's mostly my bias. I just don't like unrealistic situations coming up so that jokes keep happening. The one in a thousand chance thing is in my mind sacrificing plot for comedy whereas I'd prefer if comedy happened along with the plot. In my mind it would be more interesting if the girls broke the clone and the transformation and then they tried to find out who was spying on them (which could lead to them suspecting the totally wrong person leading to more plot relevant comedy). But that's me.

I'll read some more chapters and tell you what I think. I will tell you that your story is well written, I'm just harsh when it comes to these things.
