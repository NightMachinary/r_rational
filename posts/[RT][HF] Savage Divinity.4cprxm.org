** Here is the authors description (I am not the author):

A modern man finds himself reincarnated in the body of a young slave with no skills and quickly fading memories. Follow his journey to find normalcy while living in a savage world, filled with myth and legends, monsters and Demons. In a land where the strong rule, the weak serve, and bloodshed is a way of life, peace is a luxury few can afford.

Author's note: Expect a chapter every mon/wed/fri, unless I start writing faster.

The story is eastern themed, but not Xianxia, no chasing immortality, MC is not OP. Less action, more character and world driven is my aim. Mature language and themes, but no raunchy sex.

I have read up to chapter 32 (the latest chapter). The writing is solid and and the world seems well built. Highly recommend.

*** Well written from what I read so far, but I am not sure if it's my cup of tea, to be honest.

I prefer people who do empire-building, or is a craftman/engineer, or who do SCIENCE! of some kind.

*** Chasing immortality? He already found it, assuming the reincarnation wasn't a one-time trick.

** +Just from looking at the summary, it doesn't really seem rational. Can you explain how it is?+

edit: After reading 16 chapters: *absolutely not rational*. The author has a good grasp of how to make his writing engaging, but it's incredibly tedious reading it because he drags on and on without really going anywhere.

*** The motivations and actions of the characters are rational and dont hold the idiot ball for stupid plot reasons. Similar to how Worm is considered rational. It is not a rationalist story like HPMOR.

**** After having read 14 chapters, I don't think it's particularly rational. The characters aren't /stupid/ but the enemies so far (slavers) weren't smart either, and plenty of things have happened just because the plot required them too.

** I enjoyed this story. There are some flaws; the protagonist comes from our world, but this has almost 0 impact on the plot. There will be no industrial revolution in this fic, no firearms invented, no real changes. That said, it's fun, and the characters and relationships are realistic, their goals rational, and the world-building competent, if somewhat derivative. Worth a read.
