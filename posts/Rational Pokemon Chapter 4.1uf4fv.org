I do wonder what the Pokeballs-on-humans thing will come down to. Do Pokemon simply have fundamentally different brain anatomy? Or do Pokemon take brain damage every time a Pokeball is used and the trainer just doesn't notice? And, of course, if you outlaw research, only outlaws etc. Team Rocket simulation attacks?

[edit] Oh, one thing that wasn't clear and that I do /really/ want an answer to. Pokeballs dematerialize human, materialize again, human has brain damage. But Pokemon are /aware/ in their balls. So does the brain damage happen on scanning, or on materialization?

[edit] I really like, in general, how the fic sticks to the pattern of "smart, competent and informed people explaining their reasoning". Some people here seem to think "rational" is just a synonym for "realistic".

#+end_quote

Ok, so here's the way I'm envisioning it:

The transmutation from matter to energy and vice-versa is precise enough that it preserves just about everything organic that's part of the scanned organism.

This including all the cells and microbes and bacteria and whatnot that complex life forms contain within themselves, all in the same position they had been in. So when a pokeball absorbs a complex organism that, for example, has bacteria in their small intestine that assist in digestion, it all gets released in the same exact position it had been, rather than having those bacteria reform in its bloodstream or in somewhere in a bone or something.

The brain, however, is a different matter: creatures with basic perceptions of time and self-awareness can come through it more or less unharmed. Not exactly unchanged... but not detrimental to what humans want in pokemon, meaning less individuality, less unpredictability, more submissive/suggestive. It's not quite right to say pokemon are /aware/ in their balls, so much as their time in the ball can be translated to a suggested memory or experience upon release. If you've played the latest Pokemon, X and Y, think of Pokemon Amie or Supertraining as these kinds of things.

The higher cognitive functions of people, on the other hand, are much more fragile. Whether because the technology hasn't advanced enough yet, or simply because of the complexity of the information processed, the transition utterly screws with their memory, sense of self, personality... essentially what we consider their "mind." At best, they're reduced to an infantile/animal state: at worst, near catatonic.

It's a reference to the saying "If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns" or more generally, "if you outlaw X, only outlaws will X" where X is both dangerous and a competetive advantage in a fight.

"Simulation attack" is an umbrella term for all the shenanigans you can get up to if you can simulate somebody and convince them that they're in reality. Conversational replay attacks, predicting behaviors, "we are simulating 1000 copies of you having this conversation, if you turn us down we'll torture them, how likely is it that you're the real one" etc.

This does imply that Pokemon either have none of those things, or are unable to notice the difference. What about the smarter breeds? Capturing Mew == insanity? Is that how Mewtwo came about?

Yes, but there are still measures of warfare those in authority that consider themselves the "good guys" simply cannot condone by use.

Weaponizing the ability to effectively turn people into vegetables is one of them. Like biological warfare, criminals or terrorists may employ such tactics, but retaining the moral highground comes with some sacrifices.

1) People aren't conscious while in pokeballs, and upon exiting one would be too mentally damaged to remember any programmed experiences while in one.

2) If the above technological hurdles were theoretically leaped, it would still require belief on the part of the subject, which would be difficult as such a breakthrough would be secret.

Yes, this fic is based much more on the games than the anime, where the mean pokemon intelligence is much closer to a dog's than a human's. The smarter breeds are predominantly psychic types, and the whole psychic phenomenon is something I'm going to address eventually :) Suffice to say the ability to bend spoons doesn't require a human intelligence.

#+begin_quote
  Capturing Mew == insanity?
#+end_quote

Any pokemon with intelligence approaching the human level would be mentally harmed by being caught, yes: they might retain some superior intelligence, but it would be something like a lobotomy that removes their ability to think for themselves and, say, decide to fly away the second they're released from the ball.

** Hey guys, here's Chapter 4. Still out of the country, so edits might be a bit slow at first.

Something of note in this chapter: the economy of pokemon according to the games is just utterly screwy. Pokedollars are based on Japanese yen, each of which is equivalent to a penny. So in the games, a bottle of water is 200 pokedollars, or 2 dollars. Not a big deal, right? Except a pokeball is ALSO 200 pokedollars, while a bottle of soda is 300. Which means that somehow one of the most advanced pieces of technology we could conceive of is so cheap in labor and materials to make that it costs less than a soda. And that's not even getting into the $100,000 bicycles.

Like I said: utterly screwy.

So I'm going to scrap and rebuild it from the ground up. I'm going to use $ to represent the currency for ease and simplicity, and try to rescale things into a more rational framework, but don't jump to any conclusions about how everything is priced based just on this chapter, as the technology they have available warps the price of many things, and it's going to be a work in progress. Any feedback or suggestions appreciated.

You're ignoring the in-game backstory that pokeballs almost literally [[http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Apricorn][grow on trees]], and existed long before the pokemon world's industrial revolution.

Consider that they wouldn't make pokeballs out of whatever synthetic metals and plastics they're made of, unless it were both more reliable /and cheaper/ than just having mass-farmed apricorn orchards. So, in terms of processing required, it pretty much /is/ a soda (with the historical apricorn-based balls being respectively analogous to a bottle of orange juice.)

**** From the article:

#+begin_quote
  The special PokÃ© Balls made from Apricorns are unique, quite rare, and often valuable for a Trainer to have on hand in battle. This is due to the fragile nature of Apricorn trees, which may die if too many Apricorns are picked at once or before they are mature enough. Only one Apricorn may be picked per tree per day, in order to prevent harm to it.
#+end_quote

That one of the materials grows on trees is not indicative that it should be cheap, even putting aside all the labor and other materials that are needed to make the finished result.

The industrial revolution should help mass produce pokeballs to make them cheaper, but cheaper than a soda? Cheaper than a T-Shirt? Not everyone uses as many pokeballs as trainers do, the supply and demand balance would be utterly unhinged for Silph Co. to make so many that they're so cheap.

The only thing that makes sense to me is that their purchase is subsidized for trainers.

Now we're getting somewhere. One could presume that developing a synthetic pokeball was basically the pokemon world's equivalent of the development of the Internet: funded originally for military reasons, which forced scientific discoveries that commercialized, and eventually commoditized, the market.

Remember that you don't necessarily have to be a "pokemon trainer" in job description to need pokeballs; I imagine that, if nothing else, everyone who lives outside a city would want a few on them at all times, for the good few seconds of reprieve (to run away!) it'll buy them if a wild pokemon tries to attack them. (They work, in that sense, a lot like mace/bear spray.)

Plus, in any realistic setting, you'd have an eBay equivalent for selling freshly-caught pokemon, where trainers can also post bounties for pokemon of specific types. This'd incentivize a lot of people who also happen to wield dangerous tools in their work (e.g. policemen, long-haul truckers, train conductors) to carry balls to catch pokemon they happen to injure in the line of duty, for later sale. (And, to be less charitable, it'd incentivize a lot of people to go out "hunting" pokemon with regular weapons.)

****** Absolutely. When you think about a lot of the people you encounter in the game, like Backpackers or Tourists or Fishermen or whatever, you notice that most of them only have 1-3 pokemon. Most people in the pokemon world probably have a handful of pokemon, but it's really only trainers that would need dozens of pokeballs, and as long as they serve some important functions in the pokemon society (like say, protecting against rampaging pokemon, or collecting them for research purposes) it makes sense to support them through subsidies.

** How can they possibly scientifically say "higher cognitive functions"? Mew-two is a pokemon right? Also it implies mentally retarded people or perhaps people who already suffered brain damage could be used in the pokeball?

That leads me to believe that all pokemon in the universe are dumb (so no Mewtwo, etc), they're not classed as pokemon, or possibly seomthing else.

I wonder what about children or comatose people etc. And since they work on people why not attack others with them, team Rocket can use it to capture their enemies or soldiers. Brain damage better than death right

This is exactly why weaponizing pokeballs is a crime of the highest level. Using a pokeball on a human is essentially the perfect crime: no sign of a struggle, no body, no evidence.
