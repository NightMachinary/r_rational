Immediately throw Earth at the sun. Teleport just as temperatures rise to unsafe levels. Teleport must take you somewhere safe, nowhere safe exists on the Earth, therefore it searches elsewhere in the galaxy and deposits you on a random inhabitable planet.

More of an evil/insane supervillain choice than a rational one, as your new life is likely going to be more of a struggle than one where you have 100 billion dollars, but it optimizes your kill-count.

On the other hand, a rational supervillain might be forced to take teleportation and explain this back-up plan in order to make the extinction threat actually credible.

It's like--if mortals can live happy lives in spite of experiencing grief and loss, why not an immortal?

As for a "young mindset", it depends - if you mean a level of maturity, I'd have to disagree, because that comes with experience which you'd gain just as much of over time. If you mean "more willing to undertake high-energy activities as part of remaining in their physical prime" then I suppose you could argue that your interests would diverge somewhat, but it would be a very specific type of person that wouldn't get bored of their activities over time, or at least be unwilling to try new ones with their older friends.

  I think we can agree that old people tend to be less active than young people, maybe even more content with "doing nothing".
#+end_quote

I think this is a core point of contention with your scenario to me, and possibly with others as well. I don't have statistics to back this up, but this description doesn't mesh with my experiences. It might help to elaborate what ages and experience levels we're actually discussing.

One comparison I keep seeing is "80 year old in a 20 year old's body". However, that seems to ignore the potentially inconvenient ages between the two. For example, I think it would be somewhat difficult to say that, for example, a 30 year old first time parent is "obviously" or "clearly" less active than that same person was at 20. Is the activity the same? Probably not, they're not going out drinking and clubbing (or whatever "activity" we're positing that 20 year olds do currently; when I was 20, I sat around and watched TV a lot, so I suspect that I'm not a member of the reference group), but chasing a 2 year old around their house and yard all night long every night is certainly a lot of activity.

Additionally, I know the long distance running community is filled with people well into their fifties and sixties, many of whom were not exactly athletic in their earlier lives (though clearly, some also were).

These are two narrow anecdotal examples that would begin to hint towards any sort of generalized lowered activity level, if it does exist, being caused by deterioration in physical capabilities, rather than a more generalized process of aging altering your interests on its own.

I do agree with your statement about recycling social circles, but have observed as I get older that the age range of my circle simply has grown wider, rather than just older. My current group of friends that I spend a decent amount of time with ranges from people around 26 to 35 or 36, rather than the 22-23 when I was that age. So, with eternal physical youth and an ability to meal learn and grow, I expect my social circle would likely stabilize at around mid 40s to late 60s.

****** I am an adult, and I'm also an aromantic asexual. I am not able to experience those feelings whether I want to or not. So thanks for implying that I'm both childish and doomed to a life of misery for something I can't help, offense absolutely taken.

Fortunately, because I'm an adult, I've had the time and experience to learn that just because a lot of people find fulfillment in romantic partnerships doesn't mean that's the /only/ path to a happy life. Don't assume that what you need to be happy is what everyone needs.

Also not sure why you assume that an asymmetrically-aging couple can't be happy, given that that has never happened in all of human history. If eternally young people actually existed and their relationships all fell apart as their partners aged, then you'd have something to base that assertion on.

Edit for clarity: I am not offended that this person assumed I'm not an aromantic asexual. I understand that it's an uncommon orientation. What I took issue with was the "you must be a child if you think you can be happy without romantic love" thing, which I felt was a needlessly condescending generalization. I brought up my (lack of) orientation to give some perspective on why "romantic love is necessary for happiness" is not a universal axiom--being aromantic is /one/ example of a reason that someone might not desire a romantic partnership and be perfectly happy without one.

Seeing as we're in [[/r/rational]], I'm surprised that you're this cool with making unfounded assumptions about people you've never met. And that you think yelling "Statistics!" makes for a good argument.

Seriously--if you're going to make an argument like "you must be a child if you think you can have a happy life without a romantic partnership," you're going to have to do better than vaguely alluding to the concept of statistics. How about you try to actually back up your claim that "99.9% of people outgrow" the idea that a romantic partnership is absolutely necessary for happiness? Cause I was going to let that slide as hyperbole, but apparently now it's /statistics,/ so--you got a source for that? And do you actually think that aromantic asexuals are the only people in all the world who can be happily single?

And as for the "age gap" thing, I'm really not sure why you think situations like "a 50-year-old marries a 20-year-old" extrapolate to situations like "two 20-year-olds get married, but only one of them /looks/ 80 when they're both 80." You want to argue that a 500-year-old immortal will have trouble successfully dating the mortals, you might have a leg to stand on, but the argument you actually made was about a partnership where one partner undergoes senescence and the other does not--something that, again, has never happened in human history.

Numerous obvious caveats abound, including lack of replication as well as it being old and potentially having lower reported rates. However, by comparison, only about [[http://www.gallup.com/poll/183383/americans-greatly-overestimate-percent-gay-lesbian.aspx][3.5 to 4% of the adult population currently self identified as homosexual]], which puts asexuality as less common, but definitely not an order of magnitude less common.

So, if you think the response you received would have been unmerited had it been instead a gay person responding to someone claiming that everyone grows out of being attracted to someone of the same sex, then that's one thing. But the statistics don't really seem quite as strong as you're implying, and might be worth updating your beliefs.

****************** Asking for the sake of understanding - how do you experience asexuality or aromanticism?

Sexual and romantic attraction can be remarkably specific; there are some, for instance, that never find romance until very late into their lives. And in a similar vein, I'm... not really attracted to most people, though not so much that I would consider myself asexual. The individual that actually does spark an interest is few and far between; if not for the existence of the internet, I would likely have gone through my life without ever encountering anyone I found attractive.

I'm not saying you're the same way or attempting to invalidate your identity; it's more just intellectual curiosity - what is the driving point that makes you certain you will never experience romantic or sexual attraction?

******************* Well, I'd say the answer is that I'm not certain. I never have experienced those things, and I don't expect to; for me there's not really even a frame of reference for those feelings. But if I ever do start to experience sexual and romantic attraction, I'll swap out my label accordingly. Aro/ace is just what most accurately describes me as I am now and as I've been up to this point.

For the sake of my mental wellbeing I pretty much have to expect that I'll never feel those things, though. I spent too many years thinking I was just a late bloomer, holding out for that one miraculous person who'd make me feel butterflies in my stomach and stars in my eyes, and it just left me feeling broken and disappointed. I had to stop thinking of myself as this incomplete person waiting to be made whole. I'd rather accept that this is who I am and move forward to build a happy life on that foundation, even if my idea of a happy life is a little unconventional.

In answer to how I experience it--it's kind of like not being into a hobby that other people are super passionate about. I respect the happiness it brings them, but I don't feel any interest for myself. Like, I meet people who I think are aesthetically beautiful, but the idea that I might want to have sex with them is totally alien.

Any relationship that's so deeply dependent, I think, is unhealthy; one should never have the perception that they are merely a half of a human being, completed by another. Supplemented and complemented by, yes.

So for what it's worth: I don't think your idea of a happy life is unconventional. If anything, it's the way things should be. There's far better goals in life than romance, heh.

That being said, thanks for answering. I was primarily wondering because the labels, I feel, have been greatly diluted (and perhaps are not entirely necessary, but that's a different debate altogether; I recognize that there is solidarity to be found in others that share the label). I have friends who identify as ace, but have - ahem - proclivities that are quite clearly sexual in nature, even if they only experience it in art; there's no /real/ example of what they enjoy. Is that then asexuality, or simply that what they find attractive - unfortunately - does not exist?

********************* Oh, what I meant about feeling incomplete was the belief that I needed to "grow into" the ability to feel romantic attraction in order to become a fully realized human being, rather than specifically needing a partner--but I agree with everything you said about how our culture places too much emphasis on romance. One thing I really don't like is how we treat romantic relationships as a "step above" platonic ones--our fiction in particular often seems to glorify the newest romances above the longest-running, deepest friendships.

I think in your last paragraph you're referring to asexuals who have sexual fetishes? As someone who also falls into that category, I can offer my perspective.

The broad umbrella of asexuality is generally considered to include anyone who doesn't experience sexual attraction toward other people. That covers not only people who have little or no libido at all, but also people who do have a sex drive (and perhaps a fetish) but have no inclination to satisfy it through sexual activity with another person.

For me, the term "asexual" is appropriate and useful even though I have a sex drive, because the implications re: my relationships with other people are the same either way. Many of my personal struggles related to my asexuality are the same ones that asexuals without libido also experience. The question of whether I'd be more accurately defined as "my fetish"-sexual is mildly interesting on a semantic level, but it isn't a distinction I feel I need to make in my daily life.

I don't see the "umbrella" of asexuality as a dilution of the label; I see it as the label doing its job, which is to signal to others that I'm not a viable sexual prospect, anchor me in an identity, and connect me with the broader asexual community. It doesn't need to specify whether I have a libido or not in order to do that. Some aces like to use more expanded, precise labels, adding a variety of modifiers to "asexual" in order to pin down exactly how they experience sexuality. In the rare cases where it's necessary to get that specific, I think that's a fine way to distinguish different kinds of asexual.

********************** Yeah, and my own experience of my sexuality is... well... I'm /primarily/ a teratophile, not in the "likes-disfigured-humans" sense, but in the "monsters-that-have-teeth" sense. Honestly, anything bipedal and inhuman generally registers high on my scale - I blame Power Rangers. The vast majority of people aren't particularly attractive to me, at least not in the same way. I'm not incapable of sexual attraction to people as such, but it takes a degree more effort, so I have a certain (if incomplete) understanding of where you're coming from.

I think part of my concern regarding the so-called "dilution" of the label lies in the younger generation, and the current tendency to pick and choose labels whilst trying to discover themselves. Unfortunately, identities can be just as restrictive as they are freeing - just as you can find communities and solidarity through your identity, those very same communities often inflict a kind of unintentional peer pressure. Being involved in a community is great, but /leaving/ a community isn't; by necessity, a change in sexual identity would mean no longer being involved in that community.

So I suppose there's a balance to be had there. I'm just sort of thinking out loud; do you have an opinion?

*********************** Oh, I don't know. I think it is important not to let your label turn into some kind of restrictive standard of behavior, but my experience is that these communities are generally very good about emphasizing that. I've never encountered any pressure to conform to a "gold standard" of asexuality, whereas I've often seen people reassuring each other that they don't have to feel beholden to the label.

In fact, there are plenty of people in ace communities who are more "less sexual" than "asexual"--like, you'll usually see a few demisexuals, people who require an emotional connection as a precursor to sexual attraction. So if there's been a dilution of the label, I'd argue that the result is greater inclusivity, rather than people being shut out as their identities shift.

  Alas, there just is no fucking way of telling somebody young that their opinion might change as they grow older without them getting offended. Jesus Christ.
#+end_quote

Not while you're being an asshole that can't hold a debate, there isn't. If your argument has any merit, you should be able to support it instead of calling the person you're debating with a child. The reason you're having a problem here is because you're not actually backing up your assertions and no one's falling for it. Let me do a point by point breakdown of what you've said so far. If I've misunderstood something, feel free to correct me:

#+begin_quote
  Eternal youth only sounds good if you're young and naive
#+end_quote

This is false if you think about it for even two seconds. It's incredibly common for old people to end up with mental health problems because they don't want to be a broken down version of their former selves. They have pains, health problems, and everything is just generally shittier for them than when they were young and healthy. Do you really, truly think that old people wouldn't take an offer of eternal youth if it was on the table?

#+begin_quote
  The reason it isn't good is because your One True Love^{TM} will grow old without you and die, thereby making the rest of your eternal life pointless
#+end_quote

You're also getting disrespect for poorly thought out, sanctimonious garbage like this. Even if I accepted this premise (which I don't), the solution here is obvious. Take the eternal youth + no illness perk, and then wait until medical technology gives the same gift to everyone. With the rapid, exponential pace of technology growth and the growth of useful narrow AIs, I wouldn't be surprised if we can conquer aging in the next century. That's nothing for someone who has eternal youth.

#+begin_quote
  The "love doesn't make you happy" is very common for young people, but as they mature, 99.9% of people outgrow that.
#+end_quote

You going "Statistics!" is being ignored because showing that 99% of people aren't asexual doesn't tell you /anything/ about what situations actually make people happy. You're citing that as if 99% of the population needs to be in a monogamous One True Love^{TM} relationship and that's just not the case. Life long marriage isn't the norm by any means. If you like statistics, take a look [[http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/city/city_index/214133-city-index-marriage-lengths][here]]. So given that most people don't live "the dream" of marrying their high school sweetheart and staying together until death does them part, do you really think it's reasonable to call out someone as naive for already knowing what they want and not sticking to an illusory "norm"?

#+begin_quote
  so don't worry, I'll stop trying to get you to be rational. You can go get offended somewhere else now about your underdeveloped sexuality. Oh, and also, now you're on ignore, kid.
#+end_quote

Not much to say about this except fuck off, dude. Someone who can't prop up their points in a debate shouldn't be calling someone else irrational. Also you're the one that seems to be offended at the idea that someone can be confidently asexual. Just look at what you're saying. "too young", "child", "underdeveloped", "kid". Refusing to accept that an adult can be asexual just makes you seem like an immature person that won't accept something if it breaks their argument.

#+begin_quote
  It's unreasonable to expect nobody to ever make any assumptions if the statistics so strongly support it.
#+end_quote

Nope, you tried to pull something like a bait and switch. First you said "The "love doesn't make you happy" is very common for young people, but as they mature, 99.9% of people outgrow that". Then to offer support for this assertion, you said that 99% of the population aren't asexual. Notice that this does absolutely nothing for your claim that 99% of people need to be in a long term, monogamous relationship and that such a relationship is worth forgoing eternal youth. You aren't supporting your main claim, all you're trying to do is discredit the first person that responded to you. That's not the same as backing up what you said, so hopefully you'll understand why it's so absurd that you're calling other people "irrational" when you can't even hold a basic debate.

#+begin_quote
  If after he had said "I'm asexual" and I'd have said "You'll grow out of that", then I can understand why he'd get offended. However, that's not what I did at all.
#+end_quote

"I don't know your age, but chances are pretty high that you're not exactly an adult with that opinion."\\
"I'm actually starting to doubt that being true now. :)"\\
"You can go get offended somewhere else now about your underdeveloped sexuality. Oh, and also, now you're on ignore, kid."

No, of course not! All you said is that someone who holds her opinion can't possibly be an adult. That's totally different and in no way implies that it's something to be grown out of. Nope.

** /Invulnerability/: to physical damage, this protects me from damn near everything except incapacitation by toxins, electricity or a few other means. Basically since the body is a physical thing nothing could actually kill me, though quite a few things could put me out of commision if maintained.

/Telekinetic/: There's no size limits which means no force limit, so I can use this to move myself at relativistic speed and have the destructive power of a nuke. In fact I really have no other choice but to use this to fly around as a nude bald man since my invulnerability will protect me but not anything else.

/Hold Breath x2/: I would use this to be able to use this to remain safe from poisons or nearly anything else for an hour at a time by moving my body back and forth to protect myself with a sheath of plasma that will destroy any poisons. Effectively by always staying moving I can ensure invulnerability, and rarely have to make myself vulnerable by going somewhere and slowing down so I can actually take a breath. Also because of my long breath time I can get places by just flying directly through the planet quickly, but not so fast as to cause massive seismic activity.

With these powers I could achieve world domination flying around the world and threatening to destroy governments cities by accelerating to near lightspeed. I would use this power to force demilitarization and make global laws actually conform to basic western idealized liberal values, as well as forcing massive government transparency and cooperation. Basically with a lot of these sorts of superpower scenarios you can make yourself effectively invulnerable then force world powers to do what you want creating a world government by force.

I think you are missing the point you were /just/ making. Saying just "this universe" or "the set of all things that I don't want to cause harm to me" refers to a singular object, which just so happens to include as components everything you want protection from.\\
However "forces/objects within this universe" isn't a singular thing. The point is sort of to find a way of framing everything you want included as a singular noun.

So things can only do you any ill temporarily, but not permanently (because if they could do that then it renders the power useless). So oxygen deprivation may not kill you but it would still knock you out because your bodies systems don't know that they can just keep functioning normally, similarly many poisons cause your body to act in ways not in your best interest but this isn't damage (well it would normally cause damage). Notably if the power could just protect you from any ill effects period then you would also be immune to any allergies.

Teleportation is an obvious out-of-jail card, but I don't think it can be used for anything more than that. Unless 'anywhere' includes other planets (there are bound to be some safe ones) in which case you are screwed hard. So no.

Eternal youth seems useful, if morally dubious, provided you can handle being a loner.

** - Shape Shifter: Valdimir Putin

- Knowledge Steal: Vladimir Putin

- Intangibility: Bullets

- Frozen Yogurt: Delicious

I now replace Putin. Assassinating me is far harder, as you need a bomb or poison. Over several years, I slowly shift his Empire from its current state to one more in-line with international rules and regulations. I withdraw from Crimea, citing it as a waste of money that could be better spent improving the economy. The Mafia is taken fully under my control, and I work on turning it into something more like the Yakuza: dangerous, but controlled and mostly keeping violence in-house.

Once things are properly under control, I convince my oligarchs that the best way for them to maintain power in perpetuity and avoid the kind of revolution Russia has already had once is to set up efficient social services that will keep them happy. I root out corruption in the police, punishing abusive cops severely and pushing the more stubborn precincts into alliances with our new, far less violent Mafia. The long term plan there is to transform their front businesses into actual profitable endeavors and make them realize that going legit is very lucrative and doesn't carry the risk of assassination by rivals.

Economy revitalized, Russia becomes a true world power. Sanctions are dropped because a lot of the human rights violations are gone, and we begin exporting our former Mafia made goods around the world. With them, we export a new philosophy of stability: criminal underworlds tamed into something less dangerous, police still corrupt but usually not to the public's detriment, oligarchs living the high life while everyone else gets to live a reasonable, decent life free of reasons to violently revolt.

Because you have just spent 20+ minutes at a temperature of 500C increasing to 6000C and "intangible" doesn't mean "heat proof".

********* Ah, an idiosyncratic definition of "intangible".

If you're intangible to electromagnetic radiation then you're blind and invisible, but since you're intangible to air your suffocated corpse is now inexorably cooling to zero Kelvin as you oscillate back and forth through the core of the Earth.

If you're intangible to gravity (whatever that would mean) your suffocating body is instead hurled into space tangent to the rotating Earth.

Anyway, there's no good ending here.

So idiosyncratic it's the first result on google for the word.

What information do you have on the realities outside the universe that you know that heat would dissipate?

My suffocating body isn't hurled anywhere because who says velocity exists outside the universe?

Light is already intangible. Which is implied by the quote they use even.

You're not outside the universe, you're just not interacting with any of the matter (or, if you insist, energy) in the universe.

** I've long wondered if there's some way we can grab asteroids such as that [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bridaineparnell/2017/05/26/nasa-psyche-mission-fast-tracked/#25bd9a514ae8][$10 quintillion one]] and somehow drop them on Earth safely. So I'd take telekinesis, maybe stacked three times, and collect big useful asteroids on Earth.

Depending on the rules about bundling things into "one object" we might be able to move a lot of sea water to Mars, which combats sea level rising here, and helps with terraforming there. Presumably "the North Pole" is one object, but that's probably too much.

** "Telekinesis" + "intangibility" to the object under telekinetic control was the combination that stood out to me. Also, the "cursed" in "frozen yogurt" seems to be removed by the "without repercussion" in "hunger." As long as you process all the yogurt through yourself, infinite bioenergy fuels humanity's ascent to galactic power?

** Invincibility has a potent hack to it: the cause can be /very/ specific.

- Touching a copper plate with specific, 10 digit number on it. (or a set of names, to remember it)
- Chanting a specific song. Or a poem.
- Really, /desperately/ wishing to die for more than a day.
- "Being in a situation which will certainly inflict tremendous and long-lasting pain upon me."
- "Becoming brainwashed or permanently modified in a way my person before said modification would find a fate as bad or worse than death."
