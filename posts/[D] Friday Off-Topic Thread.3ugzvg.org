Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

** Every day from now on, three people somewhere in the world are granted a superpower. There is no choice involved; who gets a power is random and who gets what power is random. The three superpowers are as follows:

- Deception: You may, at any time you choose, trade minds with any other human within about ten feet of you; they do not need to agree to this trade. Your power rests with your mind, not your body, so you may live indefinitely by trading down to younger bodies.
- Entropy: Your biological body is replaced with a black sphere, about a foot in diameter. Any matter or energy that comes in contact with this sphere is destroyed. Your brain is preserved in a pocket dimension inside the sphere; in your sphere body you are immortal, both in the unaging and unkillable sense. The sphere body is unaffected by gravity, but you can feel its field and use it to construct a reference frame; you may move in any direction at any velocity up to about sixty miles per hour within your reference frame (this is your only way to deliberately influence the outside world, though you may communicate by, say, using finer control to carve messages on a wall). Sphere bodies bounce off of other sphere bodies. Your power rests with your body, not your mind, so the exploits of those with the power of Deception may leave you powerless. Edited to clarify that you do retain sensory ability spread out across your surface area.
- Time: You may, at any time you choose, reset the universe to the moment when you were first granted the power of Time, eliminating the previous series of events you've experienced from everything except your memory. Your power rests with your mind, not your body, so you are immune to Deception shenanigans. In the end, the final, stable timeline is one where you are either caught off-guard and are killed before you are able to react, or willingly commit suicide.

How would you expect the world to wind up? What would you do with Deception? Entropy? Time?

Uh...

The massive hole that I'm not sure you're aware of is Entropy destroying the entire atmosphere of the Earth. /This setting ends with everyone on Earth freezing and/or suffocating to death./

With Deception, I don't do anything besides research human cloning. I find genetic donors of people whose bodies I want, grow mindless clones of them, then trade minds with the clones. I work on saving the Earth from the consumption of atmosphere by Entropy, assuming that's /even possible./

Entropy, I'm a constant sink on the atmosphere, which is very very bad. I live in orbit, slowly going insane from sensory deprivation, and assassinate warlords. Perhaps I can communicate to a government authority and get a satellite hooked up that I can live around. Then I won't go insane, and my head-destroying powers can be directed to more intelligent ends. But seriously, people with Entropy who live in atmosphere are sucking down an enormous amount of air.

Time, I develop a reflex of rewinding time whenever I'm surprised. That's pretty much it. I rewind time before I'm killed by Entropy eating the atmosphere. I work on saving the Earth from the consumption of the atmosphere by Entropy, assuming that's /even possible./

**** I did consider that issue, but made what I felt was an educated guess that the atmosphere would not be consumed quickly enough to be a short-term problem. How long-term of a problem, I'm not sure. Let me search for some values and run some calculations...

Holy shit, each Entropy consumes 4% of the atmosphere a day. (It asymptotically approaches 0%, obviously, but still.) Someone lied to me a couple of years ago about how much atmosphere we had and I never realized it. If each Entropy is only an inch in diameter instead of a foot, then they "only" consume 0.03% of the atmosphere a day.

Right. If I'm Deception, I try my hardest to switch minds with an Entropy and wait for humanity to die from not knowing about air pressure. If I'm Entropy, I live in orbit and the rest is the same. If I'm Time, I endlessly rewind to try to save the world from Entropy, and the mysterious instigator to cause all this.

********* I do think the winning move now is for one of the Times to realize that the Entropies are eating the atmosphere, then try to convert all the other Times to this cause. They need to convert a few Deceptions as well. This is random locations on Earth once per day. But with a lot of loops, they can figure out the identities and locations of all the Entropies with the exception of the first few and get to them with a Time and a Deception to switch, Deception to Entropy, Deception to Time, Deception to former Entropy, to switch all of the Times into all of the Entropies. Then they all live in orbit, and they communicate with wiggles to each other forever staving off existential risks.

Deceptions can stay alive ethically through a series of mindless human clones (and if the Times/Deceptions get to the Entropies before they turn they can sample the Entropy's original genetic material). Deceptions can also keep /others/ alive through mindless human clones, which means the former Entropies in the Times' bodies can be put in their original body, or at least survive until later.

Eventually uploading becomes possible. The Deceptions have to stay in human bodies for their power to work, and they can switch with Entropies and another donor to get an Entropy out of the sphere. The problem with Entropies is that they don't go away. You need an intelligent human in them. and that means they get no tickets to the Singularity. By now there are millions of Entropies. I think the best system here would be to build a pool of people accustomed to being an Entropy, so they don't have to spend their time alone, and they each get one week out of some amount of months being printed into a human body and switched by a Deception into an Entropy.

******** I can see a way forward. They can actually communicate, it would just take a while (a few months, maybe) to get used to speaking like that. In addition, entropies have mass! They can use this mass to collect raw materials using their own gravity (kind of how we propose to drag a black hole into orbit using a huge mass to perturb its orbit) and figure out how to make tools from them. Better yet, they could just move to Mars and start grid mining for materials. They could induce charges in metals by collecting plasmized gas from stars or interstellar space and then running those charges along the metal strips to produce some sort of electrical system, and from there figure out a potential way to prevent the cataclysm from occuring.

This isn't hopeless, we just need to figure out exactly what a sentient black hole is actually capable of.

I agree that the properties of Entropy are odd, which is basically why i think that if the author decided it still had all of those properties but also had mass it wouldn't really be that different.

So it could have mass, and it could even have gravity, anything pulled to it would simply be destroyed. it could in theory have orbiting matter though (It is not specifically said that "Entropy" couldn't generate\expel particles btw so even if we assume graviton's are needed to apply gravity it could still work).

Having said all of that, Halfway through this message i realized that the person who started this whole "mass"\"gravity" thing wasn't the one that started the prompt, as opposed to what I was thinking when i started questioning, so sorry for that.

And [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon/]] already confirmed that they do not have mass previously in this thread so it closes the entire discussion I suppose, sorry for that.

********* Times can kill entropies before they gain powers, and in fact with a sufficiently paranoid time that becomes 100% likely. The first time should go around killing everyone who gains entropy before they get it, meaning that there are effectively only deceptions and times in this setting, and very short, mostly only day long loops. Deceptions don't matter, as switching with a time doesn't accomplish anything. I do like the idea of having a deception switch a time into an entropy and having the entropy-times go amuse themselves in orbit, presumably developing a language using movements in the reference frame of those you are speaking to for companionship. A band of entropy - times should be able to roam the universe at will, possibly using their mass and gravity to siphon off raw materials from stars to eventually build vessels with which to travel faster. It would be an entirely inhuman way to build tools, but possibly doable. After all, they have literally infinite time. Once the heat death of the universe happens, the times can loop back around and teach the world how to build the starships they made so they can escape their doomed planet.

This only shifts the Entropy to someone else. There will always be one more Entropy per day. One of the earliest Times would be able to figure out who turns into Entropy, though, and convince a Deception and the Times that come after them to put the Times in the Entropies and go hang out in orbit.

*********** depending on what happens when:

1. what happens entropy is brain dead or in a comma in regard to his position in space
2. what happens when deception takes the mind of a comatose\brain dead\brain maimed person
3. what happens when a 2nd "Time" resets while a 1st "Time" is alive, does the 1st time keep his memories?

One could build up a plan where time uses deception to put brain dead people in entropy up in orbit every day.

It would require:

1. find enough people which when they become entropy are willing to go up in orbit\stay in a sealed chamber as to get a streak of enough days to perform enough iterative research
2. possibly using a chain of "Time"s, of course selected by killing\brain damaging\etc. incompatible "Time"s, to pass information recursively in a way that won't get them to go crazy(i.e. assuming you have 10 "Time"s the last one resets every day, after the 10th day he asks the 9th time to reset, the 9th does the same 10 times and then asks the 8th, etc.) doing so will subjectively shorten the research time needed from the prespective of each individual time.
3. after reaching the point of being able maintain a timeline for long enough for the figured out technology to build space ships fast enough to use a deception, again selected by finding a susceptible person that will agree to this plan, to every day take an "Entropy", go to space, meanwhile a brain dead person is taken to orbit and when far enough deception switches to him and comes back.

Doing all of these you will eventually be able to sustain indefinitely.

In theory its possible that if one of the first "Entropy"s destroy earth even in a slow manner then it won't be possible for "Time" to do anything about it because no technology could be built fast enough to counteract the destruction of earth, even with perfect knowledge of that. but i suspect that would depend on the physics of the world.

*** I think rationality applies to a lot of topics in life just by recommending you find science-based recommendations.

I read [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/][an article on LessWrong]] recommending academic and empirical sources for psychology and self-improvement; I own the book it recommends most, 'Psychology Applied to Modern Life' (preview [[http://www.coursesmart.com/9781111186630/Ch02][here]]). It has three chapters that seem most relevent: one on Friendship and Love, one on Marriage and Intimate Relationships, and one on Interpersonal Communication, and the 2011 edition is [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1111186634/][on Amazon]] for a little over $7 used. I haven't applied any romantic advice (never had a romantic relationship), but it seems to be of similar quality to the advice on friendships and communication, which I've benefitted from.

Muehlhauser also posted "Rational Romantic Relationships", which is more about relationship initiation, and looks to be lower quality. I haven't followed it's advice, either, but it's similar on a similar theme to your request, RE romance and rationality.

Congratulations! Honestly, you may as well take it seriously. Pop culture seems to put a lot of undue weight on casual relationships, even though the serious impact on personal happiness, feelings of existential security, etc is made by long-term, serious relationships. There are few-enough people you can ever treat as family - as close enough to be relied-upon - that if you've found a case where sex and love coincide well enough to be real romance, you should do yourself a favor and take it.

** So, I'm curious if there's a name for something I've been noticing recently.

Most people are able to use basic logic to figure things out, but only if it supports their own opinion. They can't use the exact same logic to figure out why their "opponents" think they way they do.

Example: Someone pointed out that some comedic actors, like Jim Carrey, have given questionable performances in serious roles as support for why they shouldn't play serious roles. I pointed out that the same actors have given questionable performances in comedic roles, too, to posit the question of whether they should play comedic roles (to point out that it's hypocritical to use the logic he was for one but not the other). Even after I pointed it out, he still didn't understand that logic should be applied in parallel like that.

This definitely has a certain aspect of confirmation bias, but it's not just that. Is there a more formal definition for this bias? I've been using "parallel logic" or "parallel reasoning" when talking about it with friends recently, but neither seems to fit perfectly.

** Truth is an interesting concept. As rationalists (or aspiring rationalists), I think the majority of this sub would agree that they, in context of themselves, prefer the real truth over a happy lie (a la Dr House) You'd want to know that you didn't receive your Hot Wheels racetrack because your family is going through some tight financial times, instead of thinking that your temper tantrum at Thanksgiving put you on Santa's naughty list.

But is this the case for everyone? As a rationalist, do you think everyone (for the sake of argument, let's say everyone above the age of sexual consent) should be give the whole truth all the time (barring things that breach privacy, national security, etc). I'm not saying you inundate people with every little minutiae of data, I'm saying that it's there to be publicly accessed and viewed by anyone, at any time. I'm probably not being explicit enough, but I'm basically asking if your world view supports the existence of necessary "pleasant" lies, because you feel people's net happiness would be reduced by the full measure of the truth.

For a fictitious example, let's take the world of RWBY. These ever present, unending creatures known as the Grimm are attracted by emotions like fear and terror, so mass panic can easily lay waste to entire settlements. Hence, a certain amount of censure is a necessity. The public simply can't handle certain truths, lest they panic and destroy themselves in the process. In this case, censure by higher powers is clearly a good thing.

So. Final, non-rambling question. As a rationalist, when do you consider it ok to lie to someone, with the express purpose of ensuring their happiness/survival. Are you just all facts, all the time and are always going to be that way? Do you like having your kids believe in Santa? Where's your line?

*** I know some people who really don't have a happy relationship with the truth. To them, inconvenient facts are attacks against their integrity and always being right is central to their worldview. As a result, trying to convince them of anything is a pointless endeavour which only makes them unhappy and aggressive. So I don't. They say something obviously false, I won't correct them, they come to a conclusion that makes no sense, I'll change the subject, they ask what I think about a thing they like such as energy healing, I'll deflect with humour.

I /was/ all facts all the time, but some people just don't care about the truth, so I don't bother burdening them with it. If it has been repeatedly shown that an action achieves nothing or is counter-productive, why bother continuing with it? I can't explain to these people how to have epistemological standards, and I can't convince them of something even so simple as maybe putting a lock onto a garage filled with thousands of pounds of stock when the garage next door was broken into, so why bother trying to convince them that gluten is fine unless you have celiacs?

Following that realisation, I mostly stopped trying to convince people of things that aren't important in real life. They can have whatever random views they like so long as they are not actively detrimental, and few things are actively detrimental to their own life. Maybe if they're making a life-changing decision, or ask for an honest opinion or they want to go into business in a field with an 80% failure rate I'll speak up but for the most part I'll leave em to it. Who cares if such people think that crystals have healing energy, or that burning sage and ringing a bell will cleanse their chakras (real examples)? So long as they're have a handle of the things they actually have to do to get through life they can be as wrong as they like.

I speak truth to people who care about truth. The rest I enjoy other experiences with, they know where to find me if they ever want to actually understand how things work.

So not full availability, but no lies either - just inform those who ask that this information is restricted, and why (unless that's restricted too).

This strikes me as a flawed argument. Knowledge's application is based on ethics. The same knowledge that weaponized the atom, has made deep space probes and and cheap base-load power.

No. People are best served by the full truth, as much as they can take, all the time. The only acceptable form of deception is to lie by omission, and even then, what you actually say should be true in spirit and not just in letter.

"You didn't ask" or "I prefer not to answer" are fine, but that's merely because we don't want a world in which everyone knows everyone else's uncomfortable secrets (eg: what kind of porn you watch, that you stole that one time). /Strongly consequential/ lies should be outed.

*** I've observed that if you graph danger versus knowledge, there's a peak in danger right around the middle of the graph. It's not accurate for everything of course, but it's generally true. Going by your situation (speaking as someone who knows nothing about RWBY), you don't want to tell the public because you can't explain the entire truth, because it's just not possible in a short enough period of time, but if you were able to, then everything would be okay and that wouldn't have to be kept in the dark. The real danger comes from that middle ground where they know that the Grimm are out there but they don't know enough to be able to not be fearful and terrified.

I consider it to be okay to lie to someone if I would be unable to bring them straight through the danger zone into the good zone in a short enough period of time, but when possible I try to be entirely truthful.

I don't have kids, but if I did, I wouldn't teach them about Santa (besides the "Other kids believe in this thing called Santa" part). I would give them the same gifts as if it were Santa, but I wouldn't lie to them about something like that, especially since it would be one more thing indoctrinating them into a culture of believing in things that aren't true, especially when half of the people involved /know/ that Santa isn't real.

*** As a practical matter it's obvious that lots of people are offended by the truth and have a moral issue with it. Many see the truth as a weapon you can wield against others. As such, I do think it would be immoral to push people to tell the truth always, while we still have people that might attack you if you say the wrong thing. It serves as a valuable social lubricant too. People far more easily accept an excuse like "I was stuck in traffic" than "I slept in." at work. The first step to making truth publicly accceptable would be making sure people didn't respond much more negatively to truth.

On Santa Claus, as a general matter likewise I see it as a negative. I don't want a child of mine to go up in front of class and tell everyone they know Santa is real because their father wouldn't lie to them. That could cause a lot of issues later on. The extremely negative reactions others have to telling children about santa are an issue with generally being truthful.

To summarise, I view lying as a much smaller issue than emotional or physical harm, and whilst people willfully offer emotional or physical harm for the wrong truths a general ban on deception isn't a good idea. In my personal life I try to surround myself with people who don't lash out at truth so that lying isn't necessary.

Medical truths are a much bigger issue. If someone believes magical crystals will heal their cancer and so refuses medical treatment. Simply promoting such a truth is actively harmful. I frequently confront such beliefs, social moores be damned, as it's a matter of life or death.

Of course, the fact that I value life over truth means that deceipt is a weapon I am willing to employ in that battle. If a potent authority of the crystal healing community who they would view as an authority recommends you get cancer treatment from a doctor when you have cancer I am fine citing them.

**** I like your view here. You're generally pro-truth, but not so obsessively pro-truth that you are unable to recognize that there are times when the truth isn't ideal, and times where outright deception and/or misinformation can be useful, from a humanitarian standpoint. Cliche as it may seem to say, some people just can't handle the truth.

An example of a deception I think has a positive impact is religion (Oh, what Kishoto? How can you say that?) Of course, not all religions are so, hell, not even all BRANCHES of a particular religion are good. But I've met people who've had positive impacts in their life due to religion. People who, without religion, seem like they would be worse off, and who've used the concocted falsehoods of Christianity (I'm sure it happens in other places, with other religions, but that's by far the most common one where I come from) to legitimately better their lives. There are tons of people who use religion as a supporting pillar for their stable, happy lives. Of course, there's obviously a flipside to this, as your particular branch's teachings may not be ideal for net human happiness, but I feel as if most people who participate in church (not just for show, but who honestly feel enlightened and "saved"), even those who hold idiotic, misguided beliefs about any number of things, live better as a result. Most branches of Christianity teaches that you should love all those around you, it's not your right to judge, be good, be moral, etc. Any atheist could agree that these are good ways to be, for a net gain on humanity's happiness. And I feel like, without religion, there are many people who would be worse people, both in context of themselves and how they treat others.

I believe Christianity is inherently false. I don't think that God exists, or at least, not in the way Christianity portrays him, as this infinite being of kindness, love, etc. I DO believe, though, that there are tons of people out there who, through following Christianity's teachings, are better people for it, because they honestly believe that they need to be.

There are Christians I've met who would probably be just as nice as agnostics or atheists. My post wasn't directed at them. I'm talking about Christians who've directly used their belief in God as the driving force behind enacting change in their life. Those people who talk about how they were doing activity X and practice Y before being convinced (whether by friends, family, a dream, etc.) to follow the Lord and they used their belief in him to actively improve their lives. It is in those situations, where I would say religion is the deciding influence, as opposed to just personality. (And yes, in theory, they could've found any number of things to act as their psychological support, but, for those who believe in him, having some big, always right, always loving eternal deity may be as strong a psychological anchor as they can get)

#+begin_quote
  What do you mean by "inherently false"?

I find many of Christianity's core tenets, specifically the ones that deal with factual things, as opposed to the vaguer, more moralistic teachings, to be false. While many of the stories (such as the great flood, the existence of Jesus) probably have roots in actual fact, the way they are presented is inherently false, as far as I can tell. Do I think there was a Jesus historically? Yes. We have proof of that. Do I think he was the actual son of God implanted into a woman via miracle? Who then returned from the dead? No. Was there a great flood? Sure, I can believe there was. Was there a great flood whereby all of the animals in the world at the time were fit onto a boat no larger than a few football fields, along with a man, his wife, and their 3 sons and wives? And all we have now descends from them alone? No sir. We don't have the genetic diversity for that. Same with Adam and Eve. I don't think any two humans, no matter how varied, can have the necessary gene pool to spawn the diverse world we live in now. And the bible's proposed timespan doesn't leave enough time for evolution to run the necessary course either.

That's completely incorrect: /by the nature of a proof assistant/, type-checking /is/ proof-checking. If the code type-checks, the theorem is proved, otherwise, it is not.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Bugs in proof-assistants happen, but are exceedingly rare, especially now that we're moving towards formally verified proof assistants proved correct in stronger proof assistants. Besides which, if you take very basic security precautions (ie: run the proof checker in userspace inside an encrypted, networkless VM on a (physically) networkless workstation with its operating system freshly installed, use tapes, floppies, or optical disks to move data), then even finding a bug in the proof-checker doesn't actually /get/ the AI anything. Besides which, then you can just demand /two/ proof scripts for /two/ different proof assistants, and let the conjunction law of probability shrink the likelihood of the proofs involving /ex falso quodlibet/ for you.

This is not /that/ difficult a problem, since you've constrained the AI to output things that can't do anything but what you've prespecified and explicitly requested, and you're only looking for a few bits of information. You can even make it write to a formally-verified filesystem on top of a formally-verified operating system, if you please.

This is one of the things I liked about /Steelheart/ by Brandon Sanderson. The main character is trying to kill Supervillains ("Epics"), and his main classification system boils down to "can they be killed by a sniper rifle?".

**** I suppose "take over the world" was badly put on my side as i see all responses thusfar mentioned that he doesn't want to specifically.

I mostly meant it in the sense of "win", or "put himself in a situation where no one could realistically threaten him". I presume he loses, or at the very least doesn't win, in the end even though such power would imply he shouldn't.

The argument of SHIELD\avengers\weaknesses\limitations etc. seems problematic for me because most of those would just as much be an issue for killing random people. the power described is the most effective when people aren't expecting you obviously, so solidifying his power in the world first and then doing whatever he wants sounds more likely then doing whatever he wants while ignoring said opposition.

Anyhow I guess my main issue so far, seeing as no one said this isn't the case, is that it sounds like the antagonist is just comically evil, and that doesn't sound like an interesting conflict to watch. Not sure I understand your point about the thematic element though, so maybe I am missing something..

** I've found an interesting connection between shamanism and Daniel Kahneman's theory of mind. When someone suffers the phenomena known as Shamanic Crisis, what is referred to as system 1 becomes corrupt and the shaman's task is to somehow neutralize the sickness. Unfortunately most aspiring shamans fail to recognize the illness or they incorporate it into their ontological framework. The ones who do overcome the illness become "full shamans" creating tiers within shamanism. More interestingly, it seems as though the structures responsible for system 1 become repurposed to some degree in a manner similar to the way a blind person's visual centers are by other cognitive faculties. Unfortunately, in the course of my study of shamanism I've only encountered a small fraction of self-proclaimed shamans who have "successfully" navigated "initiation."

The more reading I've done regarding shaman's sickness and shamanism in general the more it appears to be a discrete illness, though it seems to be mistaken as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

**** Shamanism is a blanket term which describes a widespread spiritual practice among various tribal and aboriginal peoples. A shaman through altered states of consciousness perceives and interacts with the spirit world and channels energies to practice divination and healing. The shaman usually serves as a community leader and intercedes in the spiritual world to offer counseling and cure maladies caused by malevolent spirits or entities.

Shamans are produced by lineage, apprenticeship, or are spontaneously chosen by the spirits. Being chosen by the spirits is referred to as a calling. Shaman's sickness or Crisis refers to the potential shaman being beset by a spiritual sickness which his task is to then cure, or remain permanently insane, or die. This process serves as an initiation. Tiers of shamans simply refer to language used by shamans to describe those who have survived initiation, the most powerful being those chosen by the spirits, followed by lineage and apprenticeship.

Those who haven't overcome initiation haven't successfully purged themselves of the illness and aren't regarded as shamans. Research is difficult because being able to tell who has suffered the illness is difficult, but very specific phenomena are referred to which definitely separate those who have from those who haven't. Furthermore, significant industry has spung up around people claiming to be shamans so that doesn't simplify things either.
