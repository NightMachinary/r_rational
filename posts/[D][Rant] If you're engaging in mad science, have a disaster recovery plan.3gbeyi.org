I watched two summer blockbusters today. Both had, as their climax, the destruction of information held by a large company with lots of resources. /In neither case should this have happened./

I understand the storytelling impulse that leads writers to make a plot like this. It allows you for a nice dramatic moment when the hero is reaching out towards the detonator with a single bloody hand. It makes the heroic sacrifice a lot more clean. It's efficient; it's a single goal for the climax.

/However .../

Pretty much every large company in the world keeps off-site backups. This is not only common sense, it's industry standard. If a significant fraction of the value of your company is held in the form of information, one of your top priorities is in protecting that information. Leave aside superheroes and lone-wolf terrorists for a moment, there are all sorts of mundane reasons to keep back-ups. In a lot of cases, it's even a legal requirement.

In Hollywood screenwriting, acknowledging this fact is inconvenient, so they don't do it. In rational fiction, please remember that the enemy is smart, and you don't have the luxury of pretending that all data is housed at a single point of failure (unless there's a really, really good reason). This goes triple if the enemy knows that someone is actively trying to destroy the data.

This is part of the terrible [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup]["No Plans, No Prototype, No Backup" trope]].

(The offending movies are both recent, and I can't name them without spoiling the climax; if you don't care about that, they were [[#s][]] and [[#s][]]. I sort of consider spoiling blockbusters to be pointless considering how formulaic they tend to be.)


** It's mad /engineering,/ people.

Mad /science/ is experimental setups which when described sound like a mix between the highly unethical practices found at a concentration camp, and [[http://www.tvtropes.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements][noodle implements]].

*** I've heard this said a bunch, and it's indeed a great line. That said, lots of mad scientists throw around phrases like "Using my theory of Kopelson Intrinsity I'm gonna blow up the sun with my death-ray," especially before it was too cliche. So, they were mad scientists at /some/ point at least, before they became mad engineers. The true nature of Dark Science: failing to publish!

  "This is not a mystical adventure. You are not the protagonist. You're seeing and doing things which are having profound emotional effects on you. You're being irrational. You're not thinking things through, you're not working things out. You're going on mental arithmetic instead of paper arithmetic and you're going on gut instinct instead of worked, peer-reviewed results. This is not good science."

  "But I'm right."

  "I don't care how right you think you are. I don't even care how right I think you are! I want to see a LaTeX-typeset paper from you. You need to show your working, because there are demons at work in your working."

edit: now that i think of it did the pym particle produce energy? i mean the hornet suit had HUD, jetpack, enhanced strength,and multi kilowatt lasers with no arc reactor in sight! should iron man be concerned?

*** The villain's entire motivation seemed to be that he was insane. They explain this in the movie as something something particles, which is an enormous cop out. It makes for an extraordinarily weak villain, even in comparison with the weak villains of other superhero movies, but it was still fun enough in spite of that.

I came away with the same impression after watching Captain America 2. Apparently Tony Stark isn't the only one who gets stupidly advanced tech. Pretty sure Iron Man suits or their equivalent could be manufactured by any number of people and groups in the Marvel universe, if it was consistent.

**** I think one of the main points made by the Iron Man sequence of movies was that the suit, in-and-of-itself, is just a commodity (both in its expendability, and in its ease of manufacture.) Rather, it's the suit /plus an autonomous AI/ (Jarvis), and the ability to scale that up, that makes for usefully-leveraged force.

Nevertheless, while his character relied a bit too much on him being insane another major part of his character was the desire to show up Pym and he wanted to foil his attempt to steal the suit and take it away in front of them.

** The recent Fantastic Four movie is a bit like this as well. At the end, everything blows up, but the Stock Evil Military Guys have had a small army working on building the McGuffin for five years or so - and yet somehow they're unable to make it work unless Reed Richards is standing around within fifty feet of it.

/Yes/, he and Doom were the main scientist and instigator of the project respectively, and neither would be around afterwards, but does this mean that a paperwork-obsessed organization like the US military would somehow not be able to get to within epsilon of where they were previously just from backups, and then throw a lot of really smart people at the problem?

Other people would have a much easier time tampering with a remote base than an easily visible building in the middle of the city.

Or, if you want to get a little more over the top, "The password is a brain scan of the main researcher thinking a certain sequence of thoughts while calm and unafraid."
