--------------

For those that did not see it, the last chapter's ending was an April Fools' joke. It has been since updated on the site with the actual ending. See below for prompts, VP ledger, and timeline update.

It appears the time has come to reveal myself -- I am the new QM! I've collaborated with Vecht on the last two chapters (though the lion's share of the work was certainly theirs) and am posting this to get this out to you all ASAP (and without violating the subreddit's rules).

You folks are certainly in for a ride.


** I might be reading too much into it , but the way she phrased that last request doest feel right.We definitely need their help though, so we will have to ask how and where to meet with the Lynx .

Going alone seems like it would offend them less, but would be a crazy risk, especially if it's relatively far. And I doubt they are idiotic enough to jeopardize negotiations during an apocalyptic scenario just for being offended. And we have to consider the possibility of the lynx secretly working for the enemy or thinking we are working for fae or something.

Definitely go with at least Link(doubt they would complain if we explain some of his status, ignoring the farore part because possession of triforce fragments is best kept secret).And more guards if possible.

Also, ask fi what was she saying before Zelda interrupted her in case it was something beyond the obvious .

And confirm Naibi's intentions via fi lie detection

I agree, it felt very "old sagey", like "you must do the thing, I am being intentionally vague even though I clearly have knowledge on this subject and appalled by your lack of knowledge".

I think we should try to avoid substantial offense by grilling her too much immediately, but try to get some more details along the journey. At present, we have no way of even knowing with any certainty that this is the Lynx's actual representative, do we?

** We've sort of have to go with her, right? The risk of betrayal can't be so high that the possibility of an alliance wouldn't be worth it.

I did notice that she avoided making any direct statements on whether we could actually trust her. If the existence of Zelda's honesty detector leaked somehow, avoiding direct statements would be one way to thwart it.

Where do you want Zelda to meet the Lynx?

How far away is that?

Do you promise safe travel to and from the meeting? (Fie lie detector please work!)

Anyone else have things they think Zelda should ask before going to see the Lynx?

*** These are solid. Maybe add some things like:

- What sorts of resistance should we expect on the journey, if any?
- What are the weather and conditions that we should expect?
- What sorts of supplies should we bring?
- Are there any supplies that we have available here that the Lynx might find useful, that we might offer as a gesture of friendship?
- Are there any traditional forms of etiquette we should be aware of when speaking with the Lynx?
- Do you know of any reliable way of identifying followers of our enemies that we could relay to our officers while we are gone?
- Do you have any existing knowledge of areas in which our people have been infiltrated by the enemy that we should act on before we leave for this journey?

Then maybe some things for during the journey:

- What can you tell us about the forces arrayed against us?
- What can you tell us about the Lightsworn?

Does Zelda go with Naibi...

...by herself?

...with Link?

...does Link go in her stead?

...do neither of them go? (If so, how do you respond to Naibi?)

What else do you wish to do?

--------------

Your previous Void Power total was 1668.

You were able to complete research on the Cane of Byrna reinvigoration effect. This required 769 additional VP.

Fi used a total of 174 VP to restore Link's magic during the course of his training. She did this 9 times.

Fi used a total of 363 VP reinvigorating Zelda during the course of her training. She did this 7 times.

Fi used a total of 136 VP on a combination of Ethereal Avatar and telepathic communication.

This update (chapters 9 and 10) spanned 6 days and you have earned 289 VP from Zelda and 406 VP from Link during that time.

You have earned 250 additional VP per day (out of a possible 250) as a bonus for enduring the hiatus and in place of the previous planning quality and brevity/conciseness incentives, for a total of 1500.

*You currently have 2421 Void Power.*

--------------

NOTE: For future updates, you can earn up to 250 additional VP per day. This is based on the following criteria:

- How well did you progress your goals?
- Did you take any risks, and did they pay off?
- How interesting was writing/worldbuilding for us?
- How frustrating was writing/worldbuilding for us?
- How much did we enjoy the discussion?
- How easy was it to figure out what players wanted to do?

It is currently the evening of 25th of Last Brisk.

*** Thanks for the update! I'm excited this is going again.

Some initial plan ideas:

- Go with Naibi. Bring Link. Discuss the viability of bringing a larger entourage with Naibi; if you can reasonably bring sheikah and guards, bring sheikah and guards.
- Ask questions (as discussed separately in the thread.)
- Check status with the fortress before leaving.
- Obtain relevant supplies before leaving.
- Obtain relevant gifts for the Lynx before leaving (if applicable based on discussion with Naibi).
- If Naibi has advice on detecting servants of the Exiled King, relay to trusted/vetted sheikah so they can begin detection efforts.
- Give standing orders to sheikah to scry on Zelda and Link periodically and exchange messages at specific check-in times if possible. Given the mana costs of messages, these should be kept to critical information.
- Have Link spend some time on figuring out how to safely reproduce his monster one-shotting Invigorate technique.
- Continue having Link and Zelda practice with each other. Try some training with handicaps; e.g. Link only uses magic, Zelda uses no magic, etc.
- SOP: Spend up to one tenth of our current VP on time-sensitive research related to old magic or Link's essence changes.

World questions for Fi to discuss with Zelda at some point, since they may be relevant to our assumptions about physics, the passage of time, and cosmere crossover stuff:

- How many seconds are there in a day on Zelda's world, using earth seconds as a measurement?"
- How strong is gravity on her planet, in earth "g" units?
- If this can't be answered directly, how fast do objects drop on Zelda's planet, using earth seconds as a mesurement?
- What is the average daytime temperature in Celsius in the area where Zelda is traveling? What's the average night time temperature?
- What's the length of a year on Zelda's planet?
- How many moons, if any, does her planet have?
- How many suns, if any, does her planet have?
- What's the size of Zelda's planet, in square miles?
- What is the closest other planet to her's? How distant is it?

It's possible I've missed some of this; I haven't checked the Discord updates or new website yet.

A note to my fellow questers:

7 restores totaling 363 VP means ~51 VP per restore for Zelda.

9 restores totaling 174 VP means ~19 VP per restore for Link.

I don't know what % of their mana pool Fi was using the restores at (that may have been in our old plans, but I don't have it handy). This is good for giving us a general idea of how costly a restore is right now, though, and maybe a general relative idea of their mana pools (assuming they are being restored at a similar mana threshold, Link might have around 40% of Zelda's mana pool?)

Also of note, it sounded like mana pool/threshold could increase with practice, so we'll see how that tracks with future mana restoration.

Also of note in regards to crossovers, I saw an interesting word in regard to Hylia: Creation. Given the crossover, this might mean she is - or was - the Creation shard, and contrasted with the Demise shard.

**** Shouldn't we explicitly bring a bit more guards than Link if possible?(I mean because bring link sounds like bring only link, but that sounds like a weird thing to do) .

I mean not sure what is expected of us, and I guess Link and Zelda are not helpless . But imagine if it's a trap and they attack us whith more people than we can handle and we just die/are captured.

Seems like an unnecessary risk. I guess if the lynx is camping near the castle whith a few soldiers it might be worth going only us as a show of trust. But otherwise I don't see any reason to only go whith link apart from the fact vetch's questions sugest it.

In another order of things I'm not sure\\
the secons question will work as it is because it references an ooc concept of seconds , we might need to frame the question whith the definition of second instead(something something caesium 133) same for temperature.

I phrased it that way because Fi appears to be familiar with our world's metrics based on previous discussions, but I'm okay with trying to figure out objective measurements if we think it's necessary.

** VERY good progress. Link and Zelda both need to learn more from each other in their specializations (combat and magic).

I am exceptionally glad we now have Reinvigorate. That's very helpful for keeping Zelda and Link both alive. Link's a fucking juggernaut to which the only limiter is his own body, which Reinvigorate helps a lot with. And Zelda's not conditioned enough to function in combat longer than 30 seconds, so keeping her fresh is even more important.

Link should consider the use of Bursts to redirect his momentum in ways that're impossible to predict.

*** From the blurb on the "About" page:

#+begin_quote
  Legacy of the Goddess is a rational-deconstruction take on the Legend of Zelda setting, as an AU cross with the cosmere setting, explored in the format of a Quest. Among other things, this work aims to be:

  Rational: Characters behave realistically and according to their motivations, not just because the plot, players, or QMs demand it. NPCs have agency, care about the world they inhabit, and will take action towards fulfilling their interests even where it conflicts with player intent. Magic behaves lawfully and has strict rules on what it can and cannot do.

  It is important to note that no character is immune to consequence and anyone can die. Destiny and prophecy are nowhere to be found here.

  Simulationist: Events, contested outcomes, magic, character abilities, etc., are modeled with statistics, physics, custom software, and (hopefully) robust game systems. We aim to keep QM fiat rulings minimal in scope and scale, with as many things as possible being in principle predictable and deterministic.

  Deconstructive: Canon story elements, tropes, and other material are used only as inspiration to reverse engineer a setting where these ideas are taken seriously and pushed to their logical conclusions. This has involved substantial world-building, crafting of fictional histories, etc.

  First and foremost, this work aims to be as internally and logically consistent as possible while still remaining true to the source material.
#+end_quote

And if I had to give an elevator pitch:

#+begin_quote
  Hylia is dead, and a malevolent force greater than she is working behind the scenes to unknown ends. The Kingdom of Hyrule, caught up in the center of this conflict, has been on the decline for thousands of years, and in the present day is now faced with annihilation.

  Can you save their world from its impending demise?
#+end_quote

Still on the fence? I would say read the [[https://chaossnek.com/Story?chapter=C1][first chapter]]. If that doesn't hook you, then you probably won't enjoy the story. (Do keep in mind there are two prologue chapters before that if you do decide to read.)

E: I should also note that since this is an AU, familiarity with the source material isn't strictly necessary to enjoy the story or to participate in the quest.
