*** Well she is pretty safe. Dead King will never see it coming, Catherine is just an up-and-coming meddler and the only two other people against her are an old, grizzled veteran and his girlfriend with a bow with nothing else to their name.

There realistically is nothing that can go wrong for her at this point. Right?

Well, now we know how she's going to die. With Black saying the words "I do not kneel."

Still, Malicia raising new lords/ladies of the Steppes is a pleasant surprise. Especially considering we don't know whether or not the Reforms have been restored yet. Surprising, considering it gives orcs leaders to rally around. And giving Wither Foramen is unexpected too; Thalassina seemed more likely, considering Foramen's proximity to the Eyries.

That would allow cathrine to ditch all ruling duties she hates and go exploring with Idrani & Masego to see all the miracles of the world, only gating back when someone is causing a mess in callow again.

**** Catherine has never been much of an explorer. What drives her is the need to fix things, and I'm not sure she can put that behind herself entirely in a happily-ever-after.

I do like the idea of her being like John Uskglass from Jonathan Strange, i.e. a nigh-mythical ruler who disappeared centuries ago, but who people still take as granted as being the rightful leader of the nation.

If I were to guess, I think that the Name that's growing around her is going to be something akin to Bard's. A hands-off enforcer who stays away for the most part, only showing up to nudge people here or there if it looks like a godling is starting to develop a bit too uppity for the common good.

After transitioning away from Winter, she's already taken a much more advisory role with the things going on.

** That was a beautiful ending.

Ime's warning and the conversation that followed it was convenient for me; it seemed clear that Amadeus had made a decision, and I had wondered from his wording if it was in fact to kneel and then stab Malicia in open court (like Cat when split into three by Akua). Thinking back, maybe Catherine also saw that meaning and was speaking against it, and him saying he wouldn't do that.

Once again... a beautiful ending. To this Book, that is, not to the whole story! That would be incredibly frustrating!

​

I am really looking forward to seeing how Amadeus fares while experiencing this /path not taken./

Ah, before I forget, Heroic Axiom 55 makes me curious about whether it applies to Vivienne or not, in which case Callow's position after the Liesse accords could be in trouble. Hm, Hanno too, though arguably he still has all his own powers.

Unrelated: Chapter 88 goes straight to Chapter 89, but in the Table of Contents to the side the 'Rise, Rise' Interlude from much earlier is displayed between them.

Edit: Ahh, and I forgot to write down how I loved the ending of the song about climbing the tower, after all those verses one by one about everything you have to sacrifice to get there.

Different focus, different personality, everything she might have been if the wretch had never happened, filtered through the Passenger's views. Being "in tune" with the passenger wouldn't have that effect without also making her more like Khepri. Or do you think that's where the manipulation aspect is coming from? I predict we'll have an interlude 20-30 chapters from now showing that Big V is the other member of breakthrough who's out of the picture according to Contessa's prediction and she's bem trapped in shard space since that night.

I think she's going to do something stupid and get on the Wardens bad side. Hell, she already has if they find out about it. I would argue the personality changes began prior to that night and she has just dropped some of the barriers allowing her to be more influenced by Waste-chan.

/Putatively/ more loyal. I have a feeling that if Amadeus can catch up, he might disprove it spectacularly. And then Malicia will have a possibly fatal problem at arm's reach...

Tyrant, however, did not. But he lives in my heart foravah !

Pilgrim did survive Book 5, but he did die too. Hmmmpf. Let's call it a draw.

I thought 2 of the Woe would die, but only one did (Archer).

Akua did not betray the Woe... or so I think ? So I got ~8 right out of 12. The audience's vote got 9 correct out of 12.
