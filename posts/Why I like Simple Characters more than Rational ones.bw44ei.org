(This is not intended to be an attack on rational fiction, just a discussion on the frequent types of character I see here. Also, I'm super sleepy and am probably not planning this out)

With a smart character, I can't trust him.

When a simple character says "I want to be a good and help people" the immediate thought I have is " What an idealistic lad. "

When a smart character says "I want to be good and help people" my reaction is " Strategic play there".

A simple guy wanting to be your friend is just because he wants to be your friend. A smart guy wanting to be your friend could be out to manipulate you for social/political gain and there's no way of separating a sociopath from a genuine friend

Unless it's actively a dumb decision to be your friend anymore, actively something that would hurt the guy more than help him, you can't trust a guy to be genuine

When a character does something good that ends up benefitting him? "All according to plan, huh? " Earns him an ally out of gratitude ? "Got the sucker" Says he prioritizes doing good things? "

It's only when he does something stupid, something that doesn't benefit him long term, that I see the character is acting on the way he really feels, the way his true values lie. The real him

Simply put

Tyrion, is more likeable than Varys.

Because the simpler character is acting the way he feels more than the smarter one, I see his true self I can understand him more, I can trust him more.

A test

If no one knew, and no one would punish them would a "good" rational or a "good" simple, impulsive character be more likely to betray a group of people they don't care about to achieve their ultimate ambitions?

I feel a rational "good" person would be more able to rationalize this decision.

"I could use my great power to do good in the future. Some bad now, more good later. "

A simple "good" guy would very well be more likely to reject it immediately on surface level because of his gut instinct. A Davos vs Stannis perspective. Or Griffith VS Guts perspective. Or

(Of course, some will say, "a rational character doesn't have to Spock" as always. I'm just saying, the rational character has to not be acting rationally for the trust to form)

**** Decisions are not made in isolation, you need to think about the far future and the unknown. If people only think about the immediate effects of their choices, they get suckered in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction][dollar auctions]]. Betraying your friends is bad, because being that kind of person will lead to behaviors that signal others to be wary of you. A really simple way to circumvent the issue you raised is to [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ethical_injunction][Promise]] not to betray your friends, and only make Promises you know can keep with near infinite confidence.

Why make such a promise? You're putting yourself at risk if such a scenario arises! But *if* that's very unlikely, and you gain a lot of trust by making the Promise, then it's worth the risk. This is an entirely 'rational' method of maintaining trustworthiness.

To make this clear: being idealistic prevents you from making immoral decisions, but has the benefit that people trust you easily. This is equivalent to making the Promise.

It's not clear at first glance, but being (not just acting) ethical is a very rational decision.

Average person knows 600 people[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3666355/#!po=71.3483][[3]]]. So 18 of them would be considered dark. Maybe 6 of them would have IQ > 115. Of those, how many would have a motive to pull something particularly on you? It's likely they don't know you that well, that leaves the question are you the /obvious/ victim type?

#+end_quote

I'mma need to see some math on that one.

3% would be Dark Triad people, for 18 out of 600. Call that Group A. ~15% would have an IQ higher than 115, for 90 out of 600. Call that Group B. There's nothing saying that that's a Venn Diagram with overlapping circles. Group A and Group B could share literally zero members in common, giving 0 out of 18 an IQ higher than 115. It could also be the case that the Group A circle is entirely contained within the Group B circle, giving 18 out of 18 an IQ higher than 115. I have no idea how you arrived at 6

+3%+ 15% of 18 is 2.7, so guessing 6 is saying that you think Dark Triad people are */more than twice as likely/* as "normal" people to have an IQ higher than 115. If I personally had to guess, I'd say 3, because I'm pretty sure they're */not/* significantly more likely than "normal" people to have an IQ higher than 115.

Which was sorta my point.

~98% of people have an IQ lower than 130, so presumably only ~2% of Cluster B types are going to be smarter than that. They're rare anyways, so most of the Cluster B types that most people interact with aren't going to be exceptionally intelligent.

I mean, hell, we could bypass all of that and say that if 3% of the general population is "dark" then only 3 to 5% of people in the "exceptionally intellectually gifted" category are "dark," so it's bigoted to assume "smart people" are untrustworthy.

But a simplification on my part I agree, as you said, we don't define all manipulative people as clinically dark.

I think you're confusing a rational character with one who is cunning or manipulative. You can have a character who is both rational and simple, as long as the author has set up their abilities and motivations that way. A rational character, for me, is simply one who acts believably, given the available information.

** Personally, I feel differently. When I observe a non-rational character make a sub-optimal decision because of a "gut feeling" or because it was the "right thing to do" even when others are on the line, I tend to disdain them. I can forgive a character attempting to make a smart decision and failing because "they don't have what it takes" or because their emotional reaction causes them to hesitate, however a character knowingly deciding not to select the best possible option they can makes me view them as selfish or stupid.

Going forward, I'm going to assume that when you refer to smart characters, you're referring to intelligent and rational characters.

#+end_quote

I agree that someone deciding to form a relationship with me because they enjoy my company is prefereable to them forming one because the possible material, social or political gains.

I disagree however, that only smart people could be out to manipulate you. Consider the case of the socially/politically ambitious character. For these characters, relationships are formed on a different basis than how much they enjoy your company. I think it's clear based on the high school experience of many and politics throughout history that you don't need to be smart or rational to be socially/politically ambitious.

​

#+begin_quote
  Unless it's actively a dumb decision to be your friend anymore, actively something that would hurt the guy more than help him, you can't trust a guy to be genuine
#+end_quote

Strongly disagree here. People form genuine friendships all the time that don't actively hurt them. The vast majority of the friends I've made have been incidental through, school, clubs, hobbies and work. I struggle to think of a single friend I've made that has whose friendship has been an actively negative influence to my goals or values.

​

#+begin_quote
  It's only when he does something stupid, something that doesn't benefit him long term, that I see the character is acting on the way he really feels, the way his true values lie. The real him.
#+end_quote

Here I agree that when someone acts counter to one their apparent interests, they reveal more of their "value hierarchy". However, once again, I strongly disagree that this can only be accomplished through stupid decisions.

Consider the case of the character who loves their family, learns that they only way to save the city is to sacrifice them, and does so. Assuming that sacrificing their family was the only way to save the city and that conclusion was reached rationally we learn that this character has some degree of utilitarian values. I think it's clear from this that it is hard decisions (decisions that run counter to some core value or come at a high cost) that demonstrate a characters values much more that stupid decisions (decisions that are reached through poor or no reasoning).

​

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think that it depends on the ambition. If it's a personal ambition then I think both characters being "good" characters are likely to reject the offer. Alternatively if the ambition is time sensitive and is related to lives of others or a similar "higher cause" then I agree that the "good" rational character would be much more likely to accept the offer than the "good" simple character.

​

*TL;DR:* I think that when you say "smart character" you mean "ambitious, means-end rationalist" and when you say simple character you mean "honest, moral character"

****** I'm gonna split the difference with you on this one:

There's nothing wrong with thinking of a dog as part of your family, any more than there would be something wrong with a Roman patriarch thinking of his slaves as people within his household. Thinking of dogs as just tools instead of living, feeling creatures is frankly a red flag about just how well someone can rationalize their cruelty to others. Similarly, the friendship of a dog is not particularly lesser than the friendship of a human who is mentally retarded enough that they will never be able to really understand you or the things you do. A simpleton's heart is no less sincere.

The difference between dogs and cuckoos is that dogs take care of themselves willingly and successfully without their "hosts." We've modified THEM to put up with OUR abusive shit and ask for seconds so that we can take advantage of them as living tools. They're the real world equivalent of a sci-fi servitor race.

That said, I draw the line at "fur baby" stuff. For most American parents, having their children outlive them is absolutely devastating. It often leads to suicide, particularly if there are no remaining children, and very often leads to the parents divorcing and going their own ways. Yet I can't think of any "fur parents" who divorced and killed themselves because their cat died. If their feelings don't actually equal a parent's feelings for their child they are just lying to themselves.

Bottom line, I agree that people need relationships with their actual peers to be healthy, but it's also healthy and virtuous to have compassion and affection for your lessers, even if they are dogs.

****** Using your words, let's develop a model. There are people who want conditional love, people who want unconditional love, and since they don't appear to be mutually exclusive, people who want both in various proportions. If what people are looking for is conditional love, then replacing human interaction with a pet would be unhealthy. People looking for unconditional love can often look for it in animals or humans, with little loss in quality. It's far more likely that these people who consider dogs their only friends are looking for unconditional love in the first place. It is also possible that these people want both conditional and unconditional love, but have nobody close to them that can give them the former, so their best relationship is their pet which can at least give them the latter.

This model matches your observations without necessitating unhealthy behaviour.

Along with that, your comment seems to assume:

- A rise in dog culture means a rise in /unhealthy/ dog culture
- The destruction of the American family, etc, is related to the rise of dog culture (healthy or otherwise) through a significant factor for both.
- That dogs evolved due to human interaction is a bad mark against them. Note: humans evolved for human interaction.
- That a dog's love is unconditional. Note: An abused dog will react differently. They have conditions, they're just different to human ones. In light of this detail, many humans are better at giving unconditional love (eg. good parents).

If you have arguments/resources to bridge these assumptions, then I would be interested to learn. Otherwise, they appear quite suspicious.

Since you have expressed that you prefer conditional love (me too), I understand your sentiments the matter. I consider this very much an end-value. Please understand that other people have unconditional love as an end-value. Their existence doesn't signify an end of civilisation brokenness, they've always been here.

There's this weird sort of asceticism I've observed in the rationalist movement - I'm half expecting the inevitable response from someone here who has replaced their diet with Soylent because it's more logical/rational than giving into culinary pleasures.

But, ultimately, I feel like life is about taking pleasures when it is appropriate/responsible/ethical/logical, and to me, having a chocolate bar or a nice meal, seeing my dog freak out when I take the leash out for a walk, snuggling on the couch with a romantic partner, etc, those are all ends and there's nothing... shameful about the fact that those ends are pleasurable only because of evolution hijacking my brain.

** I agree that you see more about a someone's character when you see what they are willing to give up.

If you can only make that out when "giving something up" means "blundering right into despite any losses" that's on you.

You can understand the values of a rational, intelligent agent by what they are optimizing for. Where do the steps lead? Do they care more about keeping the house, the car, or the dog in the divorce? It's not about whether they are doing something that benefits them in the long term, it's about what they even think "benefits" means.

You want to use Davos as an example of a simple man? You don't think he makes intelligent decisions about risk? Davos, the smuggler? A man who prospered in career that is entirely based on knowing what everyone else wants and thinks and expects and outmaneuvering them? Davos, who got his position as Stannis's hand by, when everyone was concerned with "How do I become king?" showing up to complicate things with "but actually, what SORT of king do you want to be, and would you rather be an unworthy king, or someone you think is worthy of being king but isn't?" Davos is a good man, and his intelligence is intuitive, but don't mistake him for a simpleton just because he's smart enough to effortlessly understand the nuances he concerns himself with.

Simple characters betray everyone around them all the time. They're just too blinded by their own tunnel vision to see it coming.

Robb Stark screwed over everyone dumb enough to trust him because he wanted to do the honorable thing and marry the woman he knocked up. Never mind that doing that meant he had to do the dishonorable thing and break his oaths, or that he would be saddling all his friends and supporters with a small kingdom's worth of enemies they had done nothing to earn themselves. I'm sure that his simple sincerity was a big comfort to all the families that had to find out their fathers and brothers and sons wouldn't be coming home, or who were slaughtered alongside everyone they'd ever known because his army was too dead to come protect his people, because Robb's simple idea of leadership didn't have room for the responsibilities leadership entails.

Simple people are not more trustworthy than intelligent ones. Not thinking ahead from different angles makes people LESS trustworthy, because even when you are sure of their intentions you can't be sure of their actions, and they're prone to forgetting the life-and-death concerns of their friends whenever another simple intention strikes them.

** You (We) are free to discuss anything man, as long as the topic suitable for the subreddit.

Now, onto the matter.

I think you missed the definition of rational character. It's always motive first, means later. Rational character always have goal in mind before making decision or taking action. If a rational character betray somebody, s/he does not need to make up excuse. Her/his conscience has always been clear. It's the goal that drive. Not momentary decision that need justification.

Characters motive and trait is analogous in some special way. For motive, it has been mentioned (in fiction) over and over again that some is more reliable than other. Greed is more trusted than philanthropy. Similarly, for trait, some is more reliable than other! Dumb is more transparent than smart. And obviously, consistent/determined characters is more trusted on their motive than the flighty ones. This is the reason why philanthropic dumb dude is about equal in trustiness compared to greedy smart guy: trait and motive reliability is about cancel each other.

Maybe you did not like rational character because they're rarely dumb. Indeed they never hold the much despised idiot ball. But we've seen them making wrong decision when ill-informed. Did it affect their trustworthiness?

Their motive may also be a problem. They're almost always for the betterment of life in general. At least among the defining works that's freely available. Their traits and motive had always been on the low side on the scale.

As a test I'd like to tell me your impression about the character named Zorian who is a smart dude (low in scale) with motive for survival (high in scale). Compare him with character named Alanic who's determined (high) with a motive for compassion/devotion (low). I would guess their trustiness is about equal.

​

This extends to protagonists--if one hopes to hope for a protagonist to do well, does it not become intensely frustrating to see them think thinks through on the surface level, then go no further? To see them walk right into self-defeating crises that you predicted earlier and you feel they could have if they had spent a little more time thinking through whether their choices made sense? Or worse, to make self-defeating choices and have those choices turn out fine for them every time because the Author is visibility twisting probability and the world's history to make it happen by coincidence (again, lucky coincidences every time)?

​

It can be fun that if you have two characters like this who have different goals and interact, it's easy to love-to-hate whichever of them isn't the protagonist because they're so hard to deal with(/trust/overcome).

It also depends on how immoral this betrayal is, does it result in somebody dying or is it something smaller like inconveniencing rich powerful people? Is inconveniencing a few rich innocent people ok if you help hundreds avoid starvation ? Is it ok if one rich innocent person dies for the same reason ?

​

As you can see this is a morality discussion, to some moral people hurting innocents is unacceptable, to others it would depend on the outcome the scale of the suffering you cause in exchange for the suffering it would avoid.

** I am in fact the opposite. I dropped the recently hyped up popular anime kimetsu no yaiba because he is a cardboard cutout of a 'simple' character. If he was anything more calculating or reserved I would of kept on watching.

** I think this is not really a separation between "simple" and "rational" as it is between a character with a deontologist and an utilitarian.

The deontologist has fixed values. If they say, "I want to be your friend!" you can trust them, because lying is one of their big no-nos, and they will NOT do it, because they stick to their rules.

The utilitarian weighs their values from time to time. They could say "I want to be your friend!" because they mean it, or because they think even lying is acceptable if a greater good is at stake. They have a very small set of ethical goals and decide everything else on the fly.

Ultimately, that's the problem with utilitarianism: it's not optimal for gaining other people's trust. Harry Potter Evans-Verres in HPMOR is definitely a utilitarian in most of what he does, and that's sort of provided the mould for many rational and rationalist characters after him. But his utilitarianism is exactly what gets in trouble with people in that story. I don't think it's impossible to have a rational character who's also a deontologist - in fact, in some ways, Hermione in HPMOR is just that, or at least provides that contrast. And this problem is exactly what often drives a wedge between them. I don't think the point of the story was ever "Harry is always right and Hermione is always wrong" with respect to that conflict. Harry gets very very close to complete disaster thanks to his excessive flexibility.

** #+begin_quote
  Tyrion, is more likeable than Varys.
#+end_quote

I beg to differ! Varys is the only character in GoT I remotely relate to as not HORRIBLY EVIL by real world standards. Especially after Tyrion murdered that prostitute (although tbf I haven't watched past holdedor)
