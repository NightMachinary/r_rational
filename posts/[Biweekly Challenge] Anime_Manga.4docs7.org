[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4booom/biweekly_challenge_precognition/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Precognition". The winner was [[/u/Roxolan]] with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4booom/biweekly_challenge_precognition/d1lkw2b]["The benefit of foresight"]]. Go read it now! Congratulations to [[/u/Roxolan]] on their first win!

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-time
   :END:
This time we're doing [[/u/kishoto]]'s choice (for getting five wins), "Anime/Manga". Any submission needs to be fanfiction of some anime and/or manga. I'm not going to be super-strict on definitions; manhwa or Korean webtoons are fine, as are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_English-language_manga][OEL]] manga. Same goes for anime. If you're picking something really obscure, a description or link to the source might be welcome. Other than that, go nuts.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, April 20th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time

   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be "Cat and Mouse". Give us a story about hunter and prey, with the option for role reversal. In some ways you might consider this a subset of the asymmetric warfare.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 4/20.* Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4dpsry/challenge_companion_animemanga/][can be found here]].


** *Yugiohnai! Episode I: The Heart of the Cards?*

Destiny has chosen him to /defend/ the world from the return of the shadow games, not to embrace it. Now Yugi Moto has to figure out how to obtain and destroy all of the Millenium items before they turn one of his favorite games into a ritual of dark magic that could destroy the world.

It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel! ...Or not!

*** Liked it, but reads very much like a prologue. Its 90% original with one shift to indicate teh more rational characterisation

I was suspecting the twist to be that the rational response is to take off the edant and never ever play again?

****** Hmm. This probably comes down to individual taste; for myself I liked the parody songs (to listen to), but didn't find them particularly amusing, whereas I was uncontrollably giggling from the first episode. Episodes much later I didn't find as laughter-inducing, but for some reason the Zero episodes I then uncontrollably laughed at again. I'm afraid I don't know how the majority react to different episodes.

(<tries to control expression, remembering the first episode's Exodia scene (the vocal delivery at least as much as the words themselves)>) (Ah, and for the 'Pharaoh's Throne' song, I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the 'because it makes me happy' scene... which in turn reminds me of 'Waah, waah, Baby Pharoah wants milk'... I should go to bed.)

(Another early-on scene found laughter-inducing was the 'must--risk--life--for cards!' sea scene.)

***** You could play the above as an example of [[#s][spoiler]]

But yeah, the series overall falls down pretty hard on characters acting sensibly from their own objectives, you can either make their own objectives and plots more complicated in such a way that it becomes justified or dodge them entirely, but then you go away from anything like canon very fast and its essentially orgiginal fiction.

Only managed to write chapter 1 in time, but I feel it stands fine on it's own with 2205 words. I do have entire plot outlined already, and intend to finish the rest of the story within a week or so hopefully, when I'll publish it all at once (Chapter 1 is likely 10-20% of the whole plot).

Fanfiction of From the New World/Shinsekai Yori. ([[http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori]]) It ended up being a lot longer than I initially thought, and I didn't get to finish it in time, so this is only part of it. I'll post the completed version in the days to come.

***** TBH, I haven't watched Detective Conan in forever but, if murders truly always happen right AFTER he arrives, with disturbing regularity, he should've been locked up by like episode 40, lol. Yay anime irrationality.

Petty, unrelated side note: It's so frustrating to watch an anime in which a single man (with a sword and body enhancement magic) defeated 70,000 soldiers (with a healthy amount of magic wielders mixed in there, although it should be noted his sword cuts through magic) yet still struggles against individual, not particularly skilled opponents later. The feeling reminds me of when, as a kid, I watched Pikachu beat a Dragonite in the Orange Islands arc, only to then be beat by a chikorita a few episodes later. Made me almost irrationally angry.

****** Is that Zero no Tsukaima?

(The [[http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/17p70/][inverse ninja law]] comes to mind.) It is indeed annoying when events are bent to serve an arbitrary narrative rather than building believably on past events/capabilities.
