Do you know Shadowrun? Its this weird dystopian High-tech High-Fantasy setting, where machinegun swinging Trolls are hired to perfom criminal activities against giant corporations. Quite fun. Just found out there is two really cheap really exploitable magical abilites:

Memory Displacement

An adept with Memory Displacement is capable of removing a specifically chosen group of memory from her brain for a predetermined length of time. Memory Displacement requires the user to concentrate for about 5 seconds to activate. During this time, the character has no way to recollect the memories in question. As a consequence, the memories cannot be recovered through Interrogation, Intimidation, or mental manipulation spells. No amount of questioning will reveal that the character ever possessed these memories. Once the predetermined amount of time has passed, the adept's memories return to normal.

The other is Eidetic Sense Memory.

An adept with this power has the ability to memorize all types of sensory input. Besides perfect photographic visual memory, the adept can recollect sounds, textures, tastes, and smells---and any combination thereof. The adept can recall these sensory impressions at will, and will remember who or what they have memorized in future encounters. The adept can also photo-read, greatly increasing their reading speed.

Fun and potential are enourmos. An undercover agent scans the entire (digitally available) database of coworkers/layouts etc, goes undercover with their OWN identity erased. They have a staggered rolling set of returning memories. They know nothing interesting except they really should go to the bathroom at 2 o'clock, except maybe that things are not running as smoothly as they should for Wage Accountant Henry Smith.

Sitting there stuff comes back; enough to check upon progress and plot new stuff, or even everything- you can just erase again, right? Leave the next steps in place. Thats as far as I have gotten.


** How many memory timeframes can be adjusted? If the memory recall is all or nothing, it can still be useful, but if it can be staged like a domino effect over time then it can conceivably be extraordinarily useful in the right scenario.

*** I think you could just do that with multiple instances of the spell running simultaneously, if there's no game rule against it.

**** I think the biggest weakness here is that it is probably impossible to activate memory displacement without having some memory of engaging memory displacement.

In other words you can hide information, but you can't hide that you are hiding information, if someone looks closely enough, (and if it has as much potential as it seems to have, someone's done it before), the might be able to detect memory displacement, either by the missing memories, or the memory of activating memory displacement.

Do you have any canon examples of how it works?

***** I'm not a shadowrun player, I'm afraid. But it seems to me that you could add in your memories of activating the memory displacement along with whatever other memories you wanted to displace, even though those are memories you're making at the time.

Failing that, I propose getting blind drunk and activating the displacement then so you don't remember activating it for reasons entirely unrelated to the displacement.

****** Ah, I found a different description in a sourcebook:

This adept power allows an adept to temporarily re- move selected memories for a predetermined amount of time with the use of a Complex Action. *While the memory is displaced, the adept has no recollection of the erasure or its contents,* rendering attempts at Intimidation, Inter- rogation, or mental manipulation spells ineffective, except for any physical trauma caused. Once the predetermined time has elapsed, the memory returns.

******* This sidesteps my proposed limitation then. With sufficient training and preparation, some very interesting things could potentially happen.

***** I found a quote by the original source book writer who states that it is impossible, even for spells suchs as mind probe, to have access to the memories, sind they are *gone*. See also further down the quote from the source book.

**** Yeah, that should be possible. Its not really a spell; this class of magic users focuses magic on their minds and bodies, so they have permanent physical or mental enhancements.

** If you play it like the BBEG lich from Two Year Emperor, you could topple governments. With perfect sleeper agents and multiple sets of forgotten memories.

** How to munchkin? You could do SCIENCE! With very few variables. By having same people go through all the tests with no memories of them.
