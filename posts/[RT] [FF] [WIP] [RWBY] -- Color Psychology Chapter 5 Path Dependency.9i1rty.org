** "Pure narcissism, in retrospect."

Great line. Shows that Ruby is unbelievably mature/cynical for her age.

** SB cross-post: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/color-psychology-rwby.681778/page-2#post-50963464]]

Two questions I'm curious about, for anyone kind enough to read and give feedback:

1. How do you like the short interludes from other perspectives at the end of a chapter?
2. How well did the combat scene work?

*** I like the interlude from Weiss certainly. In my mind, RWBY has four protagonists, so seeing POV of the others is great. Here, especially, it's great to see how Ruby looked from the outside to contrast with how she seems on the inside. (Ozpin is iffier, since he presumably Knows Too Much, but I still liked his interlude.)

Overall, I'm still loving this fic. I love the depiction of Ruby, the focus on her internal state, and I was laughing at the linear algebra lectures.

I did wonder, though, if Weiss was just joking when she said she would let Ruby finish dismantling the Grimm on her own, why did she... not step up to help once Ruby started? I wasn't sure if I was supposed to read this as Ruby being mega-awkward somehow, or as Weiss blaming Ruby's awkwardness for her own awkwardness. Well, it's fine if this is meant to a bit open-ended.

*** 1. I agree with [[/u/tjhance]]. I like these kind of interludes when they are from characters with similar knowledge to the protagonists, but not when they are from antagonists or characters that know more about what is going on than the protagonists.

2. The combat scene worked really well! Ruby's semblance is super interesting and having her meticulously analyse what is happening really conveys that everything is happening in slow motion.

*** 1. I liked the short interlude from Weiss; I had been wondering how she was reacting to Ruby. A common problem that I have with short interludes is that often times they reveal information that the protagonist doesn't have. While I'm aware of dramatic irony, I'm personally not a fan.

2. I think the combat worked well, I feel a balance was struck between an analytical fighter and a highly emotional one.

** I have to say, this is one of my new favorite things.

I think one of the interesting things that you have introduced is how self-image influences aura. I hope you how that influences a huntsman/huntswoman's education. I feel like a lot of effort would go into developing a more robust self-image that is capable of greater influence on reality. Further, if one's self-image dictates how one's aura restores your body, could you if you are capable of internalizing an ideal self, make oneself stronger, smarter, etc?

Anyway, so far you've made characters I enjoy and your world has got me thinking. Great start.

*** Thanks :)

It's going to be a little bit before we get out of the forest, but once we do, I have a /lot/ of fun stuff planned for Ruby's education.

*** I wonder if Emerald's semblance, with the rules of this universe, could be super OP. Both because she could boost her own self-image, and because she could boost the self-image of those around her. That's gonna need limiters.

** So her silver eye thing is presumably making her /very/ happy to kill Grimm, and probably scales with the strength/ age of the Grimm.

Weiss seems to have actually had lessons in not pointlessly being a brat, here, so it'll be interesting to see how that change affects team dynamics - especially her interactions with Blake.

The fight scene was /excellent/, and I usually dislike reading fight scenes enough that I'll just skim them. I think Ruby's perspective might be uniquely suited to detailed, written fight scenes, thanks to her mental speed-ups.

*** Some of the subtle foreshadowing will go over your head, and some of the dramatic irony may not land, but hopefully it will still be enjoyable even if you're only a little familiar with the show. (Actually, if you do end up reading it, I'd love to hear what's confusing from the perspective of a casual fan so I can fix it.)

** Why is it called Path Dependency? Just because of that scene where she's stuck in the air? Or did I miss something?

*** It was meant to refer to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence]] , specifically the fact that the next four years of your life ends up depending a lot on who you happen to meet first in the forest.

It was also supposed to be a bit of a pun on the fact that Ruby was trying to follow Jaune, i.e. the path she took would hopefully depend on the path he took.
