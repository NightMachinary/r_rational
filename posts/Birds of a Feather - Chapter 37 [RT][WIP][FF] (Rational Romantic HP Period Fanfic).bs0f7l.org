** This story was mentioned in a few monthly recommendations but I felt like it deserved its own post for those who don't check those out (which I recommend doing so).

The basic gist of the story is imagining if a girl like Hermione went to Hogwarts the same time Tom Riddle did. The story is excellently paced, written fantastically, all of the characters make believable choices and you get a lot of insight into the reasons and motives behind the two main characters. It's also extraordinarily immersive, really excellently done in a way that puts to shame the Grindlewald movies, you really get the sense of WW2 Britain.

We've spoken a lot on this subreddit about the difficulty of writing rational romance and I'd say this is at least a good example of two intelligent characters moving towards that. Obviously it's set some time ago so the attitudes are not the same as modern ones and Tom is not a moral bastion. All of the (not romantic) relationships between characters feel real.

In the background of the story the author is also creating a quite sensible universe without tearing everything up.

Even if you're not into romance I think that the vast majority of this subreddit's users will really enjoy this story. I will say that it's not too rationalist (just rational), there are some introspective moments but not quite the listing of biases and things like that.

*** I would add my recommendation as well and further note that for those who may be put off by the romance focus, the romance aspect of the story is often simmering in the background. The story also starts off really strong so you should know fairly early on if this is your type of story or not.

** This is good stuff; the author also had some /really/ great pieces of art for Worm and at least one awesome fanfic called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/][Tabloid]].

** The interesting thing about this fic is how the story focuses on examining the characters, but manages to work in a pretty solid background plot that not only maintains momentum, but also my interest.

I wouldn't call the characters in this fic that rational tbh. Everyone is given a clear, consistent motivation to justify their actions, but for all their strengths in making strong, logical choices, the story itself puts equal emphasis on their flaws and weaknesses. And I like that, since Tom Riddle in fanfiction is a tricky character to write, especially as a protagonist. He tends to waver in between two extremes - the too dumb to live Saturday morning cartoon villain Voldemort reminiscent of late stage Deathly Hallows canon, or the emotionless genocidebot from something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] which reads like a videogame fic, where the narrator has read the manual and gave himself all the power ups, and everyone but the narrator is an NPC to be used, manipulated, or steamrolled at will.

Riddle in this fic is clever and stupid at the same time, but most importantly, he feels like an actual human bean and not a plot device or videogame avatar. The chapters are hefty and could probably be shorter, and the first half is a lot of slow build up with more character interaction than genuine plot. However, the writing is excellent and the attention to detail in setting, historical accuracy, and character voice is enough to make up for it.

I guess it feels more rational in the way that history is rational.

  In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

Unlike your examples it doesn't feel like a video game, or a story, it feels very realistic. Apart from the innate tropiniess of him ending up being heir but that's nothing to do with character actions. Characters always seem internally motivated not saying things or doing things because it's a story. For me that's the biggest thing about rationality but I guess that's just semantics or the difference between rationalist and rational

Perhaps I've become used to thick chapters because of web serials in general but I've found the pacing to be very good. I read this chapter and never felt like I wanted it to be cut or chopped sooner but maybe I just enjoy the story too much.

**** I've noticed some romance cliches, eg. the hints to a possible love triangle, being mistaken for a couple, but it's relatively minor and set up in a way that doesn't scream that this is a story written on narrative convention over character decisions and consequences. The illusion of character agency is pretty well maintained, but I def agree that on the spectrum between rationalist and rational, this is on the rational end. There's a focus on intelligent characterization, but it's not written to be particularly intellectual, as in a story where readers are rewarded for predicting the twists ahead of time, based on prior established plot points.

Reading lite novels and Asian serials, I'm used to 1-3k bitesize chapters, so these chapters are lengthy in comparison. The chapters have enough plot progression that it doesn't feel like a drag, but comparing the prose to the sparse style of lite novels, most of the wordage comes from the introspection and descriptions. I don't mind slow payoffs, so it doesn't bother me hugely.
