You could characterize it as a combination of greed, willingness to put one's money where one's mouth is, disinterest in playing zero sum games, and the hope that correct arguments will prevail over incorrect ones if you take a leap of faith away from your current assumptions.

**** It seems as if the Orp-Orp are already aware of this concept, because

- they hope to spread Orp-Orp memes to pre-fledgling civilizations such as humans.
- they are creating ways to communicate more smoothly with humans.
- they don't seem to be intending to fight the humans.

***** They are certainly planning to spread the truth of Orp-Orp to the humans and have taken up human aesthetics to facilitate this goal, but I don't think they have any intention of doing it peacefully. The backup plan if things don't go their way is to kill all the humans with an RKV, and when one of the human memes starts convincing the captain they maybe he should rethink some things he responds by shooting himself in the head.

There's also the reference to the inevitable mass sterilization that all pre-uplift planets go through. I get the sense that the captain would not mind helping the humans with this if they still haven't done it when he get there, to convince the survivor that resisting the truth of Orp-Orp is pointless.

*** #+begin_quote
  He didn't seriously believe that the human meta meme was a threat to Orp-orp, of course, even assuming it actually existed. Orp-orp was the best meme cluster in the galaxy by a wide margin. If the meta meme was able to infect it, then it would be able to infect everything.

  That purely hypothetical situation might even wind up benefiting them. Sure, they'd lose a few good Orp-orps to rhetorical tricks if they began to tolerate heresies. But if the tradeoff was that the Niminian Heretics opened their receivers to the truth of Orp-orp, Orp-orp would spread through the galaxy at the speed of light.

  The risk, however slight, was that the Niminian Heretics would be immune to the meta meme. But the Niminian Heretics would be thinking the same thing he was, that this meta-meme offered an unprecedented opportunity to spread throughout the galaxy. They were so enmeshed in their web of lies, they would surely think their own meme cluster to be the strongest. If they fully understood the superiority of Orp-orp, they wouldn't be heretics, and so the truth of things would take them by surprise.
#+end_quote

Replace Niminian Heretics and Orp Orp with any two mutually contradictory human -isms and meme cluster with the word religion or ideology, as applicable, and replace meta meme with things like open discourse and free speech and and you'll understand what the meta meme is.

In my mind these aliens seem to have such a fragile view of memes/ideologies they might as well be freaking out about a German dude publishing /The Science of Logic/ in 1816.

*** Hmmm.

There are roles that need to be handled in society. /Someone/ needs to grow the food, handle the sewerage, index the libraries.

At the same time, any (major) role needs, at the very least, a Master and an Apprentice. The Master understands the ins and outs of the role, and is able to teach others; the Apprentice will become the Master once the Master is no longer able to fulfill the role (and then he needs to look for his own Apprentice). Furthermore, each Master works best if he has peers; people to discuss his issues with, preferably people who understand those issues; so it seems that most roles should have multiple Masters, perhaps with different specialities, along with the relevant Apprentices.

Now, there are some parts of society that scale with the size of the society. For instance, the percentage of people involved in growing food to feed the society is, well, dependant on technology; but it's a /percentage/. The number of people doing Science and making new discoveries is different - the percentage isn't important. Only the raw number of scientists. If you have one Dunbar's Number society, then you have a maximum number of scientists; two such societies mean twice the Scientists and perhaps one-and-a-half times the Scientific Progress. Even if the other issues with going down to a Dunbar's Number society are resolved, it is going to /smash/ scientific progress.

***** I also question the use of Dunbar's Number. In fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that a population of only Dunbar's Number of people (150, apparently) wouldn't even be long-term sustainable on a genetic basis.

Also, there are doubtless more than 150 different jobs. You could probably have a population of a couple of thousand and still have very minimal overlap.

At the same time... psychological uniqueness is almost guaranteed, even in our current world, to my mind. Pick any two people and you will begin to /very quickly/ find psychological differences between them, because psychology has a /lot/ of variables to mess with.

I've been wondering what the mentioned memetic hazards are. I think the Hedonic Pump is things like the lottery? Thinking about makes you feel good even though it's irrational to think you'd win, therefore yo think about it more and feel more good.

The other one though, " A consumptive game-theoretic entity," Pascal's Wager maybe?

*** I'm pretty sure it's referencing religion or god. An entity that "consumes" all of your attention via prayer.

I doubt that the Orp-Orp meme cluster would be very tolerant of any competitors for its hosts and considering the throwaway line about RKVing "surviving cultists worshiping a tangle of bad math in the ruins of their old civilization"? Religion is definitely an enemy to be eliminated.

*** It was primed to notice the metameme as a threat and a danger, self-inspecting as he considered it, whereas the scientists had passed through its eye and been convinced of it before they saw the danger, and were fully convinced. Even so, the local response to contamination was to escalate up the chain.

The captain is at the top, he can't escalate further, and he shoots himself because he can't un-think the thoughts.
