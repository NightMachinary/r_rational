** Feel inclined to mention that Zero HP Lovecraft is an alt-right white supremacist, and all their stories have the undertones of that in them.

That being sajd, I just don't like this one very much. [[https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2019/09/28/the-green-new-deal/][the green new deal]] (TW: suicide) or [[https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/the-gig-economy-2/][The Gig Economy]] were both better.

Mind linking some text that proves this? If you do, I'll add an objectionable politics warning if I link stories by this author in the future.

They are a white supremacist neo-Nazi. Because of your attempt to downplay the politics of this person, I'm assuming bad faith and am /very/ wary of genuinely considering any of your points.

************* You're being very combative. I find it hard to believe you didn't know the author's views when the very top comment says it, and the comment below posts multiple sources proving it. As such, while I could debate what you're saying and point out the strawman you've set up, I'm not going to. You've had your chance, I'm no longer assuming good faith on your part, and we're done here.

************** I'll bite. What's bad about misgendering fictional characters? Or was that a misrepresentation of what the guy did?

*************** Oh, misgendering fictional characters could be easily explained away. The character who did so was ignorant, or bigoted, perhaps. But in With This Ring, the author didn't just misgender within the narrative---he also expressed transphobia as a person, claimed that the decision to misgender was the correct one, and then went on to make an attack helicopter joke. Like, trans people might want to know that before reading that story, that's all. And in the Chinese novel we have no /direct/ evidence that the author is transphobic, but we do have a lot of evidence that points that way. The culture is transphobic, the main character makes fun of trans characters every so often, and everyone kinds of treats them as a joke within the narrative. Whether or not the author is transphobic is irrelevant there, because the point of the Author Politics tags was to warn people who care about that kind of thing. A trans person might, depending on how heavily they suffer from gender dysphoria, feel /physically ill/ at reading a work where trans people are treated that way.

********** I didn't read anything particularly racist in the very few tweets I read, but it was all nauseatingly Nazi-like. I'll buy that this guy is a fascist and probably a Nazi.

I've seen nothing about the others on your supposed list, though. Where is it, that I may make my own judgments?

*** The Gig Economy reminds me of [[https://www.inkitt.com/AlexBeyman][Alex Beyman]]'s [[https://www.inkitt.com/stories/horror/35463][Persistence of Vision]] with the idea of life appearing in bizzare substrates and mediums which gives it a somewhat Lovecraftian vibes.

After reading all three stories by Zero HP Lovecraft, I think that Alex Beyman shares a lot in common with Zero HP Lovecraft. Both of them write stories thinking about the future with lovecraftian themes and how memes can be dangerously effective on the individual. Zero thinks about the market as a memetic danger, while Alex does the same thing but with religion in [[https://www.inkitt.com/stories/horror/7465][Triangle Opportunity]].

**** He's not a white supremacist (I guess he takes advantage of some edgy racial humor but it isn't central at all to his thought) and he's not alt right. Def a hard right traditionalist tho. I enjoy his tweets as something of a Laschian, there's definitely stuff one with leftist tendencies (as I still have) can relate to.

*** true, probably should've added a disclaimer to that affect myself. I think this one is still pretty good separate from the author's awful politics, but certainly not for everyone. I'm a big fan of transhumanist kink stories like this, Metamorphosis of the Prime Intellect, etc

Also, please explain who the true bigot is in that situation.
