** I /love/ the Ellimist too, very in-keeping with "winning with the lightest possible touch" theme of canon. Only because Erik prevents violence do the two yeerks who are the key to memetically infecting the rest of the yeerks with kindness surviving. Only because Marcos dad was the type who needed a Yeerk was any sort of alliance possible. Only because Ax is isolated does the alliance generate a second Andelite-Yeerk merge capable of destroying Alloran-Esplin's hegemony. The way it was set up, it /looked/ like the Ellimist was saving them from loss, but really they've been handed a clear way to win.

I'm a bit puzzled by Cassie's death, though. I'm not sure how Cassie dying helped this outcome, and I bet he could have prevented that with some subtle manipulations without additional trouble. Do the rules of the game somehow necessitate her to choose a self-sacrificing path? Perhaps Cassie would've beat Ax to this decision and that would have ruined things.

*** There are /two/ gods, and they're both pulling the /same strings./ In canon, there was a black team and a white team ... certain pawns "belonged" to one or the other.

That never seemed realistic to me, so I'm having both gods play with the same pieces, and all the pieces are grey.

**** Hm. So that must mean Cassie's death is /important/, if Crayak spent whatever game points he had just for eliminating her. Presumably this pushes things towards making Jake more militant, the rest of the team not trusting Yeerkified Ax, or something. But I imagine it's going to be difficult, as a writer, to explain why Cassie's death was important since we'll never get to see the counterfactual world where it wasn't.

Do we know that this is the Ellimist and not Crayak. It could be setting them up for a peaceful win... or it could be Crayak setting up the birth of the One [[#s][spoilers epilogue of last Animorph book]]. [[#s][Possible spoilers about things that may go wrong...]]

** ...OATMEAL? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

EDIT: Okay, read it through. Feedback so far:

- Why thank you for the shout out. Though I'll point out it spelled Couteau*Bleu*. Do not taint my silly french pseudonym with dirty english words, please :p

- I feel the inclusion of the oatmeal trick is a bit strange. For one, it might seem to come out of absolutely nowhere to people unfamiliar with canon (or even people who skimmed that particular book). Plus, it kind of... does come from absolutely nowhere. There have been no mentions or hints so far that any alternative source of yeerk nutrition, even portable Kandronas, existed. Besides, how did they learn about the possiblity? Did one their yeerks forget his three-day deadline and go "Um, I guess it's a good thing I ate this extremely specific brand of Kellogg's this morning!". Also, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ9C1VfuWok][DRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGS]]!!!!!!!

- "Right, I remember that bit about a robot army stopping the Holocaust-"... That made me laugh :p Though it does raise a lot of questions about what the Cheys were doing during, well any major war.

- I like that moment when the yeerks hear Erek proposing to send them back to V3 and start going completely off-track. The little we've seen so far of yeerks was very constrained, we saw them take very little initiative. It's nice that they have occasions to do so now.

- "Screw the larger war!" That's right man, go rogue! Do your own thing! Create your path! Forget conventions, forget hierarchy, forget your training, do what comes to mind!

- Ax decides that his people was entirely at fault for the yeerk war, and commits major treason in what seems to be a few days. That's a bit rash, and really not something you should decide unilaterally. Marco or Rachel could probably have pointed out that, so far, they only have the yeerk version of the events, and no way to verify their claims or ask for Seerow's version.

- And Marco's dad is a voluntary controller now. It's almost as if cosmic forces had noticed Marco was about to get his father back, and said "No. You shall angst so more." Which... well, it's Animorphs. Marco's life is suffering and angst. Man, now I can't wait until V1 shows up.

- Ax berating himself for not listening in school/training is a nice nod to canon. The book that comes to mind is the one with the Sario Rip, where Ax goes <So, you see, the simultaneous firing of our weapons took us across space and time to this other location of your planet.> "How... does that make any sense?" <Well, in fact, there is a perfectly simple explanation, which is that... to be honest, I don't remember. I was mostly paying attention to a pretty girl when they covered the subject>

- I don't know if anyone in the group has thought it through, but V3 only has minor responsibility for Astran's death. Most of it was probably already dead by the time the asteroid hit, killed by the pool's explosion. The kids have the excuse of not completely knowing what they were doing, though.

- Garett's "If they all.. um... learned the power of friendship" made me chuckle.

- In an alternate universe, space-faring humans discovered the yeerks, and instead of hoarding their knowledge, they gave them access to Wikipedia. Then everything went fine. Remember to donate to Wikipedia, for the sake of human kind.

- The yeerks say there's never been a murder in their entire history. I'm not sure that makes sense. I mean, yeerk coalescions seem to live in unique circumstances, but there must have been occasions where waging war on the pool next door was a valid option? If you need resources and you can reproduce, at some point the resources become scarce and you have to find some way to allocate them. Inside one pool, that's easy, because the overmind can decide how to split resources between neurons (though there might be 'tumor' yeerks who defect anyway). But between pools, as soon as the resources become scarce, there should be coordination problems, prisoner's dilemmas, and overall times a pool decides that cheating and stealing the other pool's resources is better.

- Which brings another question... how do coalescions reproduce? I imagine that, for a single coalescion, producing more yeerk mass would a process of eating and digesting nutrients and turning them into neurons, but what about macro reproduction? Does a coalescion split in two, then use gedds or other animals as transit to transport one of the halves to another pool?

- I wonder if at some point, someone will consider calling Cassie's ghost for advice on how to handle the whole "yeerks want to be nice" thing.

- How big is the Z-space rift separating Earth from everything? Because if the yeerks can travel between stars in a few days, but need several months to go through it and even longer to go around it, it must be pretty huge.

- ... Wait a sec, what happened to Ax's earplugs?

- I hope that, in future chapters, we get to see yeerks talk with the kids about moral issues and war-related dilemmas, and explore those issues deeper than canon did. Like Yudowsky said, there's a lot more to be said about ethics than "sometimes things are complicated" and "most people are neither pure good nor pure evil", but canon Animorphs mostly stopped at that. I'd be interested if the kids bounced more ideas at the yeerks, and talked about things like prisoner dilemmas, multipolar traps, the ethics of killing innocents in a war, utilitarianism in general, etc. This stuff will be important to how the kids move forward anyway.

And I think I'm done for now. Uh, that was longer than expected.

*** Ack ack *bleu* see, this is where I start to feel Axious, because I /remember/ being very specific about not getting that wrong, and yet.

- The oatmeal (on top of the asteroid) is part of my ongoing campaign to get the readers to feel the whole "the enemy is also smart" thing. My hope was that it /would/ startle/come out of nowhere, but that after thinking for ten seconds, readers would be like, oh, of course, /I'd/ be working on a Kandrona substitute, wouldn't I, especially once I started having access to human chemists and nutritionists, the bionutrients available on Earth are incredibly diverse ... man, these guys are doing their homework ... uh-oh."
- re: Ax committing major treason and acting unilaterally, yup. Almost like the guy was unstable or something. It's been interesting to see the range of reactions to his choice, with some finding it incredibly beautiful and positive, and others on the edge of their seats with apprehension.
- There's never been a murder in Yeerk history because it's almost always easier to just eat/subsume the other pool. And yeah, in the process, "your" own views change, but this is just How The World Works for the Yeerks, and the idea of maintaining and defending a certain set of opinions (soldier mindset) versus being open and curious and just seeing what's out there (scout mindset) is one the Yeerks would find deeply weird. If you and I are pools, and you and I are competing for resources, you and I become one and then allocate resources sensibly. It helps that Yeerk exchange between pools is the route for both sexual and memetic reproduction, making /not/ doing that extremely unappealing.
- Pools reproduce like beehives. The masses grow through the consumption of nutrients in the water (plankton, algae), and when they get too big, they send out hosts in all directions in search of a new un- or underinhabited body of water. Once they find one, a whole bunch of hosts all go there and unload at once, and a new mass forms.
- The earplugs can be turned on and off (plus one for noticing; I was falling asleep last night and was like CRAP I didn't make that explicit; oh, well, no one will think of it; CRAP what about chaosmosis and CouteauBleu).
- I think there will be more discussions of ethics, although without Cassie to pull the pendulum in one direction, it's not clear where the group will end up. I had a sentence in here that I struck, for awkwardness, where Ax basically thought, "Yep, this war is largely our fault and we definitely bear the responsibility for investigating the possibility of peace, AND ALSO we're still going to kill the fuck out of them as long as we're in open warfare, don't think I'm going soft or nothin'."

I think that portable Kandronas would have made more sense. Or something like "What, you really thought we only had one Kandrona on earth? We have, like, ten of those in the mothership just in case one malfunctions". While reading this version, I mostly ignored the tactical implications and just went "Really? OATMEAL?", and I got the impression that all the kids except Ax did the same.

I don't know. It's not like we've ever seen hive-mind alien species, so we're being as speculative as it gets, but I feel the "aggressive genes dominate and spread, passive genes disappear" dynamic would still be there, so hives would still want to defend themselves. In particular:

#+begin_quote
  If you and I are pools, and you and I are competing for resources, you and I become one and then allocate resources sensibly.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but I can choose to fuse with you in a way that is mostly me and not a lot of you, instead of dividing food/hosts/whatever equally. If I keep defecting and others keep cooperating, I do the same over and over again and cover the planet in "me", and the end result is a planet covered in defectors anyway. There is the mitigating factor that hives have an easier time checking for the other's intentions (capture the other hive's scouts and read their minds), so cooperation is easier to enforce, which means yeerks will have a greater tendency towards cooperation than other species. But there are still conflicts.

Although, whatever the context, "get eaten by another hive" is still super-different from "get erased by a friendly meteor strike to the face", so it's much more shocking to yeerks when the second one happens.

Mhh nope, try again :p There's no reason the engineers designing those earplugs would put an off-switch in them, especially since it would make Andalites vulnerable to torture-then-infestation if yeerks ever figure it out.

***** Eh, remember, in this AU Kandrona is something like a complex protein, not an energy ray. The Yeerks will obviously be able to synthesize and manufacture it eventually, but they only discovered space like four years ago and just got off their planet two years ago. It's on the list (high on the list, even), but it's not something they've managed to do yet, in part because from a Yeerk perspective, who would /want/ to stay out of the coalescion for long periods of time?

As for the earplugs---there's a line of telepathically-activated technologies that the Andalites have that are theoretically Yeerk-proof. Think about the self-destruct on the Iscafil device, which the kids could trigger even if they got infested. The part of Ax that can turn the earplugs on and off is deep, deep within his personality, tied to his motive will in a way that the Yeerks can't manipulate.

That's still a HUGE GAPING HOLE, because there are other ways to manipulate a person besides raw compulsion. But it's a HUGE GAPING HOLE the Andalites haven't found, yet, because all of their anti-infestation tech is largely untested. Again, the war is young, and thus far only Alloran's been taken---they haven't seen the sort of mind-twisting that (e.g.) Ramsay pulled on Theon, which would be sufficient to cause them to do whatever you wanted "of their own free choice."

Considering tweaks re: murder; perhaps I can 80/20 it by just saying that murder is extremely rare, hasn't happened since the Compact, all pools unite to destroy murderers, etc.

** OHhhh my god I need a moment holy shit. Wow. DAAAAAAAAAMN.

Okay. Okay. I'm good. Phew.

- YPM. Aftran, not the individual but the /whole/ - oh that is absolutely brilliant. C/E has been pulling some serious strings here.

- Controller-Ax? Whoa, left field, but you made it work. You also foreshadowed it nicely several chapters ago with the lack of /eib/. Seems like a mix of depression and anxiety, in regards to his behavior. Even got the compulsive eating thing going on (I started laughing the minute I saw cinnamon buns).

- Peter Levy? Also a massive surprise, but the explanation of depression/alcoholism and how Essak has been helping him definitely works. You nicely foreshadowed how much a Yeerk is capable of doing behind-the-scenes to a human brain as well, when Rachel was running Illim back to the pool. Poor Illim.

- Overall I feel this revelation regarding Aftran's remaining 2 members is really really well done. Lots of hints during previous chapters where the revelations taking place in this one aren't completely 'whoa, where did that come from?' but at the same time not blindingly obvious. More 'ooooooh, now it all makes sense and the puzzle pieces fit'.

- Elfangor was right. They did (unintentionally) sacrifice a ton of Yeerks to get another Andalite host...

- I'm really interested in the Yeerks NOT being 'one size fits all'. Makes sense, too.

- Are the remaining 2 parts of Aftran going to re-establish a new pool? Will Temrash and Essak attempt to find a body of water where they can have a very small and sad coalescion?

- How much of a coalescion could you feasibly stuff into a skull? For example, could Temrash and Essak form a new Yeerk that's dedicated solely to controlling Ax? Peter would be sad, of course. In more ways than one.

- Earplugs and oatmeal insanity has already been covered. I'm hoping that the oatmeal does not cause insanity though.

- Gonna need more elaboration on why the Yeerk morph didn't work. Does that mean that they were trying to morph an /entire hivemind/? Or was it that they didn't have a proper snapshot of the whole? Which means...if they acquire both Essak and Temrash, can they feasibly morph Aftran now that she's small enough?

- With the way the pocket dimension works, how long can a Yeerk stay morphed for?

- Holy crap, imagine if someone went /nothlit/ as the Aftran hive mind...that'd put an entire pool in the debt of the Animorphs...and if anyone were to do that, Cassie would be the one. But she's dead. Welp.

- If I wasn't already convinced of Garrett having ASD in the previous chapters, this cinches it. I love how he's the one who best teaches Ax how to read human expressions, as he's had to puzzle it through his entire life.

- I love the metaphor that Ax cannot see the path during his ritual of starlight. He tries, but cannot, and ultimately must make this decision while being completely alone and in the dark.

Okay. I think that covers it. We good. AAAAGH CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT UPDATE.

*** The remaining two parts of Aftran could definitely form a coalescion, but there isn't enough mass for whatever HANDWAVING biological stuff needs to go on to produce Kandrona.

We know that you can stuff at least two Yeerks into a human skull, because of the resonance/self-morph stuff (when Jake's wearing his morph armor, there's Jake-artificial-yeerk controlling a brain that's also got whoever-artificial-yeerk from the acquisition process). Unknown beyond that. It's heavily implied that Esplin is "more" than other Yeerks, perhaps on the order of 3-4x a human-Controlling Yeerk, given that Temrash isn't big enough to actually Control Ax (unless he was straight-up lying).

**** I just thought of some more questions:

- The Yeerk that Tobias has in DC should be from Aftran. Essak and Temrash are slightly less alone, if Tobias can retrieve it.

- With all the discussion on how Kandrona is produced, would the ability to morph a coalescion allow them to get around the oatmeal reliance by using that morph as a source of Kandrona?

- ..which leads to the next question, if tissue/limbs are removed from a morph, what happens upon demorph?

You could reintroduce the idea that Kandrona rays are a thing. Yerk tissue can act as a z-space antennae/control node for morphing to work. Kandrona could have some weird z-space component that lets the massive pool get a special type of energy necessary for the metabolic processes that produce the complex molecule set that the Yerk's need. Or it could just be regular EM spectrum, just at narrow bands of particular frequencies and the pool mass is just doing a photosynthesis-like process. You would still need special equipment to get the right frequencies at the right energy, but it wouldn't be impossible. You could keep the idea that they need the pool mass.

******** Photosynthesis idea works great actually. What you could go with is that the EM/radiation of the Kandrona is necessary to synthesize the vitamin(s) needed for Yeerk health (they're vital, after all). Maybe the Yeerks call both the EM frequency/radiation and the vitamin 'Kandrona'. Makes sense, why not. Kandrona for Yeerks is as important as Vitamin C for humans, and the fugue is like scurvy turned up to 11. Hivemind needs to dedicate a select chunk of tissue for creating this Kandrona vitamin, so 2 Yeerks alone definitely cannot do this. Kandrona being a vitamin is also consistent with the way V3 is cannibalizing other Yeerks.

Yeerk tissue can alter or weaken the blood brain barrier (BBB) allowing select metabolites through. The particular oatmeal brand could have a higher amount of ginger and maple flavorings compared to its competitors (TWICE the flavor! selling point). The metabolites of the digested flavor molecules either directly function as the vitamin(s) required, or are synthesized into said vitamins. Pray that Andalite livers work the same way/similarly as human ones. In short, the Yeerks are swapping reliance on the photosynthetic portion of the hivemind (maybe it has a special name?) to reliance on the host's liver. Would lend some interesting support to this whole symbiosis deal.

Not even necessary; it could be a unique quirk of human biology that allows the conversion to take place. After all, 7 billion host bodies with no need for the pool? Perfect.

***** "With the way the pocket dimension works" ... if a single Yeerk somehow got the morphing power (not clear how that works if it's constantly in-and-out of a pool, being dissolved and reformulated, but pretty clear that it /would/ work in the case of someone like Esplin), it could stay morphed for a /looooooooooong/ time. It's not strictly proportional to weight, since there's a sort of baseline "activation energy" for making a pocket dimension in the first place, but think something like demorphing once every day and a half. And given the way that puts one's "natural body" in stasis, it's also a pretty solid replacement for Kandrona, since it takes many, many, many morphs for you to use up three full days in the minutes in between.

Note that, if Ax's hypothesis is correct, you wouldn't restore the Aftran mind by going nothlit as the Aftran coalescion---that mind, in its entirety, wasn't properly scanned in the first place.

Thanks for noticing re: Garrett. This is the point at which I'd stereotypically say something like, I had a best friend or a little brother who was autistic, and I wanted to put him in my story, but---nope. I just really like the character, and I'm working hard to do him right.

** So it occurs to me that back in the Aftran interlude, Aftran the pool was "farming" compassion from Aftran the Yeerk. Put the Yeerk in the kid, let it develop a sense of love, and during the coelascion strip those developed neuron threads out and distribute them elsewhere, bringing the average compassion of the entire pool up somewhat.

Until the farm burned down, so to speak.

I don't quite have a single coherent review but a bunch of individual thoughts...

- Love your clever reuse of bits of canon...

  - Aftran being the one to develop the Yerk peace movement, giving the peace movement a much more thought out development than canon.
  - This is the darkest interpretation of Cinnamon Buns I have seen yet. Seeing the way you show, it makes me wonder why canon treated alien super stimulus as a joke and source of tourism instead of a compulsive hedonistic indulgence.
  - The Oatmeal thing is much more logically used than in canon... the yerk pool was cautiously testing it for safety. I note that they didn't quite say they finished testing it... Also, as I am familiar with canon it seems reasonable, but for someone unfamiliar with canon Oatmeal replacing Kandrona may seem like it is coming out of left field a bit.

- Good job making Ax's mind actually seem alien. Makes it awkward to read in a few places, but overall I think the effect achieved is worth it.

- Is the reason for 3 shredders not one so that the user of the survival kit can improvise a Sario rip? Seemed like an odd detail that stuck out to me.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4cjwxu/ranimorphs_18_interlude_3/d1jqdqq][I totally called it about Visser 3]], well... at least partially called it... I actually thought that the other Council of 13 might be like Visser 3... knowing that he is unique makes him even scarier. Curious that the other Yerks never realized his level of betrayal.

- Were the Pemalites afraid of runaway AI, or are they just overly Pacifistic like in canon, or both...?

- As I said in another comment... I don't think you are giving us a happy ending yet. [[#s][possible spoilers if my guess is correct, and spoilers for canon's final epilogue]]

** Gaaaahhh I had opinions and then I closed the wrong tab and now I will reconstruct them from memory.

- Rachel was always the most relatable, for me, and when your Rachel [[#s][foo]] it became clear that R!Animorphs passes my internal criteria for Animorphs fiction. Sufficiently dark, and dark in the right ways. Additionally, [[#s][foo]] a second time and I'm /insufficiently convinced/ that consciousness gets "switched on" rather than... noticed by the morpher for the first time. o.O

- Cassie struggling with her ethics in a way that doesn't involve extensively carrying an idiot ball :D This feels very true to form. When I was small and reading these, it was like... my thoughts tended much less towards recounting experience and heuristics, a lot more towards actually trying to figure out what's going on -- with ethics, with the invasion, with the group etc. You capture that well.

- I like base-7 (and how it's pervasive but not lampshaded). I like Esplin/Alloran thinking of probability in terms of light -- it feels like how I think about things.

- Garrett is strongly relatable and he is a positive addition.

- I am continuously more convinced of this as the story goes on.

- Also I have to get that tardigrade tattoo at this point.

- I predict that the autobiographical parts of this fic, whatever they may be, will oft be considered the least realistic. :P

- Speaking of, nice grocery store scene.

Yay people like Garrett! I waited a whole extra cycle to give him his first viewpoint chapter because I was nervous about including original characters in pivotal roles.

Random comments:

If we put humans on one end, and Yeerks on the other, Andalites fall in the middle. Humans are the most individualistic, use language to communicate, Andalites can use telepathy, Yeerks can/are mind meld.

And yet it's only when possessing humans that Yeerks learn peace and harmony. Ironic, that it takes possession a very individual creature to show them that.

I don't really understand how this explains the Yeerks morph not working.

** Just something I'm trying to clarify in my head; in one of her chapters, Cassie realizes that if she morphs holding her breath, when she demorphs, her main body is still holding her breath and concludes that if her true body isn't breathing, than how are her neurons firing. This eventually leads to the realisation (at least this is what I got from the story so far) that when you morph, you essentially morph a yeerk like creature in a host, created body, and when you demorph the experiences of that yeerk like creature are reintegrated back into your body. OK, if I'm right on those fronts, then my quesiton here is this; howw does the mind relate to the brain in this situation? When Ax morphs a human, his Andalite brain isn't working anymore; he's essentially a yeerk creature in a human brain. How can he think in 7 strands of thought anymore, when the human brain doesn't have that capability? Or was Cassie just wrong?

I'm really feeling for Ax here. I kind of have been the entire story, but now seeing the suffering from his perspective makes it even worse. On the other hand, I loved The Cinnabon Incident. It seemed almost out of place amidst all the drama and angst but no complaints from me.

And now, with Ax's decision I'm once again in the position of waiting anxiously for your next chapter. What will [[#s][Ax's]] be like?

Also, I must say that I'm intrigued by Ax's hypothesis about the Yeerk morph failure. My running guess was that it had to do with the morphing Yeerk tissue, since it doesn't seem like there would be space in a Yeerk for the Yeerk tissue used to let the morpher to control the body to be...

**** I'd maybe draw parallels between his eating compulsion and the pressure from the shoes. His thoughts hyperfocus on one thing alone - eating - and he finds himself unable to stop. Maybe compare it to the unconsciousness fear, where when he snaps back to reality he realizes with horror that that's the second time he's been unconscious in X days.

If anything, I find the consumption scene to be too close to canon Ax. r!Ax on an eating frenzy...if we're going with the ASD theme, I'd suggest making all 4 trains of thought focus on the /food/. Ex

'glucose with a microcrystalline structure' for the icing,

'amylase in the saliva turning starch into more sweetness',

and for his shadow thoughts 'acrylamide as a carcinogen, causing long-term damage to the body'.

Or maybe have them simply focus on different aspects of the flavor 'sweet', 'chewy', 'melting', 'more', showing the readers /how far gone/ Ax gets when he's presented with food.

** My second comment of the day; between the Andalite ability to think in multiple strands at once, and the newly discovered possible super intelligence of the yeerk hive-mind... does anybody have an idea for how, in a post war, peaceful universe, humanity could ever hope to compete with these two species? What advantage, if any, does a human brain hold, compared to the minds of yeerks and andalites?

*** For one, there are a /lot/ more of us than there are of them. We outnumber Andalites seven to one, and that's /after/ they became a spacefaring race and presumably spread to (at least) permanent outposts, if not full-on colony worlds. And given that pools are individuals rather than shards, there were only a few thousand "people" on the homeworld, and a pretty sharp intelligence/personhood/class distinction between larger (and therefore more powerful) pools versus smaller ones.

Humans (in my mind) have an edge in the explore-exploit dichotomy on the explore side. Any one Andalite outstrips basically any human in the abstract, but when you take into account the fact that there's extreme social pressure and pseudohiveminding going on, nobody can outdo humans as a whole when it comes to generating and testing a million different strategies at once.

That being said, I /did/ write both Yeerks and Andalites as dominating humans in a strict sense, and I /will/ stick to that. There's nothing I hate more than stories where humans defeat Skynet through plucky cleverness. If Skynet is even just 10x more intelligent, Skynet wins unless there is a /lot/ of other stuff advantaging the other side.

**** OK it is now clear to me that I phrased my question wrong. What I truly meant was, in this story, what is unique about the human mind? From what I've been reading, Ax, when he morphs human, only really notices the new sensory inputs and how weird having to speak with words is, while the human animoprhs, when morphing Andalite, seem to go into detail about how using an Andalite brain felt different than using a human one. Perhaps Temrash can explore this, as a yeerk going from a human controller to an Andalite one, he would perhaps have a more outside view on the nature of both minds, and could point out differences. Sorry if this is annoying, but the idea of humans as just individually scaled down versions of Andalite's doesn't sit well with the little I know of evolutionary biology. Surely our very psychology and neurology must be different, given that we came to be on different planets. Do Andalite brains even have two hemispheres? If not, how does that effect their thoughts, given that each human hemisphere function as two arguably sentient partners rather than non-sentient parts of conscious whole? Or maybe you've actually written about this in the story and I just didn't see it :) Thanks for the awesome story, hope you find the time to answer this question without spoiling any future plot points. :)

Myself and several others have speculated that this chapter is actually Crayak's memetic weapon, not the Ellimist's attempt at peace. If so, human's stupidity, lack of hivemind, lack of thought speak, lack of hyper detailed modeling of other minds, and sheer stubbornness in the face of reality may be very useful aspects for resisting memetic contamination.

** Ho. Ly. Shit.

This was stupidly well written. I enjoyed the entire thing. Yet again, you prove to do some amazing things to the Animorphs universe. I was very impressed throughout the entire chapter and I'm loving your portrayl of the aliens we've come to know from canon.

A take on Yeerk culture that makes a startling amount of sense while also being completely unexpected.

A plausibly done example of what might happen to a telepathic race in a socially isolated, high stress environment.

The Chee knowing their programming is flawed and doing their best to help the protagonist avoid the pitfalls of it. While also being constrained by it. Done really, really well.

Visser Three...wow, Visser Three. The borderline megalomaniacal actions make a startling amount of complete and utter sense. Any sane, rational being that's intimately familiar with the self sharing culture of the Yeerks should be well and truly terrified of memetic threats. Of course, now the question is just what Visser Three's end game is. An obvious side benefit is Esplin's ability to exist independently and indefinitely by being that guy that helps in the war. And now I'm curious as to why he's Visser Three and not Visser One considering he's a sort of super Yeerk.

Anyway, great work man. Really enjoyed it :)

EDIT: Also question [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]], is this the first time Ax has tasted something in human morph? I ask because his reaction seems very excessive (although that could be attributed to his fraying mental state)

** [[/u/TK17studios]]

Hey, I just caught up with the story and wanted to thank you. It's a wonderful retelling of a story that meant a lot to me as a child, a very fine blend of consistent and different from canon. Thanks for keeping in and enhancing cinnabonkers!Ax. Seriously, to move the story in such a way that him accepting a Yeerk into his head seems not only feasible but /wise/ without making any of the steps along the way even remotely jarring is an impressive feat.

So yeah. Your plot is great, characters are great, voice is wonderful and world building top notch.

Don't want to get you too big-headed, so here's some criticism: non-human PoVs should capitalize Human the same as Andalite or Hork-Bajir! That's all I've got for now. Don't worry, I'll probably reread and find actual criticisms, I'm completely infatuated with the story right now.

***** A good amount of the animorphs series was ghostwriters...KA Applegate wrote the first few, the last few, some of the more impactful ones in the middle, and was involved with the overall plot, but a whooooole lot of 'em were written by one-off authors telling one-off stories. Most were never brought up again in spite of the story impact (oatmeal, starfish cloning) while some kept coming back in spite of how dumb they were (helmacrons, friggin SARIO RIP).

Honestly, part of the advantage [[/u/TK17Studios]] has is that he's one guy trying to tell one story, so he's free to pick and choose what he puts in, regardless of publishability or general appeal or any metric /besides/ what he thinks makes a good story. Ms Applegate had none of those freedoms.

Do yourself a favour and acquire the last 5 or so books (where the back covers start saying "they know exactly who we are and exactly where we live"). They get surprisingly dark, a very different overall tone to the first few. I would definitely recommend them to a former fan.
