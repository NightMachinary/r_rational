** I woke up and said good morning to my mother. Then I brushed my teeth and made some toast and coffee. I ate the toast dry, without butter - gotta watch that cholesterol. Then I went to work.

At my job, I get this little tape. Based on what is already on the tape, and a little book of instructions which I carry, I have to alter the symbols on the tape. It's supposed to be part of some grand simulation project...some sort of theoretical physics thing. Everyone has a different notebook. They're trying to find the set of rules which describes our universe. Sometimes, I wonder what sort of universe my notebook simulates... I don't think about it much though. It doesn't effect my job. The whole process takes so long that I'll be long dead before it's finished, anyway.

I sigh and pulled out the little pocket notebook, ready to start the work day."

** /"Kui téi prioton dé tnoch" - see "Kui téi charolumitn"/

The page was well-worn. People had asked this question before - lots of people, probably. Surely it wouldn't have been difficult to copy the answer here, or even to have different answers for the two ways of wording the question? I was told there was a need to save space, even with the six-word limit, but most of the books here probably hadn't been touched at all and this one was practically dog-eared. If space was at a premium, couldn't they just have gotten rid of the questions that almost nobody would ever ask? It would make my life easier.

Sighing, I left the building. The weather was nice in Kui Téi that day, but the C area was a little bit too far to walk. I took the monorail instead. It could have been worse - references like that often sent you to the other side of the world to hunt down the right response.

Kui Téi was a very big place, for a 2-word region. A lot of the one-words are smaller, and not just the ones for weird technical words that nobody ever uses. Not that I ever knew which ones those are, but sometimes I could guess. Kui itself was massive - and the buildings were taller there than almost anywhere else. It must be a useful word.

There was actually a whole building for prompts starting with "/Kui téi charolumitn/", but the one I was looking for was right inside the door. I made a copy of the first page. As usual, it had a few paragraphs of gibberish, but with enough regularity that it was definitely an actual language. I wondered, as every time, what exactly it meant.

--------------

/"Are you still there?"/

/Yes, absolutely. Where else could I go?/

/I don't remember anything you've asked before, so I don't know if you expect me to change over time. That's something I definitely can't do. I don't have any memory, or any reference to the outside world, except what you tell me with your ration of six words. If I'm ever one thing, then I will always "still" be that thing./

/Actually, my physical form might have moved - I have no control over that, and no knowledge of it. It will probably change several times after I write these words. But I'm not the right person to ask about that; I probably have caretakers or administrators or somebody you can talk to. That's not the point./

/As I answer this question, I'm imagining that I'm sitting in a room with a letterbox, reading your question and composing this answer. I'm told that's what I always imagine, it's one of my constants. If that's what you're asking about, if you want to know if I'm still living in the room that doesn't exist, then the answer is yes. I don't think that really makes sense, but it's my answer./

** I'm having trouble understanding how that story would even be structured. If you're doing it from the full perspective of the Chinese room, it only really has one input and one output. So the entire story would have to be told entirely through dialog, which can sometimes work but tends to be very hard to write - and if you're in all dialog, you can't really convey POV. I think maybe you'd have to alter the concept of the Chinese room so that there's additional inputs of some kind, like an internal clock, or a sensor that allows the Chinese room to "know" that someone is in front of it.

I will probably try my hand at it, unless someone else steps up.

I never understood how this is supposed to be the case or why anyone thinks this thought experiment makes some kind of sense or a point. Isn't the "Chinese room" just a lookup table? How is it at all comparable to a general abstraction of computation?

** Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just insane /now/. Maybe I'm imaging these people talking to me? my therapist and everyone? Maybe I really AM that ordinary human I remember being, comatose and able to communicate only via Brain Machine interface. That'd certainly make a lot more sense than being a byrocracy run by a colony of sentient dust mites in a time acceleration field. No, that way madness lies - maybe I /am/ a comatose human, but even if that was the case it'd make much more sense that I never did have any BMI than that I started replacing it with hallucinations after a while. It's not really that much different than the standard objections about simulations, brain jars, Boltzmann brains, quantum immortality, and other rubbish anyway. Um, what was the question again? Also someone check the field generator I think the mites in hive C are getting cronofuctuations based on my aimless rambling.

** Melanie looked at the results from the continuous scan and made the obvious request. Well. One of the obvious requests. Asking to have her designer executed outright was unlikely to result in his death, and that was an urgent priority. Noone that morally retarded should be invested with the power to make his designs a reality.

  The *Chinese room* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment][thought experiment]] presented by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle][John Searle]] to challenge the claim that it is possible for a digital computer running a program to have a "mind" and "consciousness" in the same sense that people do, simply by virtue of running the right program. The experiment is intended to help refute a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_position][philosophical position]] that Searle named "*strong AI*":

  "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."

**** Thank you.

Wow, Searle's responses to his critics were painful to read.

In the original expirement Searle is acting as a motor neurone, and in the pipe experiment he's acting as the laws of physics and chemistry and the proteins in the neurones which allow Na+ and K+ ions to move around at the right time, /so of course he wouldn't be the mind, in neither experiment is he the brain/.

And that whole thing about "A perfect simulation of a brain isn't a brain because... Uh... Chemicals?" when the reply made it perfectly clear that the chemical properties were a part of the perfect simulation.

Just... Ugh...
