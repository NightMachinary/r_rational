** Absolutely incredible.

The only thing that bothered about about this otherwise fantastic story was the nanofabricator. How did it actually do anything in a world run by anagrams? That's like saying gasoline wont burn but your car'll run fine, right?

  I apologize to those who have read [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/hq/universal_fire/][Universal Fire]] for this story. As a peace offering, please accept this lovely lampshade.

The answer is "I'm sorry".

**** Thinking about it, I have believable justification. Transporting into the world made them into that-world compatible humans, so obviously the nanofabricator went through a similar transformation. They just happen to have a fully generalized "find and create an isomorphic algorithm in this alien axiom system" device.

Which has left my inner physicist /confused/, rather than blatantly contradicted.

**** /Puts on cynical hat./

Considering the current state of Universities, I found that to be the most believable aspect of the story.

***** /Puts cynical hat back on your head/

Considering the current state of universities, they would have sent grad-students. That's what we're /for/.

No, grad students have some useful functions (eg 'replication studies'). Send late-undergrads, who may know enough to be useful but basically exist to get in the way of research.

*** I share an interpretation posted in the comments: It's a platonic nanofabricator, i.e. it's a device that performs the function the expedition party expect it to perform. Nothing is necessarily even going on inside the machine; it could be a black-box replicator for all it matters. It takes natural reagents because they expect it to (or more correctly, either because Adwell expects it to or doesn't expect it /not/ to). This is probably because A) Adwell was at least cursorily familiar with the technology, so he shared the conception of what 'nanofabricator' means with the party, or B) Adwell wasn't familiar and thus had raised no objections to its existence and function, respectively.

Of course, the problem this raises is that it's not exactly obvious why matches wouldn't work! My hypothesis for /that/ is that matches, being conceptually simple, were completely understood (on a reductionist level) by Adwell, and so his universe rejected their function as a consequence of the fact that the basic reagent equation for match combustion isn't anglophysical (isn't anagrammatical). Whereas the nanofabricator (almost certainly not understood on a cause-and-effect reductionist level by the party, analogous to that the average physicist couldn't outline a laptop computer from scratch) wasn't forbidden because there was no specific reaction or reagent process to declare anti-anagrammatical, or something like that.

Of course, this breaks /more/ things, because Adwell almost certainly knows a thing or two about basic human biology, and AIR + FOOD + WATER -> MIND + AMBULATION + FEELS isn't anagrammatical! But it's always difficult to make consistent a universe governed by an entity with discretion. =p At the very least, this post was interesting to write. I really enjoyed the story, for the record!

** Wow, a great read!

It bothered me a bit that all the characters with a known gender are men, except for the very minor role of the chief's daughter..
