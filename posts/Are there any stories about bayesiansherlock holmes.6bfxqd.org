** In the opposite direction there's Tattletale from Worm, who's basically Sherlock Holmes if Doyle admitted that it's impossible. She has a superpower that lets her deduce things from insufficient evidence, and even evidence that she could gather but hasn't.

***** I disagree with that statement. I don't think her ability is all that nuts, in context of a fight. I think Taylor's just exceptionally gifted. I think she'd do much the same with any power that had any sort of battle application. Although I suppose we could then debate how much of that processing power she gets from her bugs contributes to said intelligence.

******* Ok, let's say that's all her power was good for. Unlimited multitasking. How would she use that to resolve any of the conflicts she'd face as a hero/villain/rogue? You can't multitask your way out of a fight. And even if she can juggle a hundred ideas, she only has 24 hours in the day and two hands. She's no Tinker.

********* That's just not true. With people like Genesis or Panacea, then sure. But most power sets don't require a ton of multitasking. Any power that doesn't allow the use of multiple constructs (be they beams, lifeforms, other powers, etc.) won't be very much force multiplied, beyond the generic multiplier that would result from someone with increased intelligence/processing using said power.

********** Tinker - tech thought reading device + drones/dragon suits/remote-controled capes (with a little help from bonesaw). With unlimited multitasking, she could sit in the PRT HQ and send her minions anywhere in the world. If she can sense through them via feedback, she could have tens/hundreds of thousands of computer terminals with access drones - I doubt even the number man could beat her processing power with enough upscaling (he only has two hands).

*********** So ok. You're saying 1 of 2 things. In which case, your point still doesn't really apply.

1. You're describing this as a part of her power set - If that's what you're saying, then that applies to my statement about powers that use multiple constructs. It would obviously be broken in cases like that.

2. You're talking about another Tinker helping her by creating those things - yea, that would be a force multiplier. But that's one applied by someone else, with their powers working together. There are several powersets that would be very complimentary to the point of being broken, which is fine. My original point is just that, in and of itself, it wouldn't be very broken if Taylor was on her own. And that's without considering the cost of the situation you described, and Wildbow's made it clear that there is a cost to such things in his realistic-ish world.

Additionally, /[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tattletale-investigates-worm-au.303094/][Tattletale Investigates]]/ is a well-written but discontinued /Worm/ fanfiction in which Lisa avoids Coil and subsequently starts a detective agency instead of acting as a supervillain.

** Masego is the best.

  “That doesn't sound good,” Apprentice said. “I suppose it's a good thing we have you along.”

  I glanced at him.

  “What's that supposed to mean?”

  “You're very good at murdering our opposition,” he said, genuinely believing he was giving me a compliment.

  I occasionally forgot Masego had been raised by villains. For him that probably counted as praise.

  “You don't know for sure I'm going to kill someone,” I said.

  “Not gonna lie, I'll be disappointed if we don't,” Archer noted.

  “I've done diplomacy before,” I continued.

  “I don't think extorting the High Lords counts,” Apprentice said.

  “Or looting that angel,” Hakram added.

  “I think bullied might be more accurate,” Masego said.

  “If you guys keep this up I can guarantee you someone's getting killed,” I said.

  “That's the spirit,” Apprentice said, patting my shoulders. “Now let's move along, Catherine, we're blocking the way. You really need to pay more attention to your surroundings.”

  He strode into the hall before I could come up with a reply, still gaping.

**** Whoops... I can't believe I posted that to the wrong thread. Sorry about that...

But, to answer your questions, yes it's from A Practical Guide to Evil and yes, I think it's pretty good. As usual I recommend reading the first 5 - 10 chapters and checking it out for yourself but here's some further thoughts & opinions to help you decide whether you want to give it a go:

- It is definitely NOT rationalist Sherlock Holmes. No detective work. No deductions.
- It is definitely NOT rationalist.
- It's reasonably, but by no means completely, rational. The main characters are all intelligent in the way they gain and deploy resources to meet their objectives.
- It does a good job of over-turning the classic good vs. evil cliche.
- It's aimed at a young adult market so it's not overly complex. Reading it is more relaxing than taxing.
- We're into Book 3 of (if I recall correctly) 5 or 6 books. The author has been very reliable in providing weekly updates.
