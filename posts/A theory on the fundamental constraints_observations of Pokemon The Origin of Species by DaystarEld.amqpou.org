*DISCLAIMER: Please note that this is not a very well formed/articulated thought you're about to read. I just needed to pen it down before it escaped my mind (Although I think that some of it might have).*

*I'd love it if you could criticize the flaws of the argument. I'd appreciate it more if you found a way to build on it.*

​

*Reference:*

Bulbapedia: "Mew is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body, and as such is able to learn any attack."

Pokedex of Pokemon Crystal on Mew: "Because it can learn any move, some people began research to see if it is the ancestor of all Pokémon."

​

*Argument:*

Ancestry doesn't work like that. If we were to trace back our genes to the very first deviation in the genus Homo, and then go further back in a similar fashion to the first microscopic form of "life", it wouldn't contain the entire genomic database of all the species that were to evolve from it.

I can figure out these possibilities:

- The theory of Mew being the ancestor of every pokemon because of having the entire genetic database of everything is similar to a belief that our ancestors wrongly formulated: God containing all of the information and everything being made in his image.

A different way to look at what - a species of which has the entire genetic database stored - would be like is an AI. One that has compiled abiogenesis. If such an AI could essentially go into any of these genetic states and, let's say, become any species by using this makeup as a stable state, this would technically need the engineers finding a way to encode all of the genetic information biologically(I'm assuming Mewtwo instead of a silicon approach).

Therefore, there was no Mew. It had to be a Myth that the older generation formulated. And Giovanni set out to work it out.

​

- If there was indeed some form of gene which had in it all the genetic information of all the pokemon encoded, then that meant that life that arose from it was a different kind of genesis: One where all available information was already present, and the traits the inheritors of those genes displayed was a permanency enforced by some form of environmental effect, along with some sort of mutation randomness.

Which means that Pokemon's could theoretically be altered to have other traits just by triggering untriggered part of their genes. Which IS being done. By Technical Machines.

If Mew did contain all of the genetic information, it wouldn't be "Evolution" that took place in Pokemon, but rather, "Computation".

​

Also note that since Pokemon and Humans essentially share some "Power" traits, this could point to the "computation" being some form of "unrealized" technology, and could/could not be extended to a common species depending on their compatibility.

Which makes a good case for Atlantean Origins. Or any highly advanced sentient lifeform which mostly perished due to the misuse of the said technology.

​

*NOTE: I'm trying to emulate what <potentially big> insight the author might have had studying the inconsistencies of the Pokemon Universe as compared to the real world.*

*EDIT: The two points might/not be related. I was just floating around ideas.*


** The story lampshades the term evolution at one point. - Red points out that it's more of a metamorphosis really, but yadda yadda yadda (something social sciency)

Anyway, entry A might not be related to entry B. Its genome contains a lot of random information, that happens to include all the other genes found in Pokemon. All that means is most Pokemon have simple genomea and mew has a complex one, or maybe it travels a lot and stores the DNA of everything it eats within its body.

It being the ancestor of all Pokemon because of the ability to learn all the moves doesn't have to be related to that at all.

I remember that, and actually it kind of bugged me because it felt like imposing scientific meanings from our own world onto the pokemon world. Like, sure, the creators of pokemon in our world were probably misusing the word "evolution", and I get that the author was lampshading that. But in-universe, evolution /means/ pokemon evolution. Even if Red is taking a prescriptivist-linguistic approach, where did that prescription even come from? People have observed pokemon evolution for thousands of years. The meaning of evolution as in pokemon evolution would have been the first.

*** I think /evolution/ actually works fine to describe Pokémon metamorphosis/transmutation, both in its modern and in its historic sense. I guess there's some notion of it being a bit more gradual than the rapid (revolutionary) process by which Pokémon evolve canonically, though I've also read fanfics which show the process happening in a manner more like conventional growth and development, with stages just being periods of stasis.

I do recall the lampshading in this fic, though, but don't remember its exact context (on mobile so it's obnoxious to look for it). What's the status of “Darwinian” thought here? Is it believed applicable to humans, Pokémon, and other organisms? Is common descent among them all accepted? Is the breadth of fossil diversity limited to the dozen-ish Pokémon we see in the games, or if there are e.g. mundane birds around does that mean e.g. there are dinosaur fossils somewhere? Has the basis of heredity been worked out yet? Has the pokéquivalent of the modern synthesis occurred? etc. I think I remember DNA, Dawkins, and maybe some other 20th century stuff mentioned --- does that mean all prior “discoveries” have also been made?

**** Modern and historical models of evolution still involve some level of iteration over multiple generations, regardless of what the selection mechanism may be. Pokemon metamorphosis involves neither of those.

As for the science exposition I don't know. The Pokemon world's infrastructure doesn't lend itself to proper experiments so I've just taken it as an edutainment moment rather than trying to fit it in with the existing continuity.

*** Consider this pov: "Moves" are technically some form of "Force manipulation".

If genes descriptions dictate which forces are manipulable by which set of genes (like the gene marker theory from HpMor), then gene descriptors should play a significant role in force manipulations.

So the ancestry reference, i.e. being the database of all gene descriptors of force manipulations must be related.

**** No that doesn't follow. For example Ditto is also able to use all moves after using transform. Transform is one of the 11 moves mew learns naturally in gen 1, and if Mew is able to retain the data used for the transformation within its body somehow that explanation is sufficient for the premise, but contradicts the conclusion.

Edit: Wait does that mean Mew is the ancestor of all Pokemon, not because of traditional RL evolution mechanics but because all other Pokemon are actually Mew that got stuck that way? /R/im12andthisisdeep

****** Mew uses transform. Mew is now Charmander. Charmander can't remember its original form. Charmander detransforms into Ditto.

Or Charmander learned Flame Thrower. Charmabder forgot how to use transform (except in certain situations and only into Charmeleon which can then chain into Charizard, but even then those are involuntary).

Of course if this is how Pokemon species happen there must be a ton of mew everywhere and the researchers just can't tell. Also normal evolution just became obsolete and most normal animal species are extinct from the rapid random environment changes they can't cope with.

******* Consider a database of all individual species as a collection. This may be stored either as a sequential memory, or a hierarchical temporal memory structure (something like a Neural Network for argument's sake). Let's go with the HTM's. A particular species results in a set of very specific triggers:

Ancestry (A Bayesian weight), environmental triggers (can result in mutations, can result in varying degrees of prowess (Bell curves)), and genetic modifications (Technical Machines).

Every one (path) of which quantify a species.

A Charmander would therefore not randomly transform into a mew randomly.\\
Note: A possible hypothesis on where you might have misunderstood my claim could be that you're assuming every Charmander or Ditto to carry the entire database. The process of how every evolution carries on is completely different from the compilation evolution of Mew. Also, note that the process by which Ditto mimics other agents isn't necessarily a similar process of how Mew does it.

A mew could essentially forget to transform back to the original mew and keep roaming as a Charmander of a Ditto.

******** Escaping computer optimized data structures, the genetic data would need to be encoded in a way that makes sense for DNA. This means we have a 4-nary or 6-nary digits. Each gene is a string of random length, including a header and footer string which Mark's the length, and must be recognized via fuzzy patterns because it gets mildly corrupted with each cell division. In addition they have no sorting. They are all individually encrypted and each time the cell receives input via chemical messenger, it will attempt to decrypt the data in parallel using the message as a key, and act upon those pieces which are decrypted successfully.

Now to include every possible Pokemon in Mew's genome, you have a huge number of individual genes that have to react predictably to a limited set of possible chemical messengers that then have to be passed in a sensible set of packages to its descendants. A Bayesian approach would lead to lots of goop (aka missingno?) even because most combinations will either fail to produce an organism, or will fail to produce one which can survive (a few seconds, but also long enough to make more of itself). There's also the question of how it's only reproducing part of its genome and why its body uses valuable RNA to make those extra unused genes in the first place.

Otoh if a mew transforms down to the chemical level, the new cells may not have the same complexity to recall its original genome. A simple microevolution that attempts to reduce the wasted RNA instead deletes the data of how to turn back, thus creating a mew that is no longer a mew after evolving, but a brand new Pokemon that never existed, which scientists eventually decided to call Charmander.

Regarding the note I think the confusion is that you thought my initial comment was a disagreement with your thesis rather than some aspects of the argument.

I know both of those words, but I don't know what you mean when you put them together like that. The least incoherent reading I can think of is that some external force simulated what the universe will look like, with all the organisms in it, then it went back and encoded that into Mew's genome. And I think that you are postulating that the researchers are postulating such a force, and calling it God or whatever?

#+end_quote

Wait, what? Why are there engineers now? If Mew (as the researchers imagine it) can Transform into anything described by subsets of its genome, then... no, it clearly doesn't need a team of engineers to do so. It already encodes the genetic information biologically. Because it is a biological thing with genes. At what point in your thought process is the genetic information encoded any other way? Why are you even mentioning Mewtwo here? Are you trying to say that the Mewtwo project invented Mew by blending together every other Pokemon, and then they created Mewtwo in order to... encode the information that they encoded in order to make Mew? I can't follow your reasoning at all.

#+begin_quote

If there never was a Mew, then what is there to "work out"? It's a thing that never existed, described by people who don't understand genetics. What concrete steps does "work it out" entail, starting from that?

#+begin_quote
  If Mew did contain all of the genetic information, it wouldn't be "Evolution" that took place in Pokemon, but rather, "Computation".

I have no idea what "computation" is supposed to mean here. Are you going back to the universe-simulating force from the other possibility, that I thought was separate? What makes you say that evolution is not the thing that is being computed? What distinction are you trying to make here?

#+begin_quote
  this could point to the "computation" being some form of "unrealized" technology, and could/could not be extended to a common species depending on their compatibility.

"Computation"? "Unrealized"? "Technology"? "Extended"? "Compatibility"? I can't even parse this sentence.

I couldn't follow a single line of thought or piece of evidence that lead you to this conclusion.

Also, I hate it. Sometimes Flying particles are just things that exist in the universe. Bringing in some ancient magic superscience to explain why the story's world isn't identical to our world is the worst kind of unsatisfying non-explanation, on par with "Red is a kid in the real world imagining the whole thing."

** What comes to mind for me: Colonisation, or more probably semi-Terraforming.

​

Some species sends out Mews to potentially-habitable planets. Cramming all the DNA into one organism cuts costs and logistic difficulties of preparing an entire self-sustaining colony ship (either multigenerational, or through costly stasis/hibernation pods, some Pokemon maybe not able to be put into stasis/hibernation): you just get the Mew as a form that can dormantly be hurled through space until it survives landing on a planet, optionally being able to guide itself into the orbit of a planet (through gas expulsion, or solar-sail-like wings?).

​

The Mew lands on a planet, tries to colonise the planet, and the 'unpacked' Pokemon with no natural predators except for each other either are wiped out by native wildlife or quickly dominate native wildlife instead. Maybe some centuries/millennia later, either the Mew-sending species (if not encoded within the Mew too) arrives and finds all its familiar tasty and home-materials animals already everywhere, or (if encoded within the Mew too) makes contact with its own kind, which presumably have inherited ancestral memories of some sort. Or they just show up and say. "You, this particular sort of psychic pokemon. You've become the dominant species, right? You're a colony of us, so please start sending us your planet's resources."

​

Now, the main question: are humans native wildlife that thrived through intelligence, despite the extinction of pretty much all other non-Pokemon native wildlife? If so, did they through being even more intellectually capable than the Mew-encoded intelligent dominant species, or by the intelligent dominant species who sent the Mew not encoding themselves within it, planning to arrive later after the planet was comfortable for them? If humans aren't native wildlife, and are encoded within Mew too, then does that mean that a much-older human government who sent Mew are going to make contact at some point?

​

Of course, it could also be a dying planet sending out Mews, but then I imagine there would be a greater focus on preserved cultural information.

​

...Hmm, by the original Mew concept, I'm incidentally reminded of an absurd moment in the Utawarerumono anime. "Now, watchers, you've wondered all along about the identity of this magical being with godlike power. His true identity is... the missing link between dinosaurs and humans!" "What."
