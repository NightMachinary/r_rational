** The entire story, for people who don't want to click through to Facebook:

The boy sighed, closing the laptop gently, too disappointed to even slam it shut. "So that's it, then," he said quietly.

The girl shrugged. "I mean, there's still replication. Something might've gone wrong; we're going to be thorough."

The boy shot her a look, and she gave her own sigh. "Yeah, that's it."

The boy slumped, resting his head in his hands. The puberty blocker had been their most ambitious plan yet, their most promising hope---begun years earlier, long before he'd joined the Project. It had taken generations to shift the public narrative to a place where the adults would even /consider/ it, not to mention the valiant efforts of the trans children themselves, breaking ground, acting as lightning rods, airing their private suffering in public where millions of people would mock and scorn them. What they'd gone through, what their parents had gone through, and in the end, all for nothing...

"He really forgot?" the boy asked, knowing as he did so that he was pushing it, himself, coming right up to the edge of what was allowed. Beliefs were for true things, not for comfort or shelter.

Her face twisted in pity, but she said nothing of it. "He thinks they went Christmas shopping at the mall last Tuesday," she said. "The details start on page six, I think. The delusion is insanely complex. If I hadn't been watching him myself..."

She trailed off. "I know you two were close," she began.

"Don't," he said. "Just---don't."

She nodded, her lips a grim line.

For a moment, there was silence.

James, the boy thought. James, how could you?

And then---as always---the wash of shame, of self-recrimination, because of course it wasn't James's fault. It wasn't /anybody's/ fault, as near as they could tell. It had happened to Ellen, and to Alex before that, and to Cameron and Jordan and Finley and Riley---to dozens of others, hundreds of others, in the history of the Project---it happened to /everyone,/ eventually---

Two years, the boy thought. Two more years, and it will happen to me.

"We're not crazy, right?" he asked.

Her head tilted, her eyes sympathetic. "We've got the footage," she said. "James didn't go anywhere Tuesday. His /parents/ didn't go anywhere Tuesday. The closets were empty, no sign of wrapping paper anywhere in the house, nothing under the tree."

"But they're all so /sure,/" the boy whispered. "Even when we play the tapes back for them---"

"They're sure," she agreed. "But we've got the /evidence./ The footage, the scales in the floorboards, the detectors in the chimneys---"

"I just wish he'd tell us /why./ I wish he'd /explain./ It'd be easier, if I---if we---if we understood---"

"Did you talk to him?"

"Yeah. I snuck out. Waited for him at the fireplace."

"You know it's not good to talk to him."

The boy snapped. "I don't CARE, okay? I don't CARE what's good for me, what's bad for me---what does it MATTER when I've got two years left, two years if I'm /lucky/---who /cares/ about the recommendations when I'm going to lose my entire mind, forget /everything/---"

"There's still hope."

"What hope? Where? What are we going to try /now,/ Susan? If even puberty blockers don't have any effect---"

"Calm down, okay? I get it. I understand. But the rest of them---look, they don't need to hear you melting down, okay? The news is bad enough as it is."

The boy sagged like a puppet with cut strings. "'For the future,'" he muttered.

"'For the future,'" she echoed. "'For those who come after.' Maybe we're screwed, maybe it's hopeless, maybe we're not going to get there in time. But we're making progress, okay? And someday---"

"Someday," he agreed.

"Anyway, my parents are throwing a New Year's party, and Quinn and Morgan were going to come over early, fly the new drones around the backyard. You want to come?"

The boy's lip twisted.

"They're really cool," she pressed.

"I know," he sighed. "I just---it gets harder every year, you know? To play along. Mom thinks she put off getting the new washing machine to buy mine---"

"Yeah," she said. "But if we don't enjoy them now, then what even was the point?"

The boy sighed again. "Yeah. Okay. I'll be there."

"Take a break, okay?" she said. "Just a few days. We'll start fresh in the new year."

The boy said nothing.

"We're worried about you."

"Don't worry about me," he said. "I'm on the good list, remember?"

** So is it the parents or the children who are deluded? I think both readings can be supported, since the perspective is from that of the children. Maybe the whole story takes place in their overactive imaginings, playing secret agent? Otherwise, I'm not sure children /could/ coordinate to the extent seen here, if surrounding adults were convinced they're engaging in harmful delusion. And the majority, I'm sure, would just not care.

I'd also wonder if Santa alters external reality or just adult perception. Do adults find money missing in their accounts, or think they earned more than they did? Do stores believe they've sold additional products? What happens if they try to use that "extra" money for renovations? Do adults do /no/ Christmas shopping whatsoever? What if work or chores were done last Tuesday -- are they undone, or else how are they explained? Are all records falsified?

And to provide some meta-commentary :]

I'd say the potential for offense lies in how the story seems to have subsumed transgender experience into the service of some fictional cause, which seems a bit like trivializing trans-suffering due to gender dysphoria or transphobia. To invoke the usual example, it's as if a story where the victims of the holocaust colluded with Nazis to fuel a blood sacrifice that banished Cthulhu or something. It makes it less a tragedy and more a justifiable means to an end. You could also read some trans-erasure into this, if transgender individuals here are just "faking" it to experiment with puberty blockers or something.

It's odd that [[/u/aponty]] was downvoted for pointing out selection effects in the transgender population comprising your personal friends (as they might wish to not offend you with a public callout, of maybe you've intentionally befriend those harder to offend, or if you've driven off all the ones who'd be offended etc. etc.). As for the math problem, it sounds like P(offense|offensive) = 0.15 = P(offense|not_offensive), so it's unclear how any observation is meant to shift P(offensive|offense).

#+end_quote

This seems like an interesting example to choose, because refusing to leave your (say, <5yo) children in a car even under ostensibly safe conditions seems like a pretty useful habit. I'm sure a pretty sizable fraction of negligent parents thought they'd be just stepping out for a second, their kids are fine, etc. etc. And in those years I'd expect harried parents to be much more prone to forgetfulness or distraction (due to e.g. sleep deprivation), and normalizing innocuous behaviors that may slide into more dangerous ones seems unwise. The analogy to standards of written etiquette seems straightforward, in the same way that prejudicial jokes normalize and destigmatize prejudice. Even if an author is not especially transphobic, their audience might be.

I definitely didn't get the "death metaphor", since not every time-pressure is symbolic. Even within the "rationalist" community it could mean, idk, the race to proper GAI specification or something. It could also be a metaphor for forgetting highschool math without practice, or for having children before infertility, or for winning the big sports competition before you graduate or overuse injuries accumulate, or for taking the roast out of the oven before it burns. In retrospect, I guess "I'm going to lose my entire mind, forget /everything/" read weird to me, because it seemed like they'd only forget their memories of Santa Claus. But I guess if these kids have devoted their entire lives to the pursuit, maybe everything is tinged green and red? (I'm definitely not a /rationalist/, but find the group amusing enough to have familiarized myself with their memes over the last ~10+ y)

It's also quite impressive the whole thing was conceived, written, and posted in 9 minutes flat. With 758 words, that's 84 wpm -- I can barely type that fast without mistakes!

You always gotta expect that some percentage of readers will forget that authors are not their characters, or that stories don't necessarily endorse the viewpoints of their characters (they may, for instance, be presenting those viewpoints specifically to highlight them for disagreement, as in many many films starring Nazis). imo, the viewpoint boy character /is/ subsuming transgender experience into what he thinks is a larger/more pressing cause, and this is a point against him, as a person---when he thinks "all for nothing," he's doing so from a very selfish perspective where all that matters is the fight /he/ thinks is important, and ignoring the fact that part of /why/ those kids would have agreed to sign on to the Project was a /mutually/ beneficial trade---greater support for a thing they urgently need, in exchange for helping possibly solve the Santa problem, too.

I didn't spell that out, just as I didn't spell out that it's about Santa, just as I didn't spell out that it's about death, but I'm willing to bet that a good chunk of the people who /didn't/ get mad at me implicitly understood it.

I strongly disagree that an interpretation like "the transgender individuals are just 'faking it' to run the larger psychological experiment" is justified by the text, though.

**** eh, I get the "authors are not their characters, nor do they necessarily endorse their views" point, but authors still instantiate universes where certain premises hold, and do not do so from some background distribution of possible universes. Like, to use an example from the worm fandom, there's a popular and prolific author that apparently contrives scenarios with lots of child molestation (as I understand it, having never ventured to those parts of his work). One can claim that's just what happens in those stories, with no relation to the author's opinions... but their repeat occurrence is nevertheless telling. And I think it's especially hard to make nuanced points in short-form work.

I think it's one of several interpretations, and not an especially charitable one, either. But where the facebook audience and here differ is that they know you and we don't (though, incidentally, we have a fairly large number of mutuals lol). They might see your story and use outside information (TK17 is not transphobic, TK17's really into gerontology, etc.) to arrive more easily at your intended interpretation where a more generic audience would not.

[emphasis mine]

does "all for nothing" not imply that there are no other benefits to puberty blockers besides the scheme to catch Santa Claus? No gender dysphoria relieved, no undesirable body parts failing to develop, etc.? They failed to delay the amnestic effects, but presumably experienced some benefits beyond mere /nothing/? This early in the story it's unclear if that passage is from an omniscient narrator's perspective or from the boy's. That's not how it reads to me, but I can see it reading that way to others.

And I guess my earlier point could use the addendum that you should keep in mind not just plausible interpretations of your work, but guard against plausible misinterpretations, as well, especially when some might have high prior expectation of unsavory thought ¯\/(ツ)//¯

******* They wouldn't have "private suffering" if they were just faking; they wouldn't be referred to as valiant trans kids if they were just pretending to be trans.

I think if you polled 100 readers on whether that paragraph was meant to represent the absolute truth as perceived by an omniscient narrator, versus a third-person perspective of the boy's personal thoughts and beliefs, a supermajority would say the latter. I'd be willing to bet small amounts of money on that, if you want to run the experiment.

It's true that the boy is thinking (selfishly, narrow-mindedly) that the fight over puberty blockers was "for nothing" in a way that dismisses the actual progress made for actual trans kids, and that this shows he's not a very empathetic character. But /even if you pretend that it's an omniscient narrator stating that increased access to puberty blockers did nothing for anybody,/ that /still/ in no way implies that the trans kids are "faking it."

Like, we could turn each line of the text into a set of concrete, symbolic logic assertions, and I claim you would not be able to derive "the trans kids are faking it" from any combination of what's present in the story.

More thoughts on the other stuff in a bit, but:

- both my objection and, I presume, the downvotes, were not for the statement itself but for its likely /intended effect,/ in context; it comes across as probably an attempt to criticize/insinuate/undermine without actually just coming out and fighting its own fight. "I summon the shadows of others" instead of "hey, I don't like this, please stop."
- I'm looking to shift the probability that the story is offensive from a prior of 50%, on observations of five people who were 15% likely to object, if it was indeed inoffensive. You could do the symmetrical problem of people who were 85% likely to object if it were offensive. Am I missing something? Does that not shift the posterior?

If you're just going to pull numbers out of nowhere, your statistics calculations are dubious at best, and I feel the point I made was the most salient one.

The first thing that rubbed me wrong was actually when you said "I have a lot of trans friends", which is valid I guess, but just pattern-matching to history it feels way too similar to when racists are like "my black friend doesn't think X" and thereby commandeer the conversation for an entire marginalized group that they're not a part of.

At no point did I claim or imply that the agreement of some trans folk would mean the agreement of all trans folk, or gave me license to speak on behalf of all of them; literally in the same comment you're referencing I talked about the possibility that others might disagree.

Adult brains invent complex false memories to rationalize the delusion. The child protagonists (along with, presumably, a larger network of children) are trying to find a way to prevent the delusion. Their most recent experiment was seeing if trans kids on puberty blockers would be able to remember Santa after the cutoff age, but that failed.

Assume also that a story that's NOT insensitive or offensive has a 15% chance of evoking a negative reaction, for symmetrical reasons. Let's further imagine that a story written by someone who knows trans people, with the intent of not being offensive, has a coin flip over whether they'll succeed (50% chance).

Given that rough prior, how do we update on +four+ +edit: five+ edit: six instances of like/thumbs-up/expressed approval? (with no concrete disapproval that I've yet seen)

I'm walking down a highway, so I don't have the paper I need, but this seems like a neat Bayes 101 question.

******** Look, /I don't care/ about vague suppositions of hypothetical people who /might/ be offended (by a positive reference to a group they're a part of, no less). I've written tens of thousands of words on this subject; another post beside the one linked above is [[https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/in-defense-of-punch-bug-68fcec56cd6b#a548][here]].

I think that these vague miasmatic "eh i dunno people might whatever" kinds of comments are /actively antisocial,/ in that they drive dynamics like e.g. mothers being unable to leave their kids in their cars for two minutes in completely safe environments, by fostering a general culture of fear and paralysis. Not to mention the entirely separate (but equally toxic) dynamic of dumping disproportionate frustration and corrective energy on one's imperfect allies rather than on one's actual opponents; if you're trying to do something about the plight of trans people, this reddit thread is not an effective place to spend your resources.

If /you/ have a problem, say so. If someone you know has a problem and can't or won't speak up for themselves, advocate on their behalf, directly.

But if you want people to preemptively bend over backwards based on the possibility that anybody in the general population might predict that maybe some /other/ person out there might experience some negative feeling upon encountering a thing that they wrote ...

Nope.

Final note from me, it's really bad etiquette to ask this question in this context and I've seen it go a long way to making hostile environments worse.

It seems un-Bayesian to respond to /what you actually said/ rather than to pick up on sub-textual cues as to your emotional state and intentions. My intuition has had a long time to train on this (by talking to people every day) and I use it a lot in order to navigate conversations, by making predictions about what filters other people are passing their thoughts through before they release them into the world as sentences, so I can try to model them better.

When things come across as you saying "I made it /so obvious/", what I don't do is assume that my intuition is correct. I give you an inch less benefit of the doubt - which I return to you intact when you explicitly say that's not in fact what you meant.

*** I just want to toss in that I'm not sure what you want here.

Should we never speak of non-cis people unless we have the space to spend hundreds of words assuring the audience that we mean no harm? I don't think we want that, as it both sets apart people who just want to live their lives on their own terms, and cuts them out of a not insignificant fraction of media entirely. If we want trans people to feel welcome in society, we have to be willing to talk about them like we would any other minority rather than shutting them out unless we're writing a novella.

Should we only ever talk about trans folks in media specifically about them and their issues? This also has the effect of segregating media, this time into pro-trans and trans-neutral, which we also don't want. Trans folks exist in the real world, which is a complicated, messy place, and their issues are tied up with a variety of others in ways which will cause them to come up unexpectedly. For instance, we know puberty blockers are safe only because they were developed to delay precocious puberty in cis girls. Surgical techniques for GCS have been developed for and used in more standard reconstructive surgeries, and vice versa. We can't talk about a lot of real-world issues in a complete and accurate way without bringing trans people in, because they're just as wound up in the rest of the world's issues as everyone else.

Do you want to avoid offending people at all costs? That is both impossible and counterproductive. Someone will always be offended by something because everyone is different. Further, there are people on all sides of every issue who are hypersensitive to offense, and others who are not. I know of a lot of trans, gay, etc folks who use slurs referring to themselves in humorous situations, and I would absolutely be among them if I were in their communities. I also know of a lot of people in marginalized communities who are deeply offended or even measurably hurt by such talk, and the thing is /both groups are right to act as they do./ People who are legitimately hurt by being reminded of the hatred of others and people who attempt to reclaim that hatred through humor are both people, who deserve to have their rights protected and boundaries respected.

If you want to avoid hurting people, I can understand that, but I am unsure how this would hurt anyone. Pointing out that trans children suffer isn't an assault on their rights, it's a fact we ought to mitigate. A fact which, in the world of the story, appears to no longer be true, as enough puberty blockers exist and they are given out freely enough for a conspiracy composed of children to get them for reasons unrelated to being trans. If anything, the world presented in the story is a significantly better one for trans kids than our own.

What do you want? Your complaint doesn't fit into any model I have. Which one are you using?

**** (I note that CouteauBleu withdrew the objection and stated it was just a knee-jerk thought, and that the original comment had positive intent. For further context, CouteauBleu provides me with lots of critique, at my personal request, which may have made him feel freer to make an offhand critical comment; that's a relationship others on the sub might not know we have. I think these are still *excellent* questions to ask, but I think that it's better to see this comment as asking them of *all* of us, rather than of CouteauBleu in particular. It seems reasonable for people to feel gun-shy around charged topics /in general,/ even if they don't have a specific model of what they want as an alternative, and even if that's a little sad.)

**** u/CouteauBleu:
#+begin_quote
  Should we never speak of non-cis people unless we have the space to spend hundreds of words assuring the audience that we mean no harm? I don't think we want that, as it both sets apart people who just want to live their lives on their own terms, and cuts them out of a not insignificant fraction of media entirely. If we want trans people to feel welcome in society, we have to be willing to talk about them like we would any other minority rather than shutting them out unless we're writing a novella.

Okay, so I clearly gave this way less thought than you did, but I don't think that's fair.

I'm not saying "talking about trans kids is bad" or "having a trans character is bad". I'm commenting about the use of puberty blockers as a part of the story's "magic system"; which is a lot more involved and touches on a delicate topic much more directly than just having trans characters.

***** Does it?

Puberty blockers are an important topic in trans circles, but they're only useful if a kid realizes what's wrong early enough. The majority of transitioned people alive today were never on them. It's definitely arguable that this is due to transphobia and trans-ignorance on the part of society, parents, physicians, and until recently just about everyone, but we're trying to fix that now. Condemning ourselves for honest mistakes made in the past (as I do believe a lot of this was, given that being trans is inherently unintuitive to cis people who have never once questioned their AGAB) will only prevent us from moving forward.

Should more people be on them? Almost certainly. But puberty blockers are some of the more invasive medications intended to be given to children. They deliberately disrupt normal development rather than try to maintain it. It is morally and ethically correct to do that for someone who will otherwise wind up trapped in a body which does not match their self-image, but people's concerns about such treatment are not totally unfounded. When you consider how little the average person actually knows about trans people and what they go through, it becomes even more understandable why such resistance exists.

This ignorance is a big part of why I think the mention here is a good thing: people just don't know about puberty blockers! They don't know the difference between puberty blockers and HRT. A lot of seemingly transphobic people just have the incorrect belief that doctors are giving twelve year olds estrogen. If more people understood that the medications given to trans children and those given to trans teenagers are entirely different things with completely unrelated effects, it would be harder for the real bigots out there to influence the concerned citizens who genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We're still very much in the education phase here, so pointing out that these medications exist by using them in a magic system is only a good thing. People just genuinely don't know.

****** It's worth noting that puberty blockers have been used to treat precocious puberty in cisgender children for decades. Indeed, most transition-related medications were used for cisgender patients long before their use in transitioning (e.g. treating endocrine disorders or hormone-responsive cancers, ameliorating menopause symptoms, facilitating puberty).

That fact takes a lot of wind out of the sails of people who oppose the use of these medications. They are far from untested; trans people are usually the last to benefit from their use. People may still oppose them on the grounds of potential desistance or detransition (the incidence of which is greatly overblown), but most of the scaremongering is simply baseless.

As it relates to the story, the only issue is the implication that those seeking increased availability of puberty blockers had an ulterior motive. Given the setting it makes sense that they'd try anything, but I can see how people might dislike that implication.

Personally I thought this part of the story was well-handled, and its inclusion makes a lot of sense (narrative-wise, the pre-teens would have had to have tried /something/ like that). I'm usually wary of potential "hot takes" any time trans people (especially trans children) are mentioned, but this was good.

****** Chiming in to say that this story was the first I've heard of puberty blockers, and found this thread a fairly interesting thing drawing my attention to them
