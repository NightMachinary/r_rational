*PLANNING THREAD*

Since National November Writing Month is coming up in a month, does anyone feel like sharing what their plans are?

I recommend to only give short descriptions of your planned story to be 'accountable' to others to actually write the story and to avoid spoiling everything you planned for the story. Very often people use up their motivation to write when they can instead talk about the story.

The goal of this post is to let people see what story ideas are being created and to ask for advice/suggestions as well as to start planning their stories.

Here's the [[https://campnanowrimo.org/sign_in][NaNoWriMo]] site.

Here's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2gttf1/dbst_anyone_writing_a_rationalist_novel_for/][thread]] from two years ago.

Here's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2isitv/dbst_rananowrimo_prepbrainstorming/][thread]] from last year.

Here's [[/u/alexanderwales]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nqi12/dbst_national_novel_writing_month/][post]] chock full of advice how to actually plan the plot of your story ahead of time.

Happy RaNoWriMo!

EDIT: Here's a link to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/nanowrimo][wiki page]].


** Since I am the original poster, I'll put my story idea out there first.

I'm playing around with a protagonist who has the time travel power of making 'save' points in time and he can reset to that saved time at will and as many time as he likes. The drawback is that he can only have one 'save' and he looses all memories of what happened after the save. He only knows if he is on his first pass of the timeline or if he is on a timeline after resetting at least once. It's an interesting power because it's so deceptively weak.

His antagonist is someone who also has a time travel power where she can receive short messages from the future, but the messages follow the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Novikov Self-Consistency Principle]] that no matter what message she receives, it will be the same message she sends back. I need to do some thinking to explain why deliberately inconsistent timelines will not occur, but I know that paradoxes by their nature simply can't occur, so she'll probably experience something like HPMOR's "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" to set her straight.

I have the early experimentation planned out for both time powers. However, the only thing I'm having issue with this story is a conflict to base the story around. If you guys want suggest anything, I'm all ears! I prefer a Good vs Good conflict and am very flexible with respect to setting (sci-fi, fantasy, or steam-punk).

EDIT: An idle thought I had was to take the idea of soulmates (where everyone has a magical tattoo with their destined one's name) and all that it entails about predestination and subvert the cliche tru-luv!, but I don't really know how to best include it in the story as a /third/ time travel mechanic without it getting messy. I rather have the story focus more on scientific experimentation than on relationship drama anyway.

**** It depends on how EXACTLY the power works, but you can track your loops if you get the "feeling" at the moment of your last reset. Since Xamuel's still in the brainstorming phase, they can choose to make the power work like this.

In that case, each day, or 3 days, or week, I sit down in my chair at 7:55 am and watch my computer clock. At 8:00, if I don't have "the feeling", I set my save point. If I have "the feeling" at 8:00, I will wait to save at 8:01 instead. If I get "the feeling" X time, I'll set my save point to 1 minute past X. Thus, if I get "the feeling" at 8:04 am, I know I've reset my timeline four times this week for some reason. I set my reset at 8:05 am, and I start to brainstorm why I would feel the need to reset my timeline four times.

If you can do this, you can do other things, too. For instance, if you know you have a problem coming up that you might want to reset, you could write out solutions ahead of time, before 8 am on Sunday, and label them. E.g, Loop 1, try X, Loop 2, try Y. (Though in practice, if you get "The feeling" at 8:00 am, you should probably start leaving earlier or later than usual for appointments this week; you might have been caught in a near-death situation like being hit by a car.)

Again, this would assume that if you're in, say, Loop 4, you only get "The feeling" at the moment you started Loop 3. For the purpose of an interesting story, I think it should probably be made to function like this.

**** Exactly. It's an exercise in precommitment, because this power is at it's strongest when it's used exactly once. If it's used twice, then it becomes an infinite loop, because the first and second loop differed with respect to a signal sent from the future, but a second and third loop will be completely identical (due to identical starting conditions) and that leads to infinite loops.

It's a dangerous power and the protagonist is going to be /extremely/ cautious with it.

***** Quantum indeterminacy could mean that an "infinite time loop" does not consist of identical loops.

You have the option of random quantum fluctuations causing the flapping of butterflies wings causing slightly greater drafts causing closed curtains preventing a passerby from seeing a vase in a window and thinking about his mother and being 15 seconds late to a meeting where his color of shirt would cause the protagonist to think about the color blue which means he more focused as he walks down the stairs and so notices the attacker before getting stabbed.

And when we're talking an infinite number of attempts and unrestricted (though improbable) fluctuations, breaking out of the infinite loop is inevitable.

He wouldn't know it, but the reader could, and this would allow some "good luck" with an in-world justification.

****** That's something I could use to justify why the protagonist is never 'stuck' forever in some loop. But if I accept this as a rule for his power, then due to the nature of infinity, from the protagonist's point of view, he will always be 'lucky' and succeed in anything he wants. He'd literally be guaranteed to never fail if he's capable of always resetting until he gets what he wants (assuming I allow auto-resets in the case of death).

It's too 'strong' of a power and I don't see an obvious way to nerf it. Therefore I decided that perfect determinism is a thing and unless the protagonist figures out a way to vary his actions loop-to-loop, he will perfectly repeat what he did in the last loop and get stuck in an infinite loop. It'll be a creeping threat where he's always tempted to reset 'one' more time when he's in dangerous situation, even if he 'forgets' about the threat when he resets.

Also, I'm dealing with non-Turing-computable operations with the Novikov time power, so the laws of physics are not exactly what we know it to be.

******* Eh, a world in which he successfully avoids an infinite loop through extreme caution, and a world in which there's a get-out-clause which will prevent an infinite loop should one otherwise arise, are indistinguishable.

And it's a small jump from successfully avoiding all infinite loops through extreme caution, to mostly doing so aside from some occasional luck. Kind of like how [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] has an in-universe explanation for the early story's apparent plot-armor, this sort of behind-the-scenes mechanic might smooth things for those with just the right style of willing suspension of disbelief.

At any rate.

***** It wasn't the use of time travel that impressed me, it was why it was being used that made the conflict interesting. The characters were given access to a time machine and used it to make changes to their personal history to try and make their lives happier. Even the villains, as nonsensical as I thought their motives were, put the protagonist in a position where he had to choose which of his friends' lives, and quality of life, he valued more.

It was that intense personal nature of the conflict that made it work. I hated the evil conspiracy because the story had nothing to do with investigating a conspiracy, it was a character-focused drama framed around a sci-fi gadget. Adding a rationalist to the story actually would have hurt it because it was their irrationality that made the characters feel human. They were just regular, flawed people trying their best to be happy with mixed success.

#+end_quote

Physically this is easy to justify any number of ways. Mechanically it's a non-issue. Might as well worry about why, in a story with free-will, the characters never choose to just spontaneously start behaving contrary to all your previous characterization. Or, why don't you ever test your freewill by jumping out of your car while driving down the highway? The only consistent scenario is one in which incentives and actions align, but that is nothing novel to your setting. You just need to make sure that the setting is realistic, in that the incentives never fail to align with the actions. The best system is one in which your protagonist never /wants/ to send back different data, but the reasons do not need to follow /directly/ from the message on the note. It is in fact more interesting, and more realistic, if they do not.

So, yes, if your physics says that the protagonist will never successfully send back inconsistent data, then your universe needs to be one in which the protagonist never does so - BUT, this doesn't require anything so heavy-handed as "do not mess with Time." That message served purposes in HPMOR (Harry bullheadedly trying to turn Time to his advantage and only stopping when confronted with threat surpassing his capacity to imagine, together with demonstrating to the reader the insurmountability of the task by practically personifying Time as a potentially malignant and super-powered opponent to any such attempt). Unless your story absolutely needs a similar treatment, it would be infinitely more interesting to produce something more subtle; where, at the time that the character understands why they would have wanted to send back the note and how it will affect things, sending back that note is precisely what they want. Mechanisms include

1. Desireable outcomes outweighing the UnDesireable at the moment the note is sent [but before all of the potentially UnDesireable ramifications are clear]

2. external influences which prevent contradictory note-sending inbetween an incentive to do so and the actual sending [Do Not Mess With Time would fall under this]

3. knowledge that it is impossible to "alter" the past and so an unwillingness to test it at every opportunity [this was the consequence of Do Not Mess With Time]

Out of these, (1) is the cleanest, followed by (3) (absent truly dire threats on the part of Time, (3) is hard to justify), and both trailed by (2). The less that (2) seems external, and the more that it blends into (1) as part of the background information influencing the decision of how to proceed, the better it plays.

This would be facilitated by a hard-coded, Physics based note-sending mechanism that prevents sending notes inbetween the arrival and sending of previous notes, so that incomplete information and inability to intervene remain your tools despite the power afforded by the time messenger's system.

**** Ooo, you seem to have a better understanding of how to explain why my protagonist doesn't try for deliberately inconsistent timelines. I will go with at least one Do Not Mess With Time experience, because like you said, (3)'s hard to justify without at least one such experience. Also, I'm writing the story for you guys and you all will get on my case to why didn't she try it at least once.

She will have a machine that only has two displays for input and output. She will see a note on the output display which will somehow lead to her typing the exact same message when she next types at the input display.

What do you mean by this? She can send her message anytime after she receives the message in question. There's no limitations like HPMOR's Time-Turners' eight hour time limit. Or did you mean the ability to send multiple messages in a different order than she receives them, because she can only send one message at a time.

****** Oh god! I don't want to deal with that headache. It's a lot easier to explain in a visual medium like a movie than in a book. It's to keep things as simple as possible that I'm only allowing one message at a time and she can only receive a new message after she has sent the previous message. It's only barely within my ability to easily conceptualize all of the ramifications of such a power. The multiple message version would be so complicated that I would always be wondering if I screwed something up.

Maybe I'll try that version of time-travel once I have finished writing about the one-message case.

*** An important question to consider about your time travel message power is the question of how frequent these messages will come. There's no causal answer, because the Self-Consistency Principle mandates that the state of the future dictate the state of the past. If your character receives from the future knowledge that she wore a green shirt the next day, it should be entirely within her power to wear blue, but that result is inconsistent with the fundamental mechanics of the universe. It shouldn't even matter if 'she wouldn't disobey her future self', since the /possibility/ that, according to causality, that future doesn't come to pass is at odds with the nature of the time travel. If this is to work properly, the sanctity of the time loop must be 100% certain before causality can be allowed any usage at all.

Instead of a vague 'timeline prime' or anything like that, you can start from an a-causal position, and form a set of sorts, containing every possible universe causally diverging from different time travel events. As in, suppose a TARDIS showed up, you'd have a universe for every thing that could be inside the TARDIS, regardless of how possible it should be for that thing to get there. And I'm talking everything, including a Hitler made of antimatter. The next thing to do is cut away all universes that don't result in the same time travel event that happened at the beginning of the observed period. In this way, you are left with all possible universes that follow the Self-Consistency Principle.

The question here is how to choose one, and when and why they happen. Causality is out of the question, because we have to approach this a-causally to make it make sense, so why isn't your character getting messages that result in blatant Bootstrap Paradoxes and why isn't she getting a message every smallest unit of time theoretically possible? These, I think, are questions that you should explore.

**** u/xamueljones:
#+begin_quote
  why isn't she getting a message every smallest unit of time theoretically possible
#+end_quote

The intuitive answer that makes sense to me is that the events of getting a message can't be treated as independent of each other. Since we are dealing with the type of time-travel where the future explicitly influences the past, then the message you get now is affected by the message you get later the following day, even if you 'sent' the first message before you get the second message.

A timeline where you get the message 'You will have a nice day', send that, and then get the message 'No you won't!' is different from the timeline where you get the message 'You will have a nice day', send that, and then (after three days) get the message 'No you won't!'.

So when my protagonist gets the very first message ever, the entire timeline of every single action she ever does using this power until she dies/stops using the power permanently is predetermined.

So now that I have explained that all messages ever sent has an effect on every other message sent, the only thing left is to explain why one self-consistent timeline is selected over another self-consistent timeline. I feel the best way to do this intuitively is via a probability distribution where each timeline has a prior likelihood chance of occurring and timelines which both better match the timing and the wording of her messages with her personality (and events in the story) have a greater chance of coming true. While she can still receive strange messages which are very unlikely to be sent by herself, they will be accompanied with either her attempting to create inconsistent timelines and/or extreme events such as near-death scenarios where she is 'pressured' to send unusual messages to force the timeline into ones where she stops messing with inconsistency/survives.

#+begin_quote
  blatant Bootstrap Paradoxes
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how to answer this question, since it feels to me that this is something that can happen. But I'm having trouble thinking of a scenario which is a Bootstrap Paradox. Do you mind coming up with one and I can explain why it does or doesn't work? Note that only one message can be sent at a time and a second message can only be received after the first message has been sent.

Hope I explained everything clearly enough.

EDIT: I just did some research into what a Bootstrap paradox is and I realized that "Back to the Future" movie involved one where Marty plays a song from the future at the school dance, but it turns out that he was the original originator of the song. The question is, who was the "inventor" of the song?

Combining it with my earlier discussion about how different self-consistent timelines each have separate probability of coming true (which all sum to 1), I would say that Bootstrap Paradoxes are fully possible, but the spontaneous generation of information requires a probability penalty which decreases the likelihood of it occurring. A very interesting example is the "Do Not Mess With Time" message, because the protagonist had no intention of writing that message, and the very existence of the message is what causes the message to be sent/created in the first place. Therefore the timeline has to be under pressure/in danger of becoming inconsistent, before Bootstrap messages start spontaneously occurring.

Another example I've been playing with is an emergency system, where the protagonist will precommit to sending inconsistent messages when she is in danger of dying. Since this causes pressure on the timeline, she will receive messages that warn her of the danger.

Yes, it gives her an insane amount of power. The story is centered around how one person with a weaker form of time travel can win against someone with a stronger power.

***** With the 'Do Not Mess With Time' message, that warning message is itself a bootstrap paradox, to an extent. In general, any time the person bases the message they send back on the message they received, the information has spawned out of nowhere. Your idea of probability penalties is good, though, and what's notable about Do Not Mess With Time is that while it, after a fashion, created itself, the amount of information being bootstrapped is very small compared to what Harry was hoping for, information that would allow him to solve any code with ease. I can't remember where, but I think Yudkowsky even said once that he built his time turner mechanics around the smallest amount of information from nothing.

What you say about everything being predetermined from the first message... I don't quite grasp it. Unless I'm fatally misunderstanding this, the universe shouldn't care if she's very confused or frustrated with her power. Unless a weighing system is in place to choose one way of going about things (like your Bootstrap Paradox aversion principle), shouldn't every universe in which she only ever receives messages that she will accurately send back be valid, including ones where she gets a new message immediately, always, or never gets a second one to begin with? I mean, this can be avoided by having her prophecies come to her as she requests them, but I've been getting the impression that's not what you're doing, so I'm not sure how you can concoct rules of time that will lead to a frequency of prophecies that wouldn't be out of place.

And as for precommitments, well, the Do Not Mess With Time Travel message Harry got was on the heels of him precommiting to answer in certain ways to the message he got and force the timeline to give him the information he wanted. Assuming a similar level of aversion for the Bootstrap Paradox, shouldn't something similar happen to convince your protagonist to abandon her precommitments instead of giving her information ex nihilo?

****** The predetermined timeline is because we know that between receiving the message and then sending it, the timeline has to be predetermined. I'm simply extending it to the entire timeline, because to me, it doesn't make sense for only part of the timeline to be predetermined and for it to be non-deterministic in between messages. So I'm working off the idea that the entire timeline is deterministic, but it gives the illusion of being non-deterministic, due to people having incomplete information. You can still make a choice and have free-will. It's just that events are determined before you have consciously decided what you are going to do. That's the best I can do to explain that the timeline is globally predetermined rather than in local temporal sections.

Now the Bootstrap Paradox aversion principle I feel has a very strong influence on the timing and the contents of the message. However, I don't feel as if it's enough to explain why some timelines are chosen over others. It minimizes the amount of new information and can be leveraged for more information when the protagonist starts forcing inconsistent solutions otherwise. It also allows for the protagonist to receive messages immediately after sending the previous one. So there can be a 'flood' of meaningless messages which the protagonist then keep sending due to fear of creating inconsistent timelines. However, I consider such a scenario to be unlikely since the protagonist will get annoyed and stop spamming herself with annoying messages.

It's a logical contradiction to create an inconsistent timeline and she literally can't ever make one. Therefore the frequency of sent messages is dependent on how likely she's willing to send the message back. Yes due to the infinite number of possible timelines there will always be some where she sends a new message immediately after the last one, but there are far more timelines where she sends messages as needed rather than as soon as possible. I probably didn't explicitly say this, but she can control when to send a message back as long as it's after she sent the previous message. If there are many timelines where she sends the same message to 8 am with minor variations, and very few timelines where she sends the message at 12:38 pm, then she's more likely to send the message at times convenient for herself at 8 am.

This is a form of time travel that I see as being very strongly dependent on the personality of the user. If you were a fearful person who earnestly believes not sending the messages will lead to death of the universe, then you will be a neurotic mess who constantly sends message after message. My protagonist is a very prideful women (to the point of arrogance) who has confidence in her intellectual faith that inconsistent timelines are truly impossible. In fact, there will be an early experiment where she keeps sending 'test' messages to herself on the heels of the previous message, she will get annoyed and thinks to herself that she won't send the next message before worrying about inconsistency issues. She immediately stops receiving messages, and she will realize that the timing of the messages are dependent on how likely future her will actually send the message.

EDIT: Added the following paragraph.

Due to her willful personality and willingness to send messages despite disturbing warnings, it actually requires a large amount of information to cause her to abandon the ability if it's at all possible. You might be thinking that since the timeline is trying to minimize the amount of information generated from nothing, it will try to get her to abandon the ability. However, she /knows/ time travel is possible and has the will/madness to poke at it despite any time shenanigans to not do so. According to my rules, the most likely timelines should be ones where time-travel is never invented or abandoned immediately. But timelines are selected based on message consistency, which won't prevent the invention of time-travel. Also if people can get past the early experimentation where warning messages to stop messing with time-travel and do so anyway, it will lead to inconsistent messages as people tire of sending warning messages back, and stop doing so. Basically under my rules, there can only be one "Do Not Mess With Time" and after that people are less frivolous with the power.

Gah! It's a little twisty to try explaining how timelines are deterministic, yet can be treated as probability distributions. I decided to try writing the rules down to better formalize it.

*Rules of Time Travel*

1. Inconsistent timelines are impossible.

2. Timelines with higher probability are more likely to occur.

3. Likelihood of a timeline is determined by the number of timelines where the user decides on the same message content and timing. Or in clearer wording, the likelihood of the user sending back the same message she receives. Or is the inverse of the probability the user will make the timeline inconsistent.

4. Timelines are globally deterministic and not locally. All events are predetermined, not just the next few days.

5. Information has a probability penalty which decreases the likelihood of a timeline. Messages with less information generated from nothing have less of a penalty to the likelihood of the timeline.

6. As the number of inconsistent timelines go up, more information can be generated from nothingness to preserve the consistency of the timeline.

Sorry for rambling so much!

EDIT: Added to rule #3. That's going to be the hardest rule to explain in the story.

******* What I was talking about with precommitments wasn't about 'whether to use the power or not' type of precommitment, but a precommitment toward what type of information is sent back. I was hypothesizing that between Harry's plan of a timeline in which he receives information which fits unique criteria from his precommitments that lets the same message be sent back, and the timeline in which he is spooked out of his precommitments and sends a lower-information message back, the lower-information timeline would be more highly weighted. The time travel wouldn't seek to prevent its own use, but instead to minimize bootstrapping within its own use.

Also, and this is the one part I'm still really fuzzy on, there's a principle at work here where the probability of the timeline is directly related to the willingness a person would have to send the message back /if they weren't concerned about consistency/? As in, I know that I would tire of sending test messages back at myself but if I kept receiving them I would always send them back, zealously and without fail, because I know I couldn't violate the consistency. But at the same time, the principle works in such a way that, since I /wouldn't/ care about the message if consistency weren't pushing me to send it, the timeline with that message is weighted less favourably?

******** Shoooot! I wrote a super long post detailing my explanation and it got deleted immediately after I finished typing it all up!!!!

/Inhales, exhales/

First off, your first paragraph lines up with what I was trying to explain about the bootstrap, so you got that right.

The second paragraph...you need to understand that the protagonist has the power to render any timeline she dislikes inconsistent, even if that fact won't be obvious in the story. All we see are timelines where she either approves, or for some reason failed to render it inconsistent.

If she was the sort of person who would always send the message back, regardless of whatever the message says, then all messages have an equal probability of being sent back in time (before we start assigning information bootstrapping penalties). However if she is willing to refuse to send back messages she doesn't like, then she can render the timeline inconsistent and therefore retroactively cause the message to not be sent at all in the first place. That's why if she isn't concerned about consistency, then she can massively affect the probability distribution of the timelines.

Let side track into a brief example of Quirrelmort from HPMOR. If you read the story carefully, you'll notice that he attempted multiple times to prevent the prophecy from coming true. While he failed in the story, it was actually a very good policy. Because if prophecies are like Stable Time Loops, then the timelines where he succeeded will be rendered inconsistent and Quirrel manages to avoid being involved in prophecies. If he never even tried to escape any prophecies, then he would likely be involved in many more prophecies. The likelihood of being in an undesirable timeline increases as the user's willingness to make it inconsistent goes down.

Do you understand that the protagonist's reaction to the message contents and the likelihood that she lets the timeline be consistent or inconsistent affects how likely it is for her to receive the message in the first place?

[[/u/TimTravel]] posted a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xie39/time_travel_and_why_everyone_gets_it_wrong/][link]] about similar mechanics behind Stable Time Loops and he covers a similar example about HPMOR at the end of the post (actually I just stole his).

I need to spend some time thinking about what it would do to the consistency of the timeline if the protagonist lies to herself in the message, because I'm very sure that lying would lead to inconsistency, but I'm not sure yet.

********* I'm still not quite sure I understand the rules about /why/ a time loop message is happening or not, at any given point. The link you have covered the reason behind paradoxes being excluded in good detail, explaining that the universe would skew probability to ensure any timelines which result in paradox do not happen. But one thing, the assumption I'm not 100% certain is being made here, is that each time loop message is being considered an event that could happen or not, and paradox-exclusion behaviours make that specific loop not happen at all, instead of default to a different timeline.

Let me explain. You said that if your protagonist got incessant messages from her future self, always on the heels of the last message, she would refuse to send a consistent message back, and that therefore the message would never have been sent in the first place. But I don't see any reason why no message can happen there anymore. Even if we have to resort to quantum silliness that shapes events in incredibly improbable ways, there should be at least one path of causality where even your prideful protagonist sends a consistent message back. This is a bit different from what I was talking about earlier, but none of your rules seem to cover why a time period /must/ go without a message when there exists at least one timeline in which a consistent message could be sent.

********** Hmm....I think there's a slight misunderstanding about how the probability is being distributed between timelines.

Understand that there ARE timelines where the protagonist gets a message immediately after she has sent the previous message. But there are also timelines where she doesn't and only receives the message the next day. You are seeing points in time such as 2 am and wondering why there are no messages if there's a possible self-consistent timeline that can send a message to 2 am. However if a message appears at 2 am, it invalidates all other timelines where there were NO messages sent at 2 am. If a timeline with a message sent at 8 am has a higher probability than a timeline with a message sent at 2 am, then there will be no messages sent at 2 am, even if it could be a self-consistent timeline.

I see the sequence of messages as a wave where the peak is a point in time where a message is being sent/received and a trough is a point in time where no messages are being sent/received.

Back to the spam messaging example. If the protagonist is likely to get annoyed and stop sending repeat messages to her past self, then she is decreasing the number of timelines with spam messages. Now there are fewer timelines with repeat messages which are consistent, and lowers the overall probability of receiving repeat messages even though there are some consistent timelines left.

I know I'm changing the wording of my explanation here, because before I was talking about each timeline having an individual probability value separate from each other. But I've been doing some thinking and reworking how probability is distributed between timelines. It makes intuitive sense to me that timelines could be reinforcing or destructively interfering with each other so that timelines which are very similar to each other and all are self-consistent are more likely overall than compared to consistent timelines which are very similar to many inconsistent timelines.

*********** Okay, so when calculating which messages are sent the highest priority consistent timeline gets its timespan reserved, for lack of a better word, and any other messages have to fit around the high-priority message. And as the protagonist becomes less inclined to respond consistently to a repeat message, it becomes lower priority and more likely to be displaced by a more highly-rated message.

I suppose, then, the problem is what happens between the 'reserved' time slots? If she gets an 'important' message at 2 PM, sends it back at 4 PM, and gets another high-priority one at at 9 PM, it should be possible to squeeze another message between the two, a consistent timeline in which the message is received after 4 PM and is sent back before 9 PM (say, 7 PM to 8 PM). If there is no higher-priority message to be sent, I've seen no defined reason for that message to not be sent, and the logic would continue onwards, filling every gap of time larger than a minute or so between higher-priority message with lower-priority messages.

************ You see the timeline as 'reserving' points in time for messages and it has the room to fit other messages because the timeline machine isn't being used during the empty time periods.

But I see the messages as being affected by when she does or doesn't get a message. A timeline where she gets a message only at 8 am is different from the timeline where she gets the /exact/ same message at 8 am and another message at 10 am. The timeline with two messages, I consider to, by necessity, to have a lower probability.

Let me try a different line of reasoning. The timelines are like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy][Conjunction Fallacy]] where the probability of a ball is red has to be greater than the probability of a ball being both red and striped. Similarly, when you have two timelines with identical messages, but timeline B also has another message in addition. Therefore timeline A has the higher probability, unless only one message leads to inconsistency and two messages allow consistency (somehow).

Sorry if this is unclear. I'm a little rushed right now.

Is there an inherent limitation of scope to this, or are we considering this superstructure to extend indefinitely forwards? Because if the latter, how is more than one message to be sent if the inherent nature of a second message at any point within the scope would decrease the priority of such a timeline? Is there some sort of accumulating push in the system that forces messages that would, overall, lower total priority after time has passed?

****** I don't think that will be a concern, because it doesn't make sense to me if the ability can affect events unrelated to the time message. I mean, there shouldn't be freak accidents that cause the time machine to send the same message without any input from the antagonist. Instead, the information in the time message has to somehow cause the protagonist to send the exact same message without unrelated events occurring. This means that this form of time travel can't do anything to prevent it's invention and I believe that consistent timelines where people are frightened off investigating the time-travel device shouldn't have higher probabilities than consistent timelines where people use it at a semi-frequent basis. I mean, timelines where people are spooked require a very unusual and unlikely message(s) to be sent.

Now you might wonder what would happen if the protagonist decides to force only inconsistent timelines. She can do so by sending a blank message if she gets a message with text, sending a text message 'Experimental Message' if she gets a blank message, sending a blank message if she gets no message, and to follow the previous three conditions no matter what message she sees. My reasoning is that messages can affect the contents of earlier messages, so if she is just deciding to try an experiment to force inconsistent timelines only and hasn't yet come up with the details of the experiment, then she will start receiving messages warning/scaring her out of trying the experiment. In fact, I'm planning a spooky thing where as she comes up with the idea, she'll get a message to check the first letter of every previous message ever sent and the letters spell out "WE ARE WATCHING YOU" or something like that.

  I'm playing around with a protagonist who has the time travel power of making 'save' points in time and he can reset to that saved time at will and as many time as he likes. The drawback is that he can only have one 'save' and he looses all memories of what happened after the save.

About memory loss being the same as death, it's an interesting philosophical question about whether or not losing memories truly counts as killing yourself. Because while I agree that forgetting the last five years of your life would be murder since I'm a different person from the me of five years ago, however if you only forget the last five minutes, hours, or days, it doesn't feel as if I'm really killing myself. I mean, if you lose the same memories due to being drunk or a concussion and only a small number of memories were lost, would you consider the person before and after the memory loss to be different people?

Finally, in most of the 'discarded' loops the protagonist is going through, he is spending the time testing out the consequences of different actions (passwords to a bank account), doing mind-numbing amount of research to learn about some important information in time, or to learn about some important future event to gain some foreknowledge. Most of this will be boring or unimportant to remember. If you forgot non-essential memories such as what you ate for breakfast, and remembered important information such as your parents' names, wouldn't that lessen the chances of you becoming a different person after losing such trivial memories?

There has to be a major twist somewhere, or you wouldn't be writing it.

Limelight is a a unique and original take on both fantasy and superheroes that rationalizes the romanticized narratives of both genres in a uniquely meta way, but it does not deliver a traditionally satisfying narrative. Every single character is an actor playing a role for a fictional audience, so their real lives are purposefully written to be less interesting than their dramatized ones in order for the story to work.

Adjusting medication has never been a fun time for me, but it's either that or just keep taking it forever.

But if I /do/ take part in NaNoWriMo, I'll probably work on the rational Doctor Who serial I've been planning. It's a somewhat loose take on canon, which is notoriously poor with consistency. I'm hoping to tighten up the mechanics and nail down some of the setting to make it more rational.

I can probably answer questions about it, but I haven't come up with a spoiler-free way to summarise the plot.

Suffice it to say that this Doctor will be a lot more interested in bettering the universe than the canon version, who is mostly content to slay dragons while literal billions are dying in agony at all times due to causes unrelated to the monster of the week.

Naturally, this task is a lot harder than "come up with a brilliant solution at the last minute like always". It's harder even than the Doctor thinks, because he's not the only time-travelling immortal out there with designs on the universe.

**** Spoilers ahead for people who haven't seen Doctor Who (mostly the new batch of seasons).

In canon, the Doctor has a lot of different characterisations, all of whom have essentially the same goals (i.e. travel with one or more companions and defeat the monster of the week). This is his status quo even after events that ought to have changed his approach.

E.g. his planet and species being destroyed by nigh-unstoppable aliens that he subsequently eradicated---except not well enough, because this existential threat to the universe keeps reappearing (as does the rest of his Rogue's Gallery, to borrow a term). Despite this, he is happy to wait for the next potential armageddon before doing anything.

Working backwards from his actions to estimate his motivations, we'd have to conclude that the canon Doctor craves the adventure, even after seeing what his failure to act ahead of time can do to the things he loves.

The second question is trickier. I'm planning to stick with the standard Doctor Who formula ("episodes" within larger arcs, with an overarching story theme). There will be the occasional Doctor PoV chapter where we see what he's actually doing, as well as hints throughout the other chapters.

The idea is that his adventures in the "main" chapters are his way of taking a break from the more boring work, and represent significant events and/or data for his larger goals.

Genre of each chapter will vary like the show's episodes do. Most of them will feature some sort of reason that "get in the Tardis and fix everything" won't work (a little more transparently than the show, where it's arbitrary and usually not mentioned so it can be a deus ex machina when it's needed).

I'm going to sleep now, so I can respond more thoroughly tomorrow.

***** I like your answer to the second question, but not the first. The Doctor is no paragon of altruism, but he never willfully chooses to not help people when he can. The reason his enemies keep surviving is because they're worthy opponents to him, not because he's unwilling to stop them permanently.

One thing that I think HPMOR did better than every other rational story I've read is that it acknowledges how unusual the psychology of munchkinism actually is. HJPEV is not a normal person and his worldview is as much an asset to him as it is a hindrance. He's really smart, but not always right.

So many stories I read here treat "world optimization" like its the obvious course of action that any smart person would follow, but it isn't. It's the product of a view of reality different from the norm that can be really useful, but is not universally better. Even HJPEV admitted he had much to learn from Hufflepuff.

*** Doh! I mistyped and put down 'ten days' for next month instead of 'in a month'. Thanks for the catch!

I'm posting about this early, because some people won't think about the event until they get an external remainder such as a [[/r/rational]] post. At that point it's hard to plan out story ideas within a week without being discouraged. I'm hoping by posting about this a month in advance, people will be better motivated to write and plan the story.

I'll post about the event again when there's only a week left, but if people think I should take it down, then I will do so.

We could always use more writers on this subreddit! ;)

** I'm considering resurrecting [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111][rules of wishing]] and first finishing it off with a concluding chapter (which I've been intending to do for literally months) and then taking it apart and trying to fill in the gaps so that it actually covers the whole plot of the movie instead of just a collection of fragmented scenes.

Obviously this is not how you're "supposed" to do NaNoWriMo but I don't really care. :-)

This may all fall apart as a plan though as the rest of the year is looking likely to be very busy.

This one is a blend of a magical school story (stylistically similar to Mother of Learning) and a JRPG-style uber dungeon crawl. It's got a pretty heavy focus on magic theory and making magical items, which I think the [[/r/rational]] crowd will probably enjoy.

** I've been thinking of stretching my writing muscles again with a near-future horror story set in the asteroid belt.

Still in the early, early, early planning stages at this point so not much is set in stone, but I want a protagonist who decides that the future is taking too long to arrive, steals a mining ship his company is working on, and takes his family out to the belt to prove there are untold riches waiting for humanity to reach out and take them. And then they're all horribly killed by monsters for my own sick pleasure.

*** Do you need monsters to write space horror?

I'd be interested in a story where it's just the (underestimated) dangers of living on space that threaten, made worse by the stubborn protagonist and other personality clashes. In space, character and environment are threats enough to dispense with an antagonist - and as /The Martian/ shows, you don't even need character threats.

You could have monsters and be very carefully ambiguous as to whether they really exist...

** I've always considered NaNoWriMo, but I wish it was January or February because November is always a terrible month for me (exams, weddings, buying/moving houses, and so on).

I want to finally novelise my "supernatural romance" story, and it'd be cool to get rational elements into it, but, honestly, it's just a vanity project with roleplaying characters me and my bff have had since we were 14, so I'm not sure anyone but our parents and partners would be interested in it.

So, maybe I'll do it in January or February, I don't know much about NaNoWriMo, can you just.... declare some other month your own personal one?

Does anyone have ideas on how to make a "supernatural romance" type story rational? It's a GLBT / feminist twist on the genre, but given it's more about relationships than "let's go destroy cthulu, who is taking over the world", is there much way that it can be made "rationalist"? We've been avoiding and subverting common tropes, especially the kind where the whole plot existing depends in a misunderstanding, but I'm not sure anything about it, beyond my own rationalist leanings, would ever be able to make such a story appropriate for this subreddit.

*** The only example I know of that comes close is the webcomic El Goonish Shive. Supernatural elements play a large part in the characters lives, but the majority of the comic is just slice of life drama with only occasional adventures. The way it pulls off rational romance is that all the characters are intelligent enough to ALWAYS talk to each other about their feelings, and empathetic enough to ALWAYS help each other through their problems. Expect plenty of anime-esque comedy, though.

The comic is a little long, it's been updating for over ten years, but I think it's a great example of a rational teen drama involving LGBT themes and the supernatural. The only problem is that it doesn't start out that way. The first few chapters aren't bad, they're just nothing exemplary since the author was still inexperienced. You can't just skip ahead, though, since you need the background to understand what's going on even if EVERY stupid or uncreative idea gets retconned away.

**** Thanks for the webcomic recommendation! I'll have to check it out too.

I agree on having characters communicate. As a polyamorous person, communication and situations where it seems all the people concerned would be OK with polyamory but just dismiss the idea are my two romance story pet peeves, and I am very much on board with putting them aside.

Something I think probably exemplifies the types of stories we might tell:

A character is a 5,000 year old gargoyle and he romances a human woman. He is a good boyfriend, but he often goes on about how fragile humans are, how he can't wait to comfort her in her old age, how humans are so young and naive and such, and she's not cool with that. So they break up (after he tries to propose, because drama is always fun). She explains her concerns and, after trying to reason with her a few minutes, he sort of smiles and nods and apologises for wasting her time.

So then he goes and starts romancing a human man, still doing the same faux-pas, only the man doesn't mind because he's got different values to the woman - he even says "um, he's a five thousand year old fifteen foot tall monster who can fly. He /is/ better than humans".

No misunderstandings, no putting up with a lover with flaws, and no creepy "I will win her back at any cost!". After all, to a 5000 year old person, dating someone for a year is like you or I going on a few dates with someone. A first date is like a tinder conversation. He is not going to feel invested enough in a partner to do anything dramatic if it is clear they don't want him.

***** I buy it, though the kind of romance stories I like is where being together leads to character growth and makes them better people. One of the relationships in EGS is a little like yours, though the supernatural character's quirks are more due to her upbringing instead of her nature.

The only exception I can think of is her sexuality, which the author actually apologized for when he realized his definition of bisexual was too restrictive. In no way did it hurt the character or the romantic arc, it was just a label and it was rectified it in-universe.

#+end_quote

Yeah, another couple involves a lot of that - very timid, low self esteem sort of guy coming out of his shell. Good point about character growth in relationships, I will consider that carefully. I'm probably going to try for JaNoWriMo (january).

It's hard to have couples change though when many of my characters are multiple thousands of years old. I just don't see a personality changing that drastically, though I did do some drabble yesterday about a vampire coping with the fact that his relationship with his lover had changed ever since he turned him, which I suppose comes into it.

Actually... there's a lot of that stuff in there. Hmm. Thanks for that. Not sure if what I just said made any sense but you made me think and that's always a good thing!

** I plan to do Nano, but am still not sure which of two ideas I'm going with. One is based on djinn with relatively limited power, which will involve at least one djinni 'owner' questioning the morality of slavery, the dangers of setting free non-human powerful entities, and how best to munchkin wish granting spells invented in much earlier times (e.g. the door opening spell gives you a 'key' that opens all locks that are locked with a keyhole - so no good for combinations or rfid scanners) Two is a world where some people get to live their lives over again - i.e. not reincarnation, but actually going back to when they were a baby and reliving the same years. Since this is effectively the same world as The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August it would effectively be a fanfic of that.

I don't know how rational either would end up, though there will definitely be munchkinry and hopefully a lack of people being egregiously stupid or pointlessly evil.

Neither idea yet has a decent antagonist or enough conflict, which is a problem :-(
