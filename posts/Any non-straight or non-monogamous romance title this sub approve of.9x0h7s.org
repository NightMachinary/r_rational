So I've never read a romance story before, besides those where a 14-year-old gets summoned to another universe, and I'm curious what it would be like.

Do people in this sub enjoy romance? Do you know any romance-ish stories you thought most in this sub would approve? I'm looking for gay romance, or one where one of the main boy is a blondie with blue eyes and preferably long hair.

** If not for the gay specification, I would have said Kyon: Big Damn Hero for polyamory. With that specification added, you're asking the wrong person, but even I have heard of and read into the Toasterverse.

If you don't mind small doses of gay pretty-boy romance mixed with larger doses of grimdark, there is Magic‘s Pawn and Magic's Price, the first and last books of the Vanyel Ashkevron trilogy.

None are especially rationalfic, but I'd consider their writing a notch above the rest. Kyon isn't ambitious enough to be acting sanely in his position, but he is reflective in a way that makes him feel a little more real.

*** There is a rational fic of Magic's Pawn.

Hang on while I go find the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13579596][link]]. It's been +slow on updates+ going nine months (~360K words so far) but it's good. Would recommend for rational romance, in general, not just homosexual rational romance.

I don't know if it reads well without familiarity with Lackey's original (which was brilliant when I was a teen/tween but recently caused me to be super annoyed because of oblivious and very poor decision making on the MC's part), mostly because I read Last Herald Mage so early that I can't imagine not knowing that story.

Edit: added link and explanation of why YMMV with/without familiarity with the original. Edit 2: corrected and quantified update assertion + formatting because dyac.

Updated comment to not say slow updates. You're right--- at like 11K words a week (12 K? 10 K?) it's not slow. The good news is that I have binge-worth stuff to read. The bad news is that it isn't the weekend.

** Shameless self plug:

I've been working on a rational fic called "Earthlings: People of the Dawn". The protagonists of parts 2 and 3 are both men who end up in a relationship by the end of part 3. They're not pretty boys, but if you're looking for rational gay romance, you're not going to find many other options. There simply aren't enough people writing rational fiction.

If you want a taste of how this plays out here's an excerpt for you (*WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD*):

#+begin_quote
  When they reached the prison, they were told there wasn't enough room to hold them there, so they had to be transferred to a different prison in San Francisco. Once they arrived they were quickly moved to a cell. It had two beds and nothing else.

  Bertie gulped. “Well, since we're going to die soon and I've never...um....would it be okay with you if we...?”

  Fred turned to look at Bertie, a blank, dead, hollow feeling in his heart.

  /I've failed/, he thought. Judging by the look on Bertie's face, he surely felt the same way. Fred sat down heavily on one of the hard, uncomfortable beds. It creaked loudly in protest.

  He waited as Bertie just stared at him with regret and hesitation.

  Finally, Fred lost his patience and snapped, “/Come on,/ it's not like there's anything else left to do.”

  Bertie flinched. Fred felt like an asshole.

  “I'm sorry,” he said wearily. “This isn't your fault. None of this is. I'm just angry at everything because our conspiracy was discovered and we're about to die. I'll try not to snap at you, but if I do, please don't take it personally.”

  “You didn't say yes,” Bertie blurted. “And I didn't really finish asking the question.”

  Fred sighed. “Yes, obviously.”

  Bertie opened his mouth, then closed it. Then opened it again...

  “Spit it out,” said Fred, “Sorry, just --”

  “It's okay,” said Bertie. “What do you want to do? Specifically, I mean.”

  Fred sighed. “This isn't a legal contract, Bertie. We're both about to die, and the longer we wait the less time we'll have left. Let's just figure things out as we go, okay?”

  Bertie nodded and slowly approached him. Fred reached out to gently pull the other man closer...

  The cell door opened. Bertie and Fred hastily sprang apart.

** It's not really a rational story, but [[http://sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=1][Stand Still Stay Silent]] is a great read that prominently features /what can be interpreted as/ a developing romance between a very blond boy with longish hair and an ash-blond boy, also with longish hair. Nothing explicitly romantic on the page as of yet (which I know is a bummer when you're looking for representation), and I don't read it that way myself, but they share a lot of sweet/intimate moments and a romantic interpretation of their dynamic is both wholly plausible and very popular among the readership. I'll try to think of something that more closely fits your specifications, but that's the closest that comes to mind right now.

*** Love doesn't necessarily mean irrationality; it could just be choosing a different set of priorities. For instance, consider the friendship between our protagonists in /Animorphs: The Reckoning/ (or just about any other fic, but /Reckoning/ is a ratfic that does it really well from multiple perspectives).

Or, for a different angle, /[[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]]/ is a ratfic of the infamous /Twilight/ where our protagonist recognizes that magically-enforced love is irrational - but she still rationally chooses to get into it to pursue her broader goals, and rationally plans around it.

*** Um, have you seen a romantic comedy where there's hilarious misunderstandings that cause breakups because people won't talk? That's what's getting fixed. In my RL normal love life it's actually pretty rational. People can act sensibly or not in love and media is full of people acting non-sensibly.

(I was writing a rational gay supernatural romance story but that's on hiatus as my coauthor has backed out and i'm trying to work out if i have the heart to continue with it. Unfortunately we didn't get to "finish"/edit the parts of the story that contain the 'rational romance', but if anyone wants to PM me I'll give you access to the google docs and you can see it in all its half-finished glory)
