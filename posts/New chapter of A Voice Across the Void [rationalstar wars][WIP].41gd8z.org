The new chapter is [[http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/134448479197/ch-7-always-in-motion][here]]. Previous chapters are [[http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818575647/a-voice-across-the-void][here]]. If for some reason you prefer to read on ff.net, the link is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10740793/1/A-Voice-Across-the-Void][here]].

The next chapter will be quite short (~1000 words) and I should be able to produce it much quicker.

** MOAR!

Seriously, that was awesome. Quite the cliffhanger there.

Somehow I didn't figure out what the solution to the chapter 5 puzzle was. Since I didn't realize that the place the "peace negotiations" would be taking place was the jedi temple. Did it say that somewhere earlier in the story?

*** Thank you! Its not the Jedi temple though, just a temple on the planet where the Ulth & Plessians live. It was stated earlier (chapters 4 and 5) that Nimbo and the rest of his padawans are living there (presumably for the duration of the negotiations).

** Wait, wait, wait. The two opposing sides have a history of bitter rivalry and simmering tensions, and the main character thinks that killing both royal families in a loud and messy assassination /won't/ act as the spark that sets off the conflagration?

What is he, an idiot?

*** The real issue is /blame/ for the assassination -- if the two sides could be convinced that some third party is to blame, this should only give them only solidarity with each other. This is not much of a stretch, given that the bomb targeted both sides in equal measure, and keep in mind that Noval's plans on how to manage the post-explosion situation have not been revealed in this chapter. Finally, previous chapters indicated that the royal families are the ones driving the conflict in the present time.

** Looking forward to the next chapter. Hopefully the monstrous motivated cognition at the end of this one will not become the norm for the protagonist. Although seeing him realise he screwed everything up because he liked that one girl would be satisfying as well, now that I think about it.
