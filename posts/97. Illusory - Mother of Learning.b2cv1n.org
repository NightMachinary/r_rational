***** I don't think he goes around killing people for fun. IIRC, he has reasons when he kills.

Is he sociopathic? AFAIK, many people in leadership positions are sociopathic to some extent.

In any case, sociopaths are always reasonable. Selfish reasons, it's true, but so long as you don't get in their way, they can always be reasoned with. Of course, you still need to be careful of a knife in the back.

The unreasonable ones are the emotional people, the hysterical ones and the so-called good samaritans. The emotional ones act on their whims and fancies and are often hard to predict. The hysterical ones act out of their fears, misunderstandings and delusions. Even when they seem calm and reasonable, you never know when they'll suddenly explode.

Many good Samaritans actually act for their own self-satisfaction. They'll always say it's for your own good and force their help on you. But very often, they don't really care about the results. They may often abandon the task halfway, leaving you hanging and your schedule in shambles. Or force you to accept their help/advice now, because it's always so urgent and important, forcing you to abandon your existing plans and projects which are actually better than what they want for you. Even if there is no direct cost to you, they often don't care who they trample or sacrifice in the process. If/when shit happens, they have all kinds of excuses lined up - karma for Buddhists, God's Will for Christians, you/no one told them, etc.

****** I don't think you need to find killing fun to be considered murderous, also those that find it fun have their reasons too, such as “it's fun” which is arguably just as valid as “they were in my way while I was trying to gain world domination”.

******* I believe the reason for killing to be important. If done for a proper objective or as part of a strategic goal, or when there is legal backing, it should not be considered murderous. Otherwise, soldiers in war and executioners of death row prisoners would have to be classified as murderers.

I'd argue that the lich doesn't kill without reason, as far as I can remember. He might have killing intent against his targets, or feel murderous rage facing his attackers, but that doesn't make him murderous.

That said, the word murder and the variants derived from it have too much emotional luggage attached and the detailed meanings seem to vary in different contexts. E.g. many pacifists seem to consider all forms of killing humans to be murder, even in self-defense or when legally sanctioned, even when the killer isn't even human. In legal terms, the definitions are more precise and I think the emotions are excluded. While in literature, the meaning is whatever the author thinks he can get away with in order to dramatize his writings even more.

*a:* having the purpose or capability of murder

[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murderous][(Merriam-Webster)]]

Therefore he's murderous in some sense of the word - but I do believe that the reason for killing is important, but not relevant for our discussion about being murderous or not.

** So Zorian's Plan with the mental landscape is to trick Zach into thinking everyone who knows about the loop is dead, right? We know it's based on his perception due to how he determines who to kill and who to mind-wipe, I can't think of any other reason to train this ability at the last moment.

Edit: Also, We know that it is fairly lifelike Spear of Resolve knew because she was paying attention and is an expert at mental enhancement, but it shouldn't be able to fool Soul Sight, should it? So that means it will have little practical purpose in battle, considering who they're up against, but Soul Sight is an active ability, so Zach probably wouldn't have it activated all the time.

Then trounces everyone in one to one combat while having highly specialised plans for everything he can't tackle personally. Still without killing anyone important. He'll bring the government to its knees, only to be stopped by an insanely overpowered Kirielle trained by Zach and the Angels.

#+end_quote

I'm not so sure about that. It's most probable, because Zach is the easiest to fool. His incapability in soul magic and relatively low competency in mind magic made elaborate illusion worthwhile to pull. But nobody said it would be used as momentary distraction. Zorian love distraction. Remember the soul severing disc, both as small projectiles and platform that activates on notice? Both are just distraction for full blast dispelling wave and do-or-die mind incursion against Quatach Ichl.

****** Key question - is the contract only checked/verified at the end of the month and never more? Because then they have to trick themselves just for that one particular moment/day.

Honestly, I'm not sure. The geas on Zach's soul is to kill or otherwise deal with anyone who performs mind magic. The geas is also to kill himself/die if there is anyone who knows about the timeloop still alive. The geas on the other two is that they free the primordial, or they die at the end of the month. But who does the checking? In Zach's case, it's his perception. In RR and SL's case, we dunno. SL actually literally says that she wiped her mind of the contract however she can still feel it in her soul.

The angels did say one thing interesting though - they said that they (the angels) are not the primordials and (I guess contrary to the primordials) the angels are not powerless on the material planes. So the primordials can't affect things in the material world, ergo the contract Pan has with RR and SL needs to have a self checking geas, cuz the primordial can't make any on the fly decisions. It's a simple algorithm.

​

All this to say that I'm not sure, but if the checking mechanism is their perception, then it's theoretically possible. however, both RR and SL are incredibly suspicious and paranoid so I don't think they would ever trust anyone to take over their minds and illusion them out.

A primordial being unleashed and with angels coming out is an extinction-level event that could directly impact him.

QI spending another hundred years subverting the governments of the continent to set the stage for his plans seems a small price to pay to avoid primordial play-time fallout.

An idea you want to keep in hand would be something that could be countered and acts like a counter itself. For example having a double agent would be something you wouldn't reveal, but 30 dragons is a lot harder to keep secret and worth just as much revealing as keeping secret.

***** I feel both Zorian's small talk with Quatach Ichl and his date with Spear of Resolve are up to par. Plots (Quatach Ichl reluctance to stay back and Zorian mind wipe strategy) developed smoothly there. Inclusion of Novelty, on the other hand, felt forcefully attached. I actually surprised people hyped about it.

****** I feel like the ending of each chapter of MoL usually has to have some sort of revelation, twist, or otherwise cliffhanger. Novelty might have been forcefully attached to adhere to this trend.
