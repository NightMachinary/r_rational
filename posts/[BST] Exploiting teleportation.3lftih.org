What are some clever and creative ways to exploit teleportation?

(You can teleport anywhere you can imagine, you can bring some amount of matter and even people with you).

P.S.

Somewhere on this subreddit, a guy summarized all cool tricks and ideas from the Jumper novels, but unfortunately I can't find that post.


** *Spoilers for all of the /Jumper/ series (which I think are worth the read):* [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2sgf95/mkbst_teleportation/cnpjlqs][this post]] is probably the one you're thinking of.

** Universal transportation like this is probably most easily exploitable as a means of setting up space infrastructure. Make a deal with NASA or ESA or your local space agency of preference, to take payloads up to geostationary for even just a tenth or a hundredth of the cost of a rocket (get lower and start taking on 'charity' jobs once you have enough money to be comfortable the rest of your life,) and you'll be rich beyond your wildest dreams while helping humanity explore space and colonize the planets.

If teleporting into the middle of something doesn't kill you (let's say that it causes you to swap places with a person-shaped piece of whatever you're teleporting into) then there are obvious applications here for deep-core mining, asteroid mining, and espionage if you absolutely /must/ lead a life of danger.

Depending on how much matter you can take with you, this may also be a means of practically creating negentropy/infinite energy: Take a big heavy thing, make a generator with some sort of bucketed vertical treadmill that can take the heavy thing and turn its fall into electricity, and teleport the heavy thing to great height to let it fall over and over again.

****** Mmhmm, and I'm glazing over a lot of detail and carefulness in favor of laying out general goals.

Like, how would you /test/ whether you can safely teleport into matter? I'd probably do it by first seeing if I can teleport 'in place' (For example, see if I can teleport from a sitting position to a standing one) and if I could, I would try teleporting myself so my hand has the tip of its pinky inside of a small rock. Worst case scenario, it hurts like hell and I need minor surgery.

If it works, see if it works on larger scales; try intersect-teleporting a couple of fingers, then a hand, then a leg, and so on. Test everything /carefully/

********* Yup. Teleportation isn't exactly a well-known science; the result could be anything.

Well, nearly anything - presumably teleporting into a volume of air doesn't make you explode or become fatally radioactive. The most likely scenario is that you swap volumes, so teleporting into solid matter would just mean that you get embedded in it and a statue of yourself appears at your source point. (And if you teleported into a load-bearing solid, you might get crushed because you've removed a critical volume of concrete or steel holding up tons of pressure.)

Likewise, probably not a good idea to teleport into extremely deep water (pressure) or hostile environments without a suitable environment suit.

** Like many of these questions, it all depends on the rules of the world you are in, and on things you haven't specified, like:

1) What happens when you port to somewhere that changes your potential energy? (i.e. nearly everywhere)

2) What happens to your velocity vector when 'at rest' where you arrive is different from where you left?

3) Do you have to touch things to bring them with you? Can you port part of a solid object?

4) What happens to air/water/solid objects in the volume you are porting in to?

You'll get whole families of different things to do based on different answers to these questions.

For a few tricks by a teleporter in a story I'm currently working on, see what Journeyman does here: [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/128307010576/the-makers-ark-chapter-9]]

What's the use of that?

*** Or the opposite, by teleporting out important things like heart valves, chunks of regulatory brain material, the top of the spinal cord, part of the wall of the stomach or large intestine, part of the blood-brain barrier... Or teleporting /in/ a few cc of poison or coagulant.

Or drizzling 70% pure alcohol into their stomach while they're driving or flying a plane. Contaminate it with vodka or moonshine or something else extremely alcoholic, drop some empties into the vehicle... any investigation would determine that no-one else had been in the vehicle, there was no sign of struggle, the vehicle was not compromised in any way etc. Still potentially very suspicious, particularly if they didn't drink much, but pretty much impossible to trace back to you if you could do it from miles away.

** What are the parameters?

- How far can you teleport?\\
- How far can you teleport /upwards/?\\
- What can you and can't you take with you? (Mass/size/material limits)\\
- Can you teleport something without teleporting yourself, or is going along for the ride mandatory?\\
- Is there a refractory period? (i.e. you can't teleport within X seconds/minutes/hours of teleporting)\\
- Are there any other limits, such as not being able to teleport controllably around certain materials or locations, not being able to teleport accurately over large distances etc?\\
- Are you teleporting as a super power, or with the assistance of external devices/magic/phlebotinum?\\
- Can you teleport from anywhere to anywhere, or only to/from certain locations? Can you add another location to the list? How long does this take / how much prep work?

Minor questions:

- Can you reorient yourself during a teleport (i.e. if you are facing one direction, you can come out of it facing another direction or standing on your head if you like)?\\
- Can you change body position during a teleport (like going from sitting to standing)?\\
- Can you dump inertia? (for example, going from falling off a cliff to standing at the bottom of it without splatting yourself)?\\
- If you can't dump inertia, can you reorient it within the same reference frame? (going from falling /down/ to falling /up/ without having to teleport to the other side of the planet)?\\
- Is your departure or arrival marked by anything that would be detectable either by human senses or artificial sensors? (bright light, whoosh sound, minor thunderclap, sulfurous smell, gravity blip as your mass disappears)?

All these things are going to affect which tricks you can pull off effectively.

**** By special relativity, FTL is necessarily time travel. How far back in time you go depends on your FTL speed, your sublight speed, and how far you jump. This is a spacetime diagram:

#+begin_example
  0t   0.5t   1
  |    /     '
  |    /    '

  |/ '  //    
  |/' //      
  /'//        
  A/----------0s
#+end_example

The line marked 0t is the time axis, measured at rest, with the future going up. The line marked 0s is the space axis, measured at rest. The line marked 1 represents the speed of light, moving at one lightsecond per second away from the origin. The remaining lines are the space and time axes measured in a reference frame moving away from the origin at 0.5c. The fact that these axes are skewed is an inescapable fact about the nature of reality: space and time are relative.

Teleportation is instant. You move exactly parallel with your space axis, appearing and disappearing at the same moment in time, without interacting with the intervening space. You start at rest at the origin, at spacetime point A. You wait a while without moving, ending up at point B. Then you instantaneously teleport to point C, disappearing and reappearing simultaneously. At point C, you accelerate to 0.5c, instantly, somehow, by non-teleporting means. You brought a really good engine with you or something. Finally, you try to teleport back to point B. You move exactly parallel with your /new/ space axis, appearing and disappearing at the same moment in time according to your /new/ time axis. You end up at spacetime point A, which is the same point in space as B (according to a rest observer), but earlier in time. Every reference frame agrees that you just telefragged yourself.

***** It's not past from every perspective; it's past from some perspectives which do not include your own.

Example: You teleport in a fraction of a second from Earth to Mars, which is about three light-minutes away at closest approach. You are now outside your previous light cone. You wait a minute and teleport back. If you were carrying a clock, it still agrees with Earth time, and the local school has you arrested.

However, an observer who is two-thirds of the way to Mars from Earth will see events on Mars from one minute in the past and events on Earth from two minutes in the past. From their perspective, they see you on Earth, then you also appear on Mars /at the same time/. A minute later, you vanish from both planets, and a minute after that, you arrive back on Earth. From the perspective of the observer, you traveled back in time because you were apparently in two places simultaneously, due to lightspeed lag.

However, from your own perspective, you cannot at any stage access previous points on anyone's timeline once you have interacted with it. You can outrace light, but you cannot prevent a signal being sent if you act after you see it being sent. You can take a message from Earth to Mars and back in one second instead of six minutes, but you can't do it in negative one second. The only 'time travel' is purely perceptual, and only by observers external to yourself.

Looks like I put the decimal in the wrong place. And come to think of it, I'm pretty sure I got t' mixed up. If t is the lab reference frame and t' is your moving reference frame, it should be

0 = (t'-(0.1c)(4 ly)/c^{2})/√(1-0.1^{2})

t'-(0.1c)(4 ly)/c^{2} = 0
