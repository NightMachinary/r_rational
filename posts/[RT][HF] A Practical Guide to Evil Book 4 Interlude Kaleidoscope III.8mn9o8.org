that would require callow to "jump" over either daoine or praes to "annex" the steppes.

that kind of bordergore is basically tempting fate to call a bunch of crusades to fix that issue.

**** I don't think it would be that far out of left field for Daoine to come back into the Callowan fold. The Duchess of Daoine has had a front row seat to Cat doing some ridiculous stuff and is cooperating fully with repelling this Crusade, which probably wouldn't have directly been a problem for Daoine anyway. She's acknowledged that Cat has Deoraithe blood too. The Grey Pilgrim thinks that she's becoming personally loyal to Cat.

**** You're on.

My prediction:

It'll be the standard tactic of one side retreating to double up the other, except Procerans can't give chase because buried munitions. What's more, The Callow army are relatively free to use the Marshland too because they're the one's with the repeating siege engines.

Portals are a viable strat destpite cat being dead, so one side of the Proceran host can be sandwiched, then munitioned up. The remaining quarter is attacking the priests(they're +Indriani, to mess with the Rogue dude). That one 'Possibly Assasin' dude from the chapter before might also come into play somehow, and Hakram might level up from all the fighting.

Who's to say what is statistically improbable in Guideverse? If you have to, just imagine that Dread Empress Malodorous I, the Desperately Horny, really wanted to increase her pool of potential partners and dumped something in the water a thousand years ago thereby altering the course of Praesi genetics forever. Call it a day.

Anyway, the only confirmed lesbian I can recall is Malicia, maybe Killian (she could still be bi, I think). Cat is bisexual (although she definitely seems to prefer women) and Archer is pansexual. There's like fifty recurring characters in this story. Probably more. Throw in Warlock (gay), Tikiloshe (pan), and Masego (asexual), and the number of LGBTQ characters is still way less than ten percent of the characters, although they do make up a fair chunk of the main cast. I don't recall any trans or genderqueer folks though, especially not in the main cast.

Everything else, like this Juniper passage, is just ship teasing. Aisha was boinking Ratface anyway, so she's probably straight. Cat's also our most frequent PoV, and she eyeballs every lady she sees; it's not necessarily reciprocated, as we saw with Princess Rozala.

This calls to mind the complaints that too many of the important and competent characters are women in proportion to men.

Honestly, we've had so many stories that totally lack this kind of representation. It's not a big deal to tip the scales the other way every once in a while. Even if Guideverse had precisely the same historical demographics as our universe, outliers happen. The main cast doesn't have to perfectly line up with the most statistically probable distribution of anything.

I hope we see General Abigail by the end of this. Is desecrating enemy corpses a war crime in this universe? It is in ours, but we don't have major powers that employ orcs in their professional armies. Anyway, it'd probably be a mercy to just get eaten by the damn orcs, since you know everyone else is gonna become part of Cat's undead reserve forces.

Edit: oh yeah, Malicia also sleeps with Ime, but she could be bi or Malicia-sexual, since evidently everyone in the Guideverse is.

**** I'm not going to go through the whole story again to confirm, but I'd say the reason the proportion of lesbians in this story feels high (to me, and a bunch of people who upvoted me) is that while the proportion of characters mentioned as lesbians to total female characters is low (something like 1/10?), the proportion of lesbians/bi characters to female characters whose sexuality is mentioned at all is high (I'd say at least 1/2 or 1/3).

Also, most characters whose sexuality is mentioned are female, which might be part of the perceived effect.

But by contrast, male characters whose sexuality is mentioned are mostly heterosexual: Hakram (probably), Ratface, Nauk, Robber, Black are mentioned as heterosexual, vs Warlock as homosexual, no bisexual male characters that we know of.

** As much as I love this story, I feel like this is a sort of litmus test for whether PGtE qualifies as a rational fic.

Based on everything we know about the capabilities of each side, can we really figure out what Juniper's plan is?

If the win comes from Cat or Masego emerging from their respective comas at the most dramatically pivotal moment, fine and good. It's been lampshaded, and in a way this is a huge part of the lore of PGtE. But it is also entirely out of character for Juniper to commit massively to a strategy that invites certain doom if one specific event out of her control doesn't materialize.

Either way, can't wait for the next chapter

*** Well, assuming this is Battle of the Camps, second camp has to get involved. I expect that juniper would ruin their supplies (thus ensuring they would lose on a strategic level due to attrition if they continue marching deeper into Callow), and then threaten to ruin /her/ supplies too if enemies don't stop the attack, while promising to share supplies if crusaders concede defeat here. This would negate the main reason crusaders have for fighting (to get supplies - you can't eat food that is on goblinfire.)
