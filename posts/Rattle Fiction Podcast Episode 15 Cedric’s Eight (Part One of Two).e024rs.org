[[https://vi-fi.github.io/Cedric's%20Eight.html][Cedric's Eight]] is a great piece of HPMOR fanfic. It's a rollicking casino heist story, with a competent protagonist challenging a competent evil Vegas magnate.

And now you can listen to it!

[[https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-15-cedrics-eight-part-one][Episode 15]] of the Rattle Fiction Podcast is live. It's a reading of the first half of [[/u/vi_fi][u/vi_fi]]'s (13,000 word) story originally posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/d6jek0/rtcff_cedrics_eight_13k_words/][here]] inspired by an [[/r/rational][r/rational]] Secret Krampus prompt. The story is split up into two longish episodes, the second will post next week.
