** Is the suggestion that Simole is the leader and was in his room the whole time somehow?

*** Kind of seemed like that to me, especially given the potential foreshadowing from the previous chapter "Simole often joked how she was his true opponent, the person he needed to defeat --- what if she was right? " that was immediately before focus went to his room.

However, last chapter also has the line " He closed his eyes and focused on the leader of the rebels. It was more of a concept than a person, but it was a very specific one." Plus we know from earlier books that the rebels seem to think he is important somehow. He could be the leader and just doesn't know it. I could honestly see it going either way.

** I *hate it* when a cliffhanger just fizzles out next chapter.
