** I downloaded this novella just yesterday and have finished it. I found it fairly compelling; somewhat over simplified as far as economics go but still a very enjoyable read at its current price point. I would heartily suggest it for those that own a Kindle or plan to get the Kindle app/desktop program.

****** I also wish it was handled better; the origin story for her very nature (something that is at least somewhat important and causing the protagonist a great deal of confusion) seems pretty cheap and uninspired. [[#s][]]
