** It's only sort-of Mary Sue - the writers do have self-insert characters in the universe, but they're C-listers (or maybe D-listers), with either minor superpowers (just enough to justify them being at a super-academy) or serious downsides/problems. They don't tend to affect - or even show up in - the main storylines.

The characters in question also do not hold much influence in-universe: they're not teachers, or faculty, or heads of student groups, or aware of their nature as self-inserts. And given that it's the kind of universe which has a cast of thousands (or at least hundreds), they're not even mentioned in 98% of the many, many stories generated by the writing group/team that makes up the Whateley authors.

*** You don't have to be a self-insert to be a mary-sue. It's pretty god damned mary-sue-ish.

**** There's no one singular character that the universe bends itself around. Nearly everyone at the academy gets their own stories, spotlights, and moments of awesomeness. And even the most overpowered students have plenty of screw-ups and failures, and usually have to put in a lot of work for their wins.
