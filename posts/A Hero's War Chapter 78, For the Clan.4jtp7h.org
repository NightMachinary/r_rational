** Makes me wonder if there's more Eika. I don't believe the entirety of their species were confined to those two clans.

** Just binged this series.

This is some serious rational shit right here. Fucking amazing read.

It rivals the top of the other stories here, like MoL.

Damn I want to read more.

Thanks for posting.

**** Oh god... I dunno. The whole thing was so good. Setting up a goddamn university was pretty good IMO. I can't wait for them to be visit the king and for the Morey/Cato letter stuff to go down.

** One of the two stories on here that I've truly liked, thank you for finding and sharing something that is in the same tier of MoL.
