Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Random thought:

So, everyone knows about Garfield Without Garfield, right? The idea is that you remove a thing from a work and the work becomes different, weirder and debatably better.

I got to thinking whether or not that was a thing that could be done elsewhere, just because of how neat it is when the concept shaped hole actually improves the thing.

I think it's also true of Harry Potter and Voldemort.

This grew out of a conversation I was having with someone about conspiracy theorists, and the person I was talking to made the point that HP, in the canon story, is basically a VAnon believer who turns out to be totally correct. Absolutely everything is about him and it is all driven by sekrit terrorists behind the scenes who just hate goodness and freedom.

Looked at from another way, then, how feasible is it to get rid of Big V? Like, what powers does he have that no one else can replicate? And it seems like, for the most part, he's just, like, a very skilled wizard, yeah? The Death Eaters' success stems from the intimidation factor more than from him personally doing work.

I tried to visualize what this would look like, and I think it hangs together surprisingly well. Each year something is going wrong for basic reasons of human avarice and weakness. Dude is just trying to steal the mcguffin on his own, student unleashing snake is just cracking under the insane system, etc. Harry mistakes ordinary malfeasance for a new point on his Voldemort red string diagram and we are off to the races.

Harry is basically Luna Lovegood, at this point, in that his unflagging belief that the problems with his world are the work of Dead Wizard Hitler is completely incorrect, but it in no way interferes with his day to day life, and, more pointedly, his heroics. Hermione & Ron understands that, you know, sometimes our weirdly fascist gov decides to murder innocent animals and we, being powerless kids, just have to accept that, but their maniacal bff has other ideas.

You contrast them being like 'look, bud, jail is just guarded by mind rape hell beasts, that's obviously the only way it could be', and dude is like 'don't you understand that the second a dead man comes back to life they would naturally join up with him!?'.

The idea is ultimately a recapitulation of SSC's Moloch principle, where the system can't be fixed by anyone within it, with a lunatic subbing in for the Czar as the outside system POV.

Anyway, I think it would be neat, thanks for coming to my TED talk.

*** That's actually a really fun idea. I can only imagine how entertaining his interactions with Mad Eye Moody would be. He would probably be the only other person to actually take this theory entirely seriously. Dumbledore may or may not believe it; Snape, McGonagall and everyone else with some common sense would believe it to be obviously bunk.

I don't see many difficulties. Voldy truly died at Godric's Hollow that night; the only bit that's necessary to explain is /why/. Other than that, the Philosopher's Stone gives you immortality and wealth, there's going to be plenty of potential thieves; Slitherin's Heir could well be a genuine blood purist; Sirius Black is actually truly a murderer, and he escaped from prison; the Triwizard Tournament is just rigged to hell and back since they all want to win, possibly by someone who knows how to exploit Harry's obsession; Harry starts dragging other students in his madness, training them in dangerous arts in secret while reasonable teachers try everything to stop him; Harry fixates on one classmate, thinking he's dead set on carrying out a nefarious plan, and ends up almost killing him; finally, Harry simply runs from school, completely taken in his delusions, and starts living like a homeless madman in the woods, fearing even just speaking the name of his enemy since he's under the ridiculous delusion that doing so would summon it to his position.

*** Garfield without Garfield only works because Jon can't hear what the animals are thinking and Jim Davis(and many comic strip artists) rarely draws movement or action, so instead it happens before the strip begins or between panels, leaving Jon as a non-interactive punchline vehicle.

Removing Garfield in that kind of scenario works, but I can't think of many things outside the daily comic strips medium that can receive the same treatment and still make sense. Maybe Mr Magoo? Or the roadrunner and sylvester cartoons?

**** Personally I'd write it in the form of a pretty long one-shot. Just a series of vignettes and scenes that unfold as the years pass. The big question becomes just:

a) how to justify the events in Godric's Hollow, which scream "special chosen boy"

b) what to do with the ending

B) depends on the general tone. If you go for comedic, a proper ending would probably be "turns out that Voldemort REALLY was still alive all along". Bonus: Voldemort is still alive /and in hiding because he's super paranoid about Harry Potter, despite all the reassurances of his Death Eaters that he's just a child and can't hurt him/.

If you go for more serious, then maybe Harry simply gets institutionalised, or withdraws in his completely delusional world which is implied to be the one we're all familiar with.

As for the ending: I mean... can't Ron and Hermione defeat the Death Eaters with/despite Harry? Clearly the obvious thing to do would be to have them do whatever big confrontation happens at the end (I don't know how it ends except that the children all have terrible names), and Harry was prepared for Voldemort but it was just Snape IDK, and then even tho R+H do all the work, Harry, being a "famous hero", gets all the credit? He then becomes the next DatDA teacher, and is insufferable and up himself like the guy from his first book whose name I have completely forgotten.

****** You can play it in a lot of different ways. For me if the joke is "Harry is a paranoid conspiracy theorist" then his ideas have to be widely mocked and disbelieved, which runs counter him being considered a famous hero. Rather, he should be a washout, that one kid that did ONE impressive thing once but now he's sort of an embarrassment.

It's both funny to make him stumble around solving a real problem with his completely skewed perspective, or make him right all along in some way.

I had a thought - instead of arguing the details, why not make this a contest? We could literally just create a "everyone write their own version of this concept" thread and then compare interpretations. I can imagine dozens of angles from which it could be either funny or insightful. [[/u/WalterTFD][u/WalterTFD]], any thoughts about this? Are you okay with your idea being used by others?

EDIT: funnily enough, I had completely forgot I actually wrote a very short opening for a story seemingly based on a similar premise that I have saved in a folder under the title "Constant Vigilance". Here's an extract:

#+begin_quote
  The Auror team landed next to them. It was headed by some grim-looking guy built like a wardrobe, the sort of type you'd just imagine to curse first and ask question later. So, this was the sort who would handle the situation now. Now that she'd /failed/.

  "I am Auror Knuckledge," he introduced himself. "Can you explain the situation to me?"

  Professor McGonagall gestured towards Dumbledore, and the Headmaster took charge. "We have a student with a... troubled history," he explained. "He's suffering from some sort of delusion. He has forced us all to evacuate the castle, ranting about some sort of Dark Lord that would be threatening us."

  The Auror raised an eyebrow. "You evacuated the school because of some student's ranting?"

  "No," intervened Severus Snape, the Potionmaster, answering the sarcastic question with a cold voice. "We evacuated the school because of the three hundred litres of Blowfire Potion that this student has apparently managed to prepare and disseminate in every nook and cranny without alerting our surveillance once."

  Knuckledge whistled lightly. "That's /some/ feat. If this guy could be recovered, I'd like to recruit him."

  "Seriously!," McGonagall answered, scandalised.

  The Auror grinned fiendishly. "No problem, missus. I'm just kidding. Real talk, this sort of nutcase is due for St. Mungo's or Azkaban. Depends how the judge feels on that day."

**** I actually started re-reading the original Harry Potter series about a month ago.

I'm about 60% of the way through the first book.

I think at this point I might just cut my losses and skip straight to Prisoner of Azkaban. I feel like I remember Rowling's writing improving around PoA/GoF.

Idk if it's Rowling's writing or if it's the fact that PS/SS covers the same year as HPMOR or if it's the chi... - I don't necessarily want to use the word /childishness/, but the earlier books were definitely targeted at a younger audience and are more like children's books than the rest of the series - but /something/ is making it feel incredibly tedious to try to push through this first book.

Having recently read these books yourself, what do you think? Should I give CoS a chance, or just skip ahead to PoA (or even GoF)?

Or did you not notice a problem with the earlier books and it's probably just that I'm dead inside and can't feel the magic anymore? (Or a less cynical alternative, that HPMOR has ruined PS/SS for me?)

*** For long-term planning, breaking it up into constituent parts (and breaking those up, recursively) allows you to make more accurate time estimates. Write down how you broke your top-level goal up to end up with your shorter-term goals, so if one of those subgoals ends up being much harder than you intended, you can check why you're doing it in the first place and see how to route around the unexpected problem. Within the individual goals and subgoals and whatnot, you can use SMART to define them. Also estimate time using the most similar thing you've done in the past, not how long the bits you can think of feel like they should take.

For group planning, it's important to know what your team wants to do, what motivates, them, and what they think is important. There are a lot of different ways to break up a long-term plan, and they're mostly equally valid. Instead of focusing on what makes it easiest for you personally to wrap your head around, focus on making sure it's broken up so the structure reflects the parts of the project that various members of the team thinks are important. Usually the person who's weirdly emphasizing a specific part of the project has a good reason. And making it easier for team members to relate their contributions to the part of the project that motivates them really helps with motivation and flexibility.

*** Generally: Organize and refine far more than you think necessary, then delegate even more than you are comfortable with. Delegating is hard and feels bad for most people initially, don't worry you will have more than your share of work. Have your project needs mapped and presented out as much as possible, with your team if possible, then break the project into solid measurables and sub goals. Utilize as much of your team as reasonable for every step of execution, but make sure you always have a good grasp of what is going on.

Break down the big tasks into smaller ones that can be completed within practical time periods, ideally none longer than a workweek. As more parts get done be sure to combine and troubleshoot as much as you can right away, while that task completion is fresh.

Edit: Seeing more background info: The hardest part of volunteer work is getting things actually completed, try to encourage people to prototype as fast as possible before refining/using the better materials.

My biggest robotics challenge tips are to look for past and adjacent designs as much as possible, use your team talents, and get something working asap. If it's piloted encourage them to practice as much as possible, practice can beat better/clever designs. Also try to get everyone to have fun! Do team hangouts, order food, and goof around (away from the dangerous/expensive stuff). Sure it's for resume building and there's going to be frustrating parts but in general the more fun everyone has the better you will do. Good luck!

Final Edit: Also be sure to munchkin it! Particularly look closely at penalty costs vs benefits, damage/malfunction allowances, and 1 time events such as the end of a challenge. I saw some disgusting munchkin moves in high school robotics such as dropping parts and one way movements for finale challenges.

My high school robotics team's best-performing year was when the seniors' carefully designed robot broke at the competition, and I and one of the other freshmen quickly put together a robot that consistently scored something like 9 positive points and 3 negative points by sweeping a large chunk of the board into our score space without checking whether it was the positive or negative color. It also did this violently enough that some of the strewn about pieces disrupted other robots' plans. The raw consistency made it eventually outperform better bots over the course of the double elimination tournament.

The winner that year also was a bunch of filthy munchkins, but with better engineering and a plan from before the day of the competition. Their robot hooked a winch over the side of the board for extra power, which it used to run forward and grab the heavy containers containing many of the scoring pieces, then using both its main drive and the winch together to pull the entire thing backwards into its scoring area.

** I'm planning a campaign for D&D 5e Forgotten Realms and I was wondering if [[/r/rational]] could help me plan a few more scenarios. The setup is...convoluted, and requires me to model my characters at a high-level, so I'd appreciate some suggestions and input.

Here's the premise, as succinctly as possible:

-3 goons are working for an evil overlord

-said overlord is attempting to capture the Three Champions Of The Light, who he intends to use in some evil ritual to to incite 1000 years of darkness etc

-through a chain of events, the souls of The Three Champions Of The Light end up in the goons

-since the goons are evil henchman, however, they dont count as Champions Of The Light

-for that to happen, and for the evil overlord to accomplish his goals, the goons will have to perform GOOD acts, and once they are sufficiently Good, they will become the Three Champions Of The Light again, and the overlord can proceed with his plans

So thats the setup, now here's the tension and hard part: The darklork needs to get his goons to do Good things, but if he makes them do something overtly Good they will catch on to his plan to manipulate them. As such, he needs to get them to do SEEMINGLY Evil things, as would befit servants of a darklord, while having them actually accomplish Good Acts (non consequentialists dont @ me)

So what are some plausible scenarios wherein these goons (who will be controlled by the players) might do Good while attempting to do follow evil orders?

(FWIW, the intent is that EVENTUALLY the goons will figure out that they're being manipulated, and the campaign will change based on their decisions at that time, but I'd like to postpone that realization as long as possible)

Stealing a large shipment of medicine or other supplies headed somewhere remote exposes guild corruption/embezzlement/skimming that would have sent off tainted/faulty supplies and killed a bunch of people.

Goons act as enforcers in a protection racket/extortion scheme that causes the small businesses you're pressuring to push back, forming a guild/union to try to protect each other. Application of sufficient force by the dark lord might leave the union still paying tribute to the dark lord, but they are also able to negotiate from a stronger position with local nobles, easing excessive tax burdens and improving quality of life for the small folk of the city.

He's a ruthless pirate captain who has an obsession with raping young boys and boyish women, and he inadvertently becomes the instigator of a slave revolt by raiding trade ships and freeing the galley slaves who row the ships (solely because he wouldn't be able to sell them even if he wanted to). Regardless, he comes to be idolized by his crew and the newly freed slaves who often become pirates themselves, and he uses that to enrich himself and to acquire victims to sate his appetite.

Eventually he's (iirc)killed by one of his rape victims and his crimes are revealed somewhat, but quickly covered up by other leaders so that he can remain a hero and self-less ur-founder of a nation of escaped slaves, on the level of George Washington.

Hope that helps as inspo.

*** (reddit ignores single line breaks. If you make them double line breaks, your list will be nicely formatted.)

*edit:* cheers. though I forgot to say, if you want the proper bullet-point list format, you also, need to put a space after each -

*** The obvious answer is to give them missions that are obviously and openly good but just lie about the ultimate reason.

Instead of saying that its about them doing good things so they can be ritually sacrificed say its so they can be used to spy on the forces of good and eventually backstab them at some distant point in the futture. Since of course the evil overlord is going to place spies and traitors there isn't any reason for them to be suspicious at all.
