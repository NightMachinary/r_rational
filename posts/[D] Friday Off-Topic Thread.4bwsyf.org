Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** Armchair psychologist answer: In rich countries, inequality is increasing and showing absolutely no signs of nearing an equilibrium, leading a sizeable chunk of the population, including lots of people with degrees and the inclination to write, to think about (perceived) mounting injustice on a large scale. The market also responds to readers, and when society seems unfair the prospect of great upsets, like a zombie apocalypse or president Trump, has a lot more draw than when the economy is booming and there's enough hope to go around.

When someone starts reading more books, certain types of previously unnoticed books turn out to be more common than you thought and only when you search for the books does the actual quantity becomes obvious.

It might also be because of books like the /Hunger Games/ and other writers are futilely trying to cash in on the popularity.

  It is incomprehensible! Nothing makes any sense! We all understand that plots in these movies don't make sense. Of course they don't. That's standard. But in this movie nothing makes sense /on a scene level/. In a lot of movies that make no sense on a plot level, the person will say, "I am going to rob this fruit store," and you can quibble about why a person would rob a fruit store, but the characters in the movie accept it and go about robbing the fruit store and we go along with it. They have conviction and authenticity and they really try to rob that fruit store good, even if we in the audience think they are being ridiculous for robbing a fruit store, because when it really works, it doesn't matter. In /Batman v Superman/ the characters say, "I am going to rob this fruit store," and then go into the fruit store, throw fruit in the air, paint the walls with fruit, pay for the fruit, use the fruit as puppets in improv comedy, have a dance party with the fruit, build a home in the fruit store, burn the fruit store down, exit the smoldering husk of the fruit store and announce, "I robbed the vegetable store."

*** Spoilers for the entire movie.

The characters were dumb, the plot was dumb, and the choices for what to include and what to exclude were dumb.

Batman is "the greatest detective in the world" and he didn't do a database/google search for "White Portuguese" when he hears it? (Also, he just does a search for that text string, instead of a white person from Portugal when he gets the files.) Also, encryption doesn't work like that. He would be lucky to get 1% of the way to cracking commercial grade encryption in a year, never mind breaking it overnight. Also, also, what was with that bug thing? Was it just jam-packed with micro-SD cards, so that he copied /all/ of lexcorp's files onto it? Lastly, the random prophetic dreams were dumb, both that they existed in the movie, and that he completely believed them with no more evidence. Wait, one more: He put the spear far away from the prepared fight zone, and /luckily/ the fight ended up there just at the right dramatic moment.

Superman was dumb. After the massacre at the start, he never told anyone that he didn't do it, and that they were killed by bullets. He didn't stick around after the senate explosion to clear his name either. When Lex tried to force him to kill Batman, he decided to recruit him instead (which is good). The first thing he did upon /meeting/ Batman is shove him across the roof, and he didn't even mention any plan to recruit Batman to him until he was almost dead.

Wonder Woman shouldn't have been in the movie, she was completely pointless. STEALING A COMPUTER FILE DOES NOT DELETE IT! Why didn't /she/ use the spear, instead of the person it was specifically designed to kill?

I got pretty drunk with some friends and watched it. I liked it. Even when severely drunk though, it wasn't very well thought out. In particular, there is a scene at the end when B&S realize they shouldn't be fighting, and it's the most cringey thing in years. The movie literally ends happily because their mothers have the same name.

** Why don't any Naruto stories include (or even mention in passing) the characters actual strength training?

Ever since starting working out and reading about how humans get stronger, it's been bothering me that all of the physical training described is basically just running and basic exercises. Any ninja village should generally be producing Olympian-level gymnasts. They should train like our own gymnasts, in addition to all the other ninja skills, not do push ups, pull ups, and sit ups for their whole lives.

*TL;DR: All ninjas should train like Gai and Lee to be any stronger than the general population, but no one does.*

Probably a combination of three things:

1. The kind of people who write fanfiction aren't the kind of people who tend to be athletes, so they don't know about these types of strength training.
2. Strength training is a lot less interesting to write (and read) about than kewl jutsu and sparring.
3. Ninja Magic.

** /What are your favorite blatantly-agenda-pushing books?/

I've enjoyed reading many propaganda pieces. /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662][Atlas Shrugged]]/ (objectivism) and /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140][The Jungle]]/ (socialism) are two of my favorite stories (I've read the latter on four separate occasions, IIRC), and I also greatly enjoyed /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122][The Fountainhead]]/ (objectivism), /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1164][The Iron Heel]]/ (socialism), /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29966][The Shape of Things to Come]]/ (socialism), /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271][Black Beauty]]/ (animal rights), and (of course) /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108][HPMoR]]/ (rationality). I just finished reading /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16470][The Profits of Religion]]/ (socialism), and liked it a fair amount.\\
(I probably should get around to looking up some fun religious or reactionary texts...)

--------------

On a related note, Project Gutenberg has [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5050][a nice archive]] of past State of the Union Addresses made by Presidents of the United States. They're surprisingly interesting to read. For example, at the close of 1859, Buchanan spoke, not only about slavery (including [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostend_Manifesto][the possible purchase of Cuba from Spain]]), but also on a possible military restoration of order to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_War][chaotic Mexico]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tientsin][an Opium War treaty with China]], among other items. Likewise, Theodore Roosevelt's first address in 1901 started with a panegyric to his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley][assassinated]] predecessor and an assertion that "anarchistic speeches, writings, and meetings are essentially seditious and treasonable", before moving on to discussion of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting][trust-busting]] and how immigration standards should be tightened (including a reinstatement of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act][the Chinese Exclusion Act]]) to keep out people "below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American labor"--i.e., willing to work for too-low wages.

Also, a lot of the older language takes two or three attempts for a modern reader to understand! A mind-melting sample from Washington:

As with HPMOR, I'm sure all the main points will be speculated upon for the book world (If I can gather the readers), but my 'bragging' is really just relief that it's not /too/ obvious.

** Pretty tiring week. Got disappointed with the ending of Boku dake ga inai machi / Erased which I had recommended on this sub. I'm thinking of what decisions the protagonist could have done to turn it into a rational fic.

Also think about what would be a good condition to stop traveling back. I'm thinking that if I had Revival I would try to trigger it consciously but end up traveling back again and again trying to get even better outcomes. I'm not sure at which point it would stop being a blessing and turn into a curse ala Groundhog Day.

On a professional note, I'm stuck on how to encode data on a spiking neural network. I understand that they're encoded by the time of spike but still I'm not sure how to decide what's the time window to evaluate or if its continuous. There isn't much about spiking neurons from what I've seen. My current goal is to model a simple AND gate using integrate and fire.

Also had fun with the Tay bot. Made one for myself and currently learning NLP to try and improve upon its responses. That and the A Third Option fic will probably take some time until I make my research on the material.

Also see a lot of good fics posted in here but find it difficult to browse them. Are they being indexed or posted in some other rational site? And any good rational fantasy fics you would recommend?

Of course the story would be over too fast if he could go back everytime he wanted but I think a rational protagonist would try to experiment with it to avoid being sent to some undesirable timeline or to have a convenient escape route in case he failed. Not to mention he could profit immensely from it, just research the lottery numbers and go back or learn many abilities in a lifetime by repeatedly reliving your life and keeping the memories.

Maybe he could trigger it by exposing himself to stressful situations which wouldn't be that hard given how much trouble the killer was giving him. The trick would be to do so without being caught, perhaps under controlled variables.

I mean he could have had his cake (stopping the killer) and eat it too (live those 15 years in a more fulfilling way) which for someone that did so much to save lives, I think he deserved that bit of selfishness. He got close to the "being a superhero" sucks message in that trying to save others will [[#s][Spoilers]].

******* Actually, I just realized another good (if not necessarily canon-supported) reason he wouldn't go back-- Given that the loop is 15 years, that's a fairly large amount of time for a potential x-risk to happen, like nuclear war. Even if the risk is low, from a total utility perspective it's best if he just leaves the timeline alone, especially considering that going back in time always has some sort of cost.

******** Although the range of the changes he made were relatively low, mostly impacting his community and friends. And honestly if he requires another shock to go back, I think I'd be tempted to go back and stay there while taking advantage of over 15 years of experience.

Heck he could become rich and get to enjoy his childhood as many times as he wanted. The main problem I see is that, it would be too tempting to keep doing it over and over.

Was thinking of a possible fic where he attempts it but as he gets used to seeing dangerous situations he ends up requiring stronger and bigger dangers/shocks to travel.

**** Definitely. I mean the series did suffer at the end (rumors are the author got tired and didn't know how to end it) but it has some really nice soundtracks, interesting characters and a nice plot at least up to episode 10.

It was really fun while it was airing because every week you'd end up with a cliffhanger and have some time to come with hypotheses on what would happen. I have yet to try watching it all at once and see if there's a difference but overall it was really nice.

Some criticism goes towards it being a bad mystery show although the author himself said its a "human drama with mystery elements" rather than a full mystery show.

** Question to all you writers:

How do you /do/ it? Not the writing process, but the actual act of putting your work up on the internet for everyone to see? I guess this also applies to anyone who puts anything they made up.

I recently put up around 8k of "fanfiction" for an internet forum quest I'm part of. My hands were shaking when I hit the submit buttom. Would they like it? Would they hate it? Why? Which parts? Were the parts I liked the good or bad ones? Should I have proofread it more? What if the only comment I get on it is a request for a spellcheck?

Sometimes I wonder why I even put myself through this. Then I remember my previous fanfic, only 4k words, that got around 50 likes (which isn't bad for that forum). Honestly, that one was trash, and I wish I could delete it, but I feel like I would be disappointing everyone who liked it.

Also the fact that we get inquest bonuses for each omake we do.

*** Well it started out because I was having fun writing things, and if I'm going to have fun writing things, I might as well also enjoy having the largely positive experience of internet feedback. I'm always up for a good debate, and having a dedicated readerbase to have that debate with is quite nice. Also, if I write something and keep it to myself, then that's one person who has had a positive experience. If I write something and post it then that's (by my current best estimation) a few thousand people having a positive experience, which is better.

Also I get to roll around on a big pile of likes and follows like some kind of literary dragon. As things progress though I'm starting to have expectations of myself, which is leading to a reduction in writing quantity and a reduction in growth of quality. If only they were so easy to banish.

*** For me, personally, I find the feedback (mostly in review form on FF.net or comment replies on reddit) to be sort of like cocaine. After any new post/chapter, I'll almost obsessively check said sites and my email for comments and drink in any and all feedback like a hit of the good old nose candy.

In hindsight, that seems completely unhealthy. Don't be like me. -_-

In all seriousness, it's just part of the fun. You have to enjoy writing at least a bit JUST for writing's sake, but putting your work out there and hearing what people think about it adds a whole new dimension to it all, and it helps you improve as a writer. As an example of something I learned via feedback from the public, I overuse commas. Like by a ridiculous amount. But it's something I never really noticed while writing or proof reading. But, now that I've had it pointed out to me, I take steps to avoid it.

So yea, idk. I think it's sort of nerve wracking to put yourself out there, but the rewards seem to be worth it generally. (Although, obviously, YMMV depending on a variety of factors such as your target audience, the fandom/genre you're writing in, etc.)

*** If, once finished with editing and proofreading, you're dealing with unrealistic hopes that war with self-criticism that shouts, "Worthless shite!" at odd intervals, take a look at your past stuff until either your expectations become more realistic, or your emotions calm enough for you to comfortably think, "It's not worthless, but it's not good either. Good enough that it won't get much better at my current level of skill and with the amount of time I'm willing to put into it." The former condition is healthier, but the latter can serve as a stepping stone. You'll still feel nervous once you see a reply, but with experience that will fade. Doing a [[https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+receive+constructive+criticism][research]] spree might also help.

*** I write when the ideas flow. You do need some thick skin, in particular just accept that most people won't comment and may not even thumb up /like the work. Most reviews are "I liked the first X chapters but this detail was stupid."

The tension is that if you feed off the good reviews the bad ones will stick in your craw.

Still, I recommend you just do it and see if you like it.

Even if I never write again, the knowledge that I cranked out a long story in a short time (even if I accept all the criticism ) is nice.

** I've seen a bit of talk about wireheading on the sub recently, and I hadn't heard of it before. After a quick google, it looks to be just a scifi Lotus Eater. To those who know more about it, is it like a Lotus Eater, or is there a little more nuance there?

It's basically the difference between an unhealthy obsession with fantasy worlds and an unhealthy indulgence in cocaine.
