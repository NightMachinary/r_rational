** Hi, folks.

I've decided to try my hand at a short story, exploring the side of isekai that normally just works itself out once the tale is told. I'm looking for feedback on the work, and advice on my technique and ideas.

My goal as an author is to create something that makes perfect sense when you finish it, but still manages to surprise and delight.

I've got five chapters up so far. If you would be so kind, please read it and let me know what you think!

Edit: Hey, just to be clear, it's okay if you don't like it, but useful criticism rather than quiet downvotes would be appreciated. Not much I can learn from, otherwise!

*** I've just finished the first chapter and came back to comment:

I enjoyed this quite a bit, and the subversions were well done. I liked the fact that the temptress was about companionship, not sex. The truck didn't make a lot of sense to me and I'm unclear what happened to his stick or how the two related, but I didn't have an issue with it. I didn't see the twist coming where it's actually the devil's story and not the man's, and I'm curious to see where you go with it.

Overall: Nicely done.

**** Thank you!

The truck was a manifestation of a /tormentor/, a demon-like spirit who focuses on pain. Chapter 5 expands on this a bit.

I should probably switch /beast/ to /tormentor/ in chapter 1 for better continuity.

I'm reasonably confident they're not in an Incipisphere. They're... they're not in an Incipisphere right?

The power of threefold repetition reminded me of Pact, as did the dealings of the /bargainer/ and the oracle.

I enjoy that Surret's power derives from the secrets and names he knows, the debts he can call upon, and his ability to turn those things into leverage. I enjoy the conversational minefields. More mines!

I look forward to learning more about the power structures of this setting. I imagine, since different fictional worlds seem to be accessible a la /Marriage and Monsters/, there's no shortage of gods drifting about, so I have to wonder what Faustian is planning.

Heh, well - I actually don't know what Incipisphere is. I did include and will continue to sprinkle in references to actual fiction (/Earthsea/, /Lord of the Flies/, /Scott Pilgrim/, etc.). The /Lands of Song and Artifice/ are an original creation. They're intended to be a children's story world, much like Narnia. I didn't want this work to be FanFic, though, so I make my own worlds.

**** Makes sense! It's a Homestuck thing-- an Incipisphere is a reality instantiated by a session of a video game (long story) which contains a planet for every player (the planets' size and distance from each other are... /context-dependent/) which is named /The Land of X and Y/, with thematically appropriate values of X and Y for each player, like The Land Of Light and Rain or The Land of Wind and Shade or The Land Of Heat and Clockwork.

So yeah I was pretty sure it wasn't a matter of Faustian grabbing an Incipisphere for his plans-- I think he'd go less postmodern in his selection of battlefield-- but either way I love the above sentence, great work.

#+end_quote

Wow, you're asking me for /constructive/ advice? Shit, I'm not trained for this.

More seriously, normally in a story you have kind of a rising action pattern, where first you introduce the character's normal life, then you start introducing stakes; usually something the main character wants, or something that threatens them. As the story progresses, the main characters does something to get what they want / escape the threat, which progressively introducing new elements, that complicate the plot, create obstacles, and generally build up whatever it is the character wants (so that, ideally, we start empathizing and wanting it for them).

Eventually the story reaches a tipping point, the chekov guns are fired, the tension that was built up is paid off, and the characters reach their new situation (eg the isekai protagonist comes back home changed after defeating the dark lord).

This story... doesn't really have that? Like, it has /ideas/, but it doesn't really have a "set-up -> build-up -> pay-off" structure (yet).

Problems are introduced (Surret is trapped on an island) and solved almost immediately (Surret goes after the bargainer). Dor needs to do something to save some random world, Dor is given everything she needs to save that world with no visible effort.

There aren't really /stakes/. The closest we have is Surret and Dor wanting to see each other, except Surret doesn't know anything about Dor, and Dor doesn't seem to care that much about her biological father.

Don't get me wrong, it's interesting and new. But so far it's just, like, a collection of things that happen, with little direction.

  The boy shrugged. "I have a specific request of you, Faustian. You will call in no favors for this, and will not seek me out again, afterward. It will take you but a moment. Agree to do this one thing for me, and we are even."

  Faustian looked at him suspiciously, but finally nodded. "Very well. Restitution and noninvolvement in exchange for one brief personal service.

  "Good," Surret replied, "Sell all your Deals to Munin here for his shiny copper coin."

Including the non-involvement deal from just now, and this after having Faistian deal in bad faith just a few days ago AND still go back on his deal. For a veteran Surret sure is bad at this.

*** Thanks for the feedback! Before I reply in spoilers, I will say that speculation like this is exactly what I want to encourage and reward in the story.

The boy is meant to be a terrifying antagonist, but he hates /bargainers/ for a reason. I should clarify a bit in-story how this works. I'll be getting more technical with the start of chapter 6. Short version is that Munin owns the Deals, but the entities involved in the the pacts, including Faustian and even Munin himself, are still on the hook for what they owe. The one owed the services is what changes. That's what makes the Deals such a huge prize for any spirit capable of using them.

More specific to the Deal at issue, Surret is now bound not to seek retribution against Munin rather than Faustian. Faustian's service to Surret remains intact. Having this work otherwise would cause Munin to get all of the responsibility along with the bling.

**** I'll chime in to agree with the above that so far making any deals at all seems stupid. The bargainer twists the results even when worded clearly, and doesn't even uphold the parts he admits agreeing to. My feeling is "What's the point?"

***** Thanks! Out of curiosity, how far have you read?

To tip my hand a bit, that's the first impression you're meant to have, and also a big part of why Surret loathes /bargainers/. Stories about clown gods messing with heroes for the evulz get dull fast, so I'm trying for something more nuanced. While I hint at it in chapter 1's second bargain, chapter 2 is where I have Faustian speak briefly with his partners about why he interpreted the Deal as he did.

****** I wasn't at all swayed by faustians justifications in ch2. He's set up as untrustworthy. Also if Sutton's family is aware of his penchant for disappearing, as we learn later, the reunion shouldn't be as fraught as Faustian claims. They know he goes to other worlds and actively trained his daughter against the eventuality. Sad as it might be, they should be sympathetic to his plight and allow some interaction with his children.

********* I'm seeing some upvotes on your comments, so I'll seek some more critical input after the story has progressed further. I think I will end up rewriting this bit in chapter 1.

At issue is that Surret has gone missing at times, but never anywhere near as long as his last one. His absence is now barely felt by his family, and there's a good amount of buried resentment because he wasn't there to parent and help pay the bills throughout almost all of his kids' childhoods. They think he's dead, or maybe worse. The concept seems believable enough to me, but I will own that I can do a better job selling this to the reader.

********** yeah I can believe there would be resentment, but if a loved one vanished and was presumed dead or worse, and they showed back up after 15 years and it was clear it wasn't their choice or fault, I don't think the typical response would be "hey fuck you for not paying the bills." By then I feel like they'd have moved past the frustration to just sadness then resignation. It would take a pretty shitty person to know their loved one was basically kidnapped and unable to return home for years and respond only with anger and rejection when they return.

Now, the kids I could understand being frustrated - they were still young when he vanished, they only knew him briefly. They probably wouldn't have a deep connection to him, though it might be mend-able over time. I'm mainly thinking the wife. Certainly their romantic relationship is over, but I would think he'd still be able to be friends and see his kids if he wanted.

i gathered Uther has some significant leverage over Faustian as a result of the violations to force him to sell all his current deals, but it still seems likely Uther will get screwed or the rules will be weaseled out of.

You were correct to infer that Surret was owed big-time for Faustian's screw-ups.

You are also correct that Faustian will be a weasel - but I don't want that to come across as effortless, nor as purposeless. Lack of consequences ruins dramatic tension, as do heroes and villains with perfect track records. Thanks for pointing out that Faustian is in this neighborhood.

**** Looking forward to it.

So far I'm rooting for Surret, maybe Dor, and against Faustian, and slightly against Munin with the caveat that she can get back to 'for' if it turns out her actions at the end there are to Surret's or Dor's benefit.

I notice this ranking matches how much we know about each character's motivations so far so maybe that's intentional.

**** Ohh, I had to read this a second time. Now I get it I think. Even though Munin owns all the deals, she only gets the benefits which Faustian was previously entitled to. Nobody whom Faustian has made deals with can use Munin's name for purposes she wouldn't agree to, or whatever the specific languagewas in each deal, but Faustian still owes Dor a party, presents, and cake in a birthday-like context (which Faustian promised in exchange for making the deal fast and making a counter offer, I guess).

speaking of nonspecific language, Faustian is really bad at this too, for it being his concept so to speak. How's he supposed to keep track of his agreements if he doesn't insist on standardized language and terms?

***** Correct on your first point.

The birthday party is planned for the chapter after this next one.

Regarding standardized language: Faustian is somewhat protected because he is the one who delivers second in most situations. Surret and Munin turned this on its head when restitution for a 3x broken Deal entered the picture. They already knew what Faustian's side would be, more or less.

Deals are artisinal things, and very difficult to standardize. /Bargainers/ make arrangements with lots of bizarre and otherworldly beings, many of whom are enormously powerful, short on attention, and quite vengeful. There is at least one other consideration for mortal Deals, hinted at in chaper 2.

****** The first deal involves an ongoing deal though, and we've seen 3 versions of it - 2 he proposed and 1 counter offer he accepted. Let's say he's not sure which version he agreed to with Surret, but he wants to reveal Surret's full name for whatever reason. In reverse chronological order:

Case 3: He may use the name only with prior authorization - saying Uther would be a fourth mistake.

Case 2: He may use the name if approval or permission is likely - Surret has already made it clear he does not approve of his first name being used and forbade its use. If Faustian said Uther, that would again be a fourth mistake.

Case 1: He may use the name if Surret would "reasonably approve" of the use - well, even though Surret has maintained the boundary of not using his first name, there can be an argument that the restriction is not a reasonable one. Then again, Surret never approved of the name being used even when being otherwise reasonable, but only when the name was being used to get his attention, not to describe him, so I guess it's up to whomever decides such things to decide if the use was fair. Faustian has some leeway in this case.

Of course, it seems the rule is whether the opposite party would be satisfied by what they received, in which case Faustian should avoid agreeing to not do something whenever he can or at least set a time limit on such things. If he doesn't provide enough of a boon he can try harder and make it happen. If he does something he's not allowed to, he can't easily undo it. Would Surret be satisfied with the reasonable approval argument in the case where his name was dropped in negotiations with Dor? Probably not, even if he agreed with the second half of the argument. Good thing for Faustian that nobody was around to hear and tell Surret.

So there's gotta be a perfect memory thing for deals going on too or Faustian wouldn't use the name so freely. Also I wonder if everyone Faustian has ever made 3 deals with knows they're not allowed to say Munin's name now but can use Faustian's name to bind him. Also since the phrasing was so vague, if people can't use their own name to bind themselves (such as signatures or wedding vows).

******* I'm a bit hesitant to speak to all of Faustian's abilities because spoilers. His approach to Deals with mortals is somewhat formulaic, as you've noted.

The domain of forbidden knowledge is interesting, as it relates to the transfer of Deals. I'll clarify as follows:

Surret still cannot speak Faustian's name in disallowed context, however doing so will result in a penalty and restitution to Munin. The same is true for Faustian in regards to Surret's name. But, that said, things run off the tracks and get pretty messy. I think I'll instead simply clean up the language of Surret's request.
