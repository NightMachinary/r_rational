This time the challenge will be *Weirdtopia*. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write a story set in a world which defies sensibilities rather than confirming them in a positive or negative way like (most) utopias and dystopias do. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][See this article]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky. The weirder you go, the better, but remember that the world /also/ has to make sense. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, April 12th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge will be *Twenty Minutes in the Future*. Write a story set a relatively short time in the future, where changes to society are extrapolations on what's currently going on in the world of science, technology, politics, etc. The term "eerily plausible" often comes up for this kind of story, since they usually don't fall so far into the future that they're pure speculation. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 4/12.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62i3ht/challenge_companion_weirdtopia/][is available here.]]
