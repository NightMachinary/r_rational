** Paging [[/u/alexanderwales]]!

I absolutely love this story, and would love to see it expanded upon. Over 6 years ago, you said you intended to rewrite it, and I believe you later said you'd finished quite a bit of it. Do you still intend to release it?

*** I was going to do it this year, but I wrote the Worth the Candle Christmas Special instead. I probably will rewrite this at some point, but it's /super/ old at this point, so ... I don't know.

**** I'm rewriting a story of mine from ~2012, so it's never too late to dust off the old words and polish them up, if that's tour concern.

** That was interesting.

Once the MC started talking about "optimizing" society (after he had been there less than a day), you know things are going to blow up in his face.

** I always liked this story since it shows how people can think they are smarter than they are and cant see the problems that their actions will create. I believe he messed up with the last gift, but that is my opinion.

**** He was immortal but also the only human among aliens who basically made his every will real. Probably wouldn't turn out that bad for humanity.

*** Exactly what it does is left undefined. It's some sort of attempt at a self-replicating world/humanity optimizer. But the author didn't spell out exactly what it does to leave it open ended.

Maybe Santa played it cautiously and just went with basic disease/malnutrition/aging protection, which should be safe. Maybe he gambled on cognitive upgrades or something a little riskier: there's a greater chance of unintended side effects, but the elves seem pretty on top of things now and he's only got one shot at this.

Really I think part of it is that now that the elves are wiser than the author, he's wise enough not to put words in their mouths. They'll help Santa figure out the right thing to do.

**** I'm not sure he made a mistake. Near the end, he talks about how the Elves have near limitless power, which likely means there are other species that also have that much power, which puts humanity in grave danger of some other species creating the black death 2.

Basically, he's gambling that his marble will increase humanity's chance for survival, and I think I agree with him. I think there are changes that can be made to increase the chances of humanity's survival.

*** The author left it open-ended, so it could be anything. Something to make people smarter, stronger, have a heightened immune system, more compassionate, unable to lie, less materialistic, less aggressive, give some sort of global human/hive consciousness, etc. Take your pick.
