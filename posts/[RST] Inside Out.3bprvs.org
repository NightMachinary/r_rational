#+begin_quote
  /Inside Out/ is the most rationalist movie ever. I can't even think of what would be the #2 runner-up.
#+end_quote

I haven't seen it, but maybe people who have seen it want to discuss it here...

^{Would an animated version of /Time Braid/ be a runner-up?}


** Well now I'm curious. I hope he writes an essay about this at some point.

** Clearly hyperbole, but interesting. I'm sure in a week he could come up with a fairly long list, likely with a better #1. It is a recent experience, and the lack of a clear #2 suggests the problem in valuation.

I have not seen the movie, so someone else will have to confirm, but it seems it does hold up in consistency and internal logic despite a slew of fantastic elements. But by this sub's strict-ish definitions, I don't see how it can actually be very /rationalist/.

** I'd really like to see EY's response to this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3bgoa1/rationalist_insideout/][counterclaim]].

*** I wouldn't call it a counterclaim. I suspect that we're referring to entirely different aspects of the film.

** I finally watched it, and I don't see what's rationalist about it. There's a system for sending memories from long-term storage, and it never occurs to them to use it until near the end. Even though that's how they got there in the first place.
