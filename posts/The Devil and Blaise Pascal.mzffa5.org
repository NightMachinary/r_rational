** Being a rationalist song from a [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/22/dungeons-and-discourse-third-edition-the-dialectic-continues/][Dungeons and Discourse]] ([[http://dresdencodak.com/2006/12/03/dungeons-and-discourse/][comic 1]], [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/][comic 2]]) campaign - see [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ep2Z42hYqj68QZz6w/king-under-the-mountain-adventure-log-soundtrack][this log]] and [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/17/fermats-last-stand-soundtrack-and-adventure-log/][the sequel]] for an excellent writeup.

Other fun music [[https://www.youtube.com/user/qraikoth/videos][can be found here]] - in particular /Mathematical Pirate Shanty/, /Philosopher Kripke/, and /What Is It Like To Be A Bat?/ are somewhere between great (if you like puns) and terrible (if you don't, you monster). From a different channel (but same campaign), [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaaPNKbWD80][Thomas Hobbes' Song]] is /unfairly/ catchy.

Any other notable examples of rationalist musical fiction?

*** I don't have any other rationalist music to recommend, but I did want to say that firstly, this is amazing, and secondly, does anyone have a link to the lyrics of this? The live journal says access denied and google is failing me.
