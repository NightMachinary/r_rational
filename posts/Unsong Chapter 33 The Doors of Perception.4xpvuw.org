** Simeon's excuses don't make sense. If the goal was /really/ to have all the names discovered as fast as possible, you'd have your sweatshops somewhere with no minimum wage. Heck, just charge people so that they have to test out a Name every time they use one of the ones that you've copyrighted, and you have a desperate peasant workforce that /doesn't/ hate you and /isn't/ dying.

TCK is son of an Archangel of secrets, who founded an organization to keep the Names of God secret and who never explained anything. Do secrets have some sort of power in Unsongverse, aside from the obvious Placebomantic stuff?

Maybe TCK created UNSONG specifically for the Placebomantic setup it would bring around? Some lone rebels bring the organization down, charge after Hell, and are boosted by their heroic stature?

*** I thought it has been explicitly stated in an earlier chapter that using names degraded the stability of the universe. The TCK would every motive to restrict name usage if he was aware of this, right?

***** I thought it was stated that Uriel's physical law based universe is falling apart, allowing enough divine light through to use names, but every time a name is used, it pulls more divine light through, destabilizing the physical universe further.

I could be wrong - would have to find the passage to check.

******* I'm probably spoilered to hell just reading this comment thread, but is this story anywhere near complete.

It looks really interesting, I just don't want it to be dropped before it's over.

******** Scott's commented somewhere (I forget where) that he essentially finished the whole story before posting the first chapter. So, I don't think you've got anything to worry about there.

**** Bro, if you can find that quote then go ahead and point us to it. But it doesn't exist.

Uriel has stated that using the divine light to kill Thamiel would speed up the end of the world, but it's never been stated that Names have the same effect. The fact that he never complains about the multiple major corporations that exist solely to find Names is a major hint that Names don't degrade the universe (at least, as far as Uriel knows.)

** Possible way around The Green Man's Name problems:

Clean out a person of peyote, then keep them at gunpoint to use names.

**** Might be useful for some industrial and agricultural Names, but the hivemind already has that under control. Military names would be too dangerous unless you could set it up so the sayer was totally unaware of the effect.
