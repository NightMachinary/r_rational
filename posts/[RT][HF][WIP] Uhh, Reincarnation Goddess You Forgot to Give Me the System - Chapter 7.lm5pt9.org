** Seven chapters in and we still have a passive protagonist being led by the hand and shown bits of the world by another character. But, hey, she's quirky and wants to help the other character, so at least she's not pointless?

I understand that maybe the setup can be difficult, or that maybe there needs to be a bit of setup before the MC can get into the groove, but that really needs to happen soon, preferably before we are 10 chapters in.

This story is kind of like the inverse of the Gilded Hero. That one had a passive protagonist too, for far too long, and just when it started getting good when he became active (and it became really good), the author stopped wirintf it. I hope that doesn't happen here.

*** Oh hey, a chapter where the MC doesn't praise/reference their own "master class in snark tongue" we're 3/7 now.

** Hmm. This is one of those chapters that would probably be completely fine in a non serial format. As it is it feels a bit like nothing happened. We have some light foreshadowing and minor world building but that's pretty much it.

Oh well. Still looking forward to the next update. I think this story has a lot of potential and I hope it reaches that potential.

*** That's how I've felt about this whole work. It seems like it could be good, but the serial format lends itself better to longer chapters. This reads more like a published (possibly YA, with the chapter length) book, which doesn't work as well at one chapter a week.

If I had some advice, I might recommend a slower release schedule that drops multiple chapters at a time, as that seems like it would be more likely to get a better response.

**** Agreed, kind of nothing has happened yet, and I get the sense the trickle is just to push the patreon, but I'd be more inclined if there was a strong indication of where the story was going and if it will be interesting.

***** Author here, the trickle is because just one chapter per week is my actual writing speed for this story. I'd love to post more often, with longer updates (where the content merits it), but I'd burn myself out and run out of backlog pretty quickly if I did that.

I'm probably going to take the advice of the posters in this thread and change up my release schedule to be multiple chapters at a time but less often.

Also, you can ignore the Patreon. It's not worth it unless you're a super-fan dying to know what happens next. And even then, it's probably debatable. (As you can see, I'm a real big brain businessman over here haha)

****** You could get a lot of mileage out of simply having her ask useful questions. After running for her life and seeing magic her first question was "What's the name of the planet?" How about "Tell me about your magic and is there any way I can get it?" A few other good candidates include:

- What are the stats?
- What does leveling up do?
- What's this about Personal Quests?
- Are the bad guys going to keep looking for us?

That's off the top of my head. Wondering about why the languages are the same seems low on the priority list.

****** Sure I appreciate the response and I'm not trying to impugn your intentions in any way. I've still been reading these as they come out, hopefully the new schedule works well for you. Good luck!
