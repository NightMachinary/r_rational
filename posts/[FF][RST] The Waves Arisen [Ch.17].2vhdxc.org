*** You want absurdly overpowered? Here's what they need to learn: [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Chakra_Transfer_Technique][Chakra Transfer Technique]]. In canon, Naruto was able to mold chakra into the recipient's elemental nature for their convenience. It's also possible to pass on nature chakra, so Hinata doesn't have to bother learning Sage Mode.

If they learned that and Naruto expanded his water clone facility, all three of them would have infinite chakra and infinite numbers of clones. And all those clones have a Byakugan and a Sharingan.

I don't know if Hinata knows the Kaiten, but if so there's no reason not to teach it to the boys.

He learned to do Sage mode by being one with the universe. He gets the chakra because it naturally overflows from his water clones, but that's not a direct transfer, just a function of how clones work.

****** "His first idea was to generate a clone and put it in his “sage mode,” then to use that chakra-transferral technique he and Sasuke had learned from Kabuto. After finding a way to rest one body's arm on the flesh of the other without the touch being too distracting he was able to feel the flow coming through a little, even while wiggling the finger of his other hand. That was a proof of concept, at least, but Jiraiya probably wasn't carting around a limp shadow clone on his back every time he fought, so there were probably better options to be found."\\

  This technique was originally created by [[https://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Hagoromo_%C5%8Ctsutsuki][Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki]] in order to "connect" the spiritual energies of every living person. His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of [[https://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Ninsh%C5%AB][ninshū]], but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. Once, the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.

Did you introduce the syrup technique with that scene in mind, or simply pick a high utility technique that Naruto would go for and then come up with the usage when you got to the scene?

I was worrying that Sasuke was killed and Itachi was using an illusion technique on Naruto, until I remembered the countless backups clones spanming Byakugan.

Well, they are pretty well min-maxed now, but I guess it will still be interesting given that they will be up against a min-maxed Rinnegan user.

  *Comet Shoemaker--Levy 9* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_naming_conventions#Comets][formally designated]] *D/1993 F2*) was a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet][comet]] that broke apart and collided with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter][Jupiter]] in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System][Solar System]] objects. This generated a large amount of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy][astronomers]] worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its role in reducing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris][space debris]] in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System#Inner_planets][inner Solar System]].

  The comet was discovered by astronomers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_S._Shoemaker][Carolyn]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Merle_Shoemaker][Eugene M. Shoemaker]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Levy][David Levy]]. Shoemaker--Levy 9, at the time captured by and orbiting Jupiter, was located on the night of March 24, 1993, in a photograph taken with the 40 cm (16 in) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_camera][Schmidt telescope]] at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palomar_Observatory][Palomar Observatory]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California][California]]. It was the first comet observed to be orbiting a planet, and had probably been captured by the planet around 20 -- 30 years earlier.

  Calculations showed that its unusual fragmented form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992. At that time, the orbit of Shoemaker--Levy 9 passed within Jupiter's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit][Roche limit]], and Jupiter's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force][tidal forces]] had acted to pull apart the comet. The comet was later observed as a series of fragments ranging up to 2 km (1.2 mi) in diameter. These fragments collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere between July 16 and July 22, 1994, at a speed of approximately 60 km/s (37 mi/s) or 216,000 km/h (134,000 mph). The prominent scars from the impacts were more easily visible than the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot][Great Red Spot]] and persisted for many months.

Assuming this is a result of some technological means, that would imply that in-universe materializing matter may be easier than transporting that many comets.

If you have on-demand, on-location, instant and rapid matter materialization, then you probably can also rapidly transport energy. Bootstrapping a dyson swarm around the sun is pretty straightforward then. Build your first few solar satellites via conventional means. Capture enough energy to build your next solar satellite via your matter materialization process. Use ultra lightweight material to save on the power required. From there it is straightforward exponential growth in your number of satellites.

And of course, your matter materialization technology might also have some related technology that allows you to rapidly and directly siphon energy/mass from the sun, making even the solar satellites unnecessary.

*** Eh, doesn't seem implausible even in our universe. The mangekyo transformation seems like the kind of thing that would cause the a burst of chakra, which, like radiotheraphy, might effectively "sterilize" and then "cauterize" the eye, killing any of the host's immune cells inside it and then preventing any more from entering. The eye would, thus, be incredibly vulnerable to infection, which could lead to complications like retinal detachment or cataracts.

But if the eye were to be transplanted to a host whose DNA was similar enough to /not/ reject it as foreign tissue, then the surgical site would create an entrance for the new host's immune cells to enter the eyeball and protect it from then on. Sort of as if the eye had bones which got a bone-marrow transplant.

This does bring up an obvious issue if we try to apply our world's medical science to the world of Naruto: why didn't Kakashi, or anyone else, experience organ rejection and auto-immune problems upon taking some random eye and sticking it into their body? Can /regular/ eyes also be easily given to random strangers in the Narutoverse?

** Hey, [[/u/Wertifloke]], do we get to see some more romantic tension between Naruto and Hinata?

Bonus points if there's dialogue among the lines of "I want to have Naruto inside me" (referring to wanting to keep his eye) and everyone misunderstands.

My only other question is whether the rinnegan works like a Langford basilisk (they exist, the nine-tailed beast effectively behaves like a mind virus), because that's really the only way for this story not to turn into a crackfic or pure power fantasy.

Edit: Actually, whether the nine-tailed beast is a mind virus depends on what happens if Naruto becomes the beast while there are still clonces running around. Strictly speaking it depends on the details of how shadow clones transfer their memories.

If Naruto takes more than 6 seconds to syrupify the entire sphere than Kisame can outpace it with water creation. Don't forget Kisame has about 3x as much chakra as canon Naruto. So Kisame either didn't think of it (dumber) or his techniques are slower than Canonisame (weaker), or he doesn't have the chakra to do so (weaker).

2. The chakra eating sword absorbs chakra on contact, and when its part of kisame he does too. If syrup without chakra reverts to water, then why would it impede him at all. It certainly wouldn't survive being drawn into his gills, so he'd be able to breathe. The chakra absorption has a maximum rate, but it works quickly enough to absorb most of a tailed vessel's chakra cloak in half a second, and Naruto's experiment showed that syrup isn't much more chakra dense than elementally created water. Kisame didn't do this here, so either he didn't realise he could (dumber) or he doesn't absorb chakra in the same way (fewer abilities).

3. Canonisame's personality was that he loved to fight in close quarters where he could use his superior strength and endurance. In canon he resorted to the water katamari only when he was pressured in close quarters combat. Fanfic Kisame makes no attempt to employ strategy, and goes straight for the water sphere, even though it would accomplish nothing he wasn't already doing (dumber).

4. Bonus:\\
   I'm not sure why Kisame maintained the shape of the water, instead of letting it flow away so he could escape it. Unless the syrup is very viscous, enough so that it can keep kami knows how many tons of water contained. Maybe chakra syrup really is that thick, so free pass on this one.

I think that this fight is just a demonstration to show that Naruto is awesome and he beats everybody no matter what, which is fine for a fanfic, and I'm enjoying how the techniques are designed to be munchkinable and the narrative of Naruto picking them apart.

*The point:* My point is just that this isn't the single point of departure fanfic I thought it was at first, and rational!Naruto isn't the biggest deviation. I also think it would be more satisfying if the antagonists were, maybe not rational, thinking characters, but at least self interested to some extent.

*** The smart thing for him to have done was go underground. Canon Kisame does have the technique and Naruto's syrup wouldn't extend downwards.

On the other hand, by the time this Kisame began trying to escape the dome he was already covered in the sap. Might not have made a difference.
