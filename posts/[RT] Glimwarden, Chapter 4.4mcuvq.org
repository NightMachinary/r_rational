  “98,550 hearts,” replied Sander, nearly automatically.
#+end_quote

For the reader's sake, translations have been made whenever the subject of weeks and years are brought up. At the time /The Glimwarden Chronicles/ takes place, the calendar system in use was a remnant of Tor Ellsum. The clergy there used a base nine numbering system, which was largely vestigial in Light's Hollow. This calendar had nine-day week-equivalents, nine-week month-equivalents, and a nine-month cycle. This resulted in a calendar with 729 days, with a single extra day tacked on at the end to make up the difference (Tripartite Day). As the Jorón lived on a planet with years equal in length to our own, each calendar cycle covered two orbital periods. While the clergy might have found the symmetry of nines pleasant, there were some obvious problems with regards to this calendar, namely that some conversion was necessary if (for example) you wanted to plant your crops at the same time each orbital period. Nevertheless, no later attempts at reform met with success, even after society had largely switched away from the nonary system.

Whenever a year is expressed, it refers to an Earth calendar year rather than the Jorón calendar year, which is twice as long. This is primarily to avoid confusion with regards to ages, all of which the reader would have to mentally double if translation was more literal, e.g. the text would describe Sander as being eight years old. Depending on context, I have sometimes translated the Jorónese word for a nine-day calendar period into a literal "nine days", but in many places I have simply left it as "a week" since it seldom matters to the narrative whether a week consists of nine days or seven (and a declaration of nine days might feel oddly specific if the reader does not know or remember the cultural context).

Sander's math is therefore somewhat more simple than the translation would suggest, because he is only multiplying basic numbers together and doing a standard conversion from nonary afterward.

** So I wonder about limits and hacks to the system. Lanterns 2-7 are usually built in the natural hexagonal circle packaging. What happens if you then turn of the middle one, taking care to have a high flux in the interlapping zones?

Do darklings just SPAWN inside the light hollow? If not you can get away with much fewer lanterns overall. Either no one ever tried - or they did with catastrophic results.

**** Really, you can extend the idea: say a lantern "protects" any volume which receives sufficient flux. So, if you can turn off the middle Lantern, it makes sense to instead have lots of smaller Lanterns in a fence, so that you're not wasting as much Light.

While you're at it, since you just need to achieve some minimum flux, why not make the Lights smaller and denser? Maybe more efficient. If the tech is there, you could instead use fiber optics (or mirror system, or similar), to direct light from a central lantern (or perhaps 2-3 for redundancy) out to the exterior.

An enterprising individual with good control of lantern output and direction could aim a beam of Light from the lantern, creating some targeting system. That could be the ultimate form of a Lantern.

A Lantern is the most wasteful use of Light, because the other forms (human consumption, runes) are permanent gains, whereas the Lanterns only temporarily illuminate the city.

***** Glimlight clearly works on some sort of principal beyond our physics. The most clear example is that intensity falls off by 1/r^{3,} which seems to suggest either that it's some sort of dipole effect, or that it's propagating in a 4-dimension space. In either case, it's unlikely that mirrors or fiber optics will work the way you would want them to.

****** Interestingly, if the lanterns work by some sort of dipole or 4D effect, but the evaporation of their central hava sphere is dependent on it's 3-space area, it would be entirely reasonable for their field strength to be dependent on the diameter^{3,} while the rate of hava consumption went as diameter^{2.}

That would mean that, fences aside, protected land area would be a constant function of the rate at which hava was used up. This would help account for the uniform design of the lanterns: there's little cause to want to make different sizes.

Risk aversion (in a simple single-wide fence, one lantern failure lets darklings into the core, which is large compared to the ring in which the residents could seek refuge), the loss of useful barely-lit hinterlands, and the sheer manpower required to maintain so many more lanterns would be sufficient to explain why fences aren't a thing - at least for mid-sized places like Light's Hollow.

Big places could have a double-thick fence, which would require TWO lanterns to fail before the core was compromised; and if the second, inner, fence was composed of lanterns mounted on rails...

I initially assumed that was a mistake, guess not. My current assumption is that grimlight is some kind of volume effect: you're consuming a constant amount of something over time, to produce an effect that spans the entire volume (so there are no shadowing effects). But it's too early to know...

  . “Of course, it leaves you weak and helpless after the fact, not to mention drained of bind, but it's better than dying, and if you don't have anything to lose, why not?”

Maybe this would have been better to test after taking Sander into the woods rather than before? You know, so if a Darkling got past Merry he would be fit and fully charged to have a better chance of not being harmed? It's nice to have the information about his signature beforehand, perhaps, but it's not useful if he has no way to use it. Oh well, Merry seems competent enough.

** Something I was confused about before that hasn't clarified on reread: the first chapter says

#+begin_quote
  Killing a darkling wasn't supposed to be about making a killing blow, or even removing its body parts one by one, it was about inflicting enough cumulative damage that it was left with no reserves.
#+end_quote

This gave the impression that taking down Darklings is a battle of endurance in most circumstances, a diminishing of HP bars that theoretically can make a group of them dangerous even for experienced Glimwardens (since they can't just one-shot them with superior power).

But that seems to be exactly what Merry is saying her guns are capable of. Except when she shot it:

#+begin_quote
  The darkling didn't seem to be effected by the hit; it began sprinting toward them, occasionally pushing off the trees with its claws as it went by for more speed. Sander had thought that it would die from the pistol shot; he stepped back with his borrowed pistol drawn. For her part, Merry had drawn a dagger and seemed unconcerned by what was happening.
#+end_quote

Not even a visible loss of substance, until

#+begin_quote
  She had stabbed it through straight to the very core and killed it in the instant that it jumped at her.
#+end_quote

So apparently a one-shot is possible if you can pierce the heart, but that's difficult normally because of all the substance being in the way. My hypothesis is that the bullet bored a line through its substance near enough to the core that she could just pierce it with a dagger and go for an insta-kill. If that's the case, why didn't it close its wound the way it did against Sander? Not enough time? I get that Merry's not the best verbal instructor, by her own admission, but I think it can still stand to be better explained.

Looking forward to seeing the new type of monster in action next chapter!

*** If I had to guess, I'd say that a darkling is basically a construct like the Lanterns that utilises the energy of the hearts in a different way. Damaging it saps energy from the system (potentially causing it to lose coherence), but destroying the heart shuts it down outright.

I'm not terribly confident in that model, but it makes a nice literary parallel with the Lanterns. "HP and heart=crit" makes about as much sense, but doesn't quite fit with the technical portrayal of the Lantern technology.

In this case, Merry was either trying to illustrate the issue of effective range with her pistols or trying to goad the darkling into attacking.

Apparently it just splits when you try to crush or bite down on it, so I'm not sure yet why stabbing it would "destroy" it unless the act of splitting it is what makes the darkling lose coherence.

** Mhhh... As other people said, the fact that the town in completely glimlit instead of bordered by a glimlight fence probably means that the centre of the ring wouldn't be safe from darklings, either because they can spawn in or because they can bypass the fence.

Could you make a hunting reserve that way? If the darkling spawn inside, it would probably be a much safer hunting ground than the forest, with bunkers, easier scouting, etc. The amount of darkings there might not be enough to sustain the lanterns, but it would still be a nice bonus.

Otherwise, I like Sander's arrogance here. He says: "Half die in the first year, but it's not so grim after that. If you could figure out why that first year was so bad then you'd be able to mitigate whatever factors are at play."

Okay, so let's say those factors are, 1: they suck at fighting, and 2: their bones are too easy to break because they haven't eaten enough hava yet. What do you do about that? Make double sure the darklings don't eat you?
