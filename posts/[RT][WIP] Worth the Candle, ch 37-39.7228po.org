** This is /Worth the Candle/, a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy with some harem elements that is probably better than you would think it is given that description. I may need to get better at blurb writing. Click [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][here]] to start at Chapter One or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][here]] to get the entire work on a single page.

Book I comprises ch 1-14 (~60K words), Book II is ch 15-33 (~80K words), and everything from 34 to present (~40K words right now) is Book III.

Apologies for the delay, I kept thinking that I would just do a multi-chapter release once I had hit a good mid-book stopping point, but it kept taking longer and longer to get there, and then eventually six days had passed. While this story does not have a definite release schedule (because that's how I like it) I do think that six days is probably a bit longer than I personally would like, especially if the chapters are just piling up and waiting to get posted.

Personally, I am going with "Elves, and half-elves default to bisexual, with poly being very popular", and while she kind of does want a threesome at some point, she has had it up /way/ past her eyebrows with the way men of other races that know this react.

RE: Soc.... His baseline social skills are so bad I figure he will trip the equivalent warning rather a lot sooner than he did for MEN if he starts dumping points in it. He still should, at least until that happens.

** +Haven't yet finished reading the new chapters.+ Thanks very much for the entertaining story, cthulhuraejepsen =)!

Regarding Joon's recent efforts to min-max the system, I think it's somewhat ironic that he is missing some key information. He considers the social stats to be dump stats like in most games. However he did notice that of the magic he is familiar with under the mental stats, they don't seem to be as all-powerful so far as he would hope.

We as the readers are aware that many of the strongest magics are actually classified under the social stats. Gold Magic and Revision Magic we've already seen to give variations on straight-up invincibility and other superpowers. Wards seems like the most exploitable generalized magic he's seen so far. Of the skills we haven't yet seen, Library Magic (SOC) certainly sounds much more useful and exploitable than Livestock (MEN) or Woodworking (MEN).

So contrary to typical expectations, to maximize pure combat power in the long term, he would have been better off maining the social stats. Though that might give weaker results in the short term.

As part of the irony here, this allocation of the strongest magics to social skills seems like exactly the sort of expectation-subverting humour he recounts using as a DM. Oops. Hoisted by his own petard.

*** Well, maybe, but I think you're assuming that the way the skills are arranged on the character sheet means something? The skills' position and their actual governing stats seem only loosely related, for example Art appears to be under MEN but in fact its primary stat is CHA, and Skin Magic next to SOC has primary stat KNO (Ch. 30). So I don't think you can reasonably make any conclusions about which stats govern which skills from the layout alone.

As you say, it's better long term but worse short term. Given how his life has been from coming to this world, it's only been recently where picking the physical stats seems like the objectively worse decision. Maximizing the magic abilities takes time to learn actual spells and uses, rather than the "I am now stronger and better with swords" of the physical skills.

I'm personally curious about steel magic. Metal bender? More for large scale things? The potential utility is amazing.

Side note, and only because I finished this story recently: what happened to that Quill guy's sword? It appeared to be able to cut through steel, and was by far the best weapon seen at that time. Sure, not a good primary weapon until he learned to use it, but even now it would be valuable to have a weapon with unexpected piercing power.

**** Blood has rather good drawbacks for the cost. The fire one is a light source, short ranged attack, and is capable of negating overheating through exercise or environmental effects. The cost is body heat, which repleneshies quickly. The heartbeat enhance thing is not only fantastic for speed, but is also a decent melee attack. I wonder when he realizes that combining a super punch with a weapon makes it vastly better, regardless of if your hand is strong enough. Make Anyblade into a halberd or long sword, then do the heartbeat punch to swing it impossibly fast.

Also, throwing weapons. He could probably throw his special dagger /through/ someone if he notices the synergy.

Both blood spells have a minor or even situationally beneficial cost, and hes only just begining in blood magic. I think he might reconsider his decision to focus on physical stats if he gets some pointers on what blood magic can do for him.

**** Sorry, I didn't think this counted as a spoiler.

Our most recent character skill listing was at [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27331518][the start of chapter 34]]. The undiscovered skills are just written in light grey text, so as readers we can see them clearly by highlighting with a mouse. Though I suppose anyone reading on mobile might have a harder time doing that.

***** Those aren't all the available skills are they? I don't see flower magic there. Just how many skill types are there?

I feel like they might be a problem. The thing is there's woodworking and horticulture, that kind of specificity kind of implies chemistry or architecture or masonry as just as viable skill classes which implies hundreds or thousands of possible skills covering every profession or subject. That seems like a bit much and overly complex. Or like why are pistols and shotguns their own skill classes? If they are then it stands to reason crossbows or whips would be too. If there's such a deluge of skills then there's some serious potential to stack lots and lots of virtues.

****** Perhaps this gives us some clue as to the nature of the reality Joon finds himself experiencing. In plenty of RPGs your main character can never learn to be a farmer even though there are clearly farmers in the world growing food. So there are a number of options as to what the skill list could indicate:

- There could be more options than listed so far.
- The list might represent a fixed set of skills which the game system can support Joon in learning beyond natural human learning.
- It might be impossible for Joon to learn skills other than those listed.
- There might be future-narrative-prediction involved such that the system only lists skills which Joon will end up learning during the course of his plot.

Specifically regarding your example of flower magic, an earlier chapter said that some sorts of magic aren't able to be learned by just anyone, but may depend on uncontrollable factors like bloodlines or such. Flower magic could be like that.

Edit: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26627424][Found the thing about types of magic]]:

#+begin_quote
  There were twenty-seven different kinds of magic, and that was the conservative count. Many of those only included in the less-conservative count were hereditary, racial, or otherwise not the sort of thing that was available to just anyone. Looking at my character sheet and assuming it was laid out in a sane way, I would have access to at most fifteen of them, though probably less. (I was extremely interested in learning more of them, but Amaryllis thought that all the low-hanging fruit had already been picked. That didn't stop me from asking questions, but she was right that there were significant barriers that it didn't seem like my ability to learn things really quickly would overcome, or which would be useless to us without the necessary resources to capitalize on them.)
