** I'm glad to hear someone call out the 'politics as window dressing' thing. Very few stories are genuinely about politics, because politics does not lend itself well to being understood as a story. It is usually just used to set the stakes.

** Tangent on a throwaway remark, but a massive amount of American dramatic theatre plots are focused on real estate, usually as inheritance.

Which reminds me, has anybody ever debated presenting a rationalist story in any form other than prose?

*** Some chatter about webcomics from time to time, but nothing serious that I've seen.

** I enjoyed this.

Politics in fiction is often an afterthought. Political intrigue is written more like a [[https://writingexcuses.com/2019/06/16/14-24-political-intrigue/][mystery or a "heist of information"]].

I'm also a fan of Bueno de Mesquita's [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook][The Dictator's Handbook]]. I'm much more sceptical of [[http://decision-making.moshe-online.com/criticism_of_bueno_de_mesquita.html][the accuracy of his models to predict future events]]. That said, applying his rules to fiction and thinking through second order effects of your political system is a great way to make your political writing believable.
