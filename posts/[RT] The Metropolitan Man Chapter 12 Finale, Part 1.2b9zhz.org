  *Origin:* The Kryptonian civilization once spanned hundreds of worlds, their technology and knowledge unrivaled in their corner of the galaxy. Kryptonians had long since advanced to a point where technology and biology were indistinguishable, making them virtually immortal and omnipotent in the eyes of less developed races. Over time they grew overconfident, and wished to introduce their technology to undeveloped worlds, in direct violation of the most important rule of the galactic community: the Omega Law.

  In an attempt to assimilate the natives of the planet Mars, Krypton finally gained the attention of Colu, enforcer of the Omega Law, and was marked for extermination. A Kryptonian Scientist named Jor-El, specializing in passively and remotely observing nearby Earth, witnessed this and rapidly set a plan forward to save his infant son, Kal-El, from their fate. By sending him in a conventional rocket toward the backwater planet Earth, he guaranteed Kal-El's safety from Colu. The rocket took over a thousand years to reach the planet, and upon reaching the surface, restructured Kal-El's body so he would appear as a human.

  Raised by simple farmers, Kal-El (now called Clark Kent) eventually learned of his heritage when examining a recorded message from his rocket. His father informed him of his fate, and that he must never dominate the planet with his immense power, as it would warp the fate of all life on Earth. Not content to passively observe humanity, though, Clark decides to inspire others through his actions as Superman.

  Superman has declared that he fights for those who cannot defend themselves, owing no allegiance to a particular government (though still obeying their laws). He has particularly targeted corporate corruption and the military-industrial complex as enemies of human progress, his most prominent opponent being billionaire industrialist Lex Luther and his company, LexCorp.

If he only came recently to his better senses, he indeed did not take proper measures before to ensure the ship's safety nor his mother's, and lying then might serve further, undisclosed purposes. That said, I cant think of any really good purpose right now.

+1 for superman being a "level 1.5 (at least)" player rather than the plain brained hero he appeared to be at first.

**** Superman is actually hiding a lot of the truth from Lois. He knows that someone out there knows his secret identity, and that there's a shadowy figure or figures pulling the strings. And he's also got to realize that Lois's life is in danger, just like his mother's was. He doesn't seem to tell Lois any of that, though it seems like she should have a right to know. He also doesn't tell her that he's got a prisoner in the Arctic. That whole conversation was sort of funny, because both Lois and Superman were dropping layers of their deceptions while pretending that they're dropping all of them.

It could be misinformation in order to see how she'd react to the lie? Or misinformation to see how/whether she's leaking information to someone? Tell Lois that the ship is in the Arctic, see what happens?

Lex described Superman's explanation of x-ray vision as sounding like it was thought up by someone who didn't know how x-rays work. Lex also said that if Superman could see through several feet of concrete, he should be able to see through an inch of lead.

That is quite different from what you're saying.

Furthermore, the Smallville operation was assumed to be secret because of lead in the earth's crust, and the death of Martha Kent is strong evidence that he indeed didn't know. It would be pretty contrived (narratively unlikely, rather than physically unlikely) if he couldn't see through the crust for a completely unrelated and unmentioned reason.

How about he bloody listened? The early chapters note the existence of many different people and organisations with ideas to do much greater good in the same amount of time as what he is getting. Psychologists exist, so if he fears going insane he can get help rather than trying to self-medicate by having a job on the side as a reporter.

The man has super-hearing, and has an institute of brilliant scientific and philosophical minds created specifically to intelligently deal with the predicament of his existence. This isn't some understandable farmboy level ignorance, this is arrogant, deliberate, and insistent.

The ideas suggested tend to be about money and economical good while Superman is all about saving the individual people. It reminds me very much of the identifiable victim effect - he does not intuitively feel the sheer amount of good he could do by being more efficient compared to saving people individually.

Well, perhaps. We do not get to see his actual reasoning besides him wanting to remain impartial. But I absolutely do not think that most people with his personality parameters (non-violent, resents money, wants to do the most good possible, etc) and background would choose very differently, not immediately.

** It seems odd to me that Lois hasn't made the conclusion that "Clark Kent" is Superman's way of staying connected to the human world. That is who he is first, then Superman. If he dedicates himself wholly to the latter, he's concerned he'll lose touch with his human side; ironically, fulfilling the exact fears Lois and Lex have about a Superman living amongst mortals.

I agree that Supes is wasting time working at the Daily Planet instead of stopping disasters; however, it's abundantly clear that he has the same mental stress limits as other humans. If he is terrified of what he'll become if he totally gives into the Superman persona, that should be STRONG evidence in support of his actions, instead of a weapon to be used against him by Lex and Lois.

As smart as they both are, they are making the critical mistake of assuming they can figure everything out without actually /talking to him about it/. Granted, he hasn't been open about his true heritage with anyone til now, which is why I've let it slide thus far.

Lex was on the right track with the concern about a human connection/empathy; however, tricking and lying to him (on both Lex and Lois' part) is a weak battle-plan compared to just talking to the man and working out with him what he needs to do to stay Superman and sane.

On the other hand, talking to him might help ground him...but what if it isn't enough, and he goes bad anyway? Then he knows who you are and might well target you first.

Based on their models of human emotions and his behavior talking to him is likely to have a much higher reward/ risk ratio than trying to kill him, or murdering his mother. Any course of action could lead to risk/ benefit, but they should base their actions on what is likely to happen. They shouldn't purposely only pursue what they know is a high risk/ medium reward strategy when there is an alternative low risk/ high reward strategy that carries little additional risk.

They should also be considering other scenarios. What if other super beings come? What if the Superman thing is an elaborate test by some godlike entity? What if the USA is invaded? Those scenarios should carry some weight, Superman could reduce the risk of a mass extinction.

Sure he acted nice in the interviews and played a good Smallville, but those could be ploys. Now that they've had an honest conversation about who he is, Lois has the responsibility of re-evaluating the risks as she sees them.

Her old info: unknown mindset, clearly lying about who he is, extinction-level powerhouse. High-risk to talk to directly.

Her new info: known mindset (lonely Smallville kid with superpowers but potentially limited rationality skills), lying to protect his own sanity, still extinction-level powerhouse. Low-risk to talk to directly.

If the kryptonite radiation hits him you could have one day of an insane god with super diarrhea, a massive headache, superpowered spasms, superpowered vomiting, given knowledge of pre-existing radiation symptoms. Any other (safe) option would be preferable.

Plus if he believes his friend is conspiring with the person trying to kill him his danger increases. Ideally, you'd want to use subtle methods to encourage those around him to talk to him and be friendly, and do nothing that looked like an order, or which could conceivably be seen as a lie if the person had to talk about their contact.

  Classically acute radiation syndrome is divided into three main presentations: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis][hematopoietic]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal][gastrointestinal]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological][neurological]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular][vascular]]. These symptoms may or may not be preceded by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrome][prodrome]]. The speed of onset of symptoms is related to radiation exposure, with greater doses resulting in a shorter delay in symptom onset. These presentations presume whole-body exposure and many of them are markers which are not valid if the entire body has not been exposed. Each syndrome requires that the tissue showing the syndrome itself be exposed. The hematopoietic syndrome requires exposure of the areas of bone marrow actively forming blood elements (i.e., the pelvis and sternum in adults). The neurovascular symptoms require exposure of the brain. The gastrointestinal syndrome is not seen if the stomach and intestines are not exposed to radiation.

** Superman's comment about moving the spaceship seems odd. If he isn't lying, he presumably put a decoy spaceship in, but I can't see for what motive. Why would a decoy spaceship be better than none at all? Especially since it contains kryptonite. Perhaps he just couldn't move the kryptonite? Or it could be a fake? But if it were a fake then Lex has no ability to harm him next chapter, which would be an extremely disappointing finale.

Him lying doesn't seem to make much sense either. He clearly acknowledges the need to move it, so why wouldn't he have? It is surely within his ability, even with the kryptonite inside it. And for what purpose did he lie?

This line will hopefully make sense next chapter, because I am currently at a loss

*** My thought was that for some reason he didn't want to admit to Lois that the spaceship had been stolen by someone, so instead he just told her that he'd moved it a long time ago. And of course he now acknowledges the need to move it, because of hindsight; it was just stolen!

**** Good point, that does seem a more plausible hypothesis than any of mine. Although I would've thought that superman might've trusted her with the information, given how much else he told her. He did leave out Floyd though, so perhaps

** Awesome!

When I'm reading these types of situations like the first bit I always find myself struggling to keep a straight face in case one of the characters knows that I know the thing. Does anyone else do that?

Is PU-356 a Looney Toons reference?

I can't fine a Loony Toons reference to PU-356, but I presume you're thinking of the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuUJfYcn3V4][Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator]]

** That was very nice. The deception on both sides was getting to be discomforting. I think Lois' turnaround in attitude was a little quick to be believable though. Part of that is that really, her hatred of the guy was a bit too intense to be believable beforehand. That's just my experience though.
