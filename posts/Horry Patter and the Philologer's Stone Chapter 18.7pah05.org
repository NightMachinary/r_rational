** It upsets me a bit that Harry didn't take chronomancy despite the obvious usefulness to his current circumstances.

It's not like a year 1 defense class will help him against his future self, and he has another five main subjects in common with his friends, so the excuse is a bit odd.

** I really, really, REALLY want to read this fic, but just can't get over the fact that its.. Horry Patter. Just looking at words like 'Philologer' makes my soul hurt :(

But I still really want to read it, because if it's half as interesting as the comments make it sound then it must be amazing.

**** I know it's an actual word, but seeing 'philologer' where I think 'philosopher' should be sends my soul back to some of the more typo ridden fics I used to read, and that hurts.

*** Oh, it's totally worth it. You get used to it after a few chapters because it becomes regular.

*** If it helps, after a few chapters, my brain just started superimposing the correct spelling over the typos. It is distracting, but manageable.

** I'm just disappointed that chronomancy classes are arranged in order from smallest to largest. I was kind of hoping for a joke similar to when Zaphod Beeblebrox attempted to summon his great-grandfather at a seance.

#+begin_quote
  Zaphod: Concentrate on his name.\\
  Arthur: What is it?\\
  Zaphod: Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.\\
  Arthur: What?\\
  Zaphod: Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!\\
  Arthur: The Fourth?\\
  Zaphod: Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third...\\
  Arthur: What?\\
  Zaphod: There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Now concentrate!

*** Yeah, reading that part as

#+begin_quote
  CHRONOMANCY 1

  CHRONOMANCY 0*
#+end_quote

made me laugh at the joke, but then after reaching the “CHRONOMANCY 1*” part I had to go re-read it properly as

#+begin_quote
  CHRONOMANCY -1

  CHRONOMANCY 0*
#+end_quote

which made me somewhat disappointed by the actual thing.
