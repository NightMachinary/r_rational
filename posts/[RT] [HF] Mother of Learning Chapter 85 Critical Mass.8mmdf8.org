** Everyone keeps talking about the artifacts I like to point out the other big thing that happened this chapter. Zorian is finally throwing himself into learning mental enchantments, soul magic, and blood magic. Zorian truly the most evil resume, but now he can gain even better mind powers. Plus didn't Tinami want a way to become psychic. The Tinami ship is still here.

**** True true, but only soul mages will be able to tell if Zorian made any soul enchantments, the same for mind mages and mind enchantment, and that's only if they were good enough to tell (eg natural or extremely skilled mind mages). Finally he could just claim the blood enchantments are from his witch ancestry. I know he had issues (moral or practical) with experimenting with these magics, but now he can finally get the superpowers we always wanted him to.

****** I am with you on the rituals; even if he was busy, he could at least have practiced on himself in any restart where he didn't expect a fight. But on mind magic, I think you are understating the danger.

We know the main character won't go mad or cripple himself, but he doesn't. And this is akin to doing a lobotomy on yourself because you know you can /probably/ fix it when it goes wrong, then repeat it a hundred times until you get the desired result, and so on. Even if you fob it off to a simulacrum, he'll go through the same thought process and will probably feel that "because it would be nice being smarter" is a weak argument in hindsight.

He could force them to do it, but then they'll resent him and that's another can of worms.

*** It's a little scary how much things will accelerate. The temp markers let them accelerate their own development by leveraging everyone elses. A few more restarts and they can probably bypass the wards on the treasury entirely, so they can teleport in and take the dagger.

They can use that to mostly guarantee four of the artefacts. Zorian got into QI's memories, so he probably knows where he starts the loop. If they knife-soulkill the pyramid wasps/Sulruthm, QI and the hydra/chameleon drakes that leaves them able to pick them up at will. That gives them four artefacts on demand, and they need only find the staff.

****** Soulkilling Quatach would have a huge impact on the restarts. So much so that any new knowledge about the invasion would be utterly worthless once they're out of it. They would have no experience fighting the lich, it's possible that any high-ranking members of the Cult of the Dragon Below they targeted would react completely differently without the lich's support, and any large-scale attempts at ending the invasion in some way or other wouldn't be guaranteed to have any success outside the loop.

Granted, it would be a great advantage to start the loop with the Crown, but they would also lose a lot in return, not the least of which is the incredible potential of trading items for Quatach's knowledge. It would seem to me like a bad idea overall, even if they did happen to somehow have obtained knowledge of where Quatach begins the restarts.

On an unrelated note, I look forward to seeing what methods Z&Z will implement to try to reduce the impact of the Ibasans being able to summon demons during the actual invasion in the real world.

******* Sure. But they've managed to cancel the invasion at least once with their actions, so they might not need practice fighting him. If they /do/ end up deciding to fight him outside then soulkilling him would be mad. Otherwise they're just removing an enormous threat.

It is a trade off, but I just can't see QI as anything but their biggest threat and one that they might not be able to overcome safely so close to the restart limit. Zach has already mentioned soloing other liches; he managed to kill Old Oganj pre-ZZ era. QI? It took an over-engineered battlefield and what seems like one of the world's pre-eminent telepaths smacking around his brain. And even that wasn't permanent. But YMMV, since if they cancel it this time, while the military will be on guard they won't know when the next will come.

******** There are three times I can think of when they greatly changed the invasion schedule. The first time was with the help of the Cyorian aranea matriarch and the memory packet she transferred every restarts, while RR was still inside the loop. The invasion still occurred, but it was just so ineffectual that it didn't succeed at causing any great damage, to the point that it was practically cancelled while RR succeeded at convincing Quatach to follow him to attack a specific academy student who apparently was responsible. This scenario won't be able to be replicated, since the next time RR gets involved by giving all the passwords and his predictions, they will also have access to demons (greatly increasing the amount of damage they can create), and Zorian no longer has the matriarch's memory packet, which gave her specific knowledge of when and how to approach whom, and who was connected to the invasion, etc. They spent numerous restarts with a whole colony of mind readers digging through the head of all important people in the region without regards for their own lives, to get that information. And it's gone.

The second time they affected it was before Zorian teamed up with Zach, when he launched an attack against Iasku Manor along with Alanic and regiments from both the Army and the Church. They succeeded, they defeated Sudomir, the dragon and the manor's defenses. They were able to get information on the invasion because Zorian had no regard to propriety or Sudomir's well-being, and did something that Eldemar's own mind mages would not necessarily be willing to do, which was to dig deep enough inside Sudomir's mind to notice that soul magic spell he'd cast on himself to force himself not to say anything about the invasion, and make him forget it. Without Zorian's direct involvement in this, this would be unlikely to happen, and the invasion would go as planned, minus a convenient forward base and midway teleportation point for the Ibasans. And even if Zorian did get involved in Sudomir's interrogation, the only result was for the military to investigate constantly deeper, until the Ibasans felt threatened enough to have to choose either to start the invasion right away, or to abort everything. They did the invasion, and the primordial was successfully summoned. In the real world, they would have the support of demons on top of this, not to mention RR's support with his knowledge of all the passwords, so this method is also not a good way to go about it.

And the third time I can think where Z&Z affected the invasion, and the one I believe you're referring to, is when they launched an attack on the Ibasan base under Cyoria during Quatach's temporary absence, around 2 and a half to 3 weeks into the restart, to eventually leave with the teleportation artifact. The reason the Ibasans cancelled the invasion was probably because they judged that it couldn't succeed. They couldn't summon demons, they didn't have all the passwords to circumvent wards, they lost their best method to transfer a large number of people, and either a powerful group or the Eldemar government itself was perfectly aware of their presence, to the point that they knew when Quatach left and were ready to immediately launch an assault. The reason I think that trying to replicate this would not be as easy in the real world is because: 1) they would have the passwords, which would bolster their confidence in the attack; 2) they would have demons, increasing their morale further and greatly increasing the amount of resistance the base can put out, possibly slowing down Z&Z's team so much that Quatach has time to come back; 3) it would be past the midway point into the restart, and at this point, it's likely that RR could have neutralized a lot of important people, not to mention whoever else the Ibasans will be targeting during that time when they won't be confused as to why their summoning attempts aren't working properly.

In the real world, the first and foremost priority will be to neutralize Red Robe before he has time to make important connections with the invasion forces and before he notices that other time travelers have left the time loop. However, he has already shown himself to be careful when it matters, so this last thing will most likely be the first thing he does. Like before, he will probably begin his restart with heading to wherever he can find one of these robes, and then immediately invading the Noveda mansion to see Zach's state. If Zach is even awake by then, he most likely won't be ready to completely neutralize RR, and this will probably end in a stalemate, where both sides are perfectly aware of the other. And where Red Robe will probably assume that other time travelers have also successfully left the loop, if Zach succeeded at doing it. So he will be fully on guard, and what he does then, and how this will impact his advice to the Ibasans, we have no way of knowing. So in the end, Zach and Zorian have to be ready to face anything whatsoever, including Quatach. Why wouldn't RR just convince the lich to immediately try to dispatch Zach, after all?

Therefore, kicking Quatach out of the loop wouldn't just represent a huge loss of potential knowledge and instructions from a great teacher. It would also make them lose extremely valuable battle experience, experience which they will most likely greatly need, in a simulation that ensures that Quatach will have not the slightest bit of knowledge of what has previously been attempted while fighting him by two (or more) completely unknown opponents.

So in my opinion, it's just not worth it. Except maybe on the very last or before last restart, where they might do it just to ensure that nothing goes wrong in their attempt to exit the loop, and when they just won't have enough time left to learn more.

At some point QI's going to go "Wait, /I/ taught you these skills." and they'll have the same problem as they had with Alanic. The one they tried to head off with Silverlake. He also remains one of the few things that can actively threaten them, but I will admit that depends on him not feeling like he can walk all over them enough that he'll use soul magic in combat. Or if he doesn't soul-suicide-bomb in a fit of desperation should they somehow end up on the high-end of his threat scale, or if he somehow finds out about the loop from the newly inducted loopers and his rat swarms). Yes, he can teach them a lot, but the risks are very high as of chapter 85.

(Pure speculation: Or he might get curious about why Zorian wants to get his sticky fingers into the stabilization frame around his soul for 'study' because if anybody is going to be mad enough to ask him about it, then try and duplicate that, it's Zorian. I will admit to being disappointed they didn't ask for his disintegrator ray spell (or offer to trade Alanic's golden fire spell for it).)

I appreciate the write-up, I'd forgotten about the demonic problem - perhaps Alanic may be one of those unspecified higher ranks that can call on the aid of Angels. Or put in a 'good word' for them with the church on the topic of maybe having a few very faithful priests nearby to assist on the day - I don't think we know enough about spiritual being capabilities yet on either side except to point it out as 'bad'. That's probably the main hole in my reasoning otherwise.

Ultimately I think this is more of a pure value judgement in risk management on our parts rather than something we could sit down and has out 50 pages of bullshit over and come out with a mathematically perfect solution. One we probably won't come to an agreement on. You see him as worth the risk to keep practicing on and learning from indefinitely/17 restarts, while I don't, and that's from having opposite views on most points and possible contingencies.

**** Zorian in particular is about to get much much more overpowered, using the dagger artifact he can study the hydra while it's docile and become mentally unified with his simulacrums, then he can use mental enhancements to accelerate his thinking speed. If you stack this with some improved time dilation chambers stored in pocket dimensions, you get a n_simulacrums * mental_speedup_factor * time_dilation_factor total improvement over normal learning speed. I think he could get 100 years of work done in the next 19 restarts.

**** i think a few restarts will be wasted before the acceleration gets intense. ZZ need to continue to use QI as a resource (which they must to get the crown, and possibly dagger, at all if they didn't get QI's starting location from the mind attack). QI definitely looks into ZZ after they try to contact him and get tutoring from him. those that are included with temp markers will be sieves of information to the cranium rats as they certainly do not have the mind magic capabilities to prevent it. Also, mundane means of the marked people accidentally giving away information is an issue too.

the aranea, of course, could be included without issue, but the list of humans is much shorter. i suppose some of the temp markers may be able to cast Mind Blank (for a whole month, no less, which may reduce the number that can be continually marked) but that comes with its own problems, as its been said that using Mind Blank for too long causes up to insanity.

the non-aranea that seem fit within the specifications would be: xvim, who might be able to contest the cranium rats without mind blank and can probably weather holding it for as long as he needs, damien, his wife and his team, as they're too far away to be a liability at the start and can just cast mind blank on themselves while in the city, any of alanic (and those he vouched for)/lukav/ilsa/nora/kyron, who could randomly have the ability and silverlake, who is also far away at the start and whose abilities are still a bit of an unknown.

i suppose the question is how many restarts will be wasted. this next one could end with more soul damage after attempting to contact QI and his subsequent background check which could waste 5+ more

And approaching QI was ballsy. Since he developed teaching in addition to his other skills, maybe that is an endgame for Zorian if he doesn't merge with his old self. Run off to Ulquaan Ibasa to learn from the terrifying murder wizard.

He's had a few restarts to get into its brain, and he knows it well enough to seriously consider starting experimenting with his own mental wonkery in that direction. He could probably just order it to bite itself to death.

#+begin_quote
  creating anchor upon soul is innovative. Doable?
#+end_quote

Maybe, but it isn't physical which would make it harder than 'just' anchoring a soul to a phylactory or a pocket dimension to.. anything. Perhaps it'll be an 'imprint' that stores Zorian's soul in a dormant state for later retrieval instead, similar to Sudomir's trap. Or spits him out whole with soul. Or it could be a gate anchor on Zach's soul that doesn't need synchronization to cast, because of the time difference inherent in one of them being in the Gate. Or some sort of quasi-soul bond that doesn't actually bond them, only allows one of them to teleport to the other at will from anywhere. Zach escapes, Zorian tags along. Or makes them into a 'two souled being' - one slots into the others mind/body, but somehow keeps Zach's soul there to regulate the life force when Zorian is in charge until they can escape. Or they might just be trying to become a regular possessor entity. Entirely too many possibilities, all of them a bit crazy. Or, hell, if the gods built the machine, it's known in setting that gods duplicated people on occasion, souls included. Maybe it's a possibility to let it run down and it'll just eject copies of the 'controller' since the loop can't end while it is inside. A failsafe.

If they go the escape route instead of actually merging, I'm looking forward to an 'aftermath' story where we get to see Kirielle's reaction, his mother and Ilsa responding to two Zorians. And maybe Taiven responding to one with a supernatural affinity for how her mind works. And the Aranae. And - well, you get the idea. ZZ could help the Aranae start their desired equivalent of a noble house by refining their magic and psychic 'vassal techniques'. They'd even have a ready-made ally in house Aope, as long as it didn't subsume the effort entirely.

The only reason he's even there is because of the Cult of the Dragon Below giving him extra muscle.

He doesn't seem the type to get angry over something ultimately pointless, plus he would recognize people as strong as Zach and Zorian would be too costly to assassinate thus being to much trouble for their worth.

And all of this is assuming he even finds out about ZZ. Remember that when the Cyoria Web and Aope family stopped the invasion, Zorian was actively going out and killing cranium rats, and QI never paid him any mind when he attacked the dance hall.

Nothing about that sentence says that it has to be a normal spar. Alanic later stated, "The point was seeing how long it would take before you started resorting to lethal moves." It was specifically in response to Zorian mind-blasting the soldiers who ambushed him; for him it was a cheap, invisible, ranged takedown, but Alanic misinterpreted it as a soft approach.

“Machine Learning” = ML

“Mother of Learning” = ML

The time loop is an analogy for how AI can use machine learning to become disgustingly proficient in a skill or set of skills. Computers are capable of running hundreds and thousands of simulations in the time it takes for us to do one iteration of that event. This operates much like the story's time loop as an extreme time dilation field.

AI can easily gain the experience equivalent to thousands of human hours through this method. Example: [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=92tn67YDXg0]]

In a way, machine learning is the mother of learning.

  Zorian turned his attention to the approaching king.

** I'm curious how powerful Zorian will be if he can utilize the crown's mana battery ability to its fullest. His main problem throughout the entire story has been his low level of mana. He developed his skill with magic to the extent that he is extremely efficient in his mana use with all/most of his spells, even to be point of improving on the simulacrum spell by adding golem bodies to make it more mana efficient.

This makes me wonder how he would compare to a fight against Zach, if Zorian had similar high levels of mana. To my knowledge Zach hasn't bothered trying to be efficent with his mana because he has always had a monstrous amount of it. It makes me think that if Zorian had the same amount of mana as Zach, he might be able to do twice as much with it.

As we have previously learned, one of the crown's abilities is to be a "mana battery" of sorts.

All of the divine artifacts have had abilities that non-soulmarked people can use. To my knowledge, the abilities these other objects have can be reproduced with magic.

The Orb contains a pocket dimension, Zach and Zorian are learning how to make their own pocket dimensions.

The Ring has the ability of soul-sight, which Zorian has already acquired and we know it is possible for a magic user to obtain this on their own.

Alternatively, mana absorbed by the soul is the maximum of mana absorbed by any particular simulacra, meaning that if you have two bodies trying to absorb 1 mana per second, soul absorbs 1 mana per second, but if you have one absorbing 1 and one absorbing 1.3, you get 1.3 mana per second.

  Uh, Zorian's simulacrums don't help him recover mana faster. Quite the opposite, they slow his recover down. Looking at the earlier comment, I'm guessing your relying on the idea of simulacrums speeding up ambient mana assimilation, but this doesn't work. A person's ability to assimilate ambient mana is limited to what their soul can process, no matter how many simulacrums they have. A single simulacrums focusing on mana assimilation is enough to max Zorian's recovery rate.

** So something rather important to note that we got confirmation of today, Red Robe used the dagger to wipe out all the spiders, which means he's capable of breaking into the royal vault. Perhaps stealthily/legally which would indicate he's someone pretty high up, or at least connected. (since neither Zach or Zorian noticed a breaking news about the vault being broken into he would have had to do it stealthily, but there might not even be news in the first place since the govt would want to keep that quiet)

Also I'm not sure if I'm recalling this correctly but RR was worried that there were multiple people running around with the marker. Which tells me he probably originally got the crown from the Lich and then got Zach to put a temp marker on RR.

Also i seem to recall that the temp marker only lasts 6 months thats worth noting.

From there RR either compelled Zach to keep reapplying the marker (which would indicate he can reliably get the crown from the Lich) or he figured out a way to sabotage the marker in such a way that it would be a permanent marker.

For this to work though RR would have had to be an extremely competent soul mage before the time loop started. (likely came to know about Zach because Zach came to him for soul magic training) Presumably RR developed his unshaped mind magic skills because he needed to fool Zach's marker so it's unlikely he had unshaped mind magic skills before the time loop.

So RR is

- Capable of learning enough unshaped mind magic within 6 months to fool a divine tool
- An extremely competent soul mage before the time loop
- Capable of getting his hands on the royal dagger within a single month, perhaps with help
- Capable of getting the crown from the lich
- Not important enough that his disappearance would cause a big disturbance in the country, unless there are extenuating circumstances
- Capable of breaking/avoiding the connection with the divine tool that tracks everyone in the royal vault
- Enhancements such that he can withstand getting shot without too much trouble, probably acquired in the time loop

Am I missing/wrong about anything? Best fit I can think of is that he's a corrupt priest of some form.

*** Err, he could just be Veyers like the story implies. If he's got ties to cultists and then QI can do nearly all of the work and all issues evaporate.

- Instead of getting the crown from QI, he just asks.
- We know QI can break in to steal the dagger (or Veyers just groundhog attacked the Royal Family until he found a way for them to give him the dagger).
- QI knows how to break the dagger tracking.\\
- He can have QI experiment on his soul to match Zach's marker.
- QI is the extremely competent soul mage he has access to before the loop.
- Veyers /does/ go missing after RR disappears.
- QI gives/teaches him enhancements.

The mundane scenario is that Zach is spending a loop hanging out with Veyers and realizes he can talk to QI on friendly terms for once, via Veyers' contacts. QI lets Zach use the crown under extremely controlled conditions to set a temporary marker on Veyers (after who knows how many ground-hog attempts). Then sometime within the next 6 resets, QI copies Zach's marker onto the (presumably loyal) Veyers. Zach thinks they'll go and be reset-buddies (like Z+Z are now), while QI thinks Veyers will come and help him escape the Sovereign Gate. They both get double crossed. Veyers has QI carefully fuck up everything he can with Zach's mind triggering a reset, then Veyers reneges on his deal with QI and instead of helping him uses him as a tutor over countless resets. Sometimes he lets QI know, which is how he gets perfect plans to steal the dagger.

Considering that Zach thought he was invincible back then, he might have just told QI and tried to talk him into a peaceful resolution. Worst case scenario he just resets, right?

The reasoning for Zach using the crown is that he's literally the only one that can use it. Zach wants to use it because he is aware (pre-memory-wipe) that he interacts with those artifacts uniquely and this would be his first chance to try it out, and QI wants to see it's true power used.

And why would he want /that/? Convincing Veyers, I get. Well, maybe, given that Veyers is an unstable cunt. Convincing QI? For what gain? Most importantly, in this scenario I find it highly improbable that anyone but QI walks out alive. The instant QI learns about the loop he becomes extremely dangerous (as seen just not so long ago).

Probabilistically there is a better consequence of the "Zach has been trying to convince everyone" MO. Zach tries to convince (let's say) the mayor of Cyoria about the upcoming invasion. The mayor is a red robe (a high-ranking cultist, one of ~10). We know that high-level cultists have infiltrated the government (i.e. Sudomir is the mayor of KD). Once Zach tells about the invasion to one of the cultists, he is fucked. Then a red robe becomes The Red Robe.

Is it possible that Veyers is a high-level cultist? I'd say no. His behavior before the loop is not corroborating this. The cult doesn't need him (teenager, super shitty mage, no soul/mind magic lineage)

*** So, each artifact has two functions. One that is the actual divine function of the artifact, and a time loop related function that you only have to physically have it one time (though the globe does not work like this for some reason).

The only reason to now have them all physically together is to unlock the sovereign gate to leave.

The knife unlocked their ability to “cast” soulkill. Now that they have presented it to the entity they do not need the knife anymore to use soulkill. Now the knife's actual divine artifact ability is to be able to physically effect the spiritual and cut it.

They ring unlocked their ability to cast a tracking spell on anyone. The divine artifact property of the ring provides the ability to have a soul sense.

The crown unlocked their ability to cast the temporary soul marker ability on people. The divine artifact of the crown is the mana battery that they discuss.

The globe has the divine ability of being a memory storage device. It does not ‘unlock' any ability like the other artifacts but the information they store in the globe stays throughout their time in the sovereign gate. The divine artifact ability of the globe is the pocket dimension itself.

Now as for what the staff does or unlocks I haven't the foggiest idea. I would be interested in what everyone thinks about that.

EDIT: I was wrong. After looking into it more it looks like they DO need to have physical control of the artifact to use is sovereign ability.

"Aside from soul magic, the two of them also worked on their basic shaping skills and tinkered rather heavily with alchemy, since this was the one magical discipline that hadn't been affected by their injuries in the slightest.

They didn't try to inform anyone of the time loop during this time. Most of the notebooks and other gathered information had been stored in the palace orb, which they couldn't actually access at the moment."

they /cannot/ retrieve the Orb when this line was mentioned. they're still incapacitated. meaning they cannot access the notebooks without the Orb. they're also relaxing and recovering so there's no reason to go on a journey to collect the orb, even if capable

and again, you still need to provide evidence in favor of them being able to use the abilities without the Artifacts on hand. there has been none, considering the orb was always on their person, and they only just got the Dagger and Crown, and the Ring's tracking not being shown in use, and the Staff still at large

While they know that they are being killed/recreated each restart, the experience of six cumulative restarts disappearing/just getting some memories / notes instead is going to have much larger psychological burden. There may be some workarounds like crafting memory packets and transferring them (or asking Zorian for a stuff like he did for Damien/Fortov).

I do think it is going to complicate things instead of making it more simple.

With Xvim & the teachers, we can see a better response on aiding the city with the upsurge in monster attacks & planning on countering the invasion.

With Daimen's group, we can see the orb being hunted without Z&Z's aid hunting the orb is much quicker. Also, we may finally have progress on Daimen's magic gathering initiative in Koth.

With the various aranea, we can see a deeper analysis into Bakora Gates (perhaps by destroying one) as well as discovering more Bakora Gates (such as on Blantyrre).

Zorian may find more opportunities to learn from these sources as they understand his situation better. The Filigree Sages in particular may be willing to help Zorian finally complete his learning of aranea spell formula "webcraft".

All of these groups will definitely have a an effect on the status quo. I expect that the invasion will be completely exposed. Quatach-Ichl will definitely have Z&Z on his radar & may even kidnap one of the new "time travelers". I expect any further tutoring from Quatach-Ichl will be difficult to achieve.

** Honestly my only problen with this fantastic story is that zorian has only been doing this for around 6 years. If 6 years of hard work is all it takes to become an archmage, why aren't there more archmages? Admittedly it's 6 years with nigh unlimited resources, and the ability to take stupid risks over and over, but from the first problem I'd expect any rich kid to be super strong.

*** nigh unlimited resources is a lot. lower profile (as well as not taught by rival teachers) gets more people willing to teach them as Zorian was told. being able to renegade on apprenticeships makes a huge difference. mentality, work ethic, etc. shouldn't be overestimated in commonness. Mind Magic helps a great deal. his dire situation helps a lot. time looping to gives him a ton more advantages like giving same person blueprints to improve on, knowing where and when something happens, and more

I think you're underselling by far the uniqueness and utility of the time loop in helping advance Zorian's abilities

In that case, bringing in a bunch of additional loopers would mean a large reduction in their remaining time, wouldn't it? Or maybe I'm just not remembering that right.

**** Maybe. Recreating is going to be a copy-construction either way, so it probably takes the same amount of energy with any (non-null) input. And destroying seems like something that wouldn't take energy--no need to wipe things clean if you're going to overwrite every part of it, after all. And in any case, from Zorian's description about anchoring dimensions to bags, it sounds like pocket dimensions might be unstable configurations anyway, and energy could even be harvested from their destruction.

I was sort of figuring a situation where the end of loop just plucks out all marked individuals, destroys the old pocket universe, creates a new one, and moves the old souls into the new one. It is weird that transferring the souls would be a non-negligible operation in all that, but nevertheless I have a vague inkilng that something like that was mentioned.

- more study of blood magic and enhancement rituals to assist in learning dimensional magic (especially for Zach)

- learn soul magic from QI (seems incredibly dangerous?)

- utilize black room to increase their study time for dimensional/soul/blood magic

*** I 💯 agree. Zorian was distracted, so QI had the time to cast soul magic. QI knew soul magic affected them due to the scars on their souls. The beam that hits Zorian didn't hit Zach which would trigger a reset. The beam that hit Zorian was mentioned distinctly from the disintegration beams. QI has excellent aim with his disintegration beams so it makes sense that if his aim was a little off it's a different attack. It was QIs last attack before he abandoned his body and those have been soul attacks in the past.

Narratively, it kicks QIs threat level up a notch since he would be able to permanently kill Zorian and maybe Zach. Additionally it's such a esoteric attack that it might be unique to QI and he will be much more interested in ZZ next time the meet.

Zorian is going to be very sad when he wakes up and his arm doesn't work.

**** it's highly unlikely. QI did /not/ have that much luxury to cast a slow attack like a soul attack while being assaulted heavily by mind magic. disintegration beam attacks have been described as simply "jagged red beams" (CH60, Ch24, etc) (or Ch4 when Zach had to dodge a red ray). a millenium old lich with proficiency in a multitude of magics to the highest degree is going to have bad aim, especially with soul magic when he's a necromancer?

souls are also not suffused and directly inhabiting different parts of the body. and Zorian would /know/ and feel that it was a soul attack

and QI has no reason to be using a slow Soul attack vs a quicker normal attack in this loop. just because Z&Z have soul scars doesn't make it a better option. who /doesn't/ soul magic work on? and normal magic would work just as well with the information he has this time
