** This seems like as good a place as any to voice a guess I came up with about the Aranea: the way Red Robe killed them was to shunt their souls outside the time loop. They aren't dead permanently, just unable to loop (and thus their souls never make it to their bodies at the start). Of course, that's maybe a little too optimistic.

Zorian may have his reasoning backwards. If Red Robe has the marker and Zach doesn't, how did the Zorian/Zach soul entanglement result in Zorian getting the marker? If Zach has it and Red Robe doesn't, how does Red Robe loop?

*** Zach has it, Zorian got it, and Red Robe probably doesn't have it.

He could instead be using a hostile version of "plan Areana", where Zach carries his memories and a compulsion to teleport to him at the start of each loop (and various others, to eg disregard mind magic).

**** They are in a time loop. Once you accept that there is one way to time travel, the probability for other types of time travel becomes more likely. Therefore, there is a chance that after Zach finally gets out of the time loop, he goes back in time by a few years and sets the whole thing up to either maintain a Stable Time Loop, or to complete some yet unknown plan. He'll act in character every time he meets his younger self (even if he isn't in the time loop, he can watch Zach to know how to react and something will signal the final loop) to keep the doubly-looped timeline on track. However, having a repeating time loop inside one large time loop is way too complicated to be true though.

*** Zach is almost certainly detectable by the spell, so the Southern presence is him. The other possible, but highly improbable, case is that he's out of range and Red Robe is showing up instead. If Zach was dead - as in, non-looping - I would expect that to have a noticeable impact on the magic in Zorian's soul.

Red Robe might be

- Out of range
- Under anti-scrying spells
- Missing the same marker, and looping by unknown means

Note that the third option would also match up well with the strange effect on the Areana - RR can clearly send /some/ soul effects back in time...

***** Hmm. I was thinking "how would that happen", but all he'd need was

1. Breathtaking competency and power before the loop.

2. One lucky encounter with Zach, where RR can implant a compulsion to find him immediately on loop start.

3. Ability to take advantage of this in each loop from zero, just by reading Zach's mind.

All of this is plausible, and also makes him surprisingly vulnerable - RR would only loop if Zach "awoke" him, so deal with that compulsion and it's over. He's more like a landmine triggered by Manchurian agent than an antagonist.. And only gets better plans from looping, not strength and control of magic.

****** So Zorian needs to teleport to Zach at loop start then.

Be an issue if Zach wakes up earlier while Zorian sleeps though it seems the loop starts at the exact moment when he wakes (which is quite lucky when you consider it)

Suddenly makes sense. The red robed individual has some sort of dimensional magic that lets him enter or leave the time thing at will and probably can do the same to the souls of the spiders hence the Aranea had to assault him as soon as possible before his grand scheme was enacted.

My overall guess at the entire message.

  If you are listening to this it mean things went awry. I know you think I had it coming by rushing into this but the reason I did so was simple: the time loop is degrading. I can't tell how long it will be before it breaks down. Red Robe can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was a high priority in success. I should have told you more but there can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly sorry. If I fail to stop the grand evil plan I hope it won't be necessary, but just in case I put in a map to the secret macguffin that can solve this problem hidden in Cyoria's underworld. As to who is powering it there is a whole other continent filled with spirits/ mages/ magical creatures. I didn't think it was possible, even with the help of a super powered spirit/ group of mages but this angry continent is planning the whole thing. You must stop them.

***** Meh, I just started reading yesterday, but the Something-gate deep in the dungeon under Cyoria is likely the McGuffin, correct? It would enable the enemy to transport troops and supplies from another continent.

*** d) Each looper has an unique marker. Usually no one can use their marker to detect any other looper. Zorian has a copy of Zach's marker because of the soul meld.
