It's easy! As long as the person you're explaining to has read the Sequences and has some familiarity with the rest of the rationalsphere canon. If they haven't, I dunno what to tell you, man.

********** Creating that regulatory system and enforcing it's dictates requires getting other people to /want/ to let that happen or punishing those who don't until they change their minds.

Legal penalties do have their place for punishing bad choices, but that is only sustainable if we can offer alternative good choices we can reward them for. Punishment cannot be our only response when others commit a wrong, or it just becomes an endless feedback loop of punishments.

You end up needing a regulatory system already to ensure that you can enforce the building of the new regulatory system that replaces it. That's what happens when you rely too much on disincentivizing the behaviors you don't want and not incentivizing the behaviors you do want.

Ideally, the reward for not violating the law, when you're a CEO, is that you get to keep being a CEO. It's a pretty sweet gig, even before the exorbitant pay. This only works when the government and the regulatory agencies enforce the law, because otherwise the /punishment/ for not violating the law (or for not extracting maximum value out of the commons to the detriment of society) is that you are replaced with someone who will. Which is what Mammon is about.

************ Yes. But that regulatory state was probably created when there was less socioeconomic inequality than there is now. Back then the public had enough power to get the government to form those agencies to hold corporations accountable even if only a little bit. And the public also had sufficient education to understand why those agencies were necessary to make.

That isn't the situation we're living in today. Regulatory states which benefit the public don't just happen on their own automatically. There are mechanisms behind their formation and maintenance.

(The extension of the regulatory state to include labor law was grassroot-driven, on the other hand, and wildly more violent than modern historiography does credit to.)

There certainly wasn't a /more educated/ public then than there is today; perhaps a less mal-educated one, but even then, I'm dubious.

Scott did not deny that Trump's actions were partly based on racial bias:

#+begin_quote
  [Trump]'s at least anti-undocumented immigrant, which is close to being anti-immigrant. And while one can argue that “anti-immigrant” is different than “racist”, I would agree that probably nobody cares that much about British or German immigrants, suggesting that some racial element is involved. ... You can argue that he and his supporters are biased for caring more about terrorism ... . But do you see how there's a difference between “cognitive bias that makes you unreasonably afraid” versus “white supremacy”? ... Let me say this for the millionth time. I'm not saying Trump doesn't have some racist attitudes and policies.
#+end_quote

Scott's main point was that people criticizing him as 'white supremacist' or 'openly racist' were exaggerating to the point of blatant falsehood, and that racial bias and outright white supremacy should not be conflated:

#+begin_quote
  /Aren't there a lot of voters who, although not willing to vote for David Duke or even willing to express negative feelings about black people on a poll, still have implicit racist feelings, the kind where they're nervous when they see a black guy on a deserted street at night?/ Probably. And this is why I am talking about crying wolf. If you wanted to worry about the voter with subconscious racist attitudes carefully hidden even from themselves, you shouldn't have used the words “openly white supremacist KKK supporter” like a verbal tic.
#+end_quote

Obviously the way Trump has acted since those posts were published has changed, meaning that parts of Scott's argument no longer apply (e.g. on January 6 Trump clearly did ally with actual white supremacists) and his prioritization of criticizing hyperbolic criticism of Trump seems more questionable, but with the information available at the beginning of Trump's administration, Scott's argument generally made sense, and considering how critical Scott has been of Trump there and elsewhere, it does not make sense to interpret Scott as trying to "defend" Trump in any sense broader than saying he wasn't a literal white supremacist.

I firmly explained to her that Pepe was a symbol of racism and made her delete all of the Pepes from her phone.

*********** It's funny, because I'm definitely not alt right, and I follow both Gwern and SSC. Poly, healthcare, gay, government spending all cool with me. I've read your source material and despite my best attempts at Steel manning your criticisms all I have got is that we should deplatform gwern and ssc because they haven't met your standards of discussion moderation.

Maybe you have unrealistic expectations of people with platforms. Or maybe you don't like your thought leaders to challenge you. I'd do more introspection instead of tilting at windmills, there are no giants here.

*** It is wise to consider that decisions people make might have internal reasoning behind them, especially when the entire internet was very loudly yelling about the reasoning at the time.
