*** Every time Kilian's been mentioned for the past three books it's been to repeat that /it's over./ In the same way that Nauk was only brought back to be a different person, and then killed off entirely.

I see chapters like this as an answer to fan enthusiasm. An indulgence, rather than a re-introduction of the plot thread. If it /still/ gets brought up in the comments of future books, there will come a chapter where we get an off-hand mention of a Legion mage with red hair annihilating a group of undead only to catch a javelin in the throat.

** Will Akua turn out to be a claimant, or will she stick to trying to become a heroine? Or both?

Either way, the simple fact that Aisha deemed it plausible enough to bother her queen with means that this is giant problem. If the General Staff perceives Cat as trying to betray every they fought for and Black too, in favor of Akua of all people, there's a massive crisis of trust going on.

** I mean if most of the wasteland nobles are dead and Ubua is there basically as Cat's oathbound enforcer i guess that's workable if Amadeus is really that opposed to actually ruling Praes rather than having held what two out of three for the position? Is it that bad that she's not the worst candidate for Dread Empress in terms of her long term goals? I mean yeah there's a bit of a huge conflict with previous oaths to put her down when... what was it she stopped be useful? Wait it was just a she doesn't go unpunished i think. I mean being leashed at the post that was her Goal of all goals is pretty ironic i'm not sure if that would qualify under most justice systems but Cat is still de facto Queen of Callow.

But also like directly calling out some of the readers it feels like with the mentions of Kilian.

*** Is Akua even bound by any oaths anymore? I thought she broke free when Cat lost Winter. She's just staying around /trying to be good/ these days.

**** I meant more like her getting an oath out of her in the future in exchange for well the position in general. Like the juxtaposition of the bonus chapter and this one gives kind of the implication of Cat being the equivalent of a High Lord being the backing for the actual Dread Empress/Emperor.

**** Doesn't Cat retain power over her through her soul being part of the cape?
