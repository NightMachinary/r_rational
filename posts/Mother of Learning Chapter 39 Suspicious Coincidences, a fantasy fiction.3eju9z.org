*** Not necessarily off the table yet. They ruled it out because Zach doesn't go off and do things consistently on each restart, but what if Red Robe is near him at the initial restart?

Zach and his caretaker don't get along. Zach even went out of his way to attack the caretaker on the restarts where he left. Maybe he found out the caretaker was working for one of the enemy factions? And maybe the caretaker is good at mind magic?

So it goes like this; Zach suddenly acts weird due to loops, Caretaker checks up on him with mind magic, finds out about loops, plants a memory packet (possibly spending several weeks preparing to plant it before end of loop), next loop Caretaker finds the packet when doing the scan and can take advantage of it from then on, as long as he can track down Zach and fix the packet by the end of the loop.

It would explain why there are long bouts of no activity from RR. Those are resets were Zach doesn't act strange enough for a memory scan or simply leaves without confronting the caretaker or something.

In conclusion: Illuminati, Half Life 3, Jet fuel can't melt time loops.

****** It's still somewhat possible. We don't know exactly what time the loop begins. From Zorian's perspective it's when he is woken up, but it could be any time from when he went to sleep till then. So there is the possibility of there being some extra time that Zack and RR can act before Zorian becomes active.

After Zorian committed suicide RR could have went back and put a new packet in Zack, with the first batch of information being about going back to check the caves.

So RR possibly had several hours to work with before Zorian got there.

*** Rea and Nochke being cat shifters is pretty much sealed at this point. I feel like that scene and the Red Robe speculation were devoted to shutting down fan theories while the characters worked their way through their own questions. Which isn't a terrible method, and didn't feel particularly awkward as long as it doesn't get overused.

I think Zorian has killed a few people already, but now we are seeing his (unintentional) mind crush powers. He actually has a good way of dealing with Red Robe permanently if he is still in the loop. He would still have to defeat him first though.

****** What bothers me in addition to that is that Zorian's passive mind detection and empathy which he is pretty much constantly using should have turned up a blank to him or if not then he should have mentioned if there was any internal reaction on Xvim's part on an emotional level.

The fact that he leaves any mention of his empathy out seems odd to me (especially since he implies the only way he could know if Xvim noticed was if Xvim said something...) So either Zorian didn't bother using his empathy sense (weird) OR the empathy sense wasn't working on Xvim (in which case why would you try a mind probe or be surprised when it didn't work?). Very confusing.

He did try using his sense of empathy on Xvim, in Chapter 23. He thought that Xvim simply had very good control over his emotions.

#+begin_quote
  Xvim's face told him nothing, and Zorian had already tried to use his rudimentary empathy on him to no avail, trying to see what made the annoying man tick. Xvim had an incredible control over his emotions, and virtually nothing fazed him or truly set him off.

***** It seemed obvious on my second read through. There is a ton of foreshadowing in the early chapters.

1) The author is really good with foreshadowing and conservation of detail. Most plot points are hinted at before they appear (Zorian's empathy, the red-headed girl being a wolf shifter, Kirielle's family troubles, etc), and virtually no fluff is present. Is something odd is mentioned, it's probably going to come up later. Mentioning Veyers as an old bully of Zorian's is foreshadowing /something./

2) Red robe pretty much had to be on campus when the time loop started (during the first festival.) That pretty much just leaves a student, a teacher, or one of the politicians at the dance. Zorian would have noticed a teacher mysteriously being absent, and the politicians have /no/ characterization--it wouldn't match the author's style for one of them to be Red Robe. It can't be anyone who actually shows up on campus, as Zorian isn't hiding his progression, and Red Robe has no reason to stay on campus--Like Zach, he has better things to do.

3) Boranova /passed/ his exam--the reason he isn't in Zorian's year is because he lost his temper during a disciplinary hearing. We don't know when that was, but it sounds a lot like Zach's regular fights with his mentor.

  It's rather fitting that it is student yet again at the center of things- yet none of the players seem to realize that's the case. Talk about missing something literally under your nose!
#+end_quote

Indeed. Zach at least has memory manipulation as an excuse.

As for the biggest plot points:

A) The Gates are a big one. As a side note, Damien found something deep in a jungle, and the gates are supposedly strewn all over. I wonder if he found one?

B) The historian is suspicious. I would also add the traitor student that threw the glass of poisonous gas in the panic room.

C) The Mayor and Iasku Manor are critical. That has to be where the invasion is getting the ironbeaks and winter wolves.

From what we're told, winter wolves have bounties placed upon them on the /suspicion/ that they're killing people. The alliance of Eldemar is pushing into their territory pretty hard on top of that--the winter wolves could be reasonable beings.

D) Shifters and familiars have been mentioned pretty heavily. I suspect Zorian is going to take the winter wolf alpha as a familiar/shifter, if the alpha isn't a shifter mage already. It might give him a greater supply of mana.

E) I don't think Ajoka wanted to talk to Zorian about going to the dance. I get the feeling it was more important. Maybe she was invited to use a black chamber?

F) This is less important, but I think Zorian will end up adapting those magic resistant cards as armor for himself and his golems.

********* A) Agreed. Zorian has trouble re-evaluating opinions of people without something to shake up his prejudices. Once he does, however, he's pretty good at accepting that he was wrong. And with his mind focused on the invasion and studying, it's no surprise he hasn't had time to think about them. It makes him feel very human.

B) Interesting. I believe the Matriarch's message also mentioned another continent.

C) The wolf shifters are basically at war with the Winter Wolves. They really don't get along. I took Kael's conversation to mean that nothing should be attempted until Zorian is an expect of soul magic.

I have a suspicion that the Spider Whitelake wants Zorian to kill will either be the ingredient to a soul sight potion, or something valuable enough (youth potion?) to be worth Whitelake finding another method to give Zorian Soul sight. Ritual murder and the dirge moths are the only methods of gaining soul sight that Kael knows, but they're also fairly easy. Grey Hunters are dangerous enough that it's possible no one would know (or bother) to gain soul sight from them.

Power increases are a tricky thing to do. Princeps Fury was my favorite book in Codex Alera, as Tavi had to find creative uses for his furycrafters if he wanted to survive. After that, he went from "powerless muggle" to "unskilled archmage", which was far less interesting to read about. The vast, swarming nature of the Vord didn't help matters.

I'm not suggesting such a power jump for Zorian. Certainly nothing like Zach or Red Robe. But a smaller jump could be interesting, especially since it would need to be earned--I can't imagine becoming a shifter is easy.

E) Akoja Reminds me of Hermione, which is probably why I thought of the Black Chamber. It's a wild, unsubstantiated guess, and is most likely something else. I do still think it's something besides romance, however. On that note, do we actually know anything about Kiana? I can't remember anything about her, besides her being a confidant of Raynie's.

F) Basically. Taivan was unable to do anything to a single card, and she's training specifically to be a combat mage. If it takes even more power to punch through larger "cards", they would make very effective armor against magic. Even without a change in size, it would make Zorian and his golems immune to things like magic missiles, and would likely reduce the effects of stronger spells.

#+begin_quote
  Also an aside: all but certain red robe has been dabbing in black necromancy, as in human sacrifice and stuff.
#+end_quote

Permanent body alteration spells and potions are extremely dangerous to test, as they can easily be fatal. But they're much easier to test in the time loop. Granted, Red Robe seems to be a necromancer, so he probably did use blood/soul magic, but Zorian might be able to accomplish similar things using less unsavory methods.

#+begin_quote
  do think zorian's two trump cards are his crafting of magical items and his mind magic. Don't know if you've read Worm (web serial set in a superhero setting. Rather dark. A good read!),
#+end_quote

That, and his ever more honed shaping skills, which will likely help him with body modifications and item crafting. It also seems to help him learn new magic quicker, as well as analyse how items work. That might be very useful on the gates.

On another note, Zorian now knows where to get a spell to recover Zach's memories. He'll have to get access to the restricted section of the library, but he's planning on that anyway.

As for Worm, I've heard a lot of good things about it. I've been hesitant to read it, however. There are a lot of tropes I dislike that seem more or less attached to superheroes. I suppose I should just read it and find out.

And then the bombshell in the last two paragraphs! Wow, I can't wait for more.

**** His marker isn't purely spiritual and mental - it's physical as well. It's how he killed the aranea, by killing them not in looped time but in linear time. Whatever the spell is, though, it's not resetting just Zach and Zorian - it's resetting everything, including their bodies. Red Robe just dodges the effect of the reset. He's not ever "leaving" anywhere, he's already wherever he was when Zach's death or the time limit triggered the reset.

*********** Fair enough. But for all the know Red Robe has been looping for way longer: He does have some truly insane power. Hell, we know for a fact that much of the time when he fights it is only a simulacrum which he has infused with some small part of his skills. And yet he is still able to completely destroyed a prepared opponent.

But I do agree that throwing someone out of a time loop seems like a potentially easier path, considering he clearly has some knowledge of the time loop and how it works. I just wouldn't throw out the option that Alanic is wrong about the indestructiblity of the soul as he is a bit of a biased source. Especially since he disdains necromancy so and that would be the likeliest path to such knowledge.

****** Not really - it's just an idea that would explain some things, you know? Feel free to pick holes in it. For example, Red Robe doesn't act like Zorian or Zach, often focusing on different areas, but not originating in an easily-found point. The simplest explanation is that he's moving purely in space, and not at all in time.

** My theory on Red Robe's method of killing the Aranea is that he has an automated spell sequence that takes care of it within seconds of the reboot (believing they are a fellow looper and wanting to avoid additional competitors). The script might be embedded in Zach's subconscious somehow, although obviously it doesn't involve Zach teleporting.

As to RR's personal loop mechanism, one possibility is that he isn't looping at all -- instead, Zach is under a compulsion to create a set of journals and magic items really quickly after he reboots. Among the magic items would be a bomb that kills the Aranea (maybe using a recall mechanism keyed to each of their locations).
