** So, I posted this story without much explanation last week and someone in the comments suggested I write up a little explanation on why it belongs in [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I'm a long-time reader of rational and rational-adjacent fiction (HPMOR, Ra, Unsong, etc.), and a longer-time writer-in-training. I've wanted to write something for this audience for a while now, and after the recent rise of the LitRPG/Isekai genres in the web-fiction-sphere, I finally had a story idea I thought might be a good match. The result is URGY, a story about a rational-ish girl who is thrust onto her own LitRPG/Isekai adventure without any special powers whatsoever, other than her desire to unravel the inner workings of the multiverse that she now realizes exists.

With regard to the "protagonist with no powers" setup, I can't deny I was heavily inspired by Will Wight's Cradle series. (If you're a fan of progression fantasy and you haven't read it yet, you're doing yourself a major disservice.) Imagine if the protagonists of HPMOR and Cradle had a baby, and that baby was a fully grown adult whose only special ability was her unparalleled ability to be inappropriately sarcastic.

I've crafted this story to be a puzzle. Every chapter will drop subtle hints toward something, whether it be the cosmology of the story's setting, the mechanics of the System, character backstories, and so on.

I can't say it will always be perfectly rational -- URGY's protagonist will occasionally make mistakes. She'll be wrong sometimes, because her working knowledge was wrong or incomplete. But such cases are intentional by me as the author -- and over time, she'll make fewer mistakes as she becomes a better thinker and a better person.

Thanks for reading, I hope you all enjoy the story :)

***** You're very right, of course. In my haste to make clear that rationalists are not perfect, I forgot about character flaws. I only meant that mistakes can be made without specific character flaws. Being rationalist doesn't mean you're suddenly aware of all the ways you can be mistaken.

****** Nah it's cool. I get what you meant. Just thought I would expand on that point. If individual mistakes are fine, so are patterns of mistakes if they have a meaning.

A rational story has more than just a rationalist robot. I think the key point of a rational fic is that the story itself progresses due to rational reasons.

While a character themself may be irrational, they could be so for rational reasons and the reader can assess that. The key point is that it is something the reader should be able to follow and see why these things are happening. Whether acknoweding they made a mistake, why they made it, or even a deeper character flaw if it repeats and they dont notice.

You nearly had me, and now I'm just leery as fuck. I'll check it out!

Decent enough. Hate the start with the literal "record scratch You may be wondering how I got here..." in the first chapter. Seems neat enough to continue, little worried how often you're gonna repeat the MC telling themselves about their "master class in snark" and hopefully the chemistry with the kid that saved them doesn't devolve to the two of them speaking to each other in pure 'snark' and 'banter' because that gets old and tends to make the non-MC seem less like a person and more like a stand in hype man to show off how funny and clever the MC is.

Look forward to more!

** These chapters are kinda short, especially with us seemingly only getting them once a week.

That aside, I'm really liking the story so far. It's giving me /major/ KUSOMEGA vibes with the way that a lot of these concepts work, was that story an inspiration, or is it just a coincidence?

Either way, can't wait to read more.

**** I love it, and loved it from the very start, but it's quality certainly... fluctuates.

I'd say the first chapter is great, second is boring, the rest is a solid "okay-to-good" with the exception of chapter four, and chapter eight, which are dogshit (though it pays off later) and amazing, respectively.

Really, the story hits it's stride in book two, which I consider to have been great all the way through.

Also, if you're going to read it, I recommend you don't. By which I mean, listen to the audiobook instead. Obviously this is subjective, but I find the format the books are written in to be very amateurish and hard to get through, with a lot of the lines only working right when you hear them, such that you can get a sense of /how/ they were meant to be said.

** From Ch. 2:

  “Grennick! What does the Inspector say about his Rank and Level?”

  Mr. Interrogator's monocle began glowing a deep green. “Low stats, hardly any STR... It's just a Stone-rank!”

***** I have little doubt the actual sounds out of his mouth, were all this real, would be "strength" my problem, personally, is writers being lazy enough to write STR when context would suggest it shouldn't be used. As an example, from someone not used to using that sort of abbreviation while thinking or writing, or in every case where someone is talking and not literally making the sound "str". I view this in the same way as if someone were to write LOL as a descriptor outside of a verbal context and a slight step above using emojis in story telling.

** Uhh, why is "the collective subconscious" the first explanation she would get to? I would have imagined something more mundane, like contamination from other cross-world travelers (since we already established that it is possible).

  “Who?” And then she laughed. “Oh, you mean the old Earth legend! No, that's all fake. Earth humanity's collective psychic subconscious wasn't well developed enough two thousand years ago to be in tune with the shape of the greater multiverse. Only the major religions from the last, let's say, five hundred years, are even remotely close to true.”

  “Uh... Earth doesn't exactly have any major religions much newer than two thousand years old...”
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  “Whoa.” I suddenly remembered Seriphen's earlier allusion to “Earth humanity,” the implication being that there were humans on other planets. Wait, not just other planets---she said “reborn in,” as opposed to “reborn on.” She was using ‘world' as a synonym for ‘universe.'

  And then I realized she had casually stated that humanity has a collective psychic subconscious, and people have auras that can be read, and clearly people also have souls, because holy shit, there's an afterlife after all, and I was suddenly starting to realize just how deep into the rabbit hole I already was. It was overwhelming in the best way possible.
#+end_quote

It's the first explanation she turns to because it's something that the reincarnating goddess said exists.

** This is a great beginning. The story has a lot of promise and its really hitting the ground running. All the rational deduction seems good too. I'm curious how Ash is going to cope long-term with the fact that she is a mundane in a superhuman world. Its hard to say until we see more about how the system works, but I'm guessing it will be glorious munchkinry of some kind. I also like how the first native she meets properly seems pretty clever. Seems like a good companion for her going forward.
