** God/damn/ but that's awesome.

It does occur to me that this is not only an excellent way to evacuate the Drow, but also what remains of their ancient culture. Imagine taking the entire column, perhaps chunk by chunk, Tower of Hanoi style, into Arcadia. Save the remnants of a once-great civilization, while you save their descendants, too.

  A warning about the dwarves invading ought to do the trick.

I'm worried that this plan of banding the drow against the dwarves might have the side effect of /pissing of the dwarves/. You know, the continental power house that sinks cities if people piss them off?

#+begin_quote
  Which did explain, at least in part, why the Everdark didn't currently consist of half a dozen lesser gods sitting in their own city with the rest of the race long gone.
#+end_quote

It does, but I'm still not quite sure why some of the Mighty haven't wondered out of the Everdark and been lesser gods on the rest of the continent. There's only a very select group of people who could deal with even the weakest of them, and they could probably achieve a better lifestyle.

#+begin_quote
  “The Sve speaks when it wishes,” Mighty Nodoi said. “That is custom. To request words is to beg for a curse.”
#+end_quote

After what happened to Black I'm kind of jumpy about the stories of other cultures. Cat's running a big risk running around the Drow homeland - who knows what kind of stories they tell? (Well, Ivah does, but thus far there's been no evidence that Cat is looking in that direction. She only just walked out what a cabal is.)

#+begin_quote
  “- have commanded armies larger in number than this entire city,” I flatly replied. “I've slain heroes and tricked fae, walked the streets of Keter as a guest and pried life out of the hands of the Hashmallim. You're just a rat in a hole, Orelik, and if you try my patience once more I swear on all the Gods I will feed you your own fucking limbs.”
#+end_quote

That's one hell of a boast. It'd sound lot less impressive if the Drow knew the full details of it all, but thankfully for Cat they don't.

#+begin_quote
  The moment the shiver had been felt the gate had opened. Akua and I were not without cleverness, and so we'd planned to have it unfold right under the ceiling of the floor below. Unfelt until it cut through the walls
#+end_quote

Wait just a moment. Cat's portals can cut through stone?!? Since when? That's a huge deal. Could she cut an enemy in half? Open a mile wide portal that cuts through a city, or an army? Cut through things thy otherwise could not conventionally be cut? That's a hell of a thing to gloss over.

#+begin_quote
  I'd been controlling and left them to stand alone in the outskirts of Winter.
#+end_quote

Well that's a power move and a half.

A few things I'm worried about here. One is that the Drow find a faerie to eat, because a Drow with portals is not a fun idea (especially if portals can be used offensively now). Two is that she's really playing into a story here where the Drow are becoming her unwilling army of monsters held in place by mind control - how long until they free themselves and turn on their master? Three is that the Drow might wander off and conquer Arcadia (Urulan gave the faerie queen a good fight, after all, and these guys are stronger than it was). Four is that these guys have now got a great reason to form a little cabal and attack Cat next time she shows up.

But still, this was a very ballsy move.

Also, there was a reminder in this chapter of how time flows differently in Arcadia. If Cat waits a day in the Underdark, I wonder how long that'll be over in faerie land?

I think there are three reasons for this:

1. It's cultural. To the Drow, status comes from being closer to Sve. Leaving the Everdark is a punishment reserved for the lowest of Drow.
2. It's hard to get out. Remember, they're surrounded by the Chain of Hunger, the Golden Bloom, and the Kingdom of the Dead. A few exiles won't draw much notice, but a powerful Mighty trying to leave risks annoying the Dead King, and we all know how that ends.
3. Even if one of them successfully reached the southern lands, there is approximately a 0% chance that they wouldn't be killed by a Hero tailor-made to defeat them within a few months or years at the longest. Outside of the Everdark, even the Mighty have to play by everyone else's rules.

As for heroes, I don't think there are many who could take on Mighty Urulan, and it wasn't even very powerful in the grand scheme of things. Hell, you'd think a few junior heroes would have some nice Secrets.

Or at least you'd figure they make waves before being killed, instead of never having being heard from again. The Drow seem to have the kind of power that if one of the serious players ever left the realm, then they'd do a lot of damage before being put down, and killing them would be serious business. It wouldn't be swept under the rug to the point where nobody has ever heard from them.

You get this impression because both Cat and Black are very, very good at manipulating the narrative and avoiding dangerous stories. The Drow would not be, to say the least. Remember this quote from Black:

/"It doesn't matter how flawless the scheme was, how impregnable the fortress or powerful the magical weapon, it always ends with a band of adolescents shouting utter platitudes as they tear it all down. The game is rigged so that we lose, every single time: half the world, turned into a prop for the glory of the other half."/

It literally does not matter what the actual objective power levels of two opponents are if one of them is fated to defeat the other. Remember the time Cat killed a minor god with nothing but a bullshit prophecy, back when she was still only the Squire?

The Exalted Champion was able to kill the Captain because of the narrative even though she was objectively vastly more powerful. The Stalwart Paladin was given an ability specifically to counter Cat's glamours right when he needed it, although he still couldn't beat her even with that. But a Might would be completely helpless compared to Cat, because they would have no idea how narrative works or how to manipulate it. They would stumble into a story ensuring their defeat pretty much instantly.

Maybe they can kill Named outside and harvest their powers, but the majority of Named are probably too weak for them to care about if Urulan was already at Cat's level.

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

  I sucked at my lip.

  “Killing undead,” I said. “Would it also grow the Night?”

  The drow paled.

  “Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”

Because she was engaging in direct fights instead of trying for tricky schemes? Remember, Cat in a direct fight outmatched over a half dozen heroes this book alone. Her skills haven't degraded overly from then till now.

Without moving the conversation too far away, I'm concerned that the Drow will gain access to portals. We know that Winter and Night are very similar to one another, to the point where tricks in each can be copied over to the other and techniques to defeat Night regeneration beat out healing from the Winter mantle itself, so it seems reasonable to assume that Night could open a portal.

Actually, given the Night-Winter interaction, there are a whole lot of interesting things that could happen with the Drow in Arcadia.

Dominating multiple opponents for a time isn't overly impressive in the Guideverse. Moreover, Cat herself admits that she took hits she shouldn't have and used tricks that should only be used as a last resort in her fight with Urulan. She said that Amadeus would've wept if he saw that fight, that's a pretty strong indicator. Villains /die/ the moment they start prancing around with their powers.

Additionally, Winter is the season of trickery and cunning, not brute strength. Bludgeoning her opponents with her power is a summer thing.

Yes. That's kind of my point? Mighty Urulan put Cat on the defensive and nearly killed her several times. That's a fairly big deal.

Cat and Akua acknowledged how strong Urulan was last chapter. That's how we ended up here, in Arcadia.

And are we really going to argue over whether Cat is a powerful and dangerous figure? There's a bare handful of people as strong as her, and apparently she eats bands of heroes for breakfast these days, as we found out chapter one of this book. Throw her against an army and she can kill the army. If you want to say that fighting a band of heroes isn't impressive because it's a band of heroes, (a) I want to remind you how villains fighting bands of heroes goes (b) it's still impressive because of the logistical advantage of superior numbers (and this is the Practical guide - logistics matter) and (c), do you really think any of those heroes could have taken Cat on their own?

Cat is a dangerous and powerful figure misusing her power to the point where it becomes story relevant, considering how often it gets mentioned. Her fight against Urulan serves two story purposes: To remind her that she's playing for reals in the Everdark and to show her that she is fighting in an inefficient way. It was a wakeup call.

Events in the Guideverse are very strongly influenced by tropes and the story. This is an in-universe fact.

Cat regularily killed large bands of junior heroes, but so did Black, with far less power at his disposal. Cat is strong, but she isn't using her power well, and EE is virtually beating us over the head with that fact. It coming back to bite her in the arse is appropriate and expected.

************ Oh boy. I could try convincing you that even used acting suboptimal Cat had enough power that she should be taken seriously - pointing to feat from her, talk about the Winter king, explain how her healing power is still a ridiculous advantage no one else has, and so on.

But let's talk about the Drow. You said they were low on the totem pole. I agree in that they've not made any waves outside the Everdark, but I dispute that it's because of their own lack of power.

Cat days as much literally the first time she meets a bunch of Drow:

#+begin_quote
  “That lot outside is bottom-feeders, Diabolist,” I murmured. “And still they were capable of a trick most Named wouldn't sneer at. There's something wrong here. If their lower ranks are this strong there's no way they'd be a ruin of an empire as they supposedly are.”
#+end_quote

Then we learn about the Night, and just how dangerous that is in terms of growth. Skillwise apparently Drow can become master swordsman by killing a bunch of swordsman.

We see Berelun, a random Mighty who is effectively nothing on the (literal) food chain, but who is physically very impressive and had a lot of tricks.

#+begin_quote
  Drow with that much Night swimming around their bodies had reflexes far beyond anything a human could muster even on their best day -- even the Watch.
#+end_quote

Then there a bunch of other stuff I'll gloss over and get to last chapter, where Akua and Cat literally talk about how dangerous the Drow are:

#+begin_quote
  Urulan was perhaps in the twenty strongest drow of Great Lotow, and likely close to the bottom of that division. It fought... better than I expected. You came close to death more than once.”

  “It was a wakeup call,” I softly agreed. “We haven't been taking them seriously enough, have we? Lotow's not one of the big cities when it comes down to it. *There's leviathans lurking ahead*.”

From what we've seen she isn't even comparable to the (former) King of Winter, if that guy was even remotely in the same league as the (former) Queen of Summer.

Because, and here's the thing, storywise using her power inefficiently is a big, /big/ deal.

I did not say that. I said that the drow are low on the totem pole, lower than they should be were their abilities as you suggested. With how their mentality is, there's no way that they wouldn't have at least attempted, and likely suceeded to take over other lands if their abilities included literal, direct power transfusion.

The fact that their Empire seemed to literally self-destruct once Sve killed the Twilight Sages and made them into the first of the Night suggests that they gain more, or even only, from each other. Otherwise it'd have been much more effective to consume others.

I'm sorry if I failed to bring that point across earlier.

That's the arc we're reading, yes, but there's by necessity a difference in the themes and story we're reading as a serial, and the narrative governing the world of aPGtE. Overlap exists, but I don't think this really works as an archetypal story for Cat to have wandered into. It's a reminder for Cat that she should be following Black's lessons, which includes dodging around narratives.

We've been told that the Night grows from killing non-Drow, that was the context in which we first saw the Night. We know that the Night encompasses knowledge and skills. There's been no direct evidence that Drow's gain more from each other than a throwaway line about how Ivan ran into diminishing returns with corpses (which may have been in absolute or relative terms, and doesn't preclude the possibility of gaining lots of night from powerful non-Drow individuals, potentially). And the big issue is about them gaining knowledge and skills.

They're already hitting well below their weight, whether they can do this or no. And despite the fact that a host of Mighty probably wouldn't have too much trouble conquering a city or three (let's say a villainous city, and dance around heroes here) they haven't. This is despite the fact that journeying out of the Everdark to add to the Night is a sacred act because they explicitly have the ability to gain Night from anywhere. And yeah, Sve's society is weird, for a number of reasons I figure we'll learn about when we get to Sve.

#+begin_quote
  I'm sorry if I failed to bring that point across earlier.
#+end_quote

This may have been a redundant discussion then. I figure this is a good place to bow out of it rather than follow the quibble over details like.

Outside of the "Drow are strong" thing, the issue I'm talking about here is whether the Mighty at the edge of Winter can learn anything. Whether they specifically pick up new powers with Secrets, or just gain knowledge behind them have to adapt techniques to work within the Night (which actually seems more likely to me), there's the issue that they might learn things in Arcadia. We already know that Night and Winter are related to each other in some fashion - Cat's pointed it out numerous times, tricks with the Night can be converted into tricks with Winter, and Night techniques designed to interfere with Night-based healing can mess with the regeneration of Cat's body constructed by the full Winter mantle. If the Drow have to deal with with outside systems, then Winter is probably what they're going to struggle least with.

It doesn't necessarily follow that growing the night and stealing knowledge also allows the drow to steal new powers outside their own species. The Mighty can gain new tricks and powers from killing other drow because ultimately they're all using the same magic system and simply applying it in many different ways. Replicating something like a fae gate or a hero's aspect would require the drow to gain access to entirely different types of magical energy (Winter, Light, etc.) which they haven't actually shown themselves to be capable of.

In my opinion it's likely that the drow could ape /some/ tricks used by other magic systems, in the same way Cat is trying to reverse-engineer the night with winter, but they can probably only achieve a pale imitation of most powers they encounter.

I agree, as I said in my post, but I'd put the odds on a drow successfully imitating a faerie gate /very/ low, seeing as the only ones with the ability are fae princes and princesses, and even then Catherine implies you need a full mantle to be capable of entering Arcadia.

We've been told that the drow can /grow the night/ by killing undead, not that they can gain the ability to use necromancy by doing so. What the night encompasses, so far as we know, is the ability to steal knowledge and grow the night by killing people, living or dead. But simply having knowledge is not enough to grant you new magics, you need the proper power to use those abilities, and the drow have not shown that they can steal that. Even if the drow steal the secret of gate making, there's no proof that they would actually be capable of using it, anymore than someone born without the Gift would be able to cast spells if they were given the knowledge of an experienced mage.

This is actually a really good point, I appreciate you bringing it up.

But on the other hand, we've see how versatile the Night is. Chapter 65 alone involved the Drow pulling off more tricks than we've seen from any one Named who wasn't cheating (im thinking of Cat the Winter queen, of magic types who can pull powers out of their ass).

The Night seems like it can be bent into an awful lot of shapes, if it turns out that they can't adapt things one to one.

And again, Winter and Night have been pointed out time and time again as having a lot of things in common. There's plenty of reasons to think that if Winter can open a gate, then the Night might be able to as well.

Oh, I agree that if they could force a fae noble into a slugging match the Mighty could probably take even a prince down, it's just that I doubt they'd have the opportunity. Even if they were lucky enough to have a noble wander by and get curious (which, as you say, isn't as unlikely in Arcadia as it might be in reality) I don't think the noble would be stupid enough to get into a fight with a whole team of powerful opponents. And even if they did, or the drow just attacked instantly, fae nobles are tricky bastards with thousands of years of experience and powers the Mighty have never seen- it's likely they could slip the noose and make with the fleeing like a proper villain.

Not knowing what a narrative is in the Guideverse seems like one hell of an oversight to have, especially for guys who feast on knowledge older than the current incarnation of Calernia.

I don't think Cat's narrative manipulation is too subtle, we've seen her do it a fair few times and mostly it's a case of pattern recognition and stunts like throwing bricks through windows. Even the framing around the Crusade wasn't much more complex than trying to give the Crusaders an out and telling them they weren't legitimate.

And Arcadia's a place where narrative's take hold easily and Cat's already set one up for them before they've had a chance to do anything: She tried to suborn their free will, monologued about her awesome power and inevitable victory, pulled them into a deathtrap, and then walked away. That's villainous behaviour straight off the evil overlord list. All of Black's lessons point to that being the sort of thing that comes back to haunt villains.

I don't see a way that this backfires on the dwarves. Either the drow join the cabal, in which case they're oathbound to Cat and won't antagonize the dwarves, or they don't join, and the dwarves are no worse off than before, or they rally around Sve of Night, and Cat, down to her last narrative chance to save Callow, exterminates any of them that aren't already bound to her.

And without it backfiring on the dwarves, why would they mind that she's doing /exactly what she told them she was going to do/ (gather a drow army and confront Sve)? Heck, she even asked, and was granted, permission for the "gathering the army" part.

  To get an audience, I needed a gift.

  A warning about the dwarves invading ought to do the trick.
#+end_quote

She's telling the Drow things they don't know, to the detriment of the dwarves.

Then she tells them specific details about the invading force that.

#+begin_quote
  “As of two months ago,” I said, “the nerezim have begun an invasion of the Everdark.”

  You could have heard a pin drop in the silence that followed.

  “Allow me to be perfectly clear,” I said. “I did not misspeak. This is not an expedition, it is an invasion. At least a hundred thousand soldiers came through the Gloom, their vanguard led by a Named. They bring with them civilians because they intend to stay. Even as we speak most of the outer ring has fallen into their hands. They aim for nothing less than the extermination of your kind.”
#+end_quote

Ivah mentioned before all this about how the Drow would form a cabal in the face of a dwarven threat:

#+begin_quote
  “They will know that if a cabal is formed for the defence of Lotow against nerezim encroachment, its first act will be to devour them to strengthen ahead of the battle. I do not believe the others will enter your service.”
#+end_quote

And in fact this is what the drow immediately want to do, right after Cat ghives more details:

#+begin_quote
  “Do we know when the nerezim will strike?” one of the Mighty said, staring at me.

  Vasyl, the symbol said. The other bottom sigil, and noticeably less hostile than the Orelik so far.

  “At least two weeks,” I said. “Perhaps more, if they spread their forces to completely clear out the outer rings.”

  “Then this is no time for quibbling,” Mighty Vasyl grimly said. “Defences must be seen to, or the city abandoned. There is no middle path.”
#+end_quote

If things don't go according to Cat's plan here, the dwarves won't be amused about having to face a forewarned force that has banded together and made weeks worth of preparations. To be clear, unhappy dwarves is not a good thing.

If it goes well, great! If it doesn't, then I'm predicting a bear market for Callowan property.

Dropping a tower through a portal is a cool plan and all, and not something you'd imagine the Mighty would have anticipated, but we're still talking about seven of the most powerful characters we've ever seen together in a room, with whole bags of unknown tricks and powers. It's not unimaginable that at least one of them could have gotten out of dodge.

And even now it's a question of how good a trap Arcadia is.

For a start, villains monologing about how their victory is inevitable, dropping someone into a trap, and then exiting stage left is the sort of story cliche that Black would have laughed at even if it wasn't being done in Arcadia, where stories trump everything.

Then there's the worry the Drow breaking free. Remember when Will walked into and out of Arcadia for trainign purposes? Or Warlock opened a gate? Or how Black got himself transported between Arcadia and Creation on his own? Or how Bard travels between the two places?

If the seven demigods don't already have the power to get out, then all they need is a high-ranking fae to open a gate for them (or to eat so they can learn how to do it themselves with the Night). How likely are they to find such a fae? It's Arcadia, chance doesn't matter much. /Stories/ matter, and in Arcadia it's as easy to start one as to swear that you will escape and have your vengeance.

Just so I'm clear, what happened was Ubua set up a portal under the 11th floor, Cat's army/Archer severed the chains keeping the tower up, and the floor itself fell in Arcadia? Is that right? If so... dang, what the heck is going to happen to the rest of the column and the city itself when it all falls down?

I'm curious about how Cat picked the Arcadian destination for the portal (or how it was determined). If the Everdark, or at least Great Lotow, is on the outskirts of Winter in relation to Arcadia, where is Winter/Summer proper in relation to the geography of Calernia? I'm wondering if Winter overlaps Callow now. Or perhaps I'm thinking too literally of the connections between the two planes.

Also, I was a little surprised that Cat's portal opened to sunlight. Duchess of Moonless Night is what she is, and the edge of Winter is where she sent them. I'd have expected cold and dark on the other side, not midday sun and a cold breeze.

I think the connections to Arcadia are more metaphorical/metaphysical than geographical. The Everdark, with the culture being so similar to Winter, would logically be connected to somewhere in Arcadia like that. Opening a gate in Ater should also lead to somewhere similarly bleak/dreadful, I imagine. And the location's connection would explain the outcome of the portal better than Cat's fae title (she's now Sovereign of Moonless Night, not Duchess).
