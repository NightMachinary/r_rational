Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Has Anyone read good fish out of water rational works? Preferably lengthy. I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Natural 20 partly for these reasons, so anything similar would be good.

*** Are you familiar with the Dresden Files? Based solely on your liking for Natural 20, I'll recommend this - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8902388/1/A-Wizard-Named-Harry]] . It's unfinished, but it's good chaotic fun anyway.

I have no idea whether or not it will make any sense without knowledge of Dresden.

** I recently finished reading the three Books of Babel series by [[https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&rlz=1C1GCEV_enUS852US852&q=Josiah+Bancroft&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NEwzzciuLLcsUIJwM4yMM7LSDJK05LOTrfST8vOz9XMyS1KLEosq44tTizJTi60SS0sy8osWsfJ75RdnJmYoOCXmJRflp5UAAJeXbnpTAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjA5eaWiPHiAhXom-AKHRCdCO8QmxMoATANegQIDBAE][Josiah Bancroft]]. Senlin Ascends, Arm of the Sphinx, The Hod King.

What a fantastic series, and not anything what I expected going in. It's a rational story at heart, but the story is logically written without large plot holes in my opinion.

I'm always very cautious when giving a synopsis of books to others, because even that can be a spoiler in itself.

I encourage you to just read these books without anything going into it, and enjoy the ride.

So thank you [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames][u/OutOfNiceUsernames]] it was really great.

** Requesting: anything with a dragon main character.

Recommending:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][El-Ahrairah]] again. Worm fanfic with a protagonist that reminds me strongly of the Harry in HPMoR and a very rational plot.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/agent-of-cauldron-worm.345669/][Agent of Cauldron]]. Another rational Worm take that deals with the worldwide goals of Cauldron and the events that are going on, following the growth of these characters and how they became who they are and /why/ they're such ruthless bastards.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]]. It's Worm but the protagonist is smarter and it's much more tightly plotted. I might even recommend this fanfic /over/ the original Worm.

The characters are pretty in line with cannon and events that didn't happen played like you would expect, and even the parts that could turn into a who would win scenarios are handled well.

It does have character development for the main Cauldron members, so there's that.

** I'm one third through [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/s-i-original-si.1134/reader][S.I.]] and I'm amazed that I haven't seen it recommended here until recently - this story is this sub personified.

The protagonist wakes up in a post-apocalyptic, post-Singularity future where a large portion of mankind has vanished, city-sized A.I.s dominate the landscape, and the world is mostly unmapped by the remaining human city-states. He is a self professed rationalist and his actions are consistent with his goal of not dying ever again if he can help it, find out what happened and prevent further apocalypses from occuring.

It helps that it is excellently written and that I haven't noticed a single typo so far.

*** I read a couple of chapters but was intending on not continuing it because it just seemed weird for the sake of being weird. The body-changing premise also really bothered me because:

- the MC seems to give no thought about where the new body came from. I would think a normal person would be worried that it would take over at some point!

- why aren't the people who transplanted him concerned about the intelligence in the body? If it came from one of the AI xities shouldn't they worried it worried it's a trap of some sort? Why would they even expend resources to transfer him? Or, if they're lying and they're the ones who made the body, why?

*** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8415898/1/God-of-the-Machine][God of the Machine]]. Like most of /The Carnivorous Muffin/'s non-crack stories, it explores some existential horror/nihilistic themes which occasionally border on the surreal. Definitely recommend it for the Mind Games and nice pacing.

*Edit:* I encourage reading despite the premise and the warning at the end of chapter 1. Use both to give you an idea of the direction of the story but otherwise the story stays true to the goal of telling a story about characters trying to out-play each other.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23539/super-science-fast-romance][Super Science & Fast Romance]], which was recommended in a recent Monday thread, is amazingly underrated.

**** I think I'll add personal summary of the article.

Chernobyl is about the danger of suppressing criticism, lies, and arrogance. The show creator intended to keep it front and center, but the show itself shows sensationalism from the first episode and never did it hold back. Sensationalism included: scare-mongering on radiation effects, blowing historical turns of event out of proportion (e.g: staffs being ordered to open a valve remotely changed into personally go down draining radioactive water, effectively sacrificing themselves), connecting events that has no relation to each other, creating fictitious incidents, melodrama.

No mention whether the show has of masterful acting, directing, or solid writing. Article's core is about exaggeration that crossed the line. Given that this subreddit fuss a lot about worldbuilding, especially when it has historical events woven into it, I don't think Chernobyl is a good match. It might be a good match if the show's populated by sane characters, despite over-the-top worldbuilding. But sadly, the article mentioned none about it.

It has indeed been corrected, saying the three guys didn't actually die. Guess perhaps the version where they died became a bit of a urban legend? But the show is apparently so accurate it seems weird to assume they simply made a mistake rather than purposefully romanticise the episode.
