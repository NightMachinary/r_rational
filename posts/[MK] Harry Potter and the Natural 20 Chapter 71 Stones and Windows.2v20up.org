** Ah, this was a good chapter. I have a feeling Milo's newfound ability to actually interact with the world according to physics rather than game rules is going to be significant. And Fiona's character has taken on another dimension of interesting with the cat + loss of paperwork.

** Well Fiona's character definitely isn't a Sue now... she is on the run and her place has gotten burned to the ground.

Sad to see Milo in a slump... I guess that's what comes with real emotions. The fact that the rock spinning worked for him is interesting. I feel like it might be significant.

*** Also, the part where it said that Milo would cast the wish spell to be able to use magic with wands. Since the rock spinning thing worked for him, that makes me wonder if other things will work for him too...wonder what will happen when he wishes for his magic to be able to work with wands?

**** Didn't the author say a long time ago that Milo wil NEVER be able to use wanded magic, and that the wanded wizards will NEVER be able to use wandless?

** Fiona Sam Fisher'ed the hell out of Alecto, that was very funny to read. I am glad her cat is ok. This shall be interesting to see if she manages to save the other people on the squad. I hope she can find some cash to get some proper clothing as she is down to nothing but her PJs, she will need another recorder to stave of obliviation too.
