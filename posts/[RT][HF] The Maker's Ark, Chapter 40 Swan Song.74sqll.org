  “Reasonable. But I still want to know how she managed to get them to invoke a rule that gave her access to any local political dispute resolution tactics in living memory. Which meant Stalin.”

This is just one of those Gobsmaking worldbuilding statements statements that has made my day.

I think I'd really like to read "the usage precedents for the Grs'thnk law it was based on.” and the volume it's resident in. Not now, the story is awesome, but if you want a suggestion for a writing block project that could eventually be your Simarellion I think Grs'thnk legal policy and the history of their Acceleration period would be interesting.

*** There's probably a /couple/ of Silmarillion's worth of potential backstory in this. :)

Also: +1 for the flair.

**** Thanks. And let's see. I have the rough ideas of the Corporate War, the Externality War (probably more than one), the Great Dislocation (otherwise known as "Shit, the icecap melted and two billion people gotta move"), the Hatchling War (Over child care. Very bitter.) and the Air Conditioner War (that one was stupid, but no more stupid than a lot of Earth wars, and is the reason that Grs'thn doesn't have even more carbon tetraflouride in its atmosphere than it does now.)

Elder Trig fought in two of the wars, ran a refugee camp in the third, saw the rest, and has Opinions. You'll be hearing a few of them either in this book or in separate stories.

*** Thank you! And that would be the Oh-Thank-God-That's-Finally-Over period, in colloquial translation 8-). You'll be hearing more about it for sure. They've been in the Boring-But-Man-We've-Got-A-Big-Mess-To-Clean-Up period for 3-4 decades. The Oh-Crap-What-Now period started a little while ago, but most Grs'thnk haven't realized it yet.

*** So basically, they challenged her to a gunfight, pulled out a pistol - and she responded by dual-wielding AK-47s.

*** 8-) And now you know why she didn't shoot it down, and didn't shoot down the drone it was on until later.

** How much longer until The Maker's Ark is done? I loved the first two and consider Fall of Doc Future to be my favorite superhero story all of time, with Worm as a close second, but I don't want to start the third one until it's done.

*** Oh boy. Thank you. I stuffed too many ideas into The Maker's Ark, so I had to push the resolution of some of them into future stories to keep it from growing to A Storm of Swords level in length. Theoretically, I am 5-6 chapters from the end, and it could be done in 3 months. But it might be 8 chapters and 6 months.
