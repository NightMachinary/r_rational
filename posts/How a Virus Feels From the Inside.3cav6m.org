***** Wait... What twist? I just got done reading Part 6 and I didn't see any links to continue the story. Did I miss something? Am I dumb?

****** I guess not really a twist, just the reveal at end of chapter one. Didn't know what else to call it without spoilering.

******* Oh! Haha, yeah, that was cute. The HPMoR references in Part 3 were also funny. The whole story is interesting, but littered with typos that make reading it really hard at some points, especially between all the computer and logic jargon. Also, it's unfinished? Still a good read though.

** I had read all except the last chapter for some reason. But it seems incomplete. Was it just discontinued or is the ending supposed to be weird?
