So, /because reasons/, I was Googling various words and phrases and clauses to see if they had precedents within the text of HPMOR, and I happened to Google [hpmor.com "thought back to"]. This returned a single link to the PDF, but no links to hpmor.com or to fanfiction.net. I noticed that I was confused, so I started comparing the scene in which the phrase appears in the PDF against the same scene on hpmor.com and fanfiction.net. As it turns out, they're quite different.

From the PDF:

#+begin_quote
  McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After a long day's shopping she hadn't needed to ask Harry how much gold was left in the bag after the salesman quoted his price, which meant the Professor could do good mental arithmetic without pen and paper. Once again, Harry reminded himself that /scientifically illiterate/ was not at all the same thing as /stupid/.

  “I'm sorry, young man,” McGonagall said. “This is entirely my fault. I would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but the bank will be closed for all but emergency services now.”

  Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for what he wanted to try now, there was no way he'd have the courage to do it otherwise. /She didn't listen to me/, he thought to himself, /I would have taken more gold but she didn't want to listen.../ He thought back to that black rage of before, tried to call up a little of it. Visualized /the person he needed to be/, and drew that personality over himself like a wizard's robes. Focusing his entire world on McGonagall and the need to bend this conversation to his will, he spoke.

  “Let me guess,” Harry said. “You thought you were leaving yourself /plenty/ of error margin, that one hundred Galleons would be /more/ than enough, and that's why you didn't bother warning me when it was down to ninety-seven.”

  McGonagall closed her eyes in resignation. “Yes.”

  “I anticpated this, Professor McGonagall. I expected this to happen. There are research studies showing that this is what happens when people think they're /leaving themselves plenty of error margin/. If it were /me/, I'd have taken /two hundred/ Galleons just to be sure; there was plenty of money in that vault, and I could have put back any extra later. But I /knew/ that you wouldn't let me do it. I knew there wasn't even any point in asking. I knew you would be annoyed and maybe even /angry/ if I asked. Am I wrong?”

  “No,” McGonagall said, “you're right.” Her voice held a note of apology, and yet still a note of self-pride alongside that, as though Harry ought to notice how very, very honored he was to have /Professor McGonagall/ apologizing to him.

  “You should understand, Professor McGonagall,” Harry spoke the words very carefully, “this is why I don't trust adults. You thought that being adult meant it was your role to prevent me from taking too much money out of my vault. Not that it was your role to /make sure the job got done no matter what/.”

  McGonagall's eyes flew open, and she gave Harry a hard look.

  “Well, Professor McGonagall, if you had to do it all over again, and I suggested taking out an extra hundred Galleons /just to be sure/, with no justification other than to be /prepared/, would you listen to me that time?”

  “I take your point,” McGonagall said. “You don't need to lecture /me/, young man!”

  “Ah, but I haven't /gotten/ to my point. Do you know the difference between someone worth talking to and a mere obstacle, Professor McGonagall? From my perspective, that is? If an adult thinks that being superior to me, above me, getting obedience from me, is the /most important/ thing to them, then they will be an obstacle. A /potential collaborator/ is someone who thinks that /getting the job done/ is more important than making sure I know my place. Allow me to show you something, Professor McGonagall.”

  The trunk salesman was watching them with undisguised fascination, as Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, “Eleven loose Galleons, please.”

  And there was gold in Harry's hand.

  “/Where did you get that---/”

  “From my vault, Professor McGonagall, when I fell into that pile of gold. I shoved some money into my pocket and then held the bag of gold against it, so jingles would seem to come from the right place. Since, you understand, I expected from the beginning that this would happen.”

  McGonagall's mouth was wide, wide open.

  “So now the question is... are you angry at me for defying your authority? Or glad that now our day ends in success instead of failure? I'm not asking for anything /else/ from you by asking this question. I am neither promising nor demanding cooperation on future matters. I only want to know if you're a /potential/ collaborator or an obstacle... Minerva.”

  The salesman actually gasped out loud.

  And the tall witch stood there, silent.

  “Discipline at Hogwarts /must/ be enforced,” she said after almost a full minute. “For the sake of /all/ the students. And that /must/ include courtesy and obedience from you to /all/ professors.”

  Harry inclined his head. “I understand. Professor McGonagall.” Though it was amazing how, somehow, it seemed /so/ much /more/ important to enforce discipline when /you/ were on /top/ of the heap, and not underneath... but Harry didn't think it wise to press the point further.

  “Then... I congratulate you on your preparedness.”

  Harry wanted to cheer, or throw up, or faint, or something. That was the first time that speech had ever worked on an adult. That was the first time /any/ of his speeches had ever worked on /anyone/. Maybe because it was also the first time he had something really serious that an adult needed from him, but still---

  Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.

  Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven Galleons into McGonagall's hands. “I leave it to you, madam. For myself, I must use the restroom. May I ask where---”

  The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set into the wall with a gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away, he heard from behind the salesman ask in his oily voice, “May I inquire as to who that was, Madam McGonagall? I take it he is Slytherin---thirdyear, perhaps?---and from a prominent family, but I did not recognize---”

  The slam of the bathroom door cut off his words, and after Harry had identified the lock and pressed it into place, he collapsed against the door. Harry's entire body was sheathed in sweat that had soaked clear through his Muggle clothing, though at least it didn't show through the robes. He bent down over the gold-etched ivory toilet, and retched a few times, but thankfully nothing came up.

  Professor McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After a long day's shopping she hadn't needed to ask Harry how much gold was left in the bag, after the salesman quoted his price, which meant the Professor could do good mental arithmetic without pen and paper. Once again, Harry reminded himself that /scientifically illiterate/ was not at all the same thing as stupid.

  "I'm sorry, young man," said Professor McGonagall. "This is entirely my fault. I would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but the bank will be closed for all but emergency services now."

  Harry looked at her, wondering...

  "Well," sighed Professor McGonagall, as she swung on one heel, "we may as well go, I suppose."

  ...she /hadn't/ lost it completely when a child had dared defy her. She hadn't been happy, but she had /thought/ instead of exploding in fury. It might have just been that there was an immortal Dark Lord to fight - that she had needed Harry's goodwill. But most adults wouldn't have been capable of thinking even that much; wouldn't consider /future consequences/ at all, if someone lower in status had refused to obey them...

  "Professor?" Harry said.

  The witch turned back and looked at him.

  Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for what he wanted to try now, there was no way he'd have the courage to do it otherwise. /She didn't listen to me/, he thought to himself, /I would have taken more gold but she didn't want to listen.../ Focusing his entire world on McGonagall and the need to bend this conversation to his will, he spoke.

  "Professor, you thought one hundred Galleons would be more than enough for a trunk. That's why you didn't bother warning me before it went down to ninety-seven. Which is just the sort of thing the research studies show - that's what happens when people think they're leaving themselves a /little/ error margin. They're not pessimistic enough. If it'd been up to me, I'd have taken /two hundred/ Galleons just to be sure. There was plenty of money in that vault, and I could have put back any extra later. But I thought you wouldn't let me do it. I thought you'd be angry at me just for asking. Was I wrong?"

  "I suppose I must confess that you are right," said Professor McGonagall. "But, young man -"

  "That sort of thing is the reason why I have trouble trusting adults." Somehow Harry kept his voice steady. "Because they get angry if you even /try/ to reason with them. To them it's defiance and insolence and a challenge to their higher tribal status. If you try to talk to them they get /angry/. So if I had anything /really important/ to do, I wouldn't be able to trust you. Even if you listened with deep concern to whatever I said - because that's also part of the /role/ of someone playing a concerned adult - you'd never change your actions, you wouldn't actually behave differently, because of anything I said."

  The salesman was watching them both with unabashed fascination.

  "I can understand your point of view," Professor McGonagall said eventually. "If I sometimes seem too strict, please remember that I have served as Head of Gryffindor House for what feels like several thousand years."

  Harry nodded and continued. "So - suppose I had a way to get more Galleons from my vault /without/ us going back to Gringotts, but it involved me violating the role of an obedient child. Would I be able to trust you with that, even though you'd have to step outside your own role as Professor McGonagall to take advantage of it?"

  "/What?/" said Professor McGonagall.

  "To put it another way, if I could make today have happened differently, so that we /didn't/ take too little money with us, would that be all right even though it would involve a child being insolent to an adult in retrospect?"

  "I... suppose..." the witch said, looking quite puzzled.

  Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, "Eleven Galleons originally from my family vault."

  And there was gold in Harry's hand.

  For a moment Professor McGonagall's mouth gaped wide, then her jaw snapped shut and her eyes narrowed and the witch bit out, "/Where/ did you get that -"

  "From my family vault, like I said."

  "/How?/ "

  "Magic."

  "That's hardly an answer!" snapped Professor McGonagall, and then stopped, blinking.

  "No, it isn't, is it? I /ought/ to claim that it's because I experimentally discovered the true secrets of how the pouch works and that it can actually retrieve objects from anywhere, not just its own inside, if you phrase the request correctly. But actually it's from when I fell into that pile of gold before and I shoved some Galleons into my pocket. Anyone who understands pessimism knows that money is something you might need quickly and without much warning. So now are you angry at me for defying your authority? Or glad that we succeeded in our important mission?"

  The salesman's eyes were wide like saucers.

  And the tall witch stood there, silent.

  "Discipline at Hogwarts /must/ be enforced," she said after almost a full minute. "For the sake of /all/ the students. And that /must/ include courtesy and obedience from you to /all/ professors."

  "I understand, Professor McGonagall."

  "Good. Now let us buy that trunk and go home."

  Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or /something/. That was the first time his careful reasoning had ever worked on /anyone/. Maybe because it was also the first time he had something really serious that an adult needed from him, but still -

  Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.

  Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven Galleons into McGonagall's hands. "Thank you very much, Professor. Can you finish up the purchase for me? I've got to visit the lavatory."

  The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set into the wall with a gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away, he heard the salesman ask in his oily voice, "May I inquire as to who that was, Madam McGonagall? I take it he is Slytherin - third-year, perhaps? - and from a prominent family, but I did not recognise -"

  The slam of the lavatory door cut off his words, and after Harry had identified the lock and pressed it into place, he grabbed the magical self-cleaning towel and, with shaky hands, wiped moisture off his forehead. Harry's entire body was sheathed in sweat which had soaked clear through his Muggle clothing, though at least it didn't show through the robes.

That's got me wondering exactly how extensively it's been edited. I assume it was done during the Britpicking, so any alterations are probably confined to the first 20ish chapters, but I found it interesting, and now I'm wondering how many other scenes have been altered, because there's a pretty significant shift in tone and characterization between these two versions of the same scene.

EDIT:

I forgot the point. I've never read the PDF version. Has anyone who's read it noticed any other significant differences between important scenes?

Additional edit:

Apparently, [[http://www.hpmor.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality.pdf][I found an old version of the PDF]], the version currently hosted on hpmor.com is up to date.


** I can't find a quote right now; but I believe the early chapters were reviewed later on to better represent what the rest of the story will look like. Less comedic, in particular.

*** There's a bigger difference in tone than just "comedic versus serious." In the original, Harry is practically sociopathic and Professor McGonagall is... idk, inconsistent? She goes back and forth between submissive and authoritative. Their personalities have been smoothed out.

That's why I'm curious about the extent of the editing, because there are a lot of people who base their opinion of HPMOR on the fact that they read the first 10 or 20 chapters 5 years ago or more, and I'm wondering if... eh, I'm just going to bite the bullet in a month or three (whenever I next reread HPMOR again) and switch back and forth paragraph by paragraph until I hit Chapter 17 (I'm pretty sure that's the last chapter that'll have been altered since that's the last chapter that's been Britpicked).

I left this comment sitting here for a while and actually started doing that, and found the first difference:

#+begin_quote
  The funny thing was, he /ought/ to have agreed with Dad.
#+end_quote

Versus:

#+begin_quote
  The funny thing was, he /should/ have agreed with Dad.
#+end_quote

Found another:

#+begin_quote
  It ought to have been an open-and-shut case for Mum joking, lying or being insane, in ascending order of awfulness.
#+end_quote

Versus:

#+begin_quote
  It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being insane, in ascending order of awfulness.
#+end_quote

And /another/:

#+begin_quote
  Harry gave a mental shrug to himself.
#+end_quote

Versus:

#+begin_quote
  Harry mentally shrugged.
#+end_quote

So yeah, I'm not going to document all the sentence-level changes like these (not publicly, anyway), but if I find any other whole scenes that have been significantly altered/rewritten, I'll make a note of them.

**** It should be possible to use a tool such as WinMerge to more easily identify the differences between the versions. I'm more familiar with wanting to diff code or config files. I'm not sure if there are other tools more suitable for written works.
