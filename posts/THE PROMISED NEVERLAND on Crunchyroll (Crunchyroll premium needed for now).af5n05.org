** As someone who wasn't hugely engaged by the manga, I thought the first episode of the anime was excellent. The more visceral medium works really well for it.

This probably isn't going to blow anyone's mind from a rational fiction perspective, but it's worth watching in its own right.

*** If you didn't enjoy the opening of the manga, you probably won't enjoy the rest of it.

There's a few interesting plans and twists as you go along, but in some parts it starts to show its age and get sloppy to the point of disrupting my suspension of disbelief. Ultimately it's a shounen manga and eventually it does fall into some of the trappings of the genre.

I still enjoy it though since I'm invested in seeing where things go.

edit: I expect the first season of the anime to cover the parts before it somewhat started to derail (IMO). So it's worth giving a shot if you don't mind potentially being disappointed after this.

**** I see what you mean. The first few chapters were really good, but I stopped reading because I wanted to catch up on other manga. I will most likely watch the anime. Thank you for your input.

***** Well this story isn't rational really, not going to spoil but the first episode of the anime until *That Part* would lead viewers who aren't versed in the manga into thinking the story is something else that it isn't. a few people I know we're disappointed, and when I told them what the story was about (they were already resolved not to watch more of it) They agreed that it wasn't worth watching. . .now, from a context standpoint. . .as in the "most anime nowadays are trash" context, in comparison this show is a lot better that what's been on offer in a while. so , YMMV, but I'm not going to pretend that this is going to be some masterpiece of storytelling (it REALLY isn't)

** It's such a shame the author started rushing the chapters around ch100. I hope this isn't eventually reflected in the anime.

****** I guess it depends on what you're referring to and when. Standard length used to be over 20 episodes but the new seasonal format (I assume more profitable) is about 13. That said it hasn't stopped a plethora of anime coming back with a second season in the future.

I'd be interested in knowing what exactly Mob Psycho 100 is boosting when the source material concluded more than a year ago. If there's no obvious answer then I don't see why you couldn't argue that some anime are definitely made to piggyback off the success of the source material. Nor should conclusion of said source material exempt it from further sales in the future, should an anime do well.

EDIT: Never mind that the source is still actively published for PN.

****** This. it's better to watch movies in the theatres or Netflix specials if you want to see decent stories that actually have an ENDING. Anime is not the place for this. It's too rare for it to matter.

***** This is most probably getting fully adapted given its popularity, but things don't tend to all be announced upfront. This season will probably cover the first arc, then we wait for future announcements.

****** Even popular shows don't always get adapted fully. I'm still waiting for the third season of Spice and Wolf, and the show and Light Novel (series has finished) were both quite popular. Unfortunately often light novel/manga companies/authors often see anime adaptations as just being a way to drive more sales of the light novel or manga so it doesn't necessarily matter to them that all of it gets adapted.

***** that's been around 95% of anime for the last ten years or so. This is why you really shouldn't watch anime, you'll almost never get fully completed stories, especially ones that are actually good.

** Enjoyable, well-paced first episode. So far at least it looks like they'll keep fan service and other annoying staple features of anime to a minimum, too. I'll definitely give this a shot when more episodes come out.
