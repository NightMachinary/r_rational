I'm just reading the story now, years after the chapter first came out, but I'd like to share my thoughts while they're still fresh. Apologies it something I say is invalidated by future chapters (I'm sure I'll find out soon enough). To refresh memories, 85 rev A is the infamous youthsuit chapter told through written testimonies by shika and ino.

When I first read rev A, I thought it was the logical conclusion of a trend I'd noticed building up since partway through the hot springs mission where the hallway masters (HMs) take shots at the players in the form of sarcastic comments to punish player suggestions or votes they disagree with, or just feel aren't totally cereal guys enough. As I started digging in to the community responses I really thought that the HMs had gone too far, moving from the proverbial "I'm not touching her/quit touching me" argument anyone with siblings is probably familiar with (but as punishing players/nuh uuh), to a proper people's elbow WWE special.

By the time I got through the comments to why the retcon happened I had changed my mind about the situation. This was a huge missed opportunity. It would have taken a lot of buy in from the player base but if everyone could agree to sacrifice hazo's lost cause of a story (pre-retcon) we could have seen aspects of the Ninja world that we can't from any other perspective: what's it like in a Black Facility? How can you fight a lupchanzen? These questions can only really be answered from a prisoner's perspective.

I mean I see how the story would have petered out pretty quickly if the HMs hadn't retconned it but I hope there is an interlude that answers these questions at some point.


** It's always interesting hearing readers' reactions to things, especially the more dramatic things.

Here's what this looked like from our perspective; first, the rules that players and QMs had agreed to were that:

1. [EDIT: At the time,] Hazō was a complete avatar of the players' will with no agency of his own. [EDIT: After this incident we and the players agreed that he would become a real character with agency who would usually obey the players.]
2. We were solidly simulationist and willing to let him die if that was the simulationist answer.

We had been very clear that when the quest started we were expecting Hazō to die within a few real-life months. The quest would (we thought) consist of exploring different parts of the world through the eyes of different characters, each instance building the players' knowledgebase about the world and thereby allowing them to make better decisions until eventually they managed a successful playthrough. We were astounded when (albeit with some luck on the dice), the players kept surviving. Still, they were one mistake or bad dice roll away from death, and everyone knew it.

Then we get to the youthsuit. To put things in perspective, imagine a group of known Commie spies who betrayed their own people but have not been accepted by America, and they're being escorted around Washington DC during the height of the Cold War. Suddenly one of them completely breaks character and starts behaving in bizarre ways that align closely with a famous American agent who is well known for being utterly insane and annoying, but is tolerated due to his phenomenal skills.

In the real world, what happens in that scenario? Answer: He and his team are immediately hauled in for interrogation, which is what we did.

Could we have decided that, well, it was completely unrealistic for American agents to ignore bizarre behavior on the part of their traitorous escortees, but we didn't want to ruin everyone's fun so we would be nice and forgiving and have the world run on irrational story logic? Sure, but that wasn't the deal.

With that disposed of, the question becomes: Did the players vote for Hazō to break character and start behaving like Gai? At this point it's down to interpretation. If you think "Buy a YOUTHSUIT!" in bold, radioactive-green letters is not a vote for acting like Gai, then I suppose you are justified in your belief that the players made no mistake.

Personally, I think the players should have just accepted their mistake and gone forward. It would have made for some great role play, and it was hardly a character-lethal event. Later on they insulted their handler, Jiraiya of the Sannin, and threatened a Leaf doctor in front of a bunch of ANBU (special forces soldiers). THAT could have been a character-lethal event. Still, they talked their way out of it and things ended up better than before.

*** From my understanding the plan wasn't "have Hanzo break character and go crazy" it was "Buy a youthsuit" (in those exact words even). How you got from that plan to what you wrote is where the extreme punitive (I'm not touching you, yes you are / we're not punishing them, yes you are) bit comes in.

Any reasonable interpretation would have Hazo remember that Akane has mentioned Rock Lee and Gai wearing a uniform that represents their style, and asking to go buy a matching set for him and her because it's a very thoughtful (or "youthful") gift that ties into her interests and what she considers important. If it's an obscure suit (rather than being a purchase available on every corner that gets you put on a watchlist,um what?) that plan alone could have taken all day, or at least a chapter.

Story wise it would have been cool to meet some of the things Kagome is so paranoid about. The fact that you guys took a 'hostile misinterpretation' approach to a plan you didn't originally prepare for might have even been ok though that's something better established in chapter 1 if that's what you want to do.

The fact that you blamed (are apparently still blaming) the players for the outcome of your hostile misinterpretation (or malicious compliance if I'm being charitable) is not ok.

**** As someone who isn't a QM but who did participate in the quest previously (along with occasionally still lurking) - I think you're wildly overstating what a "reasonable" interpretation of the plan was.

Purely from context clues around discussion, one thing to note is that this plan actually represented, among other things, a massive character break, from the perspective of the plans generally put forth by the players. Most of the plans were long, detailed, covering many different conditions and contingencies, and generally being pretty strategic in general. This plan, on the other hand, had exactly no details, was well known in-thread for being a meme-vote, and was actively formatted in a manner that in no way conveyed "calmly go to the market and hand over money for clothing". That is, of course, one interpretation, but it's far from the most likely interpretation, and assuming malice on the part of the QMs violates the entire concept of the quest.

***** The standard I'm using is "could the players who voted have reasonably predicted Hazo's resulting behavior up to the first time an NPC did something surprising?". And the answer in this case is no. There are no assumptions involved here. From the first actions he takes he's going off script and it gets worse from there. Using metanarrative excuses after the fact doesn't change that the QMs acted in bad faith (and based on their comments, did so because they disagreed with the metanarrative aspects of the vote).

This explicitly shows that "could the players who voted for this plan have predicted Hazō's behavior?" is clearly not even remotely close to the correct framing, given that it was voted for to intentionally see /what/ would happen. There was no violation of expectations, because there /were/ no expectations.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7325689/]]

This is from one of the original "plan" authors, before the update was written. Clearly, expecting the result to be "calmly go shopping" was not what was happening here.

Claiming that they were acting in bad faith is less of a factual claim, and more sounds like you just didn't like the way the story went.

Wow ok, if the previous was grasping at straws, this is an ineffectual pinkie twitch in the presence of a barn. So op didn't expect their proposal to win and therefore the only reasonable expectation is that the QMs will have the character follow a different plan in the first half of the chapter, go completely berserk in the presence of the actual plan objective, and in general just make a nuisance of himself with no actual plan in mind, until he gets arrested. Oh, and it turns out that the punishment for wanting spandex underwear is worse than assaulting a high ranking government official and threatening them and another medic/soldier with bodily harm? Right.

******** Out of curiosity, did you read the discussion that happened between chapters when that one got written, and the previous?

If not, it's fairly enlightening; I hadn't remembered reading most of it myself until this topic came up, as I mostly remembered there being a large reaction at the time, but none of the details. Upon rereading the discussion immediately before and after the vote, what was most notable to me was, in fact, that a notable portion of the thread regulars (including at least one or two of the people who voted for the plan) expected almost exactly what did happen in the chapter posted to happen.

Regardless, this is a decision that happened over two years ago, so it's long past any reasonable time to actually debate over the details you're talking about, but I did want to respond as someone who isn't one of the QMs with my own perspective. Feel free to continue to disagree if you want, but I wanted to have a second opinion represented in the comments here.

*** You are not going to prevent someone occasionally putting in a silly vote that violated expectation and rule of the quest no matter how clear you make your expectation known. The only thing you're going to get is a negative reaction. This is like having multiple signs to warn people of the bridge clearance and then wondering why people keep crashing into said bridge. The solution is to raise the bridge or make a modification such that trucks will stop crashing into said bridge, either increasing bridge clearance or force vehicles to not use enter underneath the bridge.

Other QMs would had set aside joke votes and went for the winning serious plan. At least this way, even if this resulted in a negative reaction, it's much more likely not to blow into your face.

The execution was "proceed as though one of the other plans had won, then give the main character a mental breakdown resulting in attempts of violence against much more powerful and hostile antagonists on their home turf."

If the QMs aren't going to act in good faith with how votes are treated, just because they imagined some silliness to the concept, what's even the point?

**** You're right, we're not going to prevent it. That's not our job. Our job is to provide the most realistic version of this world that we can, in the process of writing the best story that we can. If people can't understand that, or don't want to play the game we're offering, that's totally fine. They are free to take their marbles and politely go home.

Whose job is it to prevent those votes? The players'. At this point, everyone knows what we're offering. No one can pass joke votes on their own, they need to convince a majority of the voters. All the players need to do is vote for something else while politely explaining to the newbies what to expect.

And, before you ask: If a group of trolls passed a harmful vote, we would ignore it. The youthsuit thing was voted in by regulars.

*** I think you're at a big disadvantage as QMs because you're running something different from literally every forum quest anyone's done before - even quests that are notoriously "brutal" are brutal in a fashion that makes cohesive narrative sense. Whereas that narrative rise & fall doesn't really happen in something as ruthlessly simulationist as what you're going for. This is a common thing throughout the whole quest - not just the YOUTHSUIT incident. Even as early as the first couple of chapters.

In a /normal/ story the Village Hidden in the Swamp would have worked out. Like a TV show. It's inevitable demise and inherent instability would have manifested themselves in a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil][Sorting Algorithm of Evil]] kind of way, where the protagonists were just /barely/ competent enough to survive each time. You see a lot of moments like that, looking back through the story - moments where the team /fails/ a mission and runs, or bails on a location that, in an ordinary story, would have been home-base for the entire time. The YOUTHSUIT is just an extension of this mindset. The naive quest-goer thinks that, /hey/, we just got done with a very tense action-oriented story arc, it's filler time. /We're even in the village from canon, which finally puts us on canon rails./ Filler time means doing silly meme stuff. But in your world, story arcs don't actually exist, there is no such thing as canon or meta-knowledge, and silly meme stuff is as fucking bananas as it would be in real life.

I'm used to [[/r/rational]], so, that's not my biggest gripe with your story. (/My/ biggest issue was worldbuilding: I think Naruto's schizo-tech is cool and don't like the feudal Japan aesthetic as much.) But if I had never read a single rational story, and also happened to be dumb enough to not notice when the QMs were getting annoyed, I totally would have voted for the meme answer, because what else are we going to do? Add to that the times that the meme answer just happened to work out beforehand, and you have a recipe for everyone in the thread simultaneously blundering into an interrogation cell.

The Kabuto incident I don't even want to think about. That one was /more/ frustrating as someone catching up to the story, because I couldn't voice my two cents. Still, it's a casualty of the same mindset. "We're in Konoha, these are the kind people from the anime, they'll understand that we're just asking as concerned citizens." If you're approaching it from that perspective, the hammer of /common sense/ looks a lot like punishment, even if it's the sanest outcome of the literal actions that the voters chose to take. And I feel like you guys understand that on some level - every time Hazou does something sketchy, you have the rest of the party step in and tell him exactly how fucking stupid that idea actually is.

Wait what? From what I've read, it seems more like Hazo is his own person. With the thread mind controlling him occasionally to carry out their will, except with enough skill that he mistakenly believes his actions are his own. Because Hazo has done a bunch of stuff that I don't think the thread would have wanted him to do.

** Yeah, I quit reading the series over that honestly. The sheer lack of regard (and outright hostility) it displayed for the players was staggering to the point where I couldn't continue.

My annoyance was compounded by the fact that after they retconned it back they asked for a bloody apology because they felt hurt by the temerity of the players /daring/ to be upset at the poor defensless QM's for deciding to throw away everything the players had done because of a single joke vote.

I do agree however that exploring that path would be super interesting, and it would totally be a great story worth pursuing if they were to get there in a way that wasn't them basically pissing all over the players.

I'll bite. First of all, the QMs complaint wasn't ever that people were upset. It was that some decided to channel that in rude and plainly hurtful ways. I think asking for an apology for that makes a lot of sense.

As to the second part - well, they were throwing everything they had done too! The quest is hardly only the players' accomplishment. A joke vote winning could just as well be looked at as the players deciding to throw away everything that the QMs have done. (Or a coordination problem, which is why the chapter was eventually retconned, and QMs and players agreed on a set of new rules that give Hazo-the-character a bit more non-player-driven agency)
