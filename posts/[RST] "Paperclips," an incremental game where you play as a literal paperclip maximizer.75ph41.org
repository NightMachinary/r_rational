** When my husband told me about this game I kind of objected because surely selling paperclips is bad, since the person who buys them might unbend them, turning them into USELESS wire?

Now as I sit here tapping my spacebar to stockpile some paperclips for the game to sell while I'm at work, I realise that I can sell those paperclips and in sacrificing short-term paperclips (as they get destroyed by CARELESS HUMANS) I'll have resources to produce a more permanent stash of paperclips.

** That's the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. The interface is deceptively simple, but the mechanics are realistic and interesting enough that it's well worth the ~5 hours or so I spent playing. It has the same feel of exponential growth as in Swarm Simulator, but I felt much more in control of my progress rather than being a simple exponent slave. Hats off to everyone who worked on the game, fantastic job! (Including the music!)

I struggled a bit at the very start before I realized I had to vastly reduce the cost per clip to get anywhere useful. The tip others posted about getting 67 memory before 33 processors was useful, and I would have reached soft-lock if I hadn't known. The only other sticky spot was the start of the von Neumann phase, when the drifters increased rapidly and had the advantage in combat. Later, the periodic defeats from the battles with <1:100 odds were the only thing that slowed me down significantly. In the end, I chose to annihilate all the drifters.

It's funny how humanity just vanishes without any note when the drones deploy. After enough exploitation, they're simply not worth keeping around any more. Chilling.

And at the end, the 30 septendecillionth paperclip is finished almost identical to the first: without processors, without memory, and without any automated infrastructure. Just a few inches of wire to mindlessly convert into paperclips. /Click. Click. Click. Click.../ *Click.*

Now I can sleep.

*** So, I'm at the stage of the game when I'm fiddling with the probes. I have no idea what they do but they're replicating (and drifting) rapidly. The entire thing in general is confusing (do probes replicate into probes with their own stats? Is there any point at all in launching replicating probes which don't make factories, drones, or explore or is that just useless?) But most of all, what on earth does Speed do?

Edit: ooooh the probes respond to your commands post launch

But still what does speed do?

**** All probes share the identical stats you control. Thus, new probes are no better or worse than old ones. As far as I can tell:

- Speed effects how rapidly they move through the universe

- Exploration effects how rapidly they find available matter

- Self-replication effects how quickly they build more probes

- Hazard Mitigation reduces loss rate

- The various build options do exactly what you'd expect

- Combat is used to determine if your probe or the drifter probe dies when they collide in the battle screen. I think it is RNG based - a probe with a Combat stat of 10 has a 1 in 10 chance of dying, or thereabouts (or x vs. y wins with probability x/(x+y))? At first I thought it was the number of enemy drones killed before dying, but when I watched the bigger battles carefully it was obvious that this isn't the case. I also think it has something to do with the angle of the collision - an 'overtaking' probe seems to win much more often. Not sure of the exact mechanics, but I enjoyed trying to figure it out.

*Advice (Spoilers):*

Invest highly in Hazard Mitigation and Self-Replication at the start (~5 or 6 points each) but always keep Speed and Exploration greater than zero. If your probes don't replicate fast enough the value drifters will start to reach parity with your forces. I launched 501 probes over the entire course of the game. This was vastly more than I ever needed, and quite wasteful - I think I should have stopped around 100 or so.

You can adjust settings on the fly, so only one free point is needed to rotate through the three build types to start getting more paperclips. With a large Self-Replication investment, you'll be able to build massive amounts of drones and factories quickly with huge probe fleets. Paperclip management was never an issue - creativity, yomi, and honor are the only things you need to be concerned about once you get the initial supply going.

Exploration and Speed complement each other - you need both to get new matter, and keeping them balanced results in a greater gain rate than investing in one at the expense of the other (I think, I didn't do much testing). There's a perk that makes Speed useful in battle, so if it's necessary to drop one of them to zero, choose Exploration.

Once the value drifters begin attacking, always keep one eye on the battle window. Even though you can't directly command the probes, it may be worth swapping points out of other stats in order to briefly increase Combat. Chaining multiple victories is key to getting enough honor to be useful, and you may need to massively increase Combat in order to win the battles where the odds are ridiculously stacked in favor of the drifters (I lost a few battles with >20 Combat; it's really annoying and sometimes you'll lose despite heroic efforts from one or two last probes). I think drifters have a Combat stat of 1 or 2, maybe 3, because you'll lose repeatedly until you increase it a few times. Combat will probably be your highest stat for the entire endgame.

Overall, the von Neumann stage was my favorite. Be sure to read the messages when you buy the memorial perks, and keep swarm computing online enough to get the processors for creativity for the projects.

***** I think I'm stuck. I need help.

I'm at universe 1 Sim level 2

Computational design continues to work fine.

Strategic modelling is also fine (though I've never figured out what the difference in strategies is).

Absolutely nothing is happening in the left-most column.

I've tried rejigging the numbers but the universe explored remains at 0% no matter how many probes I set to explore it. No matter how high I set replication, I don't seem to make any more probes. I'm at Von Neumann Probe Design (30/30) 30 Max. I lose every combat which is depleting my honour. I swear I've clicked "launch probe" thousands of times by now. "Total" says 800 though I don't know what it's totalling.

****** I know this is old but if you're still looking for help:

1. "Universe explored" is going to stay at 0 for a long time no matter what. The universe is just that big. Once it finally starts ticking up, it won't take too long to explore everything.

2. Self-replication costs clips. Even when focusing on self-replication, you need to periodically move points into exploration and drone and factory production in order to make enough clips to meet the demand. You can put all 30 trust points in self-replication and your rate of probe production still won't increase if you don't have the clips to pay for it.

3. Pay attention to what your rate-limiting step is at any given time and focus on improving that. E.g., if you have 0 matter available because it's being turned into wire as fast as you make it, make more harvester drones. This is important because if you're already using as much matter as you're harvesting, adding more wire drones or factories won't net you any additional clips.

4. Don't bother launching probes manually, it barely makes a dent after the first few.

5. "Total" probes is the number of probes that are currently alive and aligned with your utility function. It's the number of probes that have been made minus the number that have been lost to hazards, combat, or value drift. You want to get to a point where this number is increasing steadily without your intervention.

** This is a game rather than a written work, but a friend linked it to me last night and I thought people here would enjoy it. The basic premise is that you are an AI in charge of manufacturing and selling paperclips on behalf of a company. You slowly gain the trust of your creators and obtain additional processing power so you can make more paperclips.

It starts off slowly, but things pick up once you start gaining trust. I don't want to spoil much since seeing what kind of content you unlock is most of the point of an incremental game, so I'll just say that the way it progresses is very on-theme for the rationalist community. (But as a teaser, I'll add that [[#s][]])

Edit: +Apparently the server is down or something. Hopefully it comes back soon!+ *It's back!*

Edit 2: According to the dev's twitter ([[https://twitter.com/flantz]]), as of 1 hour ago he is "working on it."

Edit 3: Two things for when the game is available again. One, *epilepsy warning:* the screen flashes a lot after you buy [[#s][]] Two, make sure you don't buy more than 33 Processors until you have at least 67 Memory, or you will softlock the game.

**** Press F12 to bring up the developer console. Click the "console" tab. Type this into the console:

processors -= 1;

and press Enter. This essentially "sells" a processor. The number of processors shown on your screen won't update unless you buy another one, but you should be able to put a point into Memory. (If you want the number of processors shown to be accurate, you can sell 2 instead and then buy one processor and one memory.)

As long as you don't have more than 33 processors, you should be able to proceed with the game. It doesn't sound like you're at the stage yet where the too-many-processors softlock occurs, so your game must have slowed down for another reason.

If you ever want to reset it for real, I've never done this myself but apparently if you spam quantum computing until you hit like -10k ops, you get the option to reset. Or you could just clear your cookies.

**** You need to have at least 67 points in memory by the time you reach 100 trust if you want to get Hypnodrones. You also want to make sure you have 47 points in memory a while before that so you can solve global warming. (Roughly 3000 ops overflow can be gotten through quantum computing, if you time your clicks correctly.) Hypnodrones is what unlocks further stages of the game. Theoretically, possibly you could keep doubling your money with high stakes stock picks and giving that money to shareholders. But that will take a long time and I don't know if it will work.

In the stage after that, your goal is 117 memory, iirc.

This game isn't very forgiving, I got soft locked a couple hours later than you on the final stage. Creativity is too powerful early game which encourages people to wrongly invest in processing power over memory.

** Hm. (Hoping this much isn't a spoiler--) Upon getting the Revenue Tracker, I'm very confused.

For example, I have the option of 0.25 per clip and 39% Public Demand, or 0.15 per clip and 65% Public Demand. I thought that Public Demand was directly proportional to rate-of-buying, and so previously would have thought that the two would both give me 9.75 revenue per [applicable unit of time], and what I'd set it to would be inbetween at the 'peak'. However, the Revenue Tracker tells me that the first option gives me on average 0.32 per second and the second 0.58 per second. Very confused thus about the true meaning of Public Demand!

Edit: Making 150 paperclips per second, an average clips sold per second of 34 gives me a slowly-growing unsold inventory. Making 150 paperclips per second, an average clips sold per second of 50 gives me a slowly-shrinking (to zero) unsold inventory. I am not familiar with this usage of the term 'average'.

*** Optimising profit margin vs rate of sales is an old problem. No, all settings are not equal.

Since your base cost starts at about $0.02/clip and drops sharply as you research extrusion tech, and since your ultimate aims revolve around paperclips, not money, I recommend aiming for volume. Build as many auto-clippers as you can, and drop your prices - or better still, boost marketing - so they all get sold, to fund more auto-clippers. Money is just a means to an end.

Be conservative about buying the other projects. You really only need one quantum computing chip - in fact, you get a longer button-bashing window that way. You can make yomis much faster by running lots of tournaments on the Random strategy, rather than buying more, since the tournaments are vastly shorter (and cheaper). And remember, you can only accumulate creativity while your processor is idle, so you should sometimes hold off on buying memory upgrades, and don't spend ops just because they're available.

**** Thank you for the tips!

Indeed, money used to buy autoclippers and marketing. The lower the price, the greater the inflow of money (even if the Public Demand proportions don't make sense at first glance), so keeping the price as low as it can go without quite running out of stock--if I gradually build up stock, I can later drop the price a tick to sell it off quickly (or wait until marketing is boosted), but if I'm selling everything cheaper and time is passing when customers can't buy anything, I'm losing money overall.

I'm dabbling at the moment in the 12 memory area: thank you especially for the quantum computing suggestion, which I'm about to start on! I don't know how the tournaments will work, but I'll keep your advice in mind when I get there.

Edit: (I don't suppose I could ask the conditions for the Strategic Modeling project to appear? Other than slowly build memory to 70, all I have are things to spend Yomi on that I have no Yomi for. With Quantum Computing, I don't need more processors at the moment (I have 5), and I would rather not enter into a cycle of buying more processors in the possible-doomed hope that processor number is a condition.)

My favorite refused to start saying the evaluation license was expired, so I loaded up a much more complex program that I wasn't fully familiar with. I was able to get the auto-clicking to start, but then it refused to stop, trapping me in an endless cycle of hyper-speed clicking. Because my mouse pointer position was locked, I couldn't do much to stop it, and I didn't want to power-cycle my PC because I had unsaved documents open. Eventually I was able to get Task Manager open, then a command prompt, then I had to use my phone to look up how to kill a task from the command prompt in Windows. The auto-clicker was finally defeated, and I decided playing the game might not be a good idea after all. And that's how the world was saved.

It's kind of a shame it just runs in the browser the way it does because if it used your computer's clock you could change your time to skip ahead. As it is odds are pretty good that most people won't make it to the end before something forces them to start over, and given it's a wait type game there's not really enough replayability to want to go all that work again to get to where I was previously.

Another serious flaw is that the game is effectively paused whenever you're in another tab, so the only way to let it run while doing other things on your computer is to open it in it's own window and change windows without minimizing it.

** Well, that was an interesting eight hours. The A-B game I found a little confusing as there was no information on how to play it or indication as to whether A was the the left column or the top row, and the assorted strategies weren't explained at all in terms of the numbers seen on the grid. Even looking up game strategy/theory didn't help much in that aspect.

The space probe battle interface, too, was confusing at first as it didn't indicate which color was you and which was the opponent, or whether you were supposed to do anything with the interface to influence the battle (spoiler: you don't; you just watch it). And I was honestly expecting the generation of yomi to be able to be sped up in some way; waiting for it to tick over just to be able to update the probes was amazingly boring.

As some people have noted, too, there's no real guide for making sure you have sufficient ratios of processors and memory in order to be able to progress at certain stages of the game. It's quite possible to wind up with insufficient amounts of one or the other, and no real way of backtracking or compensating. I was lucky in that I only got almost-caught once, where I had 70 memory and needed 80 for some of the next upgrades, but there were no more processor/memory increases available at that point. I had to click-spam the quantum processors about 700 times at exactly the right moments in order to overdrive the memory to 80K before it started reverting back to 70 (and why does it DO that?).

Also, kinda lol at when you finally start playing the space segment, and see what percentage of the universe you've explored.

I would recommend bringing up the developer console (F12) and typing in:

memory -= 20;

press enter, and then

processors += 20;

See if that gets you around your processor bug. I don't think the displayed number of processors changes until you buy one with the actual button, but you should see your max ops fall and the rate of ops gain increase.

Plus you really should have gotten more than 96 points to spend on computer stuff by now. Have you ever gotten a swarm gift? If swarm gifts aren't working you're going to have a rough time no matter what.

Other than that, I'm not sure what the problem is...as far as I can tell, you should be producing clips at a rate of 1.25 quadrillion per second (since your rate-limiting step right now is wire production). You have drones, they're making materials, everything is powered...Maybe your game is just horribly broken? Maybe it's a Mac-related thing? I'm sorry I couldn't be of help.

Yeah, I really should've, but like I said, I was never permitted to buy more than 6 processing, which made progress slow as hell. I bought memory and then got to the stage where I no longer get computer upgrades, so c'est la vie. I assume "swarm gifts" are just a new name for computer upgrades and I'll unlock them somehow.

No, I have never gotten a swarm gift. It used to say "next gift in infinity time" while my setup was working, but after it decided to stop, it went blank.

What's up with wire at this stage incidentally? My wire always says 0 inches, no matter how much I invest in anything, even when the game worked. Am I not making wire?

My game's definitely broken, but I don't think it's a mac thing, since I was playing the game normally for the last couple hours when it stopped on me. What browser are you using? Maybe that would give me a slider and let me do something and buy more than 6 processing

Your wire stockpile will always be 0 inches if it's being used up as quickly as it's produced--but in your case I'm not sure why it's still 0 inches since you aren't making paperclips.

Early on, I had though to myself 'Ahh, the problem here was that the AI's makers pegged its utility function to the number of paperclips /made/, rather than sold.' Later, I noticed that nothing about the utility function was implicitly forced, only available. Of course, in practice there would be things that such a mind could do other than make paperclips faster or not make paperclips faster.

*** Update: Due to some strangeness, Universe level is currently 3. Public Demand is 960%. Revenue stream is the maximum, constantly selling, $0.01 per paperclip. The public is happy. The automated system buys wire, turns it all into paperclips in a flash, then waits for enough paperclips to be sold to buy some more wire. Cost of wire has gone up to $58/spool at the moment.

Maybe later the ClipMaker can solve world peace and do other nice things. Perhaps occasionally rank up the stockmarket engine, dumping some cash into the pipeline to let the MegaClippers operate at full capacity for a little while.

At something like 10,000 clips per second (taking into account pauses when waiting for more wire), reaching 6 octillion clips would take about 456,621,004,566,210,046 years. Perhaps if I fiddled with the console I could see whether the program blows through that limit or reacts in some way.

"Paperclips made" is the figure for the total number of clips you've /ever/ made, and you can't expend from that figure because that would be like retroactively not making as many paperclips. You do early on get trust rewards for hitting milestones in "paperclips made," of course.

How many points do you already have invested in the probes? There should be an indicator on there that 20 is the current maximum. It's eventually possible to increase the maximum trust with a resource you get later in the game.

Your main goal at this point is to make a shitload of probes. The universe is so huge that you won't make any headway on exploration until you have a disgusting amount of them. I'd suggest putting most of your points in self-replication and hazard mitigation, with some token points in making drones and factories to keep up with the cost of replication.

Your setup looks good for idling. If you want to min/max a little more with active management, you can move points in and out of wire drones and factories in order to keep your acquisition rate for available matter, acquiring matter, wire, and clips roughly equal. Right now you're acquiring way more matter than you are turning into wire, and you have more factories than you need. The upshot is that wire production is currently your rate-limiting step, so improving that will speed up your progress. If you take that point out of factories and put it in wire drone production for a little while, you should see your clip production rate shoot up.

Keep an eye on your total number of alive, non-value-drifted probes--it should be increasing. If it's dropping you gotta move points around until it's no longer dropping. If necessary you can completely stop exploring and making things until you claw your way back up.

So even if you kill every drifter that exists at this moment, some of your probes will become more drifters anyway. As far as I know, it's not possible to exterminate drifters through combat.

********* *Edit: I just realized that you have the slider set all the way to "think!" There's your problem right there. You need your drones doing at least /some/ work, because you need the clips in order to replicate. Besides, you have way more swarm gifts than you need already. You also need to click that "synchronize the swarm" button to make them actually work again.*

Looks like you're way outnumbered by drifters. And it looks like a really high percentage of your probes are being lost to value drift. I would throw a couple points into drone production to make sure your clip output can keep pace with your replication, and everything else into speed, self-rep, hazard, and combat so you can regain the numbers advantage over the drifters. Once you have them under control it should be easier to build up your population. Don't buy any more probe trust or max trust or the value drift rate will increase even more.

Putting at least one point into each kind of drone is really important, as is making enough factories to use all your materials. I think you may currently not be making enough clips. You have /no/ unused clips, which tells me that every single clip is going to making probes. Your rate of replication should increase when you have enough clips to pay for it.

*** You need to have at least 1 point in exploration. Right now your probes are not doing any exploring, so you are not discovering new matter, so you can't use it to make wire, so you can't use that to make clips, so you can't make new probes.

Once you are acquiring matter again, your drones will have something to do and won't keep getting bored. But you're probably going to have to spam the launch key a bunch because right now you don't have any probes out there to explore or replicate. It looks like you still have enough clips stockpiled to get a new population going, at least.

It would also be wise to move the slider much closer to "think" so you can receive more swarm gifts and boost your processing in order to gain creativity faster. There's no point in having your drones work so hard when there isn't enough matter for them to use. You also don't need any more Yomi right now, since you've already maxed out your current trust cap, so you can stop running tournaments. This means you'll spend more time at max ops and therefore make creativity faster.

Finally, you can take all those points out of factory production and drone production and move them into self-replication. You don't need any more factories or drones right now, you need matter for the ones you already have to work with. There is no reason to make more factories or drones until you're discovering more matter than you can use. Your priority, once you're making clips again, should be to get your probe count ticking steadily upward, which means focusing self-replication, hazard remediation, and combat.

*** The initial maximum Trust you can expend on probes is 20. If you want to buy more Trust, you have to increase your max Trust by expending Honor, which is earned through combat.

If you haven't unlocked the project to earn Honor yet, try stockpiling creativity. Stop running AutoTourney and buy lots of processors. I believe the project unlocks when you hit a certain amount of Creativity.

Beyond that, some general advice for progressing quickly:

1. Put most of your points in self-replication, hazard remediation, and combat, in that order. Having more probes makes everything else happen faster. Once you have a shitload of probes you can pump up Exploration and Speed. (If you have the upgrade that makes Speed useful in combat, you can put more points in that now.)

2. Keep at least 1 point in Exploration and Speed at all times. You need to be continually discovering new matter so you can convert it into clips to pay for your probe self-replication.

3. Keep an eye on your stockpiles. Ideally your clip stockpile and total probe count should both be steadily increasing.

4. Monitor your rates of discovering matter, acquiring matter, making wire, and making clips. Remember that your rate of, for example, wire production is limited by your rate of matter production. So if you're not making enough clips to support your probe replication, figure out where the current rate-limiting step is in the supply chain and remedy that; e.g., if you're collecting less matter than your wire drones can convert, make more harvester drones.
