In this short fanfiction, I answer this question that very few have asked before.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27034639][AO3 link]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13721086/1/HPRick-and-MoRty][FFN (if you prefer that for some reason)]]

Strictly speaking, the fic deviates from the rational backdrop of HPMOR by slightly altering the motivations of the characters in the context of certain events.


** It's just you and me harry

The outside world is our enemy harry

Were the only friends we've got harry

Its just quirrel and harry

Quirrel and harry and their adventures harry

Quirrel and harry forever and ever, quirrel and harry for a hundred years harry

** I lol'ed. I overlooked this gem when it was initially posted here (I feared it would be the very thing it made fun of), but it got reposted on sneerclub I decided to take a look. Well worth it.

The sad part is Morty!HJPEV will probably wise up to Rick!Quirrelmort's shit and snap (seriously Rick's bs has developed a brutal and angry streak in Morty) before canon HJPEV did.

*** The premise is sneer bait, I don't think I can deny that.

But in all seriousness, if I were to continue this, unfortunately I would probably stick to the HPMOR tradition of characters taking a charitable stance, and thus not realizing the true agenda of other characters, and thus follow the stations of 'canon', so the snapping wouldn't happen until the graveyard battle, so I would have enough material to work with. Though I'd be obligated to make it more impactful. I might, perhaps, turn the Ender's Game homage parts into a Bonzo and Stilson homage.
