Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Not sure this is munchkinry, but say today at midday UTC over the course of 30 minutes everyone gets a headache that gets progressively worse until they stop doing anything dangerous, so pull over on the road etc. At the end of this headache they have amnesia.

This impacts everyone.

My questions are:

How badly would this destroy the world? Is this civilization ending or recoverable? If civilization survives what are the social and cultural implications of this? Scientists can discover that there was a bacteria lying dormant that got triggered by some specific frequency random chance cosmic wave, or some other handwave nonsense.

How quickly would people figure out who they were, and how closely would they align with what their former self wanted? These days a lot of people have phones but most are password protected.

If this happened to you how could you exploit it to take advantage of the situation? Could you become president from this, etc?

I'm not sure what scenario to stick with so you can imagine if it was just declarative memory or if it's both declarative and procedural that are impacted.

** I'm writing a SF thing, and in this by exploiting some esoteric physics humans get retro-causal computing (Delphic computing in universe), if you pre-commit to compute a function you can retrieve the output (return value) of that function the moment you make the "commitment" (this includes the function itself, the data it has to operate on, and a time delta to indicate when you want to compute aka 10ns if you want to compute in 10ns). If you are unable to satisfy the requirement, your prediction is just garbage data (but not trivially provably so). This is exploited heavily in universe to do heavy computation on portable devices and offload the compute debt to big offsite compute clusters, some other uses include running functions with known results on huge time deltas to predict your ability to carry out computation at a given time (this is used to schedule actually worthwhile calculations etc)

What are some munchkin/smart use-cases you guys can come up with, thank you.

*** If the function maps each product of two primes to that pair of primes, then if the prediction is garbage, this can be easily verified. Can this therefore factorize numbers without needing to actually do the computation (1), or can you send one bit into the past by choosing whether to complete the computation (2)?

In case 1: For any theorem, we can find a proof, for proof-checking is easy. For any algorithm specification, you can find an implementation if one exists. An easy way to break the setting one way or the other is to find the shortest program that will map each Wikipedia URL and timestamp to the article text (up to the present), then run it on future timestamps.

In case 2: If you can send one bit, you can send many. Send stock prices, research and news.

**** the former in this setting, you're not violating causality (any more than tachyons would if they are proven to exist.), and yes, this can be used to brute force a solution for something but you have to consider this actually ties up those computational resources so not many if any entities (in my setting) posses enough of these devices to make that a viable approach to solving problems. (ie. the garbage calculation cost is still carried out even if we know it's going to be garbage, you can't dispose of it without losing the retro causal computer that is carrying out your program) thanks.

*** An obvious and mundane one would be more powerful personal computers, by using the time that the computer would normally be off to process for the time that it's being used one could effectively make personal computers much more powerful without much more resources needed, interestingly people who use their computers less would be able to do more with them. I suspect that this technology would also imply the ability to do the same with lots of things, prescient resource allocation. For major computing projects people would make a relatively small processor, attach it to an RTG or something, get their answer and now people have to deal with a new form of waste that needs to be hidden somewhere and can't just be ground up. Also I assume this comes with a degree of knowing the future? IE running two calculations on two computers, one safe and the other not, if the answers match then the endangered one is probably going to be ok but if they don't then it's probably going to be destroyed.

**** This is already heavily employed in setting, most people use thin clients and a part of their taxes go to keeping up massive retro causal compute complexes that actually pay the compute debt. As for the locked up retro causal computer waste, it's one of the in universe factors (humans are planet-locked because of the massive Kessler Syndrome caused by frivolous delphic computing in the past) but I'm integrating your idea of simple but high entropy calculations being used to ascertain safety of the location in which the computer is placed (ie. a fighter jet constantly hashing list of known values at different time deltas knows if it has to dodge incoming fire presciently if the hashes start to not match the saved list.)

** You have control over a pool which can contain up to 10 times the number of electrons in your body. You can siphon electrons into this pool, and dispense electrons from this pool. Using this pool, you can charge batteries or directly power electrical circuits.

Electrical circuits that you power from your pool (to include battery-powered devices) are under your intuitive control, as long as the electrons flowing through the control circuits are electrons deposited from your pool. You cannot affect macroscale physical switches, but you can affect digital ones. If you have charged a phone via your power, you can control every function of that phone without dwelling on the minutae of that phone's operating system or circuits.

Your control is subject to the speed of light.

Electrons deposited via your powers only remain under your control for the length of time that you have held them within your pool; you have instinctual knowledge of which electrons have been held within your pool for how long.

The intersection of the speed-of-light limit and the within-your-control limit mean that your control radius is limited. Time calculations are performed relative to you, not relative to the electrons that you control. If you hold a batch of electrons for a week, then charge the battery of a device that sets off at 0.9c, you still only have control of the electrons for one week, your time.

How broken is this power?

----

Edited to add: Someone suggested that this power could be used to bypass encryption and other security features. I don't think that's the case; the power doesn't provide to the device any knowledge not known by that device. The power-user would have to input a decryption passphrase themself.

If it's useful consider this additional constraint: your control over any given electron is relenquished once you've told it to do something. This puts a cap on the number of decisions per charge, and favors newer devices that use smaller amounts of electrons per change.

** You have the superpower to make anything you imagine become real with caveats.

1. Imaginary things and any force/energy they produce cannot interact with anything biological or biological-adjacent. Not the water or iron in blood, nor metal piercings or drinks being drunk. Basically a very strict manton effect.
2. Imaginary things only interact electromagnetically (& gravitationally), no nuclear forces or anything exotic. So imaginary exit signs won't glow with radioluminescence since imaginary tritium doesn't undergo beta decay, and imaginary smoke alarms don't detect since imaginary Americium doesn't undergo alpha decay.
3. Imaginary things' mass is 0.1% that of their real equivalents. So imaginary lead would be slightly lighter than air, and imaginary mercury would be slightly heavier than air.
4. It's based on your imagination so if you can't imagine it, it won't be created. It will fill in the gaps so that you don't need to have a full anatomical knowledge of a frog, just the ability to imagine a frog hopping around. But it won't produce a kilo of technetium if you can't visualise it.
5. The power is creation only, no destruction (though their tendency towards buoyancy means they don't often stick around).
6. Control is limited to initial parameters. An imaginary baseball will have the initial momentum and trajectory its imagined with, and an imagined frog will be imbued with the intent to hop in the direction its initially imagined to hop. No telekinesis or mind control on imaginary things.
7. Imaginary things will appear where they are imagine to appear once a solid mental image is formed. That can be in your field of view, or even a remote location if accurately imagined (helps to use reference photos or video).

Given these restraints, how broken is the superpower?

**** I have doubts it's possible for someone to genuinely visualise something on that scale, but if you can fully imagine an entire star right here, then yes. The star would immediately collapse without the internal nuclear reaction to sustain it(even with a 1000x smaller gravitational force pulling it in), but the initial heat energy would be enough to ruin everything before that matters.

There some compensation for internal function, but I don't think there is any internal function that produces a working subservient platinum golem, so you'd probably just end up with a statue of a subservient platinum golem. A subservient partially platinum robot should work since there is theoretically some internal function that allows a subservient partially platinum robot to work.

** You can move impossibly fast (the flash, flicker), but can't think or react any faster than a well trained human. Essentially, you can plot a series of actions in advance, then execute them near-instantaneously.

1. Best ways to abuse this for economic power?

*** It sounds like this power is great for monotonous repetitive tasks, since you can plot those tasks out in advance and execute them mindlessly. So:

1. Spin a turbine to generate massive amounts of electricity.
2. Would not recommend superheroing, because your power has very dangerous vulnerabilities that will quickly result in your death. Especially since you lack super toughness or super reflexes, meaning you could die real quick to any regular criminal with a gun that gets the jump on you. A simple bullet through the head before you can react is all it takes.
3. Depending on how 'impossibly' fast, fly. Carry around skydiving equipment at all times. Whenever you need to escape, plot a series of swimming actions upwards. Air is a fluid just like water, so if you can move fast enough you can definitely swim through air just like water. So this course of action would send you flying straight upwards, where you can then open up a parachute and slowly fall to a safe location.\\
   Naturally this doesn't work if you are indoors or underground, in which case you are pretty screwed if you need to escape.

*** Are there other superpowered people out there, or is it just you? Can you adjust your speed, or is it set at a constant level when activated?

If you're the only super around, and if you can adjust your speed, you can make a solid chunk of cash by beating all the world records for speed in narrowly-defined tasks by a believable human margin. I think Guinness pays pretty well.

After that, invest your winnings and use your power for nothing but tedious chores to avoid attracting the wrong kind of attention.

*** When I move super fast, do I consume as much energy as would be needed to accelerate & decelerate this much mass against wind resistance etc., or does my power provide? I might be able to [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13][tap that energy source]], although it's really lame and boring.

If I were to build a tower of legos, probably I'd fumble a few. If I did it at super speed, would I be equally uncoordinated? Would a dropped lego disrupt the whole rest of my planned sequence, leaving me with half a tower and a mound of scattered bricks? Would it go flying out and smash through a window?

I actually can't think of many things that are worth much more when done fast than slowly AND don't require reaction speed. Extreme shoplifting or art theft perhaps, though that's not exactly economically productive.

**** I'm envisioning that basic kinesthetics are still working, but for a tower of Legos you'd want to speed run only a few bricks at a time. Still a lot faster in the long run, since we normally operate in this "plan->execute" system, but need to allow back down to calibrate fine motion - I'm calling that final step plannable, even though it's actually a really repetitive problem-solving process that turns into a set of learned approaches over time..

The air effects have already come up - I'm trying to work out a way to let you move at basically normal wind resistance despite hyperspeed, but of course every solution I come up with has tappable boundary effects if you poke hard enough.

Super speed is a fairly standard trope, I'm adding limitations to see how its usage is affected, not trying to work out a system of physics in which super speed isn't nonsensical (because of course it is). The closest I've seen to the latter is in Doc Future, and I'm not going to do better.
