  The *Citigroup Center* (formerly *Citicorp Center* and now known as *601 Lexington Avenue*) is an office tower in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City][New York City]], located at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53rd_Street_(Manhattan)][53rd Street]] between [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Avenue][Lexington Avenue]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Avenue_(Manhattan)][Third Avenue]] in midtown [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan][Manhattan]]. It was built in 1977 to house the headquarters of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citibank][Citibank]]. It is 915 feet (279 m) tall, one of the ten tallest [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper][skyscrapers]] in New York, and has 59 floors with 1.3 million square feet (120,000 m²) of office space,

  The building is one of the most distinctive and imposing in New York's skyline, thanks to a 45° angled top and a unique [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilts][stilt]]-style base. It was designed by architect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Stubbins][Hugh Stubbins]] and structural engineer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_LeMessurier][William LeMessurier]]. The building is currently owned by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Properties][Boston Properties]], and in 2009, was renamed 601 Lexington Avenue.
