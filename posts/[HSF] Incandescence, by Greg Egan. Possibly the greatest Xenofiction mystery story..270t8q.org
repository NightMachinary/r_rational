Incandescence is an absolutely amazing story.

It follows two parallel stories. The first is about Rakesh, a human member of the Amalgam. The Amalgam is essentially the end result of a Culture-like civilization which successfully managed to amalgamate most of the species of the Milky Way. An achievement doubly impressive due to the lack of FTL.

He's been given a quest to visit the uncharted bulge of the Milky Way, the center of the galaxy, to trace evidence of a DNA-based life form which didn't originate from one of the 11 known DNA-based panspermia. Due to ennui and a sense of obligation to his unknown cousins he takes up the quest.

On the other side of the coin, we have Roy, a member of the people of The Splinter. A subterranean race in a world where the surface is death, she joins an odd old male in figuring out the mystery of why the gravity of The Splinter is such a complicated pattern, and upon cracking that, gradually learns about the very nature of the world.

The mystery of what exactly the Splinter is, is one of the best ontological mysteries I've read, and the technical information which sets up each puzzle is enough for one familiar with astrophysics to leap ahead, while not being overly technical and leaving someone who isn't an astrophysicist in the dark.

** Like most of Egan's works the characters are not very interesting, but the technical aspects were well done (particularly what at least felt at the time like a relatively clear explanation of GR), and the subtle* twist was cute.

* Probably obvious to most people here but many of the reviewers on Amazon didn't get it.

*** Yeah, I found it particularly interesting in how they worked out GR, but took a while to grasp how c and the speed of light were actually the same.

Could you share which subtle twist you're referring to? (in spoilers)

** Mystery story? the mystery was a really small part of what made me love the book. I read the whole thing with pen and paper at hand, and it taught me General Relativity better than any class I've ever taken.

Plus I'm a huge fan of stories about scientific discovery, like this and the Quicksilver trilogy.

*** Sure, it's a great book that can really help add an intuitive understanding of relativity. It was still a mystery though, specifically the nature of the spindle itself. The data was the clues, and them reformulating Relativistic physics on abacuses was the solving of the mysteries.
