The main character's original life was traumatic and isolated. Her second run not only gives her much-needed healing; it also improves the lives of her loved ones - both through her example, and in more direct ways, as she connects with and helps them in ways she was unable to when she lived through these events.

Practically speaking, most people wouldn't be able to make much impact if they jumped 50 years into their own past. I'm only 36, so obviously I can't remember 50 years ago, but even if I were jumped back 20 years I wouldn't be able to do much aside from a few good long term stock picks (and you have to have money to make money in the stock market).

***** I guess we'd need to move that to the munchkinry thread, but I'd say the most low effort thing would be to write a book/blog/pgp signed messages about the future (and publish it anonymously). The accuracy of the predictions should make people read it at some point, entrepreneurs who implement ideas from it will have success and soon the contents will be in everybody minds. Then maybe they'll do something about future wars, climate change, pandemics etc. earlier. If they don't --- they had enough information to decide. W.r.t. to butterfly effect just preface the book with a discussion of that and that it just a version of the future where the book doesn't exist.

There is also huge societal value in just saying that stuff works or doesn't. Battery+CPU tech can be optimized till everybody has a supercomputer in their pocket. Electric cars with 400 mile range are possible. Solar cells can be improved till they produce energy cheaper than fossil fuel energy. Research can be more focused and there is less waste on dead-ends like e.g. hydrogen cars.

***** Selfishness is being concerned excessively or exclusively, for oneself or one's own advantage, pleasure, or welfare, regardless of others.Selfishness is the opposite of altruism or selflessness; and has also been contrasted (as by C. S. Lewis) with self-centeredness.

== Divergent views == The implications of selfishness have inspired divergent views within religious, philosophical, psychological, economic, and evolutionary contexts.

Remember that the U.S. intelligence community /knew/ that a terrorist attack was likely imminent. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Ladin_Determined_To_Strike_in_US][Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]. What could you or some other person without any intelligence or government connections do? Tell them you know the date and target? Why would they believe you, and if they did, how would you explain it? You need to /convince/ them, not just send an easily dismissed anonymous note (assuming you can successfully keep yourself anonymous which isn't certain given /after/ the attack the full force of government investigation is going to be very interested in that note they received /beforehand/).

The problem of exploiting other future knowledge suffers from the same issue, specifically that most would not have the proper leverage to do so in their past lives (especially as a child, as vanishingly few children have any leverage at all).

Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. At the absolute bare minimum she could've entered the tower and tried to persuade one person to leave. She could've called in a bomb threat to the building after the planes took off to try to get the building evacuated - calls on a burner phone with gloves aren't very easy to trace and even if it was traced it would be clear that she was trying to rescue people. That doesn't prevent the attack but even trying and completely failing is indescribably better than going "fuck all of them, I need a pedicure" or whatever.

******** I haven't read the more recent chapters, but I'm most confused about how we pivoted from a hypothetical about something she might or might not be able to affect in the future using her future knowledge, to something you seem to imply has occurred in the story and she chose not to intervene. The story takes place in 1998. Has it timeskipped 3+ years?

I do not share your blasé attitude towards how easy it is to avoid government notice, especially in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack. I think the fundamentals of our disagreement is that you act like it would be risk-free for her to try and intervene, even in a "bare minimum" fashion. I think you underestimate the resources of the U.S. government when it wants to know something. [[https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf][The 9/11 Commission Report]] is 585 pages, and this is a /summary/ of unclassified or declassified information. There are undoubtedly untold reams of data known to U.S. intelligence agencies about everyone involved in the attacks. At the very least using a burner phone would give investigators a time and general location. But remember that the WTC was the target of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing][an earlier terrorist attack in 1993]]. They would probably have recorded bomb threats, so now they also have her voice and a lot of background sounds to forensically analyze. Even if they did not record it, the operator would remember what she sounded like. But even this is an example of the question of leverage. The MC is a poor juvenile in 1998/2001 (prior to the widespread adoption of cellphones, especially by the young). Where is she supposed to get a burner phone, how is she supposed to pay for it, and what measures can she use to ensure it cannot be traced back to her? Burner phones can be traced, if you are not careful to obscure the trail or use criminal contacts that won't flip on you; investigators can find out where it was purchased and ask to whom it was sold. There would be many investigators whose entire job it would be to follow this one trail.

All of this would not matter if the MC is willing and able to reveal their status as a time traveler to the authorities, but there are some problems with that. Firstly, it is unlikely she would be believed. It is much more likely investigators would believe she had contact with one of the terrorists and knew the information that way; or that one of her parents, relatives or friends did, thus getting them in a lot of trouble too. When she insists she's a "time traveler, really", this would likely be seen as a lie, and quite possibly gain her and/or her family a quick trip to Guantanamo, or at least a similar U.S. based facility. And yes, there were [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_juveniles_held_at_the_Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp][juveniles]] at Guantanamo, and yes there were [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_detainees_at_Guantanamo_Bay][Americans]]. If they don't believe her, the /best/ she could probably hope for is commitment to a mental institution. On the other hand, if they /do/ believe her, they now have a resource that can give them information about the course of future events for the next 45 years. Do you really expect they would leave her to live her life? Or would you say she has the obligation to make this sacrifice? There is a reason most time traveler characters don't reveal themselves.

Furthermore, IIRC, she /has/ already saved one life, just not from a terrorist attack (from a shooting I think). It was a while ago I read it, so please forgive me if I got the details wrong, but you seem to have forgotten that, or possibly that people sometimes die in other ways than terrorist attacks. People save lives every day - these everyday heroes like firefighters and paramedics were particularly celebrated in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but perhaps you've forgotten that too. You don't need to wait for a terrorist attack to save people and she already has done, when she acted to swiftly call paramedics and save someone's life.

The 1993 World Trade Center bombing was a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, carried out on February 26, 1993, when a truck bomb detonated below the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. The 1,336 lb (606 kg) urea nitrate--hydrogen gas enhanced device was intended to send the North Tower (Tower 1) crashing into the South Tower (Tower 2), bringing both towers down and killing tens of thousands of people. It failed to do so, but killed six people, one of whom was pregnant and injured over one thousand. About 50,000 people were evacuated from the buildings that day.The attack was planned by a group of terrorists including Ramzi Yousef, Mahmud Abouhalima, Mohammad Salameh, Nidal A.

Bit late reply yeah, but my counterpoint is, the anonymous call may be heavily researched later. You would be implicating yourself with prior knowledge of a terror attack.

******** I think there's a middle ground between selfish and selfless you're skipping over here. The standard of behavior expected of others by most is not that they must sacrifice their life or freedom to help others or else be deemed "selfish".

I also think you may have not properly considered how useful future knowledge isn't. It basically amounts to one (very) good prediction; if your timeline is fixed then you can't change anything anyway and if it isn't then every change you make moves that prediction further away from accurate. I don't think it makes you "uniquely qualified" except perhaps for one or a few major changes. After that, the accuracy of your prediction is probably reduced to just another good prediction. Should you wait for a major attack before making /any/ changes? Is your memory of your past good enough that you won't butterfly away anything? What if some slight change makes the attacks happen a day earlier in this timeline? Consequentialism would ask you to weigh all the outcomes of your actions. How do you weigh the chance of butterflying away a possible (but slight) chance to avert a major attack against all the (much more individually minor) good your actions could do in the mean time, but a strict adherence to anti-butterflying would prohibit?

And you still have the problem of being /able/ to make that change (the "leverage" issue). In the original example, I think it's entirely possible the MC could expend every effort to attempt to help but still have no major effect (people dismissing her warnings), but /still/ face all the same repercussions. Even if you think it worth it to sacrifice your life/freedom to help others, do you feel the same way if the chance to help is very slight but the costs will stay the same?

You don't need to be from the future to know how to help others. And, most likely, it is within your power to sacrifice your health/comfort/etc to do so more effectively. Are you going to?

In the case of a 1v1 competition where each party has the same resources the future knowledge would potentially give you an advantage. But that's not how the world works in almost any circumstance. Even as a professional developer myself I would have a 0% chance of being able to do what Bill Gates did if I was able to go to the past.

*** I'm a sucker for loop stories too. I haven't found a way to search for them on Royal Road but here are some I found just because they are highly rated.

- The Perfect Run - MC can set a save point to return to when he dies, future earth with superpowers
- The Menocht Loop - Starts in a loop and doesn't know why, magical world with technology
- Blessed Time - Gains a looping power with active activation and limits. magical fantasy world

Honorable mention (Not looping but using knowledge from previous lives)

- The Many Lives of Cadence Lee - Reborn into a different world each death
- Magic Smithing - Reborn once, from earth to a magical world
- Sylver Seeker - Reborn into the same or similar fantasy world

**** RR actually just added a time loop tag! You can search for all stories tagged as time loop. MoL hilariously doesn't show up in a "time loop" advanced search because the author hasn't logged in to add the tag.

****** None that the previous comment didn't already. I've read all of them so far besides Cadence, Perfect Run, and Magic Smithing, but I hear good things about those, too. My favorite on the list is probably Blessed Time. Full disclosure that I write The Menocht Loop; it's less loopy than some of the mentioned options. If you're really looking for time loop exploitation Blessed Time and Perfect Run are probably what you want.

******* I've been following and enjoying The Menocht Loop since mid-way through the loop. Nice to meet you here. It has good progression and is very interesting post-loop.

I'm fully read up on all the stories I listed. The author of Blessed Time has two other stories I like more, Tower of Somnus and Burning Stars, Falling Skies.

*** If you're willing to read fanfiction, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] is a pretty good take on a repeating timeloop around A Song of Ice and Fire.

In particular, it does a great job exploring the world, especially the less used parts not well covered by the books.

**** Well ... those three. I don't really keep a list as such but other good ones include (movies): Timecrimes, Triangle, Coherence, Edge of Tomorrow, Happy Death Day, Repeaters, The Infinite Man, Predestination; (books) Life After Life, 11/22/63, [[https://bbs.pku.edu.cn/attach/80/a2/80a255d7a8fc70db/Ted_Chiang.pdf][The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate]], The Man Who Folded Himself, All You Zombies ... that's off the top of my head, I'm sure I've missed many good ones.

***** Oh I have movie suggestions for you:

[[https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/][About Time]]

It's not exactly a time loop story, but it touches several of the beats and is in general different from typical romantic comedies.

[[https://m.imdb.com/title/tt9484998/][Palm Springs]]

Classic time loop. More than one looper. More modern style of comedy.
