*** LOL haha, thought it was a cute dry joke, however I am a fan of Anathem by Neal Stephenson. I've never been one to research into the various categories of stories however from the side bar I'd say the book was pretty rationalist.

then again, so too was stuff like deltora quest and rowin of rin haha
