What should a rational + rationalist fiction panel consist of? What's are the key points to get across? Has anyone else had a similar idea?\\
I havn't thought to much about this or done too much research so its really rough. I figured, between the short into and conclusion the time would be split into two parts. The first part would be an explanation of the troupes that are embraced and avoided by the genre, and the second part would be giving examples.\\
Still a very rough idea, but I'll take any opinions people can offer.


** I think another important part is that "rational != unemotional", that rationality is supposed to make the story /more/ awesome, not less.

(I can't think of "rational" anime, so I'm not jumping up to run one. Maybe next year?)

** I would put the emphasis on rational/ist/ fiction. I don't think you want to show up at a panel and tell people you're into this niche genre about characters who don't hold idiot balls and aren't made of evil at the atomic level who live in a world with consistent rules (well, maybe all that is more radical for anime). The rationalist bullet points on the sidebar are much more distinctive.

Maybe some emphasis should be on how intelligence can and should be really portrayed in fiction. E.g. less "aha I saw that all coming cuz I read the script" and more, well, Professor Quirrell. And on how shaking up the readers/watchers in ways that are logical rather than retarded can make a work of fiction feel distinct and fresh.

That's actually still pretty radical, for /most/ genre fiction. And for most literary fiction, for that matter, which seems to enjoy taking unrealistic psychologies to extremes in order to Make a Point About Society.

**** Which is really quite a shame -- because it really /should/ be the basic rules of writing (as [[/u/writingathing]] has been eager to remind us many times).

****** Less so. Most writers, even successful ones, are terribly unoriginal, and intelligence is rarely portrayed as well as it is in Harry and Quirrell. But yes, you do have to come up with a way of presenting it in some manner other than, "Gosh, all your characters are dumb and your stories cliche." Find some term, nothing with preexisting connotations like "rationalist," and say we're into this new idea of x writing based on this idea of shaking up the reader into seeing with fresh eyes. E.g. lines like Uncle Iroh saying, "no, she's crazy and she needs to go down," which indicate that he's actually wise and not just a fat walking cliche.

I hereforth propose the name "rawrosaurse" for this genre. Pronunciation of the third r, of course, is entirely optional.
