There hasn't been a day since February that people haven't looked at it. I would feel bad if I didn't give people a reasonable update schedule, since I said "June 1st" in April (and that's after having said "March 1st" in January).

I'm going to release the first 10 chapters all at once on Christmas day, so if you're one of the people checking for updates, be aware that it's going to be a while, but when it /does/ come out it'll be a nice healthy chunk of text, thereabouts of 150 pages.


** Looking forward to it!

** Thanks for the update. I had occasionally crtl+f'd through your user comments just to see if you had any mentions of it.

  Seriously, this is all you're getting until December (unless I get drunk and accidentally upload the first four chapters without announcing it
#+end_quote

FF.net mailed me a notification this morning about a Chapter 2, but now the link goes to a "Chapter not found" error. So I can only assume you got lightly buzzed and decided to tease us.

Or possibly you updated Ch1 again, and it briefly registered as 'new' for the purposes of notifications.

*** I could've replaced the chapter with a new document and there would've been no notification, but you're quite right, I was lightly buzzed and I wanted to tease people, so I thought to delete the chapter outright and upload this draft as a new chapter, but it wouldn't let me because every story has to have at least one chapter, so I uploaded the new(er) draft as a new chapter and then deleted the first chapter.

The draft currently at ff.net is about 85% polished (I never completed that draft). The draft that used to be there was about 60% polished. The draft currently on my computer is probably 97% polished (and it's the draft I started on after I abandoned the one currently on ff.net, and I've decided that it's the final draft). I have a 75% polished draft of Chapter 2, I have a 60% polished draft of Chapter 3, and I have a vomit draft of Chapter 4. Chapter 5 is probably 95% finished (the title of that chapter is Omake Files 1, 2, and 3: Alternate Trajectories), I have vomit drafts of Chapters 6 and 7, I have an outline of Chapter 8, and Chapters 9 and 10 are at about 85% polished.

Make of all that what you will.

** Erm, is there something wrong with the first part of chapter 1? It reads like a rough draft. Also, this bit is unintentionally hilarious:

#+begin_quote
  Fury burning in his eyes, etcetera. "You foolish little boy. You can't be right. Etcetera."

*** That was also a reaction to the whole "people keep looking at it" thing. Maybe like a month ago I decided to add a line that said "this is a draft," and then I updated the chapter and saw all that extra stuff. Apparently, a month or four prior to that, I had an idea and decided to jot it down in the document itself and then forgot about it (not the idea, mind you, but the fact that I jotted it down in the doc on ff dot net; I'd had that idea bouncing around in my head for a few weeks at that point, and I was lying down in bed and my brain just started running through that scenario so I got up afterwards and wrote it out to make my brain shut up). Now that it's there, I'm not going out of my way to remove it, not when the entire chapter's already been rewritten multiple times. Everything between "And standing behind the cauldron" and the line break is a sneak peak at what my vomit drafts look like, but the entirety of the rest of it is a rough draft anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Action beat. "Draco?"

  "Why do /you/ think he's here, Mr. Potter?"

  Harry spun around to face the voice behind him and saw Quirrell.

  "/You/. Maybe more words." Action beat.

  An expression with Quirrell's face. "Mr. Potter, you failed. We're not moving on until I've made you understand everything you did wrong." Action beat.
#+end_quote

"/You/. Maybe more words." Action beat.

That's pretty blatantly "rough draft material" LOL

And this one:

#+begin_quote
  I cannot cast magic on you directly, and I needed a way to implant the False Memory Charm without the readers bitching about the Resonance.
#+end_quote

I got a good chuckle out of that one.

**** This is a pretty awesome way to write that I'd never seen before. Did you learn to draft like this somewhere, or did you come up with it yourself?

***** It just kinda comes naturally. You really shouldn't focus on the mechanics of writing while you're trying to get things plotted, that's how people end up getting stuck, but I still want to have the "whens" roughly blocked even if the "whats" are still fuzzy.

"You. Maybe more words." Action beat.

That action beat could be "Harry clenched his fists" or "Harry furrowed his brow" or "Harry dramatically collapsed to the ground and pretended to have a heart attack" or "Harry took a deep breath" or "Harry closed his eyes briefly" or "Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing" or literally /anything/. If I tried to do that part while drafting, then I'd end up with a bunch of floating heads furrowing their brows at each other.
