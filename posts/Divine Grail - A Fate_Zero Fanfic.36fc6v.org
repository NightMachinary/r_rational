I originally wrote this in response to a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/353kr3/challengeprompt_you_find_an_oracle_that_will/][competition]] posted by [[/u/alexanderwales]] about oracles, but didn't finish in time. Gradually scope creep brought me to writing more.

I recently watched Fate/Zero and enjoyed the anime quite a bit, so I thought I'd tinker around with some ideas. This is my first crack at writing anything longer than a very short story, so let me know what I can do to improve. I'm hoping to crank out 3 or 4 more chapters to reach the end of Fate/Zero in this fanfic and call it complete in the next month.

*** u/IomKg:

  Also, in my opinion a character shouldn't address someone else by their full name unless they're either mocking them, being playful, or specifically pointing out that they know their name
#+end_quote

Actually it felt like a respect thing, which fits with that whole servant \ coming from an older era aspect which is going on there in my opinion

*** Thanks for the input! I'll go through and update my numbers. Rereading it now, the numbers used in place of number-word does stand out a bit. I'll see what I can do about using more pronouns as well since that will help with the flow.

** the time reversal part was definitely interesting. the first section though was less interesting and to be honest i had to force myself to continue through it, less because it was bad and more because i had no particular interest at that point. if the timer reversal was presented first i think it would have been easier to get in to it and then the weber section would have been more fun probably.

*** Thanks for the feedback! I'll see if I can make things a bit more engaging with the other plot
