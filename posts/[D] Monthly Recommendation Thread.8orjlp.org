Wow... is the author 13?

And this is not the first (or even second) light novel I've read were mid-20s to early-30s is considered "old" and "once-beautiful".

/Release that Witch/ describes a character named Scroll the same way.

Other than that, I am enjoying the story so far, so I'll tentatively second this rec.

It may not be a typical harem but it is definitely similar.

The "No OP powers" is debatable. The author does do a good job of leveling up enemies along with the protag, but the protag wins a bit more often that I would like.

That being said, release that witch is better than most isekais. Uplifting a medieval civilizatoin is straight up [[/r/rational]]'s alley.

** I've recently read through the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiji_(manga][Kaiji]]) manga series and I'm craving more gambling style manga. Similar examples would be Gamble Fish, Liar Game, and Gambling Emperor Zero.

I'm also requesting fanfiction of Temeraire. Dragons in the military are so much fun to read about.

I suppose I should provide recommendations as well right? There is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14686974/chapters/33934212][Chili Pepper Mint]] which is fanfic of [[http://sadehall.tumblr.com/][/The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatues/]]/,/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922890/13/Harry-and-Hermione-Starring-in-The-Digital-Revolution][Harry and Hermione Starring in the Digital Revolution]] has recently updated, and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/advice-and-trust-nge.8768/][Advice and Trust]] which is a beautifully written romance between Asuka and Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion where they are actually rational about their Hollywood-like romance.

*** For gambling manga:

You've already read Kaiji and Gambling Emperor Zero, and if you like those basically everything else written by Fukumoto will probably also be up your alley.

If you aren't sick of Mahjong yet Tetsunaki no Kirinji is pretty good.

If the fanservicey stuff like Gamble Fish doesn't put you off Kakegurui is probably worth a try.

For less gambly more mind gamey stuff I liked Spiral: Suiri no Kizuna. For very edgy mind games Tomodachi Game was decent.

Might edit more in later, I feel like I'm drawing a blank for more similar titles.

*** I mean, I wouldn't say that /James and the Giant Peach/ is a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's /so much better/ than /so many things/ that going so far as saying "it is the thing [you] hate most" seems pretty irrational. Have you ever seen any of Michael Bay's /Transformers/ movies? How about /The Emoji Movie/? Adam Sandler's /Jack and Jill/? /Howard the Duck/? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKAwXLVxuZQ][Tommy Wiseau's /The Room/]]?

What is it about /James and the Giant Peach/ that makes you hate it so much?

EDIT: Also, you didn't say "the movie/book/show/game/whatever-other-medium-of-narrative-delivery you hate most," you said "the thing you hate most." Racism? Income inequality? FGM in third-world countries? The holocaust? Death? And "the thing you hate most" is a semi-psychedelic movie about a little boy who travels around the world in a giant hollow piece of fruit with a gang of giant semi-anthropomorphized bugs?

(I understand hyperbole. I "hate" Minecraft/Fortnite youtubers who make clickbait for children, and I "hate" pickles and I "hate" mustard and I "hate" people who think it isn't a hate-crime to put pineapple on pizza, and I "hate" Generation Z's entire culture (what with the fidget spinners and dabbing and meaningless memes and all). Just pointing out how silly it is to say you hate a movie more than literally everything else.)

***** I see. That /is/ a thing kids do. I went through a phase when I was 3 years old, where I played /Mary Poppins/ multiple times a day, multiple days a week, for a period of time that I'm not in a position to estimate. I did the same thing with Disney's /Robin Hood,/ and Rob Evans' /The Donut Man/ videos, and god only knows what else.

I edited my first reply just before you posted your reply to my reply, so, yeah, I get "hyperbole." But, objectively speaking, /James and the Giant Peach/ is /not/ trash. /Norm of the North/ is trash. Whatever all this /Minions/ stuff is, it's trash. "Youtube Kids" is trash.

Out of curiosity, had you seen the movie before your cousin over-exposed you to it? What age were you? Have you seen it since then? If so, how long after your initial over-exposure?

Sorry, but I really am fascinated at such an extreme negative emotional response to such a benign movie.

(Content warning: That's a "horror" "movie;" I've only seen it once (as part of Achievement Hunter's "Theater Mode" show (it's a lot like Mystery Science Theater 3000)) but I'm pretty sure there's a little bit of mild gore; also, that's a link to a playlist with 150 full "movies" (I seriously doubt any single one of them had a budget higher than $5,000) and almost all of them are sh***y "horror" "movies," so if you go randomly clicking around (which you aren't going to do because you're not going to watch that movie because it's /objectively/ terrible and so are all the other ones, but /content warning/ regardless) then don't be surprised if you see something that you might rather not.)

Though I don't know, now that I think about it; you listed Troll 2 and The Room as pretty high up on your list, so you might actually /like/ this stuff.

FWIW, I would consider Glimwarden pastoral in setting, as it takes place in a small(ish) town surrounded by farmland and is a bit cozy in that sense ... but not really pastoral in terms of the archetype. I really /should/ reread it though, since it's been some time (too long).

(There have been a couple of different studies that show writing things down makes us less likely to remember them, which I think is definitely the case for me; stories that mostly living in the brain stay there, while stories that go onto the page tend to vanish.)

***** If I can comment on a work in progress, I don't think you need to escalate the level of conflict in Glimwarden as much as you might think.

I really liked the early narrative based on concepts of maturation and finding/making a place for yourself within the context of this isolating, resource-limited world. I also enjoyed the magic system munchkinry and mystery box elements of the increasing threat, but there's friction between those and the early narrative that relies on the status quo as context. My completely unsubstantiated guess is that friction was behind the burnout/hiatus.

*** Have you given [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kik%C5%8D][Yokohama Shopping Trip]] a read? It's a 14 volume manga.

Up front, it doesn't outright fit the boxes you selected, but is adjacent to them in a. lot of ways. It's about a gynoid/robot managing a small café. There are occasional guests, but much of the story is about her traveling, experiencing the world around her, and keeping her friendship with her neighbours. the story is very much low on dialogue (whole chapters with but a few words uttered), with lots of scenic images. Much of the science fiction could very well be fantasy (there are streetlamp plants, for instance, and other creatures). On TVT the setting is described as a /cozy catastrophe/ and /humankind in decline/, which appears to be true, but another way to look at it would be mankind passing the baton of exhilarating advancement to their children and leaning back in their rocking chair. There're also quite a few peculiarities in the setting that aren't ever explained to the reader,

So... there are checkmarks in pastoral scenes and slice of life, and science fiction is more conceptually expressed than hard. The pacing is very measured (some might say slow), and consumption shouldn't be rushed.

There's also an OVA adaptation, but I don't remember how I felt about that one. The manga was published outside of Japan only in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, so you'd have to look for translation elsewhere. Incidentally, it also won the Seiun award, a very noteworthy speculative fiction award in Japan (other winners, for comparison: /Japan sinks/, /Legend of Galactic Heroes/, /Empire of Corpses/)

To be frank: YKK is one of my favourite manga, definitely in the top ten and a good contender for first place, so I am a fairly biased in my recommendation.

A story and style that's familiar and comfortable to digest for the ravenous hordes of readers from the litRPG/light-novel/xianxia communities (which also happen to be among the biggest commercialized mediums online). A likeable /and/ unpredictable protagonist. A plot trajectory that's mainstream and "safe" for a wide audience (lately it's been very HFY), yet has cliffhangers and plot twists aplenty (readers eat it up).

It's a great story by the Wachowskis and JMS and they intended a 5 season arc, but early reviews of the finale state that it's a very good finale.

Episode 4 is widely considered the place where it becomes clear what the series is about, so if you watch it and don't like it at first but want to give it a chance, episode 4 is where it begins to show its potential.

The group orgies is something that the show got a reputation for that is pretty unearned, I mean yes they happen but they occupy the same amount of "sex scene" time that something like GoT has in its run time, and I think they're very beautiful / artistic / poetic like a renaissance painting in motion rather than gratuitous.

False. In the first place, neither Harry nor any of his allies /intentionally/ caused the nuclear war. It just so happened that the Muggles went into a worldwide panic after Hermione (accidentally) and Alice (intentionally) shattered the Statute of Secrecy. In the second place, no one was /praised/ for the destruction of the Muslim world and of several Russian "ports", "airfields", and "manufacturing or control centers".

Two major problems with this counterargument. First off, Harry and co are very explicitly held up within the narration and narrative as the great heroes of this stage; in typical PL fashion his charachters are "the best", and thus all that narrative atta-boying translates directly into narrative approval for their acts. Add in the authorial rants and the approval is pretty blatant; while death of the author does hold sway, author's notes in fanfiction are part of the medium and thus directly impact the story itself.

Maybe we're talking at cross-purposes.

In /CED/, when I see Naruto set up new and inventive ways for Gaara to brutally torture, maim, and kill Sasuke on a stage in front of thousands of cheering Shadow Clones (plus a few confused genin), I chuckle, because that's [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Crosses_the_Line_Twice][Crossing the Line Twice]]: it's so over-the-top that it's funny. The Shintenshin-induced incontinence, on the other hand, falls flat because it's not outrageously flamboyant but merely pathetically petty. /CED/ is a /combination/ of hilariously-over-the-top bashing and fascinating ideas (/e. g./, "Lightning-nature chakra actually is an ancient kekkei-genkai combination of fire and air" or "Suffusing a patch of earth or river with your chakra is a good chakra-control exercise"). The same goes for /PKH/, except that /PKH/'s bashing never drops to /CED/'s level of pettiness (and, IIRC, /PKH/'s harem shenanigans aren't as boring as /CED/'s): it remains consistently entertaining right up to the end.

I would dispute entirely that the fic is funny or well written, because I'm entirely convinced that it isn't, but I'm honestly not interested in arguing that particular point here since I only have so many spoons and the other half of the argument, that the "heroes" in his stories are endemically awful, is more important.

I honestly think your line about it in you paragraph isolates perfectly just how nasty they are, but here's a few more: PKH Harry causes Snape to bludgeon himself to death in the middle of a class by torturing him with legilimency. He also goes on to torture basically everyone else who works with dumbledore that he can't mind control away, and uses an advanced form of magical mind control on >50 members of the cast in the form of turning them into fairies that are magically under his control.

CED, meanwhile, has Tsunade, among others, perform the whole laundry list of unethical medical experiments on non-consenting kidnap victims. Naruto Steals family memorabilia and heirlooms and sells them out of entirely unjustfiied spite. Everyone tortures Sasuke (lots of times, lots of the "heroes" doing this), who I migth add is basically innocent of anything at this point, and a minor to boot.

I went to go look for more, but reading through some of the later chapters looking for stuff that I had forgotten was starting to actually make me sick. This shit is absolutely vile.

** Wouldn't call it rational by any stretch, but I've been enjoying the manga Hoshino Close Your Eyes. / Hoshino me wo tsubate

[[https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=130286]]

For a harem rom com, it's got surprisingly good writing. It's about a antisocial loner getting roped into doing makeup for a girl in his class who leads a double life - her pretty popular made up self and her unfettered athletic unmade up aelf. Essentially it's a super hero story from the POV of the secret keeper, but the super hero plot is merely a device to explore the coming of age story.

Probably what I'm most enjoying is the theme of (personal) identity, the different roles we take with various people we interact with, and balancing that with vulnerability in relationships. Echoes a lot of themes in Ward, appropriately enough.

It's probably the best harem rom com I've read snice Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa/My Monster Secret , which is decidedly not rational (all of the characters are loveable idiots - indeed thwir most threatening antagonist is explicitly acknowledged in story as so fearsome be cause they're not an idiot), but it's got one of the best endings in any media I've experienced in recent memory.

** I need an english text of my choosing and I was wondering if our subreddit could offer something nice. My topic is based on landscapes and people's relationships with them, but the landscapes can be any type (urban, natural, homely) of any form, (real, remembered or imagined). I'm looking for something that shows people's interaction with different landscapes and how they are affected by them. Any genre, any text type (except non-fiction, since we are already using a non-fiction text). Even oblique examples such as games and podcasts could work well if they explore landscapes (Elder Scrolls was an interesting suggestion)

*** You could try [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8680.Fierce_Invalids_Home_from_Hot_Climates][Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates]] by Tom Robbins. It's one of my favourite books, mostly because of the exquisite prose. In the book he travels all over the world, from the US to the Amazon to the Middle East, and he tends to describe the various locales very distinctly. Here's an example:

#+begin_quote
  Switters was actually quite fond of Seattle's weather, and not merely because of it's ambivalence. He liked it's subtle, muted qualities and the landscape that those qualities encouraged if not engendered: vistas that seemed to have been sketched with a sumi brush dipped in quicksilver and green tea. It was fresh, it was clean, it was gently primal, and mystically suggestive.
#+end_quote

It is not a typical recommendation for this sub. The MC is proudly irrational at times, and it gets very weird.

***** Hi, if you still need another recommendation give [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77507.Red_Mars][Red Mars]] or [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234225.Dune?from_search=true][Dune]] a try. Both books deal a lot with people reacting and changing their environment, and in both they seem to have a love-hate relationship with it.

edit: Dune in particular would be interesting.

- The protoganist starts his journey by leaving an ocean planet and going to a desert one.
- One of the themes of the novel is this idea that people are products of their environments, and thus the best soldiers in the galaxy come from the most hostile environments.
- Another relevant concept (explored more in the sequels) is the idea that by terraforming the world into a better, more welcoming environment, the inhabitants become a softer, self-indulgent, all-around worse people.

****** I've heard a lot about Dune and my school has some copies that I might be able to borrow. I'll need to ask my teacher about it, because he was telling our class that using texts that english teachers know about can make them mark harsher since they have a better understanding of it already (so they can notice flaws) and they have other students to compare us to.

I'll check out Red Mars as well, thanks!!

****** Yeah, Dune is on the extension english list of texts, so to the marker it will look like I studied Dune in extension english and then used it as a related text in the topic I'm currently doing (which is looked down upon). My teacher says that even the sequels will appear like I was doing extra reading for Dune, and not actually picking a personal text.
