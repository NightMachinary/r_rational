Afi can scry on the town until it moves. But the town's in an extradimensional space. Only its entrance technically /moves./ Doesn't that mean that Afi can spy on 90% of the town any time no matter how far they run, unless they completely tear down and rebuild the town?

Also, if I'm inferring right, either Jake doesn't fit into the world's alignment system or.... /Jake is eeeeevillll!/ Bwahaha! His pally pallies are gonna have a fun time with that one.

Hasn't Loki and many other gods manifested to Jake without fulfilling these conditions? Arros and Ilara could perhaps count under a danger to the world, but not Shailos or Loki. Unless what they're doing doesn't count as manifesting

Also, Jake's Orbital Bombardment trick appears to have curried favour with 2 gods, Loki and Arros. I think that it would clearly be in his best interests to come up with more creative uses of munchkinry such as that. Not that I have an ulterior motive here or anything.

** We know that Loki is playng both sides. He is probably thick with Afi (just like Jake), given Afi's apparent penchant for munchkinry and Loki's Neutral alignment. The trick with destroying Herrún's temple to kill her off, then getting Grǫfhamr to sacrifice their secrets to bring her back is probably something they worked out together.

Afi could be a pretty good ally, if they could get a Helm of Opposite Alignment on him enough times to get past his will save. Could Loki be planning to do this to Shailos?

The black flames are most easily explained by lots of evil undead making sacrifices. The only way to prevent Herrun from being predisposed to evil would be to either compensate with more sacrifices from good people, or find the undead and HoOA them all. Or maybe HoOA the evil Herrun, if that is possible. To incapacitate the undead long enough, I'm thinking polymorph them into tree sloths, or something else that is slow moving.

How broken is Polymorph Any Object, anyway? Can one turn an anthill into a secret city containing billions of virtuous elves with all kinds of secret magic arts, say, to sacrifice to Herrun? On the other hand, maybe actually use their secret arts for the war effort directly.

The truthful-mandatory questions could be phrased in a way so as for the honest answer to be a set of numbers, with each one corresponding to a numbered piece of paper with a scenario written on it. There could be hundreds of them. By asking "what is the complete set of numbers corresponding to claims regarding this reality", the truthful answer would be a simple set of numbers with no room for deviation.

The complete-honest questions could be more open-ended, e.g. asking for the 100 most likely plans to work, sorted from most likely to work to least likely to work, with percentages indicating probability in the event that the plan were attempted with no new information.

Anyway:

Congrats on writing Grǫfhamr properly -- I think you may be the first one who bothered to render the o-with-caudata. :)

PAO is extremely broken, but it does have limits. It turns /one/ thing into /one/ other thing. So, ant to elf, sure. Anthill to elf city? Nope. There's also some limits about creating information -- e.g., if you say "Polymorph Any Object: rock to map showing the locations of every lich's phylactery!"...yeah, no. Won't work. (And yes, this is actually a deviation from RAW. As written, PAO would allow you to do that, so I'm bringing down the "gods of knowledge don't allow that crap" hammer. (It gets kinda tiresome how often I have to do that, actually...D&D 3.5 is *sooooo broken!!!!*))

I like your "set of numbers" technique. Expect it to get an appropriate treatment in the next chapter.

**** I'm not entirely sure PAO RAW would allow a map showing the location of every lich's phylactery.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/alterSelf.htm]]

The polymorph spell appearance alteration is based on alter spell.

"You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check. "

So you have a limited ability to alter the appearance of things you polymorph. By Raw, you can only alter the minor physical characteristics and physical qualities, and they must be within the norms for that race, they provide, at most, a 10+ disguise bonus.

I'd argue that a document showing the locations of every lich's phylactery would not be within the norms for the race of pieces of paper. In fact, you're going somewhat beyond RAW if you alter anything bar height, weight, hair color, gender, hair texture, and skin color. The spell doesn't provide any bonus to forge document, writing on a document isn't really covered by the spell.

For example, at my table I would allow PAOing into a weightlifter. Some people read Alter Self to say that you can't so that because of the "average member" clause.

It is relevant in that it explains the limitations of your magic. In saying "I believe this spell as written allows me to create a map of an enemy's magical objects" you are saying that there are no limitations that prevent you from doing so. Since polymorph any object is dependent on the powers of polymorph, which is dependent on alter self your ability to alter the physical appearance of an object is dependent on the wording of alter self, which details what you can do. You lack the ability to alter the writing on an object so it's a house rule that would let you do so.

That would be RAI/ a house rule. The disguise skill requires you to spend more skill to overcome a significant weight/ height difference, 50 skill points. You're essentially allowing them to have a 60+ bonus to disguise (the normal stuff plus 50+ for an abnormal physique) from alter self, allowing you to bypass most disguise checks. That's normally a third level sort of spell effect, doing epic effects of skills, not a second level sort of effect. Like fly at level 3 making climb useless vs spider climb at level 2, invisibility at level 2 vs invisibility sphere at level 3 (hide others) making hide useless.

#+end_quote

No, it really isn't. Objects are not creatures. Alter Self talks only about what you can do vis a vis a creature. It makes no mention of objects, because it /isn't about objects./ You are taking the details of a spell about creatures and extrapolating what it should therefore allow you to do vis a vis objecs. That is the very essence of RAI.

[disguise issue]

You are misunderstanding my point. Granted, I was unclear because I used the word 'disguise' ambiguously. Let's try that again:

Alert Self has two uses:

- Make yourself look like a person who isn't you [general appearance change]
- Make yourself look like a specific person [disguise]

If you are using the 'disguise' function then sure, fine, you get a +10 bonus and overcoming a huge body difference is hard.

If you are using the 'general appearance change' function, then you are limited to 'the norms of the race'. This includes both very strong / fat people and very weak / skinny people. It probably doesn't include Mr Universe or a supermodel, but it would cover, e.g a random gym rat or a marathon runner.

This is a stupid and contradictory way for a spell to work, but it's the only way I can read it that is internally consistent.

******** Most of the alter self rules use the term form, not the term creature, and the polymorph any object implies that the term form refers to both objects and creatures. Besides which, it would be a very quirky interpretation of the rules to say that "This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another." Meant that you could ignore polymorph rules because you were now making an object. The clear meaning of the words is that polymorph rules apply, except in that you can now make objects, which are also subject to polymorph rules about forms, not that objects can ignore the rules of polymorph about forms.

It doesn't have a specific person disguise mechanic, it just provides a bonus to a disguise skill check, where you do specific things to set up a disguise. Until you put in the 1d3x10 minutes your alter self does nothing to make you look like a specific person by RAW. It could improve bluffs by dm choice, but nothing else.

What humans possible range by chance is defined. 124-260 pounds. Personally I'd argue that somewhere in the middle would be closer to the meaning of average, but a, say, 6 stone beggar weighing 84 pounds is clearly not in the norms, since it's impossible to be that just with rolling given the normal human stats. A body builder is more possible, there's a good chance you could fake that with alter self.

While the DnD creators made many obscenely broken spells they did at least try to stop some things, and their efforts deserve respect.

Edit. Besides which, there's a spell that can locate the phylacteries anyway, Discern Location. It's unblockable except by mind blank or deity intervention, and phylacteries aren't creatures and so can't be mind blanked.

As to not being able to use Mind Blank on an object, that is absolutely correct.

You have to make up new fluff text and rules for how it works beyond the existing stuff to fit your new definition that doesn't inherit polymorph stuff.

************ There is one way to bypass mind blank that I can think of.

Miracle can teleport you to a location without any divination or information gathering, or any need to know where you are going. It's an evocation spell, so it's not blocked by mind blank. As such you could teleport directly to the phylactery or assuming they have teleport wards teleport several hundred feet above, drop several tons of antiosmium, and teleport away. It's like a greater greater form of greater teleport which has some sort of omniscient location finder.

If your god is unwilling to aid you you can just convert to the cause of good and let the power of goodness power you so your request is mediated just by their alignment and nature. You are killing undead who are evil so many gods of good would likely support you, and the request is explicitly one that miracle can grant.

Re: elf mage. Erm...good question. You can definitely create an elf. Running down the chain of base spells, I don't think RAW supports creating something with character levels.

The Hourglass doesn't "make spells permanent" it "casts a Permanency spell", which can only affect certain spells, PAO not among them. It's not an issue though; you can PAO a pebble into a human, which has a 20 minute duration, then you PAO that human into itself, permanent duration.

If you're tying things together to form a new object (eg a net with floats attached) then I would say yes, that is a single object.

PAO'd critters would be blank slates with no active memories of their own, although they would have basic autonomic functionality -- treat them as a person with total amnesia.

Yes, you can use Programmed Amnesia to put memories into a PAO'd creature. You could not add character levels that way, though. You might be able to add knowledge skills, but not physical skills.

So presumably the strength of the secret is the impact it would have on people's lives. Although it doesn't say whether its on the person in question or people in general. Which explains why Jake's nuke from orbit secret was so powerful and implies that his Loki deduction could have had a massive impact on things. In which case, creating elves which are not permanent and then programming them with the information that they aren't permanent would have a pretty big impact on their short lives. So that should be a powerful secret for Herrun, if my guess is correct. Unless the length of the lives they have left would matter?

Presumably programmable amnesia suffers from the same information creation constraints as PAO, so an elf couldn't be given the memory of the lich's phylactery locations. Sadly.

*********** In theory you could do the elf thing, but Programmable Amnesia has a 10 minute casting time, so it wouldn't scale very well. There is a spell called Mindrape, which does pretty much exactly what PA does but has a 1 round casting time so in theory you could use that and have good throughput. (I think; I don't remember all the details on PA and MR). Problem is, that spell doesn't exist in 2YE because I dislike the name. Also, it's got the Evil descriptor, so the Deorsi / Flobovians wouldn't be using it anyway.

************ Does basic autonomic stuff cover language? Because they could then just be told these things. If not, then this idea probably wouldn't work

************* Erm...I'm really not sure. I would need to dig pretty heavily into the language rules. My suspicion is that yes, this would probably work, but I have only slightly more than coinflip confidence in that.

*** In chapter 35, Jake already tried listing potential facts and asking "Of those statements, which ones are false?" Referring to the statements by number shouldn't change anything.

Loki charged him for each claim separately. He was in a good mood and gave Jake a discount, but it would probably be a bad idea to try the same trick twice.

  eaglejarl: I like your "set of numbers" technique. Expect it to get an appropriate treatment in the next chapter.

  Anakiri: [Jake tried that and,] Loki charged him for each claim separately.

Dangit, stop reading my story notes! Now you've blown what the 'appropriate treatment' is! :P

***** Argh. He should definitely specify that the set of numbers be ordered from most important to least important so that if he does blow all the answers, he at least gets something useful.

Better yet, he could request /only/ the most important true answer. For example: "Of the claims written on these 100 pieces of paper, which of the true ones is the most important (to us) for us to know about?" That way, if he blows the answers (on the grounds that information about the other claims is contained in the answer, i.e. that they are not as important, whether true or not) he at least doesn't sound like he has been taking stupid pills.

** A fun chapter. It shows working with genies done right. Lots of kindness to make the genie like you, intense and potent results, Loki being scary, and the genie screwing over the character despite all their preparation.

**** Well, I could be wrong, but I got the impression that giving him the Scotch was Arros's main purpose in meeting with him. He's already using it as an emotional crutch--he's going to end up an alcoholic at this rate, and I think that was what Arros was going for.
