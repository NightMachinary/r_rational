** I'm enjoying this story and I have some thoughts.

My new position is that this entire story was designed just for very tangential meta commentary about web serials.

Am I the only one getting an AR feeling from this like when people find a secret message in video games making them go to some website where they deduce a code that gives them the date of the next sequel or what have you?

In particular I imagine no one here at this point now believes the author to be a newcomer. Web serials are tough, I think the first web serial someone writes is usually obviously their first. Who wants to start a prediction market with what author this turns out to be?

Perhaps due to this communities particular love of psuedonyms I have scaled up by probabilities too high.

Also to raise a conversation:

#+begin_quote
  there were always people who'd try to abuse that direct contact to move the serial into a direction more suited to their views.
#+end_quote

Do you think this counts as abuse? It seems to me people have an obligation to their views/themselves to make the world more in line with it. It's most obvious if you use an extreme example so say you were reading some Nazi apologists work, is it an abuse of the web serial medium to comment on it saying you'd prefer the story to contain less apologia for the holocaust?

*** The psuedonym thing has been discussed in some detail over on the Alexander Wales Discord server, which now has a dedicated channel for this story - it was a while back, but the author themself has stated on multiple occasions that their only previous writing has been short prompt responses and the like under throwaway names and other unpublished work.

While recent updates have proven their willingness to flat-out lie to their readers if they think it'll make the story better, it still seems more likely that they're telling truth in this case (as they seem to do in most cases - remember, this isn't some throwaway account, but one that regulaly participates in discussions on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]] and elsewhere). People have generally remarked that this doesn't "read" like someone's first serial, but that can easily explained by experience both reading and (privately) writing. Between the CRJ/AW reveal and the EY hunt, I think we're all kinda primed to just assume "if it's good, it's gotta be written by someone we know" - maybe not the best mentality to have?

**** u/Noumero:
#+begin_quote
  this isn't some throwaway account
#+end_quote

Hm? "u/teddy_teddy_teddy" is a three-months-old account whose activity prior to /Game by God/'s start consisted of starting one thread on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]] and responding to two comments in it. Since then, it left replies in seven [[/r/parahuman][r/parahuman]] threads, wrote six snippets on [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]], and made one response to a [[/r/offmychest][r/offmychest]] thread. The rest of its activity is directly related to /Game by God/.

Unless I missed something, it's /very clearly/ a throwaway account.

--------------

Personally, I don't think teddy_teddy_teddy is Wildbow or Wales, because they're busy with /Ward/ and /WtC/ respectively (as well as for several other reasons). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6749809/Bavitz][Bavitz]] seems possible; the style is different and we've never seen "Bavitz" directly interact with the rationalsphere, but we've semi-frequently discussed his (?) works on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], he is known for employing pseudonyms, and the meta parts are something I could see him doing.

Mainly, I suspect Yudkowsky. This whole "untrustworthy author" shtick seems in-character for him, he isn't busy with anything else (except working on small-time stuff like the AI alignment problem), he has claimed to employ pseudonyms, and I don't see any concrete arguments /against/ this possibility sans those based on prior probabilities.

It's entirely possible, of course --- even /likely/ --- that "u/teddy_teddy_teddy" is a throwaway account of some other r/rationalist. I have several suspects, in fact.

***** I don't think it's EY. Teddy3 loves their mystery visual novels. I've never seen EY talk about any of them, and EY loves recommending stuff he likes.

Teddy also actively denied they were EY or AW when asked, which is something EY would also never do.

From several conversations, I think they're either actually new or someone who doesn't have much of an established fanbase here (could be one of the writing contest regulars I suppose). I know the serial writer backstory implies otherwise, but it's not a self insert and it's not like serial writers actually have panels at conventions, so it's not hugely realistic in the first place.

***** Should've added that I've seen them knocking about in the Parahumans Discord too, and I think in the comments of Ward (though I might be misremembering). I dunno, I'm just inclined to think they're a lurker, someone who's been aware enough of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but mostly participating in other stuff (say, Danganronpa-esque mysteries) - a reader who only felt the need to start joining discussions once they got thinking about writing a serial of their own. It's a bit of a trap to point at the story itself for evidence, but I think in "The Absurdist" By describes her own relationship with the community in those sorts of terms. So that's another layer to it.

I have no idea why people keep suspecting Yud for all of these stories. He has such a consistent style in all of his work and this story, like every other story written under a pseudonym suspected of being his bar hpmor, does not have a shred of it.

Even when Yud is trying to imitate someone else's style as in Trust in God or something it's still blatant.

I love Bavitz but it's clearly not them either.

**** Agreed especially on the last point, however considering the main character is specifically familiar with the experience of writing a serial it does seem to me to be evidence in favour of the author having written something else prior.

The account only talks in Parahumans and only posts their story here in [[/r/rational]] is the kind of half hearted cover up a throwaway attempt I'd expect from someone aware of crj.

But yeah I didn't go stalking the entire profile as I'm not that invested, just ideal speculation

***** The fact that By herself is a web serial writer is certainly relevant - I think one of the central questions of the story is whether not GBG is analogous to By's /Space Attorney/ (first web serial that garners a small following but ends poorly) or /Ionia of Illumination/ (more experienced work that ends well).

Honestly, that's why I'm invested in this thing. For most web fiction, the persona of the author itself and the way the story's written and released don't really factor into the story itself - but here, GBG-the-story, GBG-the-game and /Space Attorney/Ionia/ are kind of all one and the same.

Yeah, that URL is so god damn weird and I can't help but feel like it'll be relevant.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think it can go as far as to be abuse, sometimes. To take the opposite extreme example, the Nazi commenter who complains about a mixed race couple. Once they're told "thanks but fuck off with the racism" if they keep harping on the point I think I'd call that abuse.

By's definition of abuse is probably much more broad, she seems inclined to look at commenters in a very uncharitable way. Expecting anyone to stay completely objective about this sort of thing after years of solo moderating an active comments section might be unfair though.

Certainly don't think it's out of character for her just an interesting point.

Personally I don't think that's abuse still. If they get banned and they circumvent a ban to continue posting I would absolutely agree that that's abuse.

Certainly even if I was to say it was abuse it wouldn't be that the act of wanting something moved in a direction to fit your views is an abuse of the ability to comment or leave feedback but that repeatedly doing something when informed not to is more abusive of the system.
