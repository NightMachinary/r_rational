Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I need a sort of "offensiveness check".

I have a short story that's most of the way written which has, as the central premise, that in 1970 a pill was invented which changes homosexuals and bisexuals into heterosexuals. The story is then partly an alternate history of the gay rights movement and partly a meditation on personal identity, social pressure, and terminal/instrumental values.

Part of offensiveness is in terms of presentation, which I'm doing my best on. I'm more worried about the other half, which is things that I just don't understand as being offensive. And I don't really mind offending people, I just want to do it for the right reasons.

So is the counterfactual premise of there being a way to no longer be gay irredeemably offensive? Is the idea that some people would choose to be straight and others would choose to be gay offensive?

*** Not inherently offensive, but LGBT people often have to deal with people saying that it's a choice, so it's stepping on some toes. People who have traits that are not chosen by them and of which they are also proud don't like the suggestion that it might be a choice. Although your story is fictional and in fact is exploring a /different/ world where it is a choice, it may step on toes.

It's all in the execution. Done well, it would not be offensive. It could in fact be really well-received, if for no other reason than that it shows that the world would be really different if sexuality was truly a choice. Done poorly, it would be in bad taste.

For example, if you wrote a story in which people could change their physical sex with a pill, and the entire story was how awful it was to use this pill and how people should keep their birth sex or else it's unnatural, you should expect to get some flak. However, a thoughtful meditation on the nature of sex, gender, and socialization would be great. Done well, I don't expect you'll see problems.

Other way around, I'd think. If you write a story with a pill that changes someone's gender and you include a strong emphasis on dysphoria and the unnaturalness of feeling like the opposite gender, then you're showing the everyday experience of the non-transitioned transgendered. But if you make a story where changing gender is great, fun, and done casually with no consequence, you're undermining that experience. (When I went to Gencon there was a panel with Ed Greenwood where he explained that gender swapping items and magic had been mostly removed from D&D because they mostly just served to trivialize or make light of the issue.)

***** I find myself curious about whether it's possible for us to meaningfully predict whether the dysphoria is inherent, or whether it's tied to the current effective-irreversability. I've heard one (body-uncomfortable) person express the intention to do self-violence to physically address the issue, and another body-comfortalble) person express unhesitating interest and curiosity at the prospect of trying a body of the opposite sex.

--To compare it to a less/poignant example, I find myself (baselessly) wondering if it's like hair. If you have long beautiful hair that you spent six years of care and maintenance to grow out (and preferred it to having short hair), and then one day someone cut it off while you were asleep, you would feel as though you had been stabbed, and be deeply upset about it until you had finally returned to your previous state. If you had remote control that could change your hair length at any time, though, then you might go for months at a time with short hair without discomfort, the preference for long hair temporarily outweighed by the change of scene feeling, the way you could otherwise casually have a ponytail every so often even if you normally preferred having braids (and would be upset if you weren't allowed to have braids).

--Hmm, I ended up imagining a story which starts out with everyone changing to a different novelty body every week/month/year or so, then after a maintenance sabotage (or evacuation requirement to a different planet, or anything preventing foreseeable future use of that technology) people starting to feel discomfort and creeping horror (and presumably regret) at the thought of being stuck in their current bodies for the rest of their lives.

Now then, what might happen to a society when all or the majority of participants feels that way..? (I'm put in mind--though not directly relevant--of a story idea of a cloning machine accident, a city ending up entirely filled with clones of the same person. Some keep trying to act the same way as before the accident, some form small groups with polarised behaviours, each acting as a single 'person' with each body taking the role of a mental aspect, and some polarising into the same aspects but instead forming organisations filled with other clones following that aspect. (The climax is when the organisations get swiped out from under their anti-government leaders by clones who have borrowed the governments' resources to become even more compelling representations of those aspects than the leaders who set the organisations up.))

#+end_quote

A way to no longer be gay? Maybe not. A pill that medically "fixes" gayness, even in bisexuals? In the vast majority of ways it would be presented, probably. It's taking as its basic assumption that homosexuality is something that is "medically curable," ie, defective, abnormal, unhealthy, etc, even if you don't intend it that way. This plays way too much into the narrative of the anti-LGBTQ community to not press many people's anger buttons, to the point that any nuance might be lost, or never even given a chance to be seen.

My suggestion would be to have the pill either flip one's sexuality, or make anyone who takes it bisexual so they can "live straight." This still allows all the moral arguments about sexual identity and social pressure and so on, but also allows you to widen the scope of the argument a bit toward people who maybe want the pill for reasons other than to "renounce gayness."

Or would that change things too much from what you envision?

  The DSMV, at one point in time, did in fact list homosexuality.
#+end_quote

The DSM did indeed list it as a disorder, way back before 1973. It was removed from the DSM-II, though some form of it remained for another version or two. Today it's widely understood as the outdated perspectives of the past affecting clinical perspectives: whether people consider it a disorder is not the same thing as it being one.

#+begin_quote
  this doesn't make them unhealthy or defective.
#+end_quote

By whose justification? Certainly not mine, and probably not yours, but the question is about common perceptions.

By most accounts, the modern, Western argument for removing foreskins is a medical one. The data doesn't support the perspective, as far as I'm aware, and the religious or Puritanical roots of the practice aren't often brought up, but if you actually ask people, it very much is considered by circumcision advocates as a positive health decision.

Even putting that aside however, the problem with comparing things like foreskin and small breasts with homosexuality as a "socially created condition" however is that they're not nearly as tied with identity and agency, and not nearly as politicized.

...WRT my examples of medically alterable human features... I was just saying: "look, just because there's a legal surgery for it..."

Further, I suppose you are right - if you use those as writing prompts, you don't get forms which you can use to present the ungaying pill in an inoffensive way.

It's more that the definition, and interpretation, of a psychological disorder has changed:

“A mental disorder is a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a *significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.*”

That last part is important, as it offers an objective metric by which to judge the difference between someone who likes to wear a wolf costume for, say, sexual adventure, and someone who likes to wear a wolf costume to roam in the wilderness and live with wolves. The former is a kink, the latter might point toward a mental disorder.

One can argue that being homosexual in a culture where homosexuals are jailed or stoned to death might constitute a "significantly increased disk of suffering death, pain, etc," but that's obviously the result of their surroundings. By most metrics the definition simply does not apply to those in the Western world.

Some in the community feel that it is a form of genocide, wiping our their culture because "normal" folks consider them impaired, while others consider it a godsend.

I think the only way such a story would be(come) offensive just with this is if the story's narrative was making it so. For instance, if a premise like this was used to tell:

- how of course /all/ gay people would decide to change their preferences if given the valid chance, or
- how the only people who refused to take the pill were also mentally ill, or
- that the majority of gays took the pill and now the population in general had the right to ignore the rights of the rest or to re-evaluate them as being mentally ill, etc.

You can't do that as you can't be non-offending in general --- it's like rule 34, there will always be someone offended by it, no matter what “is” is.

Regarding the offensiveness of modification of traits that define a person's self-identiy: if we use an analogy for this, then the answer comes as obviously negative as well. Is a premise of people changing their gender (species, from organic to inorganic or synthetic, etc) offensive by itself?

Like, that's funny, but there's literally no drawback to having the ability to turn things to ice, and there's also no reason that you ever have to reveal it to the public if you don't want to. And some of the powers /suck/ so it makes a lot of sense that they would want to not be a mutant anymore.

Further, it never really made sense to me that the United States government declared a war on mutants rather than just bringing them into the fold with heavy incentives. Given the expansiveness of comics, I'm sure it's been done at some point, but come on ... why in the world would the government see someone like Multiple Man as something other than an asset? Just pay the man! (This annoys me even more when the X-men exist in the same universe as the Avengers.)

The fictional history of the Weapon X program changes a lot and it's gone through a lot of iterations, but they do lots and lots of clandestine work that's probably based on real work done by the United States like MKUltra. Mind control, brainwashing, etc. They also engage in trying to create their own mutants, or stealing the power of the mutants they find.

And that's all fairly believable; rogue military agency doing its own thing without oversight happens all the time. But what puzzles me is that the /other/ parts of the government, which in most continuities know about mutants (since mutants are apparently feared and hated all around the world) aren't trying to scoop them up. Or corporations, for that matter. Most mutants have huge practical, mundane applications for their power, above and beyond their combat abilities (if any). But it's only the clandestine, shadowy, military organization that pursues them, and then not through the conventional means of just paying them money or getting them whatever legal or personal help they need.

****** It doesn't make people more or less masculine/feminine, it only changes sexual orientation. So if you're an effeminate gay man prior to taking the pill, you'd be an effeminate straight man afterward, and if you're a masculine gay man you'll end up as a masculine straight man.

As for hormone therapy ... it's tough, because we don't /actually/ know what causes sexual orientation or how it might be medically altered, which is part of why the story is just going to leave the mechanism blank. There are some scattered reports of people changing sexual orientation during transition already, but so far as I'm concerned the actual science is thin on the ground (there are some contested papers on the matter, I believe). It's not going to feature in the story at all and the question will be left as an exercise for the reader.

Not just because of the reduced stigma but probably partly as a result of the struggle of activists before me. I also think you should make sure you include or allude to figures like Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera and Storme DeLarverie, because they are often conspicuously absent from modern LGBT narratives set in the 70s.

I usually split words like "offensive" (and "annoying", "attractive," "compelling", "provocative" etc.) into a few pieces when thinking about them. It doesn't describe what the word itself /truly/ means, but that's not the part of the language that I have problems with.

1. Would this offend me, personally?
2. Would this offend the audience/bystanders?
3. Would this offend people who would /not/ see it, if they actually did see it?
4. Does this match a culture's standards for "what is offensive", regardless of the answers to 1, 2, and 3?

#1 is pretty much a moot point here, but it acts as a proxy for #2 since we are likely to be part of the audience.

#2 is probably what people care about the most, as offending people unnecessarily is bad, and the audience is a large number of people.

#3 is a safety check, in case you're wrong about who will see the content. One non-audience-member is less important than one audience member, but there are millions of them.

#4 is a bit odd, but it still affects people's behaviors. I know that I avoid things that unnecessarily break my cultural standards for "offensiveness" even if I'm not offended by it, and I assume that other people do too.

That's too much work for too little gain IMO. Keeping it as one homogeneous group of "people" is too imprecise, I couldn't think of a way to make three or more useful and well-defined groups, and a continuous function based on the probability that they will see it is too much work.

  Even if reading something offensive to others brings vast swaths of personal utility to yourself, you still avoid it simply because it is offensive to others?
#+end_quote

"Avoid" was too strong of a word. It's a negative trait, but that's not enough to categorically reject something.

Also keep in mind that this breakdown applies to more words than just "offensive", and that the relative values of the points can change as a result of that. For example: I'm having a conversation with another person and I want to know whether or not it's "engaging". I would care about myself and the other person a lot, the bystanders a little bit, and basically ignore the wider population and cultural standards.

I've mostly interacted with you fine gentlemen/ladies/undefined starfish aliens here. What I want to know is, how reliable is said wiki?

Context for this: A friend of mine who's more spiritually and new age minded than I, posted a link to a video by a Leonard Coldwell, which claimed that every (yes, EVERY) cancer could be cured in 2-16 weeks or even less. I looked up the guy and found him on the rational wiki, being torn down as a fraud and whatnot. I'm just curious as to how accurate this is, as I don't have the time (or emotional investment) into doing a proper investigation of investigating someone that perpetrates, or is purported to perpetrate, scams successfully.

******* First of all, it can certainly be "unfair" to cite facts, when they're a carefully selected choice of facts, deliberately designed to give an unfair impression, expressed in the worst tone and manner possible, so as to bias you.

E.g. if someone asks you "Who was Martin Luther King, Jr?" and you respond "Some convicted criminal", that would be hilariously unfair to Martin Luther King, even though it's citing the fact that he was convicted by an Alabama court because of the bus boycott.

Secondly, rationalwiki to my experience doesn't give a damn about facts, except when convenient. Specific wrongful facts in their 'LessWrong' article that I pointed out in their discussion page were left uncorrected for months, and all I received was scorn for defending their target of choice - nobody argued that I was /wrong/ or that the article was right, they just didn't give a frigging damn.

Rationalwikers don't care about /informing/ the readers, their purpose is to bias them instead. They'll do that with tone and with scorn and with the occasional fact, yes. (Of course this may be my bias talking. I guess it may be that they're horribly unfair only in regards to the issues that /I/ know about, and they're absolutely fine on all the rest.)

EDIT: And even in the example you gave if you read carefully you'll see that my core objection (that utilitarianism isn't relevant to the article) was not addressed, and the person who responded was engaging in a different discussion (as I mention in the comment there "I'm discussing the article and its validity, and you're discussing decision theory. We two are in two different discussions"). As a result the Utilitarianism section in that page still remains a complete mess, and is still utterly irrelevant in its context. The only point of that section was to drag as many unrelated ideas into that mix and mock them all. What does 'utilitarianism' or 'shut up and multiply' or 'dust specks vs torture' have to do with Roko's basilisk? Nothing at all but by golly if we pretend they do then we can tarnish them by association, and thus bias readers against those ideas too.

If you figure out that the whole point of Rationalwiki is to bias readers in their preferred direction rather than unbias them, then their writing style and editorial choices all make sense.

It's about the way you cite said facts. Look at any standard, wikipedia page. Even though pretty much everyone can agree that Adolf Hitler was an asshole, you're never going to see "Adolf Hitler was an asshole" written there. Wiki pages are supposed to be about giving impartial, unbiased information on the topic in question. Which isn't really something that particular page does. While it isn't as overt as you might expect, there's still a clear opinion presented on E.Y and his work by the article itself.

By having the article sarcastically say that "no one else had previously noticed" this problem, it conveniently omits the famous and intelligent people that noticed the problem and agreed the problem exists when it was brought to their attention... and thus transforms what ought have been a compliment (Eliezer Yudkowsky helped bring an actual problem to attention) into an insult (Eliezer Yudkowsky is imagining non-existing problems)

Not correct. Wikipedia aims to provide impartial and unbiased information but other wikis are not required to share those policies, some wikis such as Conservapedia and Uncyclopedia deliberately provide biased information.

From what I can tell rationalwiki doesn't have a policy of being respectful for those it talks about. The sarcastic humour and snark mocking the cranks and pseudoscience in its articles is probably both deliberate and a significant attraction for it's readers.

I have next to zero experience with main-series /Dynasty Warriors/ games, but I /think/ that the /DWG/ series (except, glaringly, /DWG1/) has one very major additional mechanic that makes it better than the main series: the ability to use dash combos infinitely until your boost meter is depleted and must be recharged (or until the ace manages to boost out of your combo). The lack of this (in addition to nigh-impossible one-on-one ace fights) is what really made /DWG1/ annoying, in comparison with the other /DWG/ games:\\
- Mash =square= and =triangle=, killing all the grunts around you with a massive combo\\
- Stop mashing =square= and =triangle=, and wait for your mobile suit to stop swinging its weapon\\
- Hit =cross= to boost to the next group of grunts\\
- Repeat\\
While, in /DWG2/3/3.5/, it's like this:\\
- Mash =square= and =triangle=, killing all the grunts around you with a massive combo\\
- Hit =cross= and =square= to Dash Attack to/through the next group of grunts\\
- Hit =cross= to stop the dash combo with an Emergency Dash--or just keep hitting =cross=/=square=/=triangle= to continue the dash combo\\

** *No knowledge of Log Horizon is required to respond to this post.*

I'm in the process of writing a Log Horizon fanfic, the basic premise being that the akihabara adventurers figure out a difficult, but feasible way to cross back to the real world.

Seeing as I'm heavily limiting how often people can cross, I don't need to deal with the full scale of the social fallout. Still, people are going to react to people who vanished from their homes while playing an MMO suddenly returning with functional immortality and fantastic magical powers (not to mention the whole different-species thing.)

So to pose my question, how would /you/ act in that scenario?

- craftable (or easily accessible) reusable magic items
- imported (or rare) reusable magic items
- common single-use magic items
- character abilities
- rare single-use magic items

For each of those sets of magic sources, I'd look for the following effects:

- magical healing and resurrection (preferably of more than just combat wounds)
- teleportation and other travel spells (preferably safe)
- scrying and other information spells
- infinite energy sources (preferably with high power/weight ratios)

*** Upvoted for Crime and Commitment. Just read up to the most recent chapter and really enjoyed it. It starts out looking like a stomp fic but then escalates and enters the cycle of cliffhangers and daring plans that dominates Worm. Also, an awesome villain that has a power that seems like a joke but can take on heavy-hitters.

Would recommend Spiral Path also, though with the warning that it is a heavily sexualised story. I've been waiting for it to get completed for ages now because I don't like reading writings in process.

  - Manager (Worm; 219k words, ongoing): Taylor can mix-and-match powers between people--including herself. (Less interesting than I remembered it from my first reading...)
#+end_quote

I tried this way back when and never got to the end (and it has since grown immeasurably). The author had let exponentials write him into a corner.

- The Worm-verse has a shitload of powers, and a shitload of people.
- In a given person, each combination of powers produces a different result.
- Any given combination of powers produces a different result depending on who is carrying it.

And all these things were really cool when Taylor and Tattertale were playing around with 3 or so powers... But as Taylor stole more and more powers, and met more and more allies, the number of possible combinations went through the roof. I'm only willing to read so many pages of people being granted different powers and showing off new effects.

Also, in my headcannon the change in Lung's shard makes no sense. He has always been Escalation as far as I know, not Dragon. The dragon form was a secondary characteristic of the main power.

** I had this idea for a setting or overarching theme for a story. However as it's very unlikely I'll ever write it myself, here it is for you to dissect:

As we know (I think), a sufficiently advanced civilization could create sentient lifeforms similar to us as in terms of mental aptitude. Be it as simulations or actual lifeforms, doesn't really matter.

So the protagonist of the story lives in a world where gods exist mainly in the myths of their people, but suddenly there's hint of the existence of gods, maybe through the discovery of magic or bugs in the laws of nature or whatnot.

A lot of stuff happens and in the end the protagonist is having a chat with (one of) the gods and demands an explanation as to why they would create lifeforms and then leave in all this suffering and inefficient design.

Answer: Creating worlds where lifeforms just barely passing for sentient develop "naturally", is pretty much the extent of the power of the gods. The gods themselves cannot reproduce except by cloning, which, on a cosmic scale, is a really bad idea. So creating lifeforms, which develop into a higher civilization, which spawns new gods, is their way of reproduction with variety.

In case of simulated worlds, the resulting new god would probably need to be lifted into the next-higher tier of reality to avoid a Matrioshka effect where the simulation necessarily needs to be smaller in overall processing power, but that's details for the gods to worry about.
