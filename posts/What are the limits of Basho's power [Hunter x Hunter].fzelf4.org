[[https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Basho][Basho's nen power is based around him writing haikus,]] for those who don't remember. I'm interested in him because his nen ability is either the most overpowered in the series, or it's so underpowered I'm amazed he ever passed the Hunter exam.

Since there's no limit to what he can write about, he could make almost anything happen if his will is strong enough (whatever that means). For example:

#+begin_quote
  Stuck at home all day

  Outside: disease, sickness, death.

  COVID, go away!
#+end_quote

Or, you know, something better, but you get the idea. There's almost no theoretical limit to what his power might achieve. On the other hand, his team is faced with all sorts of problems in the York New arc, and he only uses his power twice: once as a demonstration (when he burned a chair) and once to compel Kurapika and the other potential bodyguards to tell the truth, and in that case the threat of the power was enough, the power wasn't ever activated. So why doesn't he use his ability more?

For example, when Neon went missing right before she met Chrollo, I feel like Basho could have written

#+begin_quote
  The shopping mall is

  crowded. People everywhere.

  Where did Neon go?
#+end_quote

It probably wouldn't tell him exactly where she is, unless he was seriously invested in finding out, but surely he was invested enough for it to give him the general direction to search or something?

His nen type is unknown, so that's something we can speculate about. According to Hunterpedia, the "battle collection" (I don't know what that is but I think it's non-canon?) has him as a Conjurer. It also makes an allusion to a fantheory that he can only conjure fire, but that theory is based on a sample size of one so I don't put much stock in it. That's probably the lower bound for how limited his power could possibly be.


** I'm a big HxH fan, and I think Occam's razor is in play here. There might be contrived reasons why Basho's power wasn't used more, but the most likely reason is because it isn't that versatile- he uses it on two occasions, and on both occasions he uses it to summon fire. If you hear hoofbeats, look for a horse, not a zebra- he was a bodyguard of mild standing with the ability to summon flames, manifesting them using written triggers.

His interactions with other characters show he doesn't think himself that strong, so attributing a highly powerful and versatile ability that he never demonstrated seems like a stretch. Most likely, he passed the Hunter exam with his good physicals and instincts, but was not a standout and did not awaken a particularly groundbreaking nen ability.

*** Yeah. Tangentially, one of the (few) things I dislike about HxH is how most Hunters turn out to be weak and fairly useless.

**** That's because they scale it so that each order of magnitude higher percentile you are, you gain an order of magnitude more power.

Contrast with reality, where higher orders of magnitude higher percentile ability result in ever diminishing increases in ability, and maybe you'll see the appeal.

** It's probably not that powerful. Remember that Nen Abilities are never that broad. Basho is apparently stated to be a "Conjurer" in HxH's fighting game. Since both uses of his power involve bringing fire from a poem, you might presume that his actual power is to to create items or displays of energy as described by a haiku. He definately doesn't seem to have the personality traits of a Specialist, but shows the traits of a Conjurer or Enhancer.

The part about whatever he brings being weakened if the poem is bad is presumably just that "unknown psychological component" mentioned by Biscuit. You might see him as a more limited Green Lantern actually if he is limited by Will, because in addition to having the will he also needs to make a good poem about it.

As for your examples. Well, the first might work on himself, assuming he can Enhance his own immune system. Or create a drug that does something similar to anyone it is injected to. But the latter was always impossible. Divination like that seems to be limited to Specialists

** You seem to be misunderstanding how Nen works, on a pretty fundamental level.

Nen powers get more powerful the more restricted they are. If you have a power to summon fire, that will be weaker then a power that can only summon fire on Saturdays, which would be weaker than a power that can only summon fire on Saturdays which can only hurt people named Bob.

For a practical example, take Gon's rock. Pouring a bunch of energy into a fist and then attacking with it is basic Nen stuff, anybody practiced enough could do the same basic thing. In principle, you can get identical results through using Enhancement - you'd just have to be skilled enough to make up a deficit. This applies to all Nen types. Anything a Conjurer can make could be made by conjuration. But if you're not using a technique, with restrictions and which suits your personality, it'll be far harder to do so.

Could Basho write those haikus? Probably, yeah. But because his power is so wide in scope, he won't get much of a boost in actually making those things happen. He would, for the most part, be a Conjurer or whatever else making those things happen through Nen normally, without any sort of technique. It's doubtful he could get much of a result out of any of them, if any at all.

With Nen you can get power with either effort and talent, or restrictions. If Basho has an unrestricted ability, and he hasn't put an insane amount of effort into it, and he isn't crazy talented, he can't be that powerful. There aren't any loopholes.
