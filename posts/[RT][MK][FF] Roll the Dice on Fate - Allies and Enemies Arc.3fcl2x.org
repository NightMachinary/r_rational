** I figured I'd only link this whenever I finish an arc. If I popped it up every time I wrote a new chapter, I'd be spamming the front page every day due to their small size.

Also available on [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/roll-the-dice-on-fate-naruto-si.348922/][SB]] for those who like to discuss the possible series of events that caused the Elemental nations to end up with working throat mikes and radios but using horses and carts for transport (our most recent topic).
