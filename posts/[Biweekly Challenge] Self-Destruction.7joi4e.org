This time, we will be doing ultra winner [[/u/vi_fi]]'s choice, *Self-Destruction*.

"The theme I would like to see [[/r/rational][r/rational]] work on is Self-Destruction. At first glance, this prompt can be understood in two ways. On one hand, it can be about the self-destruction of a character. The first question that comes to mind is whether self-destruction can be a rational course of action. On the other hand, it's also possible to understand the prompt to be about the trope of the Self-Destruct Mechanism. In that case, a driving question might be why (and how) a rational supervillain might implement the self-destruction of their doomsday device. Of course, these ideas are meant to inspire, not to limit ;)"

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, December 27th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]).

Next time, the challenge will be *Forbidden Research*. There are very few areas of research that people are expressly forbidden from pursuing, but they do exist, whether for moral, ethical, political, or practical reasons. This prompt shouldn't be taken to be /just/ "Things Man Was Not Meant to Know", though that's the obvious avenue for it; some things are dangerous, unorthodox, or simply tied up in political red tape. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 12/27.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7jp0kv/challenge_companion_selfdestruction/][can be found here]].

*** Nicely done. I'm a bit disappointed [[/sno%20one%20brought%20up%20recycling%20the%20least%20necessary%20person%20on%20the%20ship,%20e.g%20an%20elderly%20person%20who's%20not%20contributing%20anything%20even%20if%20they're%20not%20willing,%20and%20doing%20some%20other%20punishment%20for%20the%20couple%20to%20discourage%20future%20unauthorized%20baby%20making.][spoiler]]

**** Thanks! There's a million things no one brought up, I had to choose what would make a decent story.

(Actually, I just put the first things that came to mind. I wasn't trying to be as rational as possible, the purpose of the story is to imagine circumstances in which people behave relatively rationally but there's still the set-up for a YA dystopian, hence the typical dystopian elements like birth control, central planning etc. except here they're actually necessary and going against them kills everyone).
