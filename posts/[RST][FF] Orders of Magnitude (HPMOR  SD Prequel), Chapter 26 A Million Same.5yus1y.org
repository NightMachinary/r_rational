** I tried reading this a while back, got confused right away. Can someone explain to me what's going on in the prologue and first chapter or two?

*** It's a prequel to a sequel to a fanfic (a shadow of a shadow of a shadow distilled down through /four/ authors now). I think if it can't stand on its own two legs, you can just move on.

**** I think that's a fair critique: it's very reliant on the reader's familiarity with the extended HPMOR-verse. (Even though it's explicitly a SIgnificant Digits prequel, it references some of the other major HPMOR-sequels)

*** The prologue is basically the setup for a giant causal loop that was responsible for the Atlantis disaster.

The fake-prologue is an exploration of what might have happened in an alternate universe if Voldemort had won.

Chapter 1 and 2 explore the Atlantis disaster and those who survived it.

*** Yeah I can't even understand half the sentences in this story. Any idea what happened this chapter? seems Perenelle fought Baba Yaga and won somehow, then went to see cadmus?

**** From Perenelle's perspective, in chronological order: She experiments with the stone a bit to find more about its properties. Realizes Cadmus is still alive and has the Elder Wand, goes to him and ambushes him, taking the Wand. The wand then suggests to her how she could defeat Baba Yaga, and so she goes to Hogwarts.

From the perspective of Ignotus' ghost, he's watching Nell's fight with Baba Yaga at the same time as her fight with Hermione a few centuries later.
