** Also, testing out a new host for the podcast, so let me know if there are any problems with it!

*** The new host is good. My only issue is a pet peeve that there doesn't seem to be a convenient way to adjust the volume in the page. I managed to figure it out thought, so no worries (I opened the dev console and through the network tab found [[https://anchor.fm/api/v3/episodes/e2v3pv][this]] JSON file which has two audio sources [[https://d3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net/production/2019-0-10/8156044-44100-2-8c14cf2bbf57.m4a][this one]], which I imagine is where the ads/sponsorship section is kept, and [[https://d3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net/production/2019-0-16/8413156-44100-2-4805d198cb0c2.m4a][this one]] where the rest of the podcast is, which also explains why the players says 50:06/49:20 at the end of the episode).

I think the new host is definitely worth it, and good episode too!

***** I have way too many website pet peeves so over the years I +have developed a completely useless skill+ have become adept at this stuff from all that +time I've wasted out of sheer pettiness+ experience and wisdom I have accumulated. So it didn't take long (maybe two minutes).

**** No, too time consuming to make. Hopefully transcription software may soon get to the point though where it will be easy to get them for each episode.
