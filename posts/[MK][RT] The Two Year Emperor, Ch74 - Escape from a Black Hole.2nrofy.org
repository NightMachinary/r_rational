**** As time approaches infinity, the probability that somebody will have discovered a way to (possibly accidentally) destroy the Prime Material plane approaches 1.

The method that pops into mind requires a couple epic levels, but I recall finding a way to throw the Elemental Plane of Earth, and a Hulking Hurler does 1d6 damage per 200 pounds of thrown object, so that'd probably do it.

***** Not necessarily. Lets take an 'event' to mean the evolution of one state of the universe to another state by way of the laws of physics.

The number of possible states of an infinite universe is at most countably infinite. This is because space is discrete, any finite region of space can only have a finite number of states, and any sum of discrete items is at most countable.

Also, it is possible (albeit /incredibly unlikely/) for the entire universe to spontaneously tunnel into another state.

Thus, the number of possible events in the universe can be viewed as the number of functions mapping one element of {N} to another element of {N}. This is an uncountable set, and so the number of possible events in the universe is also uncountable.

This means that even given an infinite amount of time, you cannot say that any arbitrary event will occur with probability approaching 1, or else EVERY event would have to occur with probability 1, and there simply just isn't enough time for that to happen.

Edit: Unless you assume a universe with finite volume. Then there are only a finite number of states, and then /every possible event/ would occur /infinitely many/ times. That's just weird to think about.

****** Well, that's impressive.

I was specifically thinking about laws of physics as buggy as D&D, with sentient beings around to fiddle with them, though. I suppose I should say "the chances the universe ends up in a state that nobody can do anything about (for instance, because the universe is empty) approaches 1."

Though with the quantum tunneling there's always a chance it'll revert to some other state, so I guess it doesn't actually approach 1.

*** I don't think we can answer that with presently known physics. Any case where the Schwarzschild radius expands faster than the speed of light - where particles can go from "outside a black hole" to "should already be inside a black hole" instantaneously at least doesn't conform to normal behavior around a black hole, so I'm not sure if simultaneity is well-defined in this case, rather than producing the answer "Neklos is in the infinitely far future".

Because of that, I'm also unsure how much subjective time passes for Neklos before the decay of the black hole, if it ever would: normally, objects never seem to pass the horizon from the outside, so the black hole decays before they appear to fall in, and since everyone has to agree on observations, the black hole decays before you fall in, but with Neklos he just discontinuously ends up inside a black hole.

** What's the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation][gravitational time dilation]] factor?

Let's assume he sat around inside the black hole for a few minutes (from his perspective). Let's assume he was around ten meters away. We know that it's ten billion solar masses.

The equation I found on the internet breaks down inside of the Swartzchild radius (i.e. the event horizon). The logic is that if you measure the amount of time it appears to take for somebody to fall into a black hole, it take an infinite amount of time, because the photons heading in your direction are going slower and slower as they get closer to the black hole.

I wonder if any of Death's followers tried to teleport into the room to save him. Where is this room, anyhow? Not on the Material Plane, I hope.

*** [time dilation]

I am treating the area inside the event horizon as also having infinite time dilation. From the outside universe reference frame, Neklos is stuck inside a Temporal Stasis (except not magical). From his own perspective he was only in there for one round -- 6 seconds. When the black hole finished evaporating the time dilation fell apart and he returned to find a universe where all the protons had decayed into nothing.

Nope. Extradimensional space (aka demiplane) that Afi had created.

********* PAO can only affect nonmagical inanimate objects of up to 100 cubic feet per level - or one creature. By eaglejarl's reading of the rules, this is a limit on the size of the object's original form, not what it turns into.

And PAO is temporary, too. It is permanent if the transformation is relatively simple (there's a definition of this in the SRD), and apparently casting it twice makes it permanent (temporarily polymorph A into B, then permanently polymorph B into B). But again, this only works if B is small enough to be a target of PAO.
