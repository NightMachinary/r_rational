** So I have a bunch of pokemon nuzlocke comics. Among the best is definitely [[http://wasserbienchen.deviantart.com/art/IBAW-1-New-Beginnings-242570288][In Black and White]]. Another really good one is [[http://itsahardlife.smackjeeves.com/comics/2357688/chapter-12-page-68/][It's a Hard Life]]

For those not familiar, a nuzlock run is a playthrough where pokemon die instead of faint, and you can only catch one pokemon per route. What makes these two comics special is that they diverge significantly from the game storylines; they definitely take inspiration at some point, but they're functionally independent.

Unfortunately, I can't really give elevator pitches for fear of spoilers, but suffice to say, if you ever found yourself wishing pokemon was aimed towards the YA to late twenties population, you'll love these comics.

*** A very interesting part of the nature of Nuzlocke comics are that they're always based on a real playthrough of the author (at least, I haven't encountered a Nuzlocke that /wasn't/). Because of this, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie][Anyone Can Die]] is in full effect, as the author's successes and failures in the game can kill off even the most important or beloved of teammates from something as trivial as a random trainer who got a critical hit or had an unexpected super effective attack.

This is a blessing and a curse, though, since while the way no Pokemon is safe provides real tension and uncertainty in the fates of the characters, many authors write their stories as they play through their game, stopping after a major event to write an update covering that event. As a result, these deaths can often feel abrupt and unsatisfying. If your starter died to an unlucky crit in the middle of a route, and your last update described the route as peaceful and idyllic, it'd be really hard to give your starter the death scene it deserves without it feeling forced.

Were I of the mind and talent to make a comic of the Platinum Nuzlocke I once did, it would do my story a world of good to know that the lowly Gastrodon I caught would last to the end of the game, as well as be the only reason I even survived a devastating boss fight that killed most of the rest of my team, since I could give it a proper underdog storyline. At the same time, if I knew that Candice fight was going to be so devastating, I could make the updates before the fight build up to the fight appropriately, whether by wearing the team down or by raising them up to contrast the fall. If I knew my Sneasel was going to die in the very same room I'd find the item that'd let it evolve, I could fit in a scene about that evolution item and its importance to a Sneasel, or some other such scene as the context would permit.

This challenge in writing is something you'll see many Nuzlocke authors grapple, since the deaths are as shocking and abrupt to them as they are to you. They can even spend the majority of their journey building up a great plot only for a pivotal character to die, leaving the author to make that death fit into the plot and make the plot to continue anew. In spite of that challenge, though, and often because of it, the stories can carry that element of tension and uncertainty all the better.

** [[http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Bakemono-no-Ko-Dub][The Boy and The Beast]] is a anime film released last year that I'm proud to count as one of the few movies I've loved after watching. It comes from the same director who gave us Summer Wars and Wolf Children, and has similarly amazing animation. It's about a boy who runs away from home and arrives in a world of anthropomorphic animals where he becomes an apprentice to a swordsman/martial artist with an extremely rough personality and demeanor that nobody likes.

It sounds straightforward, and it is, but I normally don't enjoy stories like these. Something about these two and their relationship made me fall in love with them despite the fact that I normally write characters like them off as assholes who refuse to communicate properly. Here, though, it somehow really works and seeing them learn and grow together over the course of the movie was a joy to behold. Even the conflict that drives them apart later in the film feels completely natural as does how they resolve it. The plot doesn't break any new ground, but even though I knew exactly what was going to happen next I still wanted to see it and loved what I saw.

Even the genuine flaws the film has don't bother me in the least. The threat in the climax isn't properly built up (and even then I saw the reveal coming from miles away) and the final act has pacing issues, but I didn't even notice and still don't care. There's a female character who is arguably shoehorned into the story halfway through, but I really liked her even though she didn't do that much. The few supernatural elements of the world aren't well explained, but they worked so well as emotional metaphors that I didn't mind.

Also, I'm talking about the dubbed version. The voice acting is fantastic and perfectly fits the characters and scenes. This is Ghibli-level production values, with beautiful colors and expressive characters. There's even an interesting twist in the story I haven't seen in any other of this type that won't spoil, though will undoubtedly appeal to fans of rational fiction. Even if you don't like the movie as much as I did, it's well worth your time to watch and your children's too. If I haven't persuaded you, watch [[https://youtu.be/_DEH6vuJ7FM][this 5-min review that sold me on it.]]

** I've been reading Floating Point by Stephan Gagne which can be found at [[http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint]]

I'm not sure if it meets all the criteria for rational fiction but it seams fairly rational to me.

It's a story about a civilization of emergent AIs in the computer of a space satelite, with parellels to internet culture. The main characters are programs, the descendants of apps, and it starts out with Spark and Tracer Winder trying to find the killer of their childhood teacher/mentor. Then it picks up from there.

It has just updated recently and is up to the third book in the trilogy. I like the justification for the programs resembling 21st century humans, especially why knives and weapons work the way they do in reality (they use the physics collision software to target the program's data in memory and kill/erase them.)

In short, It's story follows humanist principles more as it goes along and the characters seem rational while most of the story takes place in a computer simulation. I like it.

** I've been reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.3604/][A Cloudy Path]], which is a Worm fic based on a kind of similar premise to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/playing-with-legos-worm-supcom.377328/][Playing with Legos]] which has been recommended here before, where Taylor is given Tinker powers based on one of the factions in Supreme Commander.

I haven't actually played Supreme Commander, but it was interesting to see the different directions they took based on the same concept. In ACP, the protagonist uses something called nano-paste, which seems to be their main bottleneck for production. I'm not sure I'd call it rational, since she seems to spend her paste on stuff other than power generators and better nano-forges way too much, given how much she complains about not having enough.

I'm also not sure I like ACP quite as much as PWL, since it is slower paced and has more angst, but I did enjoy some of the development of various side characters such as Uber and Theo. It is a WIP and I am only a bit over halfway through so far. Anyway, I though people here would probably enjoy it.

Anyone have other wormfic recommendations, especially ones about tinkers bootstrapping their way to power with self replicating machinery?

The author's addressed this several times in the thread. I don't have time to find the actual post right now, but I remember him likening it to the actual game, where if you spent all your production time on getting better production equipment, you'd be killed by the very first wave of enemies.

That probably wasn't the entirety of his reasoning, but I remember finding it convincing at the time.

As for tinkerfic recommendations, it's /possible/ that [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/foundations-worm.474787/][Foundations]] will take a turn into that general category, though the author seems to keep their fics relatively short. Beyond that, I'm not aware of anything major outside of ACP and PWL.

**** The actual answer is more simple than this: even if she had put /everything/ into upgrading her production, in the end it would have only made a very small difference in how fast her production rate ramps up.

You can see this in-story with numbers she quotes from time to time (production rate vs cost of her weapons/armor vs cost of more power/forges), and a few author's notes where he's explicitly used the in-story numbers to show this. In general, the equipment she makes is so much lighter than the cost of upgrading her production that it only makes a small dent in her ramp-up speed, and she /still/ is quite sparing in how she uses her nano-paste. Her equipment seems like very reasonable decisions to me.

***** I guess it just seems weird to me that she could make extremely powerful stuff like the sonic gun and bulletproof shield early on, but months later (when she's running the shelter and so forth), she still has to loan out her old non-thrusting hover pack, and most of her inner circle doesn't have their own shields. The exponential growth factor doesn't seem to come into play, it seems more like a linear progression, at least in the parts of the fic that I've read so far (2/3 or so).

It is a good touch the way she used non-nano stuff as much as possible for things like the holding tank. But since she has such a nano-paste bottleneck, early on in the game she should be making new nano-forges until her power consumption is close to maxed, or building more power generators until the nano-forges are producing at the max rate, unless the holding tank is already full most of the time in which case she needs to cobble together a better one (which would be the first thing to do when Uber joins).

**** That makes sense. I guess I just got a subjective impression of slowness and not enough time thinking about how to make more nano-forges or power generators relative to other things (especially after she built a new holding tank). When Uber joined, she should have had him get on building a new holding tank right away, since that's a non-nano part.

*** Piggybacking on this to recommend [[http://www.readcomics.tv/astro-city/chapter-7][my favorite Astro City story arc]]. It's about a Wonder Woman-esque superheroine who runs a franchise of women's shelters dealing with an attack on her image as she questions herself and her role as an icon. It does an amazing job at exploring themes of feminism, power, abuse, adversity, and the questions we ask ourselves about the choices we make in our response to them.

**** (spoilers)

If I can wax poetic for a moment, I feel like feminist superheroes like this just about always have a massive blinking /MISSING THE POINT/ sign over their heads, and this one is no exception. If a male superhero's power source was an abstract virtue, it'd be something like "justice" or "honor." What abstract virtue does Winged Justice draw power from? Feminism.

It's a recurring theme in so many female heroes. The writer sets out to create a female hero, and winds up creating a female-/themed/ hero, which isn't unlike the difference between a pirate and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney Land. It's horrifically ironic, since it's every bit the token-y, women do their own thing while men resolve the actual plot bullshit that these characters are supposed to be a protest against. If having Wonder Woman fighting Captain Chauvinism and opening a women's shelter isn't quite as bad as having her be the secretary for the Justice League, it's not much better, either. Because while Lady Woman of Womantopia III is stuck being a feminist mascot, she's neatly trapped in a box that prevents her from saving the world from anything other than male chauvinism, fighting for any agenda other than feminism, and otherwise prevented from helping to offset the incredibly male-dominated world of superheroism.

And the cycle continues.

I don't know, maybe there was a cunning subversion coming in Issue #8. There were certainly satirical elements, and the story seemed self-aware, but it still rubbed me the wrong way.

This series starts slow - I think it took me three or four attempts to get through the first third of the first book. But once it picks up, it really goes - I've finished book 2 in half a day, and book 3 is only set aside because of work pressure.

The futuristic world is fairly well presented and consistent. While the series has a couple really weak chapters [[#s][minor spoiler]], they're spread around enough that they're tolerable. Other than such 'filler', the characters are both novel and believable, the plot points intriguing, and the setting interesting.

Again, if you try, don't give up at least until the actual mystery begins. The action is really slow at the very beginning, but if you slog through that (or if you're really into happy utopia descriptions), you'll find gold.

ETA: So, halfway through book 3 I kinda gave up. It gets /very/ ayn rand in space. Disappointing. First two books are still a good read, if you can stomach unfinished stories :P

**** The tone of Worm is one where each success Taylor achieves is hard won. Sometimes they're undone trivially by people who don't care about her, but she still /wins/ sometimes. She makes progress, and the reader gets the feeling that if she just keeps moving forward she'll get there, that it'll be okay in the end.

Pact is relentlessly dark in comparison. For Blake, there was only Pyrrhic victory and loss. I almost never felt hopeless reading Worm. The setbacks she faced, no matter how large, seemed like something to be faced and overcome.

In Worm, the world sucks because making a good world is hard and their are powerful people who's goals don't correspond with a good world.

In Pact, the world sucks because it is /mathematically impossible/ for it not to. In the past it was maximally good, each new day is a new worst day ever, and the /universe literally hates you./

***** That's very useful, thank you. Pact's unrelenting bleakness really wore me down, despite how much I liked the premise.

****** I know, right? Sure, I love engaging characters and good worldbuilding, but the main reason I read fiction is often escapism. I don't want to feel like it's all pointless and that there is no reason even trying. Reality gives me that feeling often enough, thank you very much.

I loved Pacts characters and world, even more so than Worm, but the feeling that Blake was trying to stem the rising tide with nothing but his bare hands weighed heavily on me at times.

I just want to feel like a semblance of a happy ending is still achievable, I guess.

***** Speaking as someone who found Worm too depressing to finish (though I loved it before Leviathan showed up), I actually think I'd like Pact. For some reason I really like Cosmic Horror, but have never enjoyed stories where the monster is just an asshole human. Maybe it's because I've been dealing with mental disorders my whole life so seeing the mere fact of my existence screw me over feels familiar and somewhat comfortable, while still being scary at a personal level.

When the threat is human, however, they frustrate me rather than frighten. I just want to see the suffering they inflict end as soon as possible, which might be one of the reasons I like superhero stories and why Worm disappointed me by the standards I have for that genre. It could be because I have depression, but there's just a point where I face so many setbacks that I give up. Taylor kept going long past that, so her unyielding determination started to come across as foolhardy rather than inspirational.

****** What arc did you stop at? Based on the little context you gave I think you would like the rest of Worm, and that you quit at the lowest point for you. Trying not to spoil much, but Taylor starts to feel the same frustration you are that human conflict is getting in the way of stopping S class threats, and acts on it directly later on in a way I found very satisfying.

It's an intended reaction that has a lot of payoffs later and and I think it just hit you a little too hard, and I think you'll REALLY like the ending arcs if you push through arcs 14-16.

******* I quit after arc 14, but I've had future events and the mythology spoiled for me and it doesn't sound like I'd enjoy them. My issue with Worm was that I wanted it to be a dark superhero story, but after Leviathan it became more of a survival horror story that doesn't even horrify me.

I was already pushing my way through the arcs with the Slaughterhouse 9, so I'm not willing to push any further. The story had just become too unpleasant for me to continue and I haven't heard any reason to expect it to get any more enjoyable. I like cosmic horror, but not in a superhero story.

**** Agree with [[/u/Kylinger]]. I think Pact is far darker in the sense that the main character is beset by forces beyond his comprehension from the very beginning, and even as he gets stronger, he's constantly hanging on by the skin of his teeth, clawing his way up inch by bloody inch, against relentless forces that want to kill him or screw him over. Even his allies are almost all under suspicion and with potentially sinister motives.

Worm on the other hand, I didn't actually feel like was "grimdark" while reading it at all. No matter how bad things got, the main character was relentlessly focused on what to do next, on how she can overcome her problems and win. She was beacon of light in the darkness around her, and I knew she would never, ever give up, and her successes made it seem like she could really rise to the challenge. Her enemies become exponentially stronger as she improves, but she eventually makes real allies and friends that make things feel less hopeless.

**** AFAIK, it's because he used to get a huge number of pings all the time, and it made it impractical for him to use reddit at all on that account. He sometimes replies to questions on [[/r/parahumans]] (that aren't aimed specifically at him) and gets into conversations, which wouldn't work well if he were constantly spammed with messages.
