*** This OP in particular has been... I don't want to say /spamming/ or anything, but, let's say, /aggressively active/ in linking anything even remotely relevant to the subreddit for a while now.

If the mods are allowing it, I guess it's fine.

*** Any recursive fanfic of FiO does not require further explanation.

Correcting for that, I don't see an exceptional number of FiM fics in [[/r/rational]]. It's a prolific fandom, and at a glance has about as much presence as Pokemon. Possibly you just notice it more?

#+end_quote

So you're saying that Pokemon is as much well known as FiM?

hmm, I always tought that Pokemon is well known to almost everybody, while FiM is an obscure cartoon

***** Fair point. It /is/ disproportionate. I don't think it's an [[/r/rational]] phenomenon though, FiM is just a super active online fandom (or was? I don't know if the cartoon ending caused a drop). I don't know why. Well, I have just-so explanations but they're untestable.
