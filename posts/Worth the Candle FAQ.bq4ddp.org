** For anyone who is upset with me for getting their hopes up at seeing a WtC post and finding out that it's not a chapter, I have good news!

The word count [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][spreadsheet]] says new chapters are being posted today! Patreons have already seen the chapters yesterday.

*** I'm confused, are you extrapolating based on previous word counts, or saying that you have some sort of tool that detected alexanderwales posting a new chapter on Patreon?

EDIT: Oh, I just read the FAQ, it's the second one. Nice!

** u/JusticeBeak:
#+begin_quote
  Not having deadlines means a lot of burden removed from my shoulders. I think from an income/readership standpoint, it would probably be better to have a consistent release schedule, but I think it's worse for my enjoyment of writing, the quality of the work, and production speed.
#+end_quote

I'm glad he's in a position that allows him to prioritize the quality of his art over the money he'd get by writing at a more consistent pace.

** u/RMcD94:
#+begin_quote
  In the same way, individuals on Aerb can walk different directions and find that it takes different amounts of time/distance to wind up back where they were
#+end_quote

Wouldn't you go forever? If you start walking one degree above east you'll never return to your original home. (I think this is a maths problem called infinite forest or something)

*** From [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/7634/you-are-standing-at-the-origin-of-an-infinite-forest-holding-an-infinite-bb-g][math.stackexchange]], because I don't have a strong math background, the situation isn't analogous to the infinite forest primarily because people have width, and at least according to the highest upvoted answer there, yes, they will /always/ return to their home.

That said, actually circumnavigating the hex is pretty damned rare, given the distances involved.

**** Yeah, if you're limited to a straight line (not on one of the six axis) the distances quickly explode but even just following the axis is difficult.

I guess you'll see most train tracks and powerlines running at (or rather in the general direction) one of the six optimal angles.

Edit : straight line because I am they measure it with a laser above the atmosphere and point it in one direction and see how long it takes to hit the back.

Like the moon.

*** It seems a stretch to describe that as a fetish. It certainly doesn't seem to me like something "sudden and forced", for the sake of a supposed fetish.

I mean, take Christian mythology. That too includes a rather analogous pregnancy segment, where there is a magical pregnancy where a character (who happens to be called Mary) is implanted mystically with a pregnancy, as part of the storyline.

You may or may not like the Christian virgin birth story, but it would be a stretch to imagine it to be fetish-related. Rather, it's an integral part of the storyline, that yes, touches on a subject some people has a fetish for, but (as far as I can tell) without any particular sign that the author chose it for that purpose. (Or if they did, in either case, they made it sufficiently integrated in the story itself that I certainly can't tell.)

**** I'm willing to go on the record as not having a pregnancy fetish, for whatever that's worth, and never attempted to depict the pregnancy in a way that was fetishistic.

(A lot of the details of that arc are drawn from my experience with my wife being pregnant, and I don't think I ever once thought anything like "it's so sexy that you're pregnant", even though I was happy that we were having a child.)

*** It was also setup decently well (like from when they first met the locus/druid), and played off of what the different characters motivations were (Amaryllis stated early on she would do whatever she could to help the locus/druids; they needed a way to do the revival; the druid mentions rebirth early on). It also wasn't forced, one of the characters stepped up to do what needed to be done for the betterment of the world.

It was also a good excuse to get a lot of other stuff done. Like months of character development while only days passed in the rest of the plot, to have a pen pal sequence, let them move up in technology, and explore earth culture. And examined a novel (in my opinion) perspective on the concept for time acceleration.
