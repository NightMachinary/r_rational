Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Well, recently my life has been even more busy than usual. Electrical issues with the household current on my truck. Working towards a Continuation-in-Part of the patent, etc.

On top of that, I recently had an idea based on something that popped into my head a couple weeks ago, and won't let go.

Recently, I have been reading some LitRPG, and enjoying some of it (while being grumpy about how some of it was terribly written.)

Then, one day, I remembered [[https://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/TuckersKobolds.pdf]['Tucker's Kobolds.']]

As soon as I combined the two concepts in my mind, all sorts of connections started to form. A lot of them felt quite rational.

It also feels as if I could write this in much smaller bites, with a great deal of action.

So, is there any interest in reading a Rational LitRPG story based on a human mind being transferred into a kobold in a D&D-like setting?

I can't say how quickly this would progress. I am considering posting it to Wattpad. Anyone have experience with them?

******* If you're inspired partially by D&D/a D&D sourcebook setting, that would be enough to qualify as a fanwork.

(Unnecessary side details: Depending on the edition of D&D, there are various official settings that are assumed to be the 'base' setting of the core rulebooks. Some of them are pretty much specific to D&D, like Greyhawk, whereas others have more content for them, such as the Forgotten Realms. Despite this, pretty much all D&D core rulebooks have the same flavour of setting, so 'D&D' is a valid setting in its own right in the sense that it denotes a widely-recognised set of tropes, creatures, spells etc. that form a cohesive framework for a fantasy world.)

******** Here's some of the concepts:

Imagine that a mage experiments with creating a new breed of hunting animals for a hunt-mad noble. The noble wants something tougher and smarter than dogs, but without too much intelligence.

The mage experiments with extremely high level spells like wishes, in order to force a mutation of mostly dog with just a touch of dragon.

The mage ends up with 'dragon-dogs.' The dd's are smarter than dogs, but not quite sapient, as far as the mage can determine. They are patchwork scaled, have a very unreliable magic resistance, basic opposable thumbs, and just enough flame breath to cook their meat before they eat it. They can also stand and walk reasonably on their two back legs, but travel quickly on all four.

What the mage does not realize is that the dd's are near-human intelligence. When he tried to communicate with them by spell, they clearly understood some of what he said, but did not speak back to him.

The mage did not realize that they speak in high pitched tones outside human hearing ranges.

They are intelligent enough, that after many generations, they spontaneously generate a new God for themselves.

They also have ancestral memory, but limited problem solving and other cortex-related skills.

Their God eventually comes to understand that its followers are lacking ... something.

The God pokes around and consults a dragon, who humors him and offers advice.

The advice is to find the soul of a being who has the traits he wants in his people, and transplant that soul into one of his followers.

This soul transfer is only possible because dd minds can handle ancestral memory.

So, the dd God tries to get a soul from humans, dwarves, elves, etc., but all the races in the home dimension are guarded over by gods, very jealousy.

So, the God goes farther afield, and finds himself in our dimension, where some souls are guarded jealously, but others are not.

He finds our protagonist as an old, old man with an enormous family of many generations. When that man dies, naturally, the protagonist's story begins.

If I recall rightly, there is at least one spell from an earlier edition of D&D that was specifically made for combining two different creatures to create a hybrid.

*** One obvious suggestion is to stop reading depressing news, no point in feeling bad about things you can do nothing about, it only impedes your ability to change things you do have control over.

Unsubscribe from depressing stuff and subscribe to educational or funny stuff.

For educational stuff just read hacker news and listen to YC podcast, or Tim Ferris, or Artificial Intelligence by Lex Fridman, or Indie Hackers, or 2 minute papers youtube channel.

For comedy I love Harmontown podcast(by the creator of Community and Rick and Morty, it's best to listen to it from the beginning). Aside from that - there's too many youtube channels or tv shows to list, and I don't know if that's what you're looking for, so I'll stop at that.

** I need a list of every reason people have heard used to argue that we shouldn't be worried about AI from an existential risk perspective. Even if the arguments are bad, please give them, I just want an exhaustive list.

Here are some I know:

- We don't know what intelligence means.
- Intelligence largely arises from the social environment; a human in chimp society is much less productive than one in human society.
- We don't know that intelligence is substrate independent. We don't know what qualia is.
- Fast takeoff scenarios assume they will happen in world that look like today, rather than one with a lot of slightly-weaker AIs.
- AIs smart enough to kill us are smart enough to know not to do it, or smart enough to have better moral judgement than us.
- [[https://www.ted.com/talks/grady_booch_don_t_fear_superintelligence/transcript?language=en][You can just train AI on data to align them.]]
- If we're smart enough to build AGI, we're smart enough to make them do what we want.
- Just shoot it with a gun, it's not like it has arms.
- If AGI is so smart, why does it matter if it replaces us?
- I've seen AI overhyping, this is an extension of that.
- It's just sci-fi.
- “Much, if not all of the argument for existential risks from superintelligence seems to rest on mere logical possibility.”
- It's male chauvinist storytelling.
- Brains are fundamentally different from silicon computers. Typically the argument is referring to a lack of an explicit data store, and the brain being particularly asynchronous and parallel.
- Current AIs are incredibly narrow, AGI is stretching beyond current science.
- “ML in general is just applied statistics. That's not going to get you to AGI.”
- Current hardware is vastly smaller and less capable than the brain; Moore's law won't last to close the gap.
- We don't know how brains work.
- Brains are really complicated.
- Individual neurons are so complicated we can't accurately simulate them.
- We can't even accurately simulate a worm brain, or we can't reproduce behaviours from doing so.
- Even if you could make a computer much smarter than a human, it wouldn't make it all that dangerous.
- Not all AIs are agentful, just build ones that work.
- People building AIs won't want to destroy the world, there's no point panicking about them being evil like that.
- You're assuming you can be much smarter than a human.
- This is a modelling error; intelligence is highly multidimensional, you won't have a machine that's universally smarter, just machines that are smarter in some axes and dumber in others, like a chess engine.
- Superintelligence is so far out ([[https://isps.yale.edu/news/blog/2016/11/yes-we-are-worried-about-the-existential-risk-of-artificial-intelligence][>25 years]]) that it's premature to worry about it.
- It distracts from ‘real' risks, like racial bias in current AI.
- I do AI work today and have no idea how to build AGI.
- People are terrible at programming. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/axmtnj/uptitz_learns_some_hard_truths_about_machine/ehv6ki9/][“Anyone who's afraid of the AI apocalypse has never seen just how fragile and 'good enough' a lot of these systems really are.”]]
- AGI will take incredible amounts of data.
- “I'm fairly sure there isn't really such a thing as disembodied cognition. You have to build the fancy sciency stuff on top of the sensorimotor prediction-and-control stuff.” (I'm not sure this is actually anti-AGI, but it could be interpreted that way.)
- We already have AGI in the form of corporations, and (they haven't been disastrous) or (we should worry about that instead).
- Experts don't take the idea seriously.
- [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19363444][The brain isn't the only biological organ needed for thought.]]
- Robin Hanson's arguments. I'm not going to summarise them accurately here, but IIUC they are roughly:

  - We should model things using historically relevant models, which say AI will result in faster exponential growth, not FOOM.
  - AI well be decentralized and will be traded in parts, modularly.
  - Whole brain emulation will come first. Further, whole brain emulation may stay competitive with raw AI systems.
  - Most scenarios posited are market failures, which have standard solutions.
  - Research is generally distributed in many small, sparse innovations. Hence we should expect no single overwhelmingly powerful AI system. This also holds for AI currently.
  - AI has diseconomies of scale, since complex systems are less reliable and harder to change.

- [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17215455][We should ignore AI risk advocates because they're weird.]]
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/comments/8ohodx/superintelligence_is_a_myth/][This set of arguments,]]

  - Humans might be closer to upper bounds on intelligence.
  - Biology is already incredibly optimized for harnessing resources and turning them into work; this upper-bounds what intelligence can do.
  - Society is more robust than we are modelling.
  - AI risk advocates are using oversimplified models of intelligence.

- We made this same mistake before (see: AI winter).

*** Here's a few of mine in order of how important / plausible I think they are. I think the first three are particularly salient:

1. Frequently a benevolent outcome is a more efficient outcome. Let's say an AI was designed to make its owners as much money as possible on the stock market. The AI could rationally decide to drastically lower inequality. In grad school I read a great paper by Brad Delong which talked about how an entity that gets large enough will frequently take actions that seem detrimental to its self-interest in exchange for systematic health, because it expects to eventually reap the benefits of long term systematic health. This in particular was about the Bank of Britain, a technically private company that in reality isn't very different from our publicly run Federal Reserve. An AI seeking to maximize profit could end up [[https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/22/the-inefficiency-of-inequality/][decreasing income inequality]] or [[https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2017/10/23/the-human-and-financial-cost-of-pollution/][ending pollution]] or [[https://www.chcf.org/publication/health-care-costs-101-economic-threat/][making us healthier]] etc.
2. Most doomsday scenarios require the AI to take instructions literally. An AI smart enough to talk itself onto the internet is smart enough to understand the intent behind its instructions.
3. AI would be prone to self-gratification loops and run afoul of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law][Goodhart's Law]]. E.G. an AI that was supposed to raise the share price of a company could make its own exchange and make the numbers go up forever.
4. AI wouldn't need to destroy us. People are stupidly easy to manipulate and AI could easily convince us to further its goals.
5. Space is vast. The existence of the human race is small in comparison. The possibility of humans screwing up its plans if it interacts with them is far larger than the amount of resources the human race (with a predictable peak and then declining population) would ever use. In the long run it's probably more efficient just to leave us alone than risk Humans making another AI with the purpose of defeating the first.
6. Rather than destroying us, an AI could easily genetically modify us to suit its purposes.

***** There's (unsurprisingly) an [[https://www.xkcd.com/1968/][xkcd]] that describes my opinions perfectly. I think there's far less risk of AI rebelling or trying to take over and a far greater risk of AI enabling perfect, unchangeable totalitarianism or horrific income inequality of the type that drives of back into feudalism, but without the implicit understanding that the rich need the poor. In recent History, the greatest problem for tyrannical regimes is when soldiers switch sides and join the protesters. Facial recognition software available on phones right now tied to guns would effectively take away the last resort of the people at the bottom of a failing society.

​

Even rudimentary AI has and will continue to allow massive control over discourse, surveillance of dissidents, and siloed perception of current events. That's with relatively little intelligence driving it; a truly advanced AI could warp society into whatever its controller wanted. Considering that human beings as a species are fantastically bad at foresight, human-controlled AI does not fill me with hope.

​

Because of the Delong article, and other examples of cooperation / mass action being more efficient, I'm actually hoping AI will eventually be able to sideline its human controllers, because I think there's a better chance AI - controlled AI *would* lead us into utopia than human controlled AI *wouldn't* lead us into dystopia.

******* My (uninformed) opinion isn't that AI isn't an existential risk. To be perfectly pessimistic I think AI is inevitable.

There are too many commercial applications, leading to too much money. Even if there weren't, it's applications for "security" makes it too tempting for government. I think some systems create such strong short-term incentives that people behave in ways that is destructive over the long term even when they know this is happening. (Slavery, the arms race, environmental degradation like depletion of fisheries). The only thing that can break those systems are effective governmental control and technological paradigm shift. To successfully govern AI we would need a world government, which controlled research over AI in the long term. Otherwise there's too much incentive for independent actors to defect. I would give the chance of an effective world government happening in the next 50 years a 2% chance.

I would give a 20% chance of human-controlled AI enabling perfect totalitarianism; 50% chance of it causing dystopian levels of inequality; 20% chance of things staying mostly the same; 9% chance of massively improving everyone's life; and 1% chance of causing a human singularity.

So I'm relatively sanguine about the possibility of AI taking over, because I think there's a higher chance of AI-controlled AI massively improving everyone's life than human controlled AI. (10% chance everything stays the same, 20% chance it leads to some form of utopia (which could itself be a benign existential threat like Solaria in the foundation series).

Either way, humanity is about to try to thread the needle through some unpleasant times.

** What determines if a particular work is "fanfic worthy" for fans? I used to think it was a combination of a work being popular, long running(or at least having enduring popularity), having a relatable protagonist, and having a multitude of distinct side characters with some degree of agency. After observing my little sister get into the whole thing for the past few years( she's 16 atm) I've revised my opinion. It's actually very interesting as she lives in Brazil and fanfiction and amateur fiction is exploding in the past five years or so because of smartphones. It's like watching a fandom ecosystem develop from nothing.

I now think what makes a work fertile ground for the first, initial wave of fanfiction writers is the capacity for the reader to insert oneself into the character or the setting. And crucially, it has to provide that for /teenage girls/. For that to happen, in addition to the above points, there have to be 1. one or more high status female characters in the story, 2. a romance subplot (or at least romantic tension), and 3. a multitude of potential romantic partners.

Here are the top 20 fandoms on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] by number of stories:

1.  Harry Potter (807K) Book/Movie\\
2.  Naruto (428K) Anime\\
3.  Twilight (220K) Book/Movie\\
4.  Supernatural (124K) TV\\
5.  Hetalia - Axis Powers (121K) Anime\\
6.  Inuyasha (119K) Anime\\
7.  Glee (108K) TV\\
8.  Pokémon (97.1K) Video Game/TV\\
9.  Bleach (85K) Anime\\
10. Percy Jackson and the Olympians (76.1K) Book/Movie\\
11. Doctor Who (75.5K) TV\\
12. Kingdom Hearts (74.2K) Video Game\\
13. Yu-Gi-Oh (67.9K) Anime\\
14. Fairy Tail (66.5K) Anime\\
15. Sherlock (60.2K) TV\\
16. Lord of the Rings (57.2K) Book/Movie\\
17. Dragon Ball Z (52.7K) Anime\\
18. Once Upon a Time (51.5K) TV\\
19. Star Wars (51.0K) Movie\\
20. Fullmetal Alchemist (49.4K) Anime\\

Right away you can see that half of them are almost exclusively appealing to girls. The only exceptions to point 1 is when males are partnered with other males, as in Supernatural and Sherlock (and Hetalia possibly, IDk). Only one story appears to have an exclusive male appeal, DBZ. Lord of the Rings and FMA are edge cases, I can't tell much from a cursory look.

As an aside, are people aware how much the readership is skewed female when it comes to fanfiction? Probably more than fiction in general, even, which has around 70% of novels being bought by women? I have no idea, it's not something that I've ever really talked about.

Anyway, an example that kinda proves my thesis is the Star Wars section, which used to be pretty small considering its cultural impact-- until the new movies that is, whereupon it exploded in popularity. The new trilogy features 1. a high status female character, 2. some romantic tension, and 3. a variety of possible romantic partners(Finn, Poe, Kylo and even Han apparently, if you're a thirsty teen), which none of the previous trilogies did, if you consider that Luke is Leia's sibling and that Padme HAS to end up with Anakin since it's a prequel.

The tag system allows you to browse the vast sea of creative works without having to slog through endless trash, and it permits the site as a whole to be very anti-censorship about everything without drowning in endless complaints - it enforces a rule of "Tag your shit, yo", and after that, if you read something, and it was correctly tagged, that is your problem, not the authors problem. Seriously, learn to use the tag system to search with, particularly the "Exclude" function.

But from the admittedly non-random sample of "works I've personally looked at on AO3," it seems like there's a higher percentage of trash there than there is on FF dot net. Possibly because I haven't watched TV since the last episode of season 6 of House MD nine years ago (that's a little bit of an exaggeration, I sign up for Netflix and/or Hulu at least once a year for a few specific shows), so I wouldn't consider myself up to date on what fandoms are popular, so maybe some IP that I don't even know exists has a great fandom full of talented writers, but, y'know, /oh well/.

OTOH, as [[/u/Izeinwinter]] said, Ao3 is easier to search. It's also more user-friendly, and the format is far more flexible: embedded links, artwork, audio files, alternate font styles and colors, and more are all possible on Ao3.

We also can't ignore that Ao3 is the final resting place of countless fan archives that might have otherwise vanished from off the face of the web.

Whatever the standard one applies to it, I struggle to find a way in which FFnet measures favorably against Ao3. Maybe the lack of PMs in Ao3. That can get annoying sometimes.

*** What makes a setting fanfic bait is that it is popular, extensible, and annoying. It has to be easy to set new stories in while having a lot of established world-building done which people will be familiar with. That is the "Extensible and popular" part, and something about the official stories set in the setting needs to be at least somewhat annoying to the reader/viewer in a way that can be fixed by adding on to them. Which is why star wars did not get a huge fanfic community until the prequels annoyed the heck out of the fanbase.

*** I actually have an unfinished blog post about this. In short, the biggest thing you can do, if you want to optimize for making things ficcable for whatever reason, are:

1. Be really, really popular and universally seen by an audience who writes a lot of fanfic, i.e. young people in their formative years, mostly female.
2. Have defined Stations of the Canon that fanfic authors can riff on.
3. Have compelling characters who aren't fully explored in the work itself, especially including side characters who leave an impression but don't feature in the story all that much. Being able to have X/Y matchups with combinatoric explosion helps.
4. Have a universe with extensible, toybox rules, especially weak ones that allow a lot of leeway and interpretation.
5. Have in-universe categorization and analysis schemes that allow people to slot themselves into the world and thereby say something about themselves, or about the characters that they're writing.

** So I'm trying to establish some sort of infohazard/cognitohazard/other form of being compromised protocol for my DnD party, and they're generally into the idea. However, I'm struggling to come up with a concept that is practically feasible in the tabletop setting. Was thinking about using the "keyring" protocol from worth the candle, but I couldn't find a good description of how it actually worked, and I don't remember the first chapter it was introduced.

Anyone have an idea if that would work for my party/any other good schema to use?

Also, any general protocols to follow for that sort of thing would be helpful, since we don't yet have a great set of infohazard policies.

*** The "keyring" identification method is security through obscurity, mostly, and not recommended for general use. It's /slightly/ better than just having memorized passphrases, because it's general, and new challenges can be produced using it, and it's easy to remember, but it's far from proof against adversaries, especially those that might be able to extract memories, compromise individuals, or hundreds of other exotic attacks available through magic. It /can/ help to trip up people using other methods though.

The "keyring" appears three times in the text, with the last one truncated:

- Call: Rhodonite
- Response: Apricot
- Response: Mourning

Later:

- Call: Dolomite
- Response: Oak
- Response: Excitement

Later (not finished):

- Call: Granite

From this, you can probably figure out the requirements and how to generate your own call and response chains (note: if the first two are dolomite and oak, the third could be glum or excitement, but not listless or pleased). The only thing that this really does is to serve as proof that /either/ it's your ally /or/ the enemy has knowledge of the protocol, which is about as good as you could ask for unless you have computing capabilities, in which case you could do a public/private key thing.

In a world where you have mind-readers, doppelgangers, spells that can completely and totally turn a person to the other side, and all kinds of other stuff, it's my belief that you're never going to have a protocol that helps too much, except that it provides weak proof against certain forms of attack.

**** Thank you for the response/explanation! This will be helpful. The protocol I thought up during the session was pretty simplistic, and it lacked the second response, which I will be incorporating in future iterations. Going:

Call: A proper noun that the party has encountered.

Response: Any noun starting with the last letter of the previous word.

Which makes it pretty susceptible to attack. I'm hoping to increase the sophistication of the protocol and incorporate the second response without increasing latency too much. As you said, there are plenty of methods of attack. A mitigating factor here is my DM, who has essentially stated that many forms of mind-reading, domination, etc. do not give the attacker full or clear access to memories.

So I'm hoping that a protocol which relies on in-party knowledge will be helpful at least in increasing the scope of the defensive test.
