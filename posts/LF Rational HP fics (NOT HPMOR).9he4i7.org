So, I'm looking for 'rational' stories that aren't self-sure mary sue wankery - HPMOR is, in my opinion, and I've met few more that made me drop this line of fics, but recently I've met link to "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Perfectly-Reasonable-Explanation][Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation]]" and loved it.

So, I'm looking for similar stories - MC being properly awed and confused by magic world and ignorant in magical life the same way mages ignorant of muggles, non-MC characters actually being smart and having their own agenda, magical world with it's own reasons, magic being 'magical' or having different base rules to known muggle sciences, and so on.

  Too Young to Die
#+end_quote

I have to give an anti-recommendation for this one. As stated it has a "ruthless" protagonist, which in this story translates to edgy with a really slapdash tragic start.

If I hadn't seen it here the premise alone, of an emotionally-abused-by-Lily-and-James Harry with a spoiled twin who defeated the dark lord, has enough red flags to make me drop it. The first tragic event happens before I can connect to anyone and falls completely flat. Later I find that "ruthless" means he casually casts dark magic on people for little more than the pleasure it provides?

I'm having a lot of trouble connecting with anything in this story and given how the first few conflicts were handled it seems to have at least an order of magnitude more "self-sure mary sue wankery" than HPMOR.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][*The Arithmancer*]] is a good read, though not strictly rational. It focuses on Hermione, who in this fic has an eidetic memory and a love of maths, and delves deeply into (obviously) arithmancy and spell creation. The book goes through years 1-4 in Hogwarts. I enjoyed it more than its sequel, Lady Archemedes (covering years 5-7), which I didn't actually finish... though looking online I think I just got to the end and never went back, as it's now finished. I might do so at some point...

I remember a lot of talk a while back about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717474/1/Horry-Patter-and-the-Philologer-s-Stone][*Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone*]], but it's not really rational. Like, at all. But it appeals to a lot of readers on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] (somewhat like how Unsong does, I think) so it might appeal to you too. I'm not up to date on it, but it basically sets up the world of HP as an alternate timeline where everything is slightly, uncomfortably, /off/. Don't get confused by the character names when you're reading - they are definitely different people than the normal HP timeline, and the seemingly annoying changes to the spellings are that way for a reason.

And [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][*Significant Digits*]] is the unofficial (but endorsed by Eliezer Yudkowsky) sequel to HPMOR if you haven't read it yet.

Finally, I second the other recommendations for Harry Potter and the Natural 20. It's highly amusing if you have any fondness for D&D. It's also unfinished, though; we've had, what, one update in the past three years? So be warned of that.

To be fair, describing something as "masturbatory" is relatively common, and most people recognize it as being synonymous with "self indulgent" rather than assuming it's literally referring to sexual pleasure.

Or it could be because the author wanted the conflict to be about something besides arbitrage. Regardless of the motive, the scene is still grating.

See below, "masturbatory" in this case is just a way to say it's very self-indulgent. Equivalent to calling it a self-insert Mary Sue/Gary Stu power fantasy or something like that. I think it's justified IMHO in HPMOR as it was the first time it was done that way, and in itself it provided a hilarious subversion of the canon - not to mention, being overconfident is actually an established in-universe flaw of Harry Potter-Evans-Verres. However I can see how it would quickly get old. In a way, when things go /too/ easy for the "rational" protagonist it feels like it contradicts the same thing Lucius said to Draco in HPMOR: super-complicated plans never work, because there's too many factors that you just can't control, no matter how clever you are. So even in a ratfic, it can break suspension of disbelief to see a protagonist just outperform everyone else all the time and crack in a few months systems that had resisted centuries of study.

**** Hmmm, it definitely has mystique but to me it felt more like "The Magicians" than "Harry Potter," despite the obvious HP setting and influence. Rather than magic feeling mysterious and cool and amazing, it felt like magic was powerful and fearful and dangerous. It felt like a disaster was always looming just out of sight, and things would come crashing down at any moment. It's a sign of good writing that it inspired that uneasiness in me, but it was definitely a different feeling than when I read HP for the first time!

I /heavily/ disagree with this statement. We just haven't reached the part where 'Horry' is properly introduced to magic yet. And even still he's made great starts, such as copying parts of his self-book. Take this excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  A portal appears across from Lucas, "/Oblivius/, expedited ceritificate. /Now/,"

  Lucas rolls his eyes and points the wand through the portal, "/Oblivius/," he says. The portal closes with a 'pop'.

  The speaker on his desk chimes, "/You are in mortal peril in two seconds/,"

  /What?!/

  A thundercrack, and the old man stands across from him, eye blazing blue. Another small portal opens, and the brilliant glow diminishes.

  "/Oblivius/, standard certificate," says the him on the other side. A speaker on the other side says something imperceptible.

  "Immediately," the other him says, again.

  Lucas looks past the portal at Alvin, and raises an eyebrow. "/Oblivius/," he says, pointing his wand towards the portal, and it slams shut.

  Alvin watches Lucas, silent. Then, "You're too clever for you own good, Lucas,"

  Lucas eyes the threat assessments blaring in red all across Britain to his right. Six...seven...eight...all eight locations?

  "Can...I help you, Alvin?"

  "Burning the candle at all available ends, it would appear. For how many years now? Ten? Twenty?"
