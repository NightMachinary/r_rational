** Knowing that it was a solvable mystery may have made it too easy to solve. I figured it out the minute people got sick. Generally I don't have a strong track record on such predictions.

** --It occurs to me that, if you had an AI-containing supercomputer or a cold-sleep chamber or anything else that you had a strong need to stay untouched for a vast length of time, a secret inner chamber in such a place might be an /excellent/ hiding spot. Or rather, I could imagine myself thinking 'Isn't it even more likely that any really important things would have been hidden in the middle of all this, rather than elsewhere?' and wanting to send in people in lead-lined suits to check... (For which matter, presumably no evidence that there aren't such secret plans for these facilities in reality? Which now is better, low-security that no one knows about or high-security that everyone knows about, but without knowledge that there's something there...)

Pondering pictures. A skull, of course, for humans is most evocative. If resolution could be maintained, a graphic multi-panel representation of causes and observable symptoms... hm.

**** A very good point--and whether they knew about it already or had to throw scientists and test-animals at it to develop protections, by the point they're taking the danger inside seriously the preparations have arguably fulfilled their role. Past that point, if they're willing to risk lives for it--especially if they're also stopping it from spreading outside while they're doing so--it's their choice if they want to poke around inside just in case we've hidden something there, rather than taking out word for it. The intention being to prevent 'tragic accidents' who would have been harmed by us if our warning methods were insufficient... yes.

********* Spoiler tags let you black out spoilers so that they must click to be revealed, preserving surprising elements of the story so that they may be more fully enjoyed, and allowing people to opt into them. Their use is detailed in the sidebar, although they only work when the subreddit's CSS is loaded, and not for example on i.reddit.com.

** My hypothesis without spoilers and reading about halfway: it's an old radioactive dump site and they're trying to make it look as scary as possible to keep people away. I figure this because I've seen similar ideas in a youtube video about keeping vastly different future cultures away from our long-lasting radioactive waste.

Edit: Yup. Got it at "looking scary is the first line of defense for a lot of old tombs". I'm pretty sure the story was inspired by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOEqzt36JEM][this]] or one of its sources.
