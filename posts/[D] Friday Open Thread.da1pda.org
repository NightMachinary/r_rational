Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** There are SO many fics out there about people from our Earth who are punted into a fantasy/sci-fi world. But what if the hero came home ... maybe after gaining powers or learning things? Anyone ever heard of a rational (ish) story like that?

Closest I can think of is re-do stories of coming back from the future with memories/skills intact. Not quite the same thing.

***** I liked it. You have a character trying to deal with PTSD, and the clash of living in a world with electricity and English after having lived with elves and magic, a guy who got twisted into a monstrous tyrant having to find his place in society, and a practical guy trying to hold everything together.

That said, the ending kinda threw me. The main characters are all running away from their problems and abandoning those closest to them. It becomes literally about escapism It isn't bad, just something I disagree with.

***** It was a pleasure to read technically, but kind of a disappointment in the actual story. I can't find my original criticism of the story (probably on an old monday thread) so here's my best attempt at remembering it (spoilers for ending):

I really didn't like how the brother character basically pulled a perfect karma houdini and gets away with it in the end. He successfully lies to and manipulates everyone, gets to have his cake and eat it, too. The friend character is screwed from the beginning, there was nothing they could have done to return to their world, and basically end up having a psychotic break to end up in an asylum, after being betrayed by his best friends. You could say having an ending where a bad guy with a good plan wins is quintessential "rational reality", but eh, it was a pretty unsatisfying ending.

- What is the best way to get information about the current state of any field of technology? Browsing science articles? Reading Wikipedia?

  - For example, how far have we gotten with uploading animals since [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaCRNX0hdwU][this thing]] from four years ago?

This does not exist. There are only sources with different kinds of biases.

If you want a broad basis, for the US and UK I'd recommend perhaps The Guardian, NPR, the WSJ, the Economist, the Washington Post, and the NY Times, but you'll need to keep in mind how those publication's editorial biases and their writers' personal biases compare to your own.

Get a good feed reader. I don't know which one to recommend to you, though, because my feed reader is Tweetdeck and Reddit and a few Mastodon instances skewed towards hedonism, and that's not a good combination for your purposes.

Don't try to stay up-to-date. Stay informed. Read [[https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/10/02/in-praise-of-day-two/][the day two stories]], not the live updates. Look at moments, but pay attention to the trends, not the details of the moment.

This. This so much!

I have a tendency to tune out nearly all live news or news that try to be as immediate as possible. So much of the news are about being as emotional as possible and there is always some distortion as they exaggerate or outright falsify what is happening (intentionally or not).

News reporting is optimized towards reaching as many people as possible. That means it's all about being as efficient of a replicator of a meme as possible. Hence all the click bait titles, extreme emotional drama, simplified into a quick sentence summary, and many other ways to butcher and mangle the truth until it's more fitting and well suited for publication.

At this point in my life, I cannot recall any time* when any piece of news was so relevant or important that I needed to know about it right away regardless of how accurate it might be. I rather listen to day two stories where the reporters have had more time to investigate and with less of a pressing need to cram in as much emotional drama as possible.

This method has its pros and cons. Sometimes I'm unaware of major events that just happened and am surprised when some of my friends are talking about it. But after I have taken the time to catch up, I have a better understanding of what is going on without any distortions from reading the first published news reports.

*The one exception might have been 9/11 since I lived in the same state at the time, but I was pretty young and wasn't old/mature enough to care about watching the news or to understand what was going on.

** So I went to a co-ed pickup sauna the other day (for the first and probably last time, though the person I went with assured me that this was a substandard club. 3/10 got groped, would not recommend. any regulars want to read my 2,200 word writeup feel free to request it and I'll PM it to you - note that nothing interesting or titillating happened if you are expecting a penthouse letter). But that's not what this is about.

What this is about is that I realised that the sort of sex club vibe seemed very much like how I imagine vampires to be, so I wrote a (pretty bad) short story based on the layout/appearance of the club I visited (except I made the vampire lair classy). Thought people might be interested in it: (1962 words) [[https://pastebin.com/6yKhmgWX]] (contains a very small amount of mild sexual content, and it's text-only)

** After chatting to the director of the computational stats dept on campus, I was asked to lead a year-long workshop series on Bayesian inference. Since my home department is Anthropology, I think this'll be a good way to further signal my technical skills in anticipation of industry positions after graduation. And while it won't be paid, it's work that I'd mostly be doing anyway (in running an ongoing reading group on the subject), and it'll be catered (my budget for refreshments is $100 / meeting) and I'll have another $1k to use for travel purposes. Looking forward to it overall! Now I need to make a flyer and figure out what to call it. I'm tempted by something in the Charles Atlas style, complete with scantily clad bodybuilders and "DO YOU WANT TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF ABS (Applied Bayesian Statistics)?" calls to action. Don't know if they'll go for it.

*** Lecture attendance is meaningless in a world of online lecture recordings. Much better to have weekly homework to make sure that students are keeping on top of work.

*** In order:

1. Lecture attendance policies are bullshit. Lectures are like gas, they expand to fill all available space. I've never met a teacher whose lectures were worth paying attention to that failed to convey information in the time given, and likewise, I've never met a teacher who sucked at giving lectures that would have done better if given twice the amount of time. As far as I am concerned, as long as I do well on the assignments, it should be up to me what I do with the time allocated. Ditto for technology policies. If I want to use my phone to not pay attention, that's my business, not the teacher's.

2. You're chasing the proximate cause rather than the ultimate cause. The problem isn't how to disable keys to make room for your cat, it's how to keep your cat off your keyboard. I recommend a water bottle, but a kinder alternative is to keep something the cat likes better than you nearby. I distract mine with a cat tower he can use to peer down at me, but a cat bed nearby on the desk might be more helpful. Assuming your cat is nice enough to use a cat bed. But to answer your question: [[https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/11570/disable-the-keyboard-with-a-keyboard-shortcut-in-windows/][google says somebody already made a solution ages ago that's compatible with Windows 10.]] I imagine if you want to be more specific and disable only the function keys, you can just write your own AutoHotKey script.

3. Not important at all. Fuck copyright, and /specifically/ fuck copyright trolls who think a meme or a single diagram is important enough to demand citation. It's /polite/ to give credit to artists and photographers, and expected if you're citing academia, but if you expect to be processing a lot of copyrighted information in a short amount of time, it's a waste of resources for something that's probably not even going to get you in huge trouble. Only do it if you think the citations will point your students or coworkers to resources that might be useful. A lecture or an informative slideshow is a transformative context anyhow.

4. Correlation doesn't equal causation. I wouldn't be shocked if obesity was partially caused by food choices in childhood, but given the overwhelming evidence in favor of modern food being unhealthier and more plentiful than food in the past, I /would/ be shocked if your baby food was the most important factor. People have been trying for years to frame the obesity epidemic in ways that imply it's not the fault of grown adults for making the decisions that they do. I won't claim that they're wrong - a lot of that evidence is very compelling, and most of it makes sense. But this study in particular seems like an extension of that in a direction that doesn't feel like it works. I'm not going to do a deep dive into the study, but there are a couple points that bug me. One: I'm pretty sure [[https://www.stateofobesity.org/obesity-by-age/][adults in /every/ age range]] started gaining weight at around the same rate, in the same proportions. People who are older than sixty-five probably weren't eating baby food in 1970. Two: [[https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2012157?WT.ec_id=IJO-201306][the idea of HFCS being responsible for the obesity epidemic is pretty old]]. We're still not sure if it's functionally different from other sweeteners, and there are plenty of other things that could have caused it.

The furriness of most of the head puts some constraints on that, but let me think about where I could see out.

There's a gap in fur behind and above most species' pedipalps, which is a narrow slot but one's that's already negative space, and thereby suited for hiding mesh or eyes.

If the fur is discarded, and the spider is presented in a lowpoly fashion with fabric stretched over an inner frame, black fabric would provide good places to look through. I've used that technique on other masks.

If I were a rich man, I could slap a camera or two or eight on the spider, and wire those to per-eye displays. I saw a Protogen furry doing something similar, and I wonder if they've documented their build.
