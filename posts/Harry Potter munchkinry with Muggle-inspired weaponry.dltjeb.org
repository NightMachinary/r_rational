** It feels strange to see someone deep dive on munchkinizing weapons in the HP setting. Like, it's been a while since I watched the show, but from what I remember of the setting the need just isn't there.

The bad guys are like a few dozen terrorists, right? Like, 'if only we had better guns' feels like a really weird problem for the cops to have. The thing that needs to get munchkinned away is whatever is stopping the cops from just sending in ten times as many wizards as their enemy has.

They obviously tacitly endorse their new fascist overlord that brings order and an iron fist to magical Britain. AAAB (All Aurors Are Bastards).

*** I think we learned in the last book that most wizards were basically indifferent to Voldemort in the first place

** This is stupid. A shield charm will protect a wizard against everything in the first chapter, as it likely protects against 'harm', broadly speaking.

I hate this kind of munchkinery in HP. Removes all the charm from the setting. Flashbacks to early 2000's nerd-wankery ugh

*** What exactly is the charm of the setting? Esp. if you have any links to people who explain it.

My problem with is, do you know how many bullets can penetrate your skull in the time it takes to raise a wand, make a flourish with it, and say the word "Protego"?

**** good wizards don't make flourishes or say words. non-verbal magic is fsater than muggle seeing someone, pulling trigger, etc.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
