** This. This is what I've wanted since Cat was first given her knife. She is beginning to lay ground rules between heroes and villains, that *both* sides will stomp on if violated. No more Lone Swordsmen *or* Diabolist turning entire cities into graveyards. The battles between Above and Below will be fought by those sworn to Above and Below, not innocent bystanders. Greenskins and Praesi will not be killed or tortured as Willie "city-killer" of Greensborough did.

This is why I love this story.

Assassination of officers doesn't affect either and is standard warfare, and the Fae are a targeted weapon, one Cat needs to balance out the 14 heroes, so she can't say she won't use them without the Grey Pilgrim withdrawing Heroes in concession.

Evil fucking won, Cat being an Evil Queen of Callow is changing eon old narrative, no wonder why Black was supportive of her and fine with letting her take the throne, even offering his help. This was what he wanted all along way back in the earlier books when he said he wanted evil to win, this is so fucking cool.

*** I want this specifically so the other Heroes get to wonder at how eminently reasonable the Black Queen is being. It's harder to think your enemies are pure evil when they're deliberately sparing civilians and banning WMDs and inhumane treatment of sophonts.

This looks exactly like something to get the Heroes to the table in the Liesse Accords. If she demonstrates that agreements made with her are always honored, they should feel much more comfortable with making concessions.

Nice callback. I don't think we're getting Break and Regulate Aspects this time, but if the terms hold, this may well turn into an invasion story instead of a proper Crusade.

Of cource, given the fact that Princes' Graveyard will still hapen despite Catherine's oath about sparing officers, I'm somewhat gleefully awaiting the good guys fucking this up.

EDIT: Nevermind, the terms they discussed were about /prisoner/ exchanges, not about refraining from targeting /officers/, both Headsman and targeting princes are very much in the cards.

#+end_quote

Given that Catherine's initial pair of Break and Take stemmed from her having "something that would use what it could not break and break what it could not use" at her core, and mirrored Black's own Destroy and Conquer respectively, the distinction noted here would probably either diminish her enemies' power on breaking some kind of condition, placing a restriction on both her and the opponents-to-be, or empower her allies when enforcing some kind of pre-established agreement.

******* Well, the quotes from future memoirs and treatises suspiciously don't mention her Name, they only call her Foundling (and refer to her in past tense). A Watsonian explanation for that would be that she'd have transitioned by then and her close friends (including Juniper and Aisha, who wrote those) would have already be more accustomed to her name than to her new Name.

A Doylist one would be either that the author doesn't want to reveal her future Name, or that she loses her Name instead of a proper transition. Either way, in the prologue she seemed to rely more on her fairy powers (portals, rebuilding the cunstruct of her body, glamour) than on her Name tricks (shadow spears and panes).

** Oh, well done, Cat. You even got the hero to give you brownie points for foisting your own dreaded problem (the Hell Egg) off on the heroes to solve.

This chat went a lot better than any of the heroes visiting Cat to assassinate her, or even the parleys with Hasenbach.

On another note:

#+begin_quote
  “Simply by being who you are, you darken Creation,” the Grey Pilgrim replied calmly.

  [...]

  “Heed an old man's advice, Catherine Foundling,” the Pilgrim said tiredly. “The world can only be healed so much.”

  [...]

  “There is not a single life I've taken I have not regretted,” the Grey Pilgrim sighed. “No matter the deeds to their name. To inflict death is to end the possibility of redemption, and that is the greatest gift the Gods have granted us.”
#+end_quote

Does anyone else get the impression (reinforced by the name) that Pilgrim started out on the same path Cat did (acting under an Evil Name with Good intentions), and then was redeemed to the side of Good?

That said, Levantine heroes are by and large more brutal than average, he easily may have done something that led him into his current Role in an attempt to redeem himself.

*** I think it's a reflection of how he has a Good Name but understands Evil Names & the need to choose the lesser evil. Sure, he's still Good but he's had to do his fair share of evil deeds while trying to overcome villains and he isn't as die-hard as most heroes with a Good Name. I'd imagine dealing with the Above for fifty odd years doesn't let you keep the belief that they can only do good deeds - hence the "gray" part to his Name (I'm assuming he transitioned to this name).

Or it could be something else completely. I dunno :)
