Just curious, since I think having soundtracks to things as small as rational/rationalist books is kinda dope. The only things I know of are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzhX5N0pWQM&t=6s][Annexias' Worm fansongs]] and that time during a live reading of one of the last UNSONG chapters where [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOH1a1h_IA&t=10s][a choir came and performed Scott Alexander's joke version of Hallelujah]] (it's a banger and the lyrics are actually really good ok?).

So yeah, anyone know anything? Also, the comments sections of those Worm songs 100% contain spoilers if you haven't read all of Worm yet.


** Other than Annexias the only other music creations I'm aware of is the Hamilton inspired "Wormilton: the Musical" by [[/u/professor_crispy][u/professor_crispy]] (Spoilers for Worm):

1. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/9byote/the_opening_number_from_wormilton_working_title/][Wormilton Opening Track]]
2. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/bhtm9t/wormilton_track_2_armsmaster_sir/][Armsmaster, Sir]]
3. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/gy7hg3/its_wormilton_3_the_bank_robbery_enjoy/][The Bank Robbery]]

I think there are two Ward songs on their SoundCloud too but I haven't read Ward yet so haven't checked those out.

** I've written songs for Worm/Parahumans over the years that can be found here: [[https://soundcloud.com/user-371879520/sets/worm]]

They're instrumental, so no spoilers.

I also write my own serial, Conquest of Avalon, where I sometimes post official soundtrack songs as well.

*** Do you have a non-soundcloud source? On mobile so a moment of internet instability stops loading the track and needs a page refresh (which doesn't preserve the timestamp) to restart. I've tried listening three times without finishing the first song. Youtube/Bandcamp/anything else doesn't do that.

**** I don't at the moment, but SoundCloud has been annoying me a lot lately and I've been strongly considering a move. This might be the final straw. I'll send you another reply if and when it all gets moved.

** You would probably appreciate the soundtrack to [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/17/fermats-last-stand-soundtrack-and-adventure-log/][Scott Alexander's Dungeons & Discourse campaign]].

The oldest songs on that channel are from so long ago he's credited under his real name- and now he's cycled back to using it, so no harm sharing it.

*** "Back to using it" is putting it too strongly. ACX has the byline as Alexander, not his legal name. He is no longer maintaining the strict firewall between his legal and pen names, but he's still overwhelmingly sticking to the pen name.

** Currently rereading WtC and on hearing [[https://youtu.be/aBsTGOyexNs]] I found myself unable to stop thinking about the fic. Something about the tone/lyrics/gestalt of the song resonates irrationally strongly for me.

** I find it hilarious that here's someone talking about Worm on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] when just yesterday I was reading a series of essays I entirely agreed with about how Worm isn't rational fiction at all, namely because of Wildbow's major doylist streak that he's long been open about.

** â€˜Sea of Stars' by Liquid Citrus was inspired by HPMOR, specifically the scene where squirrel and Harry are gazing at the stars

EDIT: very very hard to find because of what they have chosen to name themselves (google liquid citrus it's just soap) so I might have the title wrong but I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
