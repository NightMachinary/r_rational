Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?

  To me it seems rational to walk from place to place quickly so you aren't wasting time you could spend doing something more interesting.
#+end_quote

Walking is interesting. There's people and places to look at. The weather's nice. The light exercise gets my blood flowing. I can think if I want to but I don't have to focus on a specific task. And it doesn't need a huge slice of time dedicated to it.

If I wanted to get somewhere quickly, I'd take the bus, or the car. Or at the very least I'd set out earlier so I can make it at a leisurely walking pace.

Anyway there's no sense in saving walking time if you're just going to waste that time in some other way. If I needed more time in my day, I'd start by blocking Reddit.

The TL;DR is that groups of females will walk slower than any female's preferred speed, groups of males will walk faster than any male's preferred speed, and a male+female will walk at the preferred speed of the female.

Of course, I haven't actually read the study, so I'm likely mischaracterizing it.

*** I think that the answer might have to do with prioritizing why you're walking. I know that several famous scientists and philosophers say they think better while they're walking in such a situation it's the locomotion itself that you want so having a leisurely pace while slow walking is reasonable where is if you're trying to get to one goal or another than going the fastest you reasonably can is probably the right move. There's a word flaneur (?) which represents someone who takes his time strolling around his hometown. Nowadays people who identifies as such understand that there is value in taking your time because you get to be more observant of the areas around you and your more present through your day which has been statistically proven to increase both satisfaction in life and mental awareness in other problems

  Today we [scientists] are told that what we do must be relevant to society's needs. But relevant /when/? Today, tomorrow, a decade hence? ... Today's advances ... will surely underlie a new technology, and will offer major new forces for the alteration of the human condition. Issues of a new dimension will surely be raised. It is crucial that these issues be made understandable to non-scientists who must participate in decision-making.

  As the Reverend Theodore Hesburgh (1962) has observed, man's intellectual history up to now has represented a long series of abortive attempts to establish an unwarranted hegemony for this or that kind of knowledge. I can only agree with him that we now have the rich opportunity of changing this trend. But we will not succeed unless we each have deep conviction. We must repeat with Terence: nothing human is alien to me: no human insight, no human misery, no human beauty, no human knowledge, no human anguish, no human value, no human hunger

** One of my friends is a very enthusiastic aspiring rationalist, actually one of the most enthusiastic I've seen who is still very excited trying to implement the LW style of rationality in her day-to-day life.

Anyway, she's in an university, but she doesn't want to attend lectures because they're mostly less educational than her own reading, doesn't want to attend group session because they take too much time and the only reason she would want to attend classes is that she'd be able influence other students to become more like effective altruists.

I mentioned that having regular friends and being able to converse with regular people have a lot hidden (and clear) benefits. But she thinks social life comes at a great cost, it takes a lot of time and distracts her from more explicit rational and altruist aspirations. She's afraid her standards for herself will drop, she'll become more like other people, less productive, less obsessed with world-saving.

I understand her point because I've noticed I become more similar to the people who I spend time with, and therefore try to distance myself from people with hostile and antisocial beliefs because I don't want to become like them. But taken to this extreme, it seems... kind of crazy?

[[http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/my_beautiful_bu.html][People like Brian Caplan have said they've done something similar,]] who makes sure he gets as little input from the outside world and mostly likes to spend time with libertarian economics Ph.D.s which include bloggers from the rationalist memeplex like Robin Hanson or Alex Tabarrok from Marginal Revolution. His motivations seem to be more selfish - he simply doesn't like other kind of people and finds the outside society "unacceptable, dreary, insipid, ugly, boring, wrong, and wicked."

But I'm more interested in my friend's case because it's more tangentially rationality related, and Caplan's motivations are quite uninteresting. If you want to want to maintain your current personality into the far future as closely as possible, are measures as extreme as this warranted? Your deeply-held beliefs might not change, but how important you find them probably will if you spend time with people who don't find the same things important.

*** Sounds like a serious case of halo effect. a person can't save the world on their own, and they can't save the world if they don't take care of themself. your friend needs to taboo the word rationality and remember that the thought she cannot think (even if the thought might be wrong) limits her more than the thought she can. She shouldn't let her thinking be paralyzed by the fear of thinking an irrational thought, because that could cause her to think too rigidly.

Rationality is a skill that can take a long time to master or even to be proficient with. People don't learn that kind of thing as well if they expect themselves to be perfect at it from the getgo and then get upset at themselves when they're not.

Instead of putting a metaphorical dam in her mind to block her less rational thoughts from consciously forming, it might be better to let those thoughts come out into the open and address them with more thoughts, even if she knows they're wrong and even if it makes her feel stupid. Be willing to question everything, even if the question doesn't make sense since if it doesn't you can just unask the question afterwards. And if she finds herself spinning in circles stuck on a particular looping line of reasoning, she should just take a step back and take an outside view on whatever the subject she's thinking of is.

Ultimately rationality is just a tool to help someone form more accurate beliefs and achieve their goals more effectively. If it's not helping her form more accurate beliefs and it's not helping her achieve her goals more effectively, she should ask herself what she thinks she's talking about when she says "rationality". Real rationality isn't just believing the words of some great teacher, even if what the teacher says is so obviously sensible and right and rational, one should still think it through thoroughly for themselves, just in case there's anything at all the teacher might have gotten wrong that slipped their notice, since the teacher is imperfect and human just like everyone else is, and since thinking things through thoroughly for yourself is a good habit to have.

I'm starting to suspect that halo effects and happy death spirals are a common and prevalent enough problem for the rational/ist community that we really should be doing more to address it. People who are in a happy death spiral about rationality make rationality and this community look bad and aren't doing themselves any favors either.

Hope this helps, and I hope your friend recovers from her happy death spiral as soon as possible!

She's rationalizing (and she seems smart, so she's pretty good at it). Nobody is so hyper-rational that they would be able to cut out social contact just because they've decided they could get more useful information through reading.

Her decision to cut off most contact with others is an emotional, not rational decision. If I'm right, she's probably a lot like people on this sub, people who like both rationality and reading. For her, it's become an addiction, which she has rationalized as a perfectly reasonable decision.

*** Tell your friend to do a thought experiment. Ask her how many of the profound ideas she is reading she could have come up with herself. Then ask her how important it is that you introduced her to this. The final part is ask her why does she believe that other people don't have the potential to contribute ideas just as life changing as rationality? For further reading I would say she should look into Nassim Taleb and his books the Black Swan and anti fragility. Pretty much he says that any event that you go to that has minimal downside on your immediate well-being but could have potentially huge upside should be engaged in. And parties fall into this anti fragile category. You can extend this to socializing in general.

Meeting someone cost you a few seconds of your life which, if you are being healthy as a rational option, you can probably afford a few seconds and if you don't like them you can politely disengage and not have to worry about it again. People disengage all the time, but maybe you will find that person who will introduce you to rationalism or your new favorite band or maybe the person who you love and motivates you to be a more effective altruist in another way. I guess the more effective way to say it is her understanding of rationality is very short term. friends and socializing and parties and even class don't have a great return on a daily basis but if you spend all semester in class and only get introduced to one life changing idea that you couldn't figure out on your own then that class was still totally worth it. You have no way of predicting that ahead of time and if its a boring class you can just read while you're in class

To play devils advocate...

Most people aren't the people you read about in books.

The only reason that a live interactive individual would do better then the collective sum of recorded human knowledge is because individuals might be able to tailor their advice for you specifically. You get information tailored to a specific individual.

But on average they're going to be worse at conveying information then someone who's thought a lot about how best to convey their information to a general individual.

There are two fundamental problems. The ability to convey useful information over speech, and the selection bias of who you're talking to (IE: not people who think the ideas are important enough to commit to the internet).

(You can get around the latter by careful selection of people, and specific instruction is often very useful for learning a skill)

If you're relying on /talking/ to people to get introduced to new ideas, well you're going to have a bad time. Read more instead.

***** You aren't incorrect but you're making a mistake in assuming that the information you are going to receive from those people is going to be intentionally conveyed. I forget who said it but and often repeated idea is that everyone teaches you either they teach you what to do or they teach you what not to do. In which case your observation of that person is significantly more important than anything they say.

Besides I think that you're also making a problematic binary here it's not that there are interesting people and boring people life is more vague than that. Maybe that person who you think isn't very rational stumbled upon a really rational belief and practice by accident. Maybe it only works in one aspect of their lives but if they have a brilliant way of doing that, which I believe almost everyone has at least one or two brilliant revelations inside of them, then it's more like there are points where your wisdom quality will increase and decrease.

So I still believe that the best argument in favor of interacting with other socially is the anti fragile one. You lose almost nothing trying to be social and forcing yourself to do so for one full minute per person at a party. If you get bored or if you decide you don't like it you can always leave but you may get lucky. And if you make it a point to be social over a long enough time You are almost guaranteed to be lucky because unexpected people will be there.

More importantly she even said that the only reason she would have to interact with other people and introduce them to rationalism if she wants to do that then she should be a good rationalist and be a fun person to be around. There is a terrible terrible stereotype of the Vulcan rationalists without emotions who only talks about analytical things if you want to be a real rationalist you have to figure out how to deal in a world without everyone following rationalism and you can't just lament that they're not as smart as you you have to set an example explain it where it is relevant and socially okay so that people are willing to listen and actually change their behaviour and more importantly you need to be the kind of person that people want to copy

*** This reminds me of a point Tetlock makes in Superforecasting; he describes a thing that almost all of the forecasters who performed extremely well over a 4 year rigorous forecasting tournament shared: a 'dragonfly-eyed' perspective, or in other words a tendency to actively include multiple external points of view. The general makeup of a 'superforecaster' seemed to correspond to a careful, rational thinker, after reading through the whole book, so it seems relevant to dig into this 'multiple perspective' idea.

Here's one slightly more detailed explanation. So, there's studies about how averaging lots of people's estimates can actually produce really good estimates taken together, granted on problems where observers have any chance of being able to forecast at all (kinda pointless to ask a crowd to forecast the psi of a gust of wind 20 years from now in a South African diamond mine). However, there's potentially even better forecasts possible if you *extremize* that calculation. That means 70% -> 85% probability and 30% -> 15% probability, or something similar. The intuition is that scraps of useful information are spread across many observers; if those observers all knew all of the information, they would update their forecasts to be stronger. Turns out by extremizing the 'wisdom of the crowd' measure, they were able to beat out the 'wisdom of the crowd' (based on what I understood). So, including lots of perspectives actually makes you more accurate (but you do still have to incorporate those perspectives well and update with care, and have an eye to the underlying causal relationships too, and so on and so on....)

Anyway, incorporating multiple points of view is directly beneficial to anyone who wants to become stronger rationally, it seems. (There are probably more direct ways to argue this point)

Besides the other benefits, like feeling contentment (social contact seems important for this) and discovering new allies. I personally can't imagine having grown half as much in general without all the social experiences I've had at work/college, including meaningless blather.

*** There are two issues here. The first is friends. All her points are quite valid. Although surrounding oneself with friends that motivate, inspire, and help one make progress toward one's goals will indeed help her in achieving her goals, the opposite is also true. She's said there are no people of the former class near her location; for her to then go out and cultivate a friend into the above description, or seek out people that fit that criteria, is extremely suboptimal - one should not place that expectation upon her. It sounds like she has many online friends whose company she values; her social skills will not atrophy. Her acceptance of her situation is rational given her goals, and will not have costs to her emotional health.

The second issue is the human need for in-person socialization. This appears to be a concern you haven't raised with her, and of which she might not be aware. Rare is the human whose happiness will not suffer when isolated from in-person, one-on-one interaction for a prolonged period of time. This interaction need not be any deeper than eye contact and a smile, jest, and/or thanks; each interaction hardly costs any time, and the benefits to one's mental health granted by even twenty minutes of such interaction will be well worth her time. It's also an opportunity for her to exercise her social brain in-person, as online interaction, even via video, isn't quite the same.

I feel the need to say this because I think other advice offered here strawman her concerns, and conflate the above two issues.

I don't think you've given us enough information to judge whether she has social anxiety or awkwardness that is influencing her reasoning. To mitigate whatever influences that might or might not be impairing her ability to reason as a rational agent, I offer this advice: Evincing to her that you come from a position of agreement with her goals, present any advice or suggested courses of action not as criticism but rather as refinements to her plans.

Yes, spending time with people will tend to make you more like those people. Deliberately walling yourself away from people will, I think, make one more extreme in one's views. Not occasionally discussing one's views with others removes a number of sanity checks - it's often true that one does not notice the flaws in one's own beliefs and opinions (confirmation bias makes this very hard to do through self-study alone, and discussing an idea only with people who already subscribe to part of it risks forming an ingroup that runs into a group form of confirmation bias).

So... there /is/ a cost, in time and other ways, to having a social life. But it's also a buffer against a number of self-reinforcing mental biases. If, somehow, your friend is always perfectly correct about anything and everything, then it would be too costly to have any social life, at all...

...but if she /thinks/ that she is that good, then I have to consider it significantly more probable that she is over-estimating her own correctness than that she is, in fact, that good. (Would that be egotistical bias?)

So, yeah. I can see a clear and obvious failure mode that starts with refusing all contact with regular friends, and ends with spending several years and a lot of effort in pursuit of something which, in hindsight, turns out to be the /wrong thing/ to do - perhaps trying to make everyone happy in a way that turns out to be equivalent to forcing wireheading on the world or something.

More generally, the coursework moves through material at the pace of the typical student. Therefore, a student who's significantly more gifted than their peers will naturally be able to master material quicker by themselves.

******* I agree with [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]] here. Professors are usually experts in the field, and will usually know more than you will learn in your whole undergrad career about the class subject. There are exceptions, like when you do research in the class topic and your professor doesn't, but that doesn't happen often. I also find it hard to believe that anyone will learn more in 50-70 minutes of reading a textbook than by spending the same amount of time paying attention in a lecture environment with a person you can ask questions to.

I mean, in retrospect it was a terrible idea that quite likely pushed me into a depressive state for months at a time, but academically it wouldn't have changed much.

The lecture notes contained much of the same material as the lectures themselves, and what they didn't I could get from textbooks at the library. And most professors took more questions outside the lectures (during breaks and via e-mail) than during them.

*** Even if one somehow manages to get into a good university, attending classes tends to be an effective way to learn when one's academic ability in the subject is lower than that of a typical student. Otherwise everyone's going to be moving too slow and time is wasted.

The usefulness of lectures and group sessions depends on a variety of variables outside of the student's control, such as the talents of the teacher and peers, the financial state of the university and so on. On the other hand, there are usually several good textbooks to choose from for every subject, and it's fairly easy to acquire the very best ones. Given decent studying skills, a combination of google, wikipedia, stack exchange and the best textbooks on the subject (and related fields as well) is very hard to compete with. A small group of closely matched students working in close coordination with an education-focused professor would probably achieve somewhat better results, but that's not how education in universities works at all.

As you can tell, I'm in complete agreement with your friend as far as efficiency of self-study goes.

In regard to the issue of friends and social life, the optimal solution is to hang out with fellow rationalists and effective altruists, I think. This satisfies the monkey-brain's need for meatspace social interaction and keeps one healthy, without forcing one into interactions with idiots. Not to mention the fact that there is a bunch of ways to cooperatively use social effects for various benefits, such as using public commitment and peer pressure to overcome motivation problems.

** WARNING: SPIDERS

I find it interesting that both the socjus tribe, and the anti-socjus tribe want basically the same thing (equality for everone) and yet have polarised into two camps that seem to spend hours every day demonising and ridiculing each other instead of productively working together toward their shared goal.

Society has an alarming amount of both misogyny and misandry, of predjudice in all directions, and all but the fringe crazies of both tribes believe these things to be terrible tradgedies to be rectified.

And then /instead of working together rectifying them/ they waste time drawing comics and writing blog posts depicting the other tribe as disgusting pathetic bigots.

As far as I can tell, the socjus tribe thinks the anti-socjus tribe are rapey neckbearded redpillers, and the anti-socjus tribe thinks the socjus tribe are cultish violent hypocrites.

And /sure/ there are /elements/ of these things in both tribes, but they tend to be vocal minorities, right at the edges. For the most part, if you tabooed any gender-politics jargon and took a person from each tribe and got them to talk to each other, they'd actually find they have very similar views.

That they hate each other so much just seems to boil down to standard us vs them tribalism.

And socjus vs anti-socjus isn't the /only/ place where I've noticed this bizzare trend of people with common values dividing into two tribes that spend more time mudslinging each other than trying to acheive their goals.

So I'm wondering if you all have any ideas for getting people to drop their pointless tribalism and actually work together on shared goalstates.

***** The practice of rationality is individualized. It makes sense for there to be a repository of mental techniques and behaviors and a systematized way to teach each one (CFAR), but there is no such thing as a "style" or "form." I cannot think of a single reason why making disparate and unitary "styles" of rationality would be useful when you can judge pieces of evidence and techniques on their individual value to you in your current situation, like everything else in the world. A categorization of techniques, perhaps, but this still does not approach "styles."

Rationality is one thing: "Doing what works," subject to your own beliefs and values. If you're saying it should be anything else, please give actual reasons.

As I said, I don't think the idea of a "form" of rationality is useful. "Their own," however, is something I can get behind. As I said, I believe learning and practice should be developed in a manner subjective to the individual's circumstances and goals. I mean, that kind of thing is pretty much an antithesis of "styles" or "forms."

I mentioned CFAR. They do week-long seminars, I believe. They're the only real example of a "rationality dojo" I can think of, other than perhaps meetings in the Bay Area (the most concentrated group), though that is undoubtedly not as systematized.

Other than that, there is no physical location, though I wish there were. The Internet is both a good and a bad thing in this sense: communities have a much broader scope, but a much harder time connecting in real life.

I realized I may be misunderstanding you. Do "their own forms" mean discovering /novel/ biases, concepts, and behaviors? I think it is more important to first develop your fundamentals. There is a use for the analogy of martial arts in this case.

"When you can take the pebble from my hand, it will be time for you to leave."

I don't want to end on that condescending quote, so I'll end with my opinion. I think we probably agree regarding your actual question, but the way you express yourself is somewhat incoherent and otherwise hard to understand. I think you're focusing on aesthetics ("Minervan arts" and the extended metaphor of martial arts in general) to a fault. I'll leave it at that, I don't want to be too presumptuous.

****** First I would like to explain by saying I was using the talk to text function on my phone. I should have double checked that it had actually typed what I had intended to say. That is why they are huge sections of my message that are very jumbled up.

Second I will address the idea I brought up of forms martial arts and mental martial arts. I know that you may believe that I am over focusing on this analogy but that's because I don't believe we have gotten all the value out of the analogy we can once we have we can discard it. The reason that martial arts exist is that people who are not naturally strong or fast discovered individual techniques that could be put together and become a force equalizer. The difference in the martial arts comes from both the environment in which of martial arts were developed to be used and the basic premises upon which understanding of the body was built. In the same way I can imagine that each culture could be equivalent to the environment in this analogy. I would love to see a systematic study of biases across cultures. My gut tells me that while certain problems exist in every culture both the language and history of each culture would make them immune to certain biases and highly vulnerable to others. An example of this is that Arabic culture, I would be willing to bet, has a slightly higher rate of optimism bias because everyone in the culture, Muslim and Christian, is highly religious and discussing something not happening that you want is almost implying that God can't do it which is very taboo. By that same token their profound faith makes both of the major religions in the area regularly practice both in financial terms and in time work with the poor. This means that most of the Arabic people I have met how much better empathy when it compares to wealth. I'm willing to say that this may be all in my head and more importantly I don't believe there's enough data currently for anyone to have a clear understanding of what I'm saying is right or wrong but I'm going to keep using it because this belief is made my mental map more accurate. The second part is what you believe about the mind and more importantly how you design your Minervan art to reduce cognitive energy cost. This leads into my use and defense of the works of Nassim Taleb. I will be comparing him against classic rationality from less wrong but I want to make it clear that I understand that neither of these guys has divine wisdom written in stone.

When I first read about less wrong I was very enthusiastic to the point of fanaticism. If it wasn't for the introduction of happy death cult spirals in the very basics I can easily see how rationality would have become one. But the problem was that while I now know of these biases and even had some better ways of thinking so that I would have the less of this affecting my decisions in the future I still did not have a clear set of instructions on how to build my mental muscles. In fact I found there to be very little discussion about ego depletion at all. I call this the first arrogance and first fiction of rationalism that someone has the mental energy to be rational and to use a rational thought process consistently.( I would recommend looking into the book Thinking Fast and thinking slow by Daniel Kahneman one of the founders of heuristics and bias research. He says that our brains are not actually that good of reasoning in logic and in fact using what he calls your system to rational brain is exhausting literally the same as running a hundred meter sprint in most ways to your body! )

If you want be able to do that all the time you need some kind of exercises. This is where I feel that less wrong rationality could be improved. Because it takes a long time between when you first read these things and become constantly vigilant of your own psyche before they start to become second nature. The threshold to success is rather high using that system. Talib points out in his books that there is a heuristic that can be added at the beginning of every single decision that is extremely simple to implement extremely simple to explain to others and once used properly can have profound effects on the long term. That double sided heuristic is to ask 1) where in my reasoning and in this goal could a Black Swan event, that is to say an event which is not only unpredicted but also unpredictable at the current moment because you lack information, ruin my plans or strengthen them. And 2) is the system or project I'm about to work on fragile or anti fragile which from a mathematical perspective can be defined as how well will this system and/or object deal with a sudden change or surprises or Black Swan events.

The rest of his books describe different places where people make the mistake of either assuming that black swans do not happen or how to apply his anti fragility thinking to real life and those things are useful. But the truth is just using those first two rules, which is much easier to explain to someone and to have them start doing right away, is a mental force equalizer. Especially because in the long run unpredictable things tend to have a much bigger impact then small subjective changes. Applying just these two rules for a normal person will make them invest and act as intelligently as some of the best investors and risk managers in the world. I am willing to say and that maybe this does not constitute a whole style for every person. For me I believe there is enough depth to explore for a while and that is good enough for me but I can understand the other side.

I guess a better way to summarize it is that for it to count as a mental martial art it not only needs to create techniques by which you practice strengthening your mind against ego depletion and making rational choices second nature it also needs to provide a coherent strategy for creating a personal worldview. I assume, but I may be incorrect, that different mental Practice will naturally lead to the discovery of new biases that can be defended against. Also I know this is going to end up as a block of text because I am doing this on my phone but I wanted to say thank you for not only pointing out the unreadability of my earlier post but calling me out to become more specific

Are you still using it?

I would bet that different cultures have different incidence of biases, just as different cultures seem to have different incidence of psychological disorders. People also have different brains that work in different ways and have problems with different things, with biases as with mental dysfunction. This does not point to "styles" being a useful metaphor, this points to individualized training. Psych treatment does not involve treating people as discrete groups with uniform prescriptions.

#+begin_quote
  This leads into my use and defense of the works of Nassim Taleb. I will be comparing him against classic rationality from less wrong but I want to make it clear that I understand that neither of these guys has divine wisdom written in stone.
#+end_quote

There is no such thing as "classical rationality." There is no alternative to distinguish it as "classical" from anything else. You have provided nothing to say that anything in Taleb's works are somehow /exclusive/ of rationality as it is known. /The exclusivity is what I am denying./

#+begin_quote
  [third paragraph]
#+end_quote

You are fundamentally misunderstanding what the effective practice of rationality is. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/09/constant-vigilance/][It does not require logical reasoning such as doing expected value calculations and brainstorming in your head.]] Paper and calculators are entirely fine for that purpose, and tools certainly help to explicate and develop mental models, but this is not how you counteract biases, it is how you form /strategies/ for things you /don't do every ten minutes./ Nor is it the paradigm of reductionist and algorithmic mathematical thought, though that certainly helps literally everything. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/][The practice of rationality is a number of habits and behaviors performed below the five-second level.]] [[http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/p/microrationality.html][Tortoise skills.]]

#+begin_quote
  [fourth paragraph]
#+end_quote

1. Taleb did not invent the concept of unknown unknowns, and the idea of asking "Where in my plans will unknown unknowns occur?" is literally useless. What you do to counteract unknown unknowns is to diversify your strategy and reserve more resources to offset risk than you think you otherwise need to.
2. Robustness, resilience, adaptability. And second of all, you should not be asking "Is the system fragile?", you should be asking "How can the system be made more robust?"

Additionally, I will point out that

#+begin_quote
  it takes a long time between when you first read these things and become constantly vigilant of your own psyche before they start to become second nature
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  there is a heuristic that can be added at the beginning of every single decision
#+end_quote

is selectively applying your complaint. It would take no longer for any one LW/CFAR technique to be well-trained as second nature than it would for Taleb's /one/ technique.

Now, either you're complaining that rationality techniques expend energy via System Two thought, or it takes too long to train rationality techniques as System One thought. You don't get both.

#+begin_quote
  Applying just these two rules for a normal person will make them invest and act as intelligently as some of the best investors and risk managers in the world.

That claim is patently ridiculous. I will not even entertain argument on it unless you have compelling evidence.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It does not constitute a "whole style" for /any/ person.

#+begin_quote
  For me I believe there is enough depth to explore for a while and that is good enough for me but I can understand the other side.
#+end_quote

I believe this is your way of rationalizing a suboptimal choice to reduce choice fatigue. What you are describing is /literally one concept./ While it might be a place to start, you are claiming it as a "whole and alternative style" that is "good enough for you." It may be good enough for you, just as rejecting rationality concept and techniques entirely may be good enough for you. But this does not actually reduce your epistemological biases, or even any other instrumental biases. All it does is make you a better planner than you already were, /without even allowing for any other means of becoming a better planner./

*** Taleb gets talked about a lot, but I find his books needlessly long for the amount of information they convey.

It boils down to...

1) Don't assume everything is a Normal curve.

2) The sum of the smallest probabilities can often be big enough that the probability of at least one of those events occurring is fairly high.

3) Some predictions have such a large margin of error that they are basically useless.

4) Don't trust prediction markets, stock prices, etc. They can easily be wrong.

And don't assume you can transform everything into a Normal curve either. Sometimes you just have to go nonparametric and that's okay.

** *Seeking socio-econo-political organizing methods*

How many useful ways are there for an uploaded mind, an em, to organize copies of itself to maximize the accuracy of their final predictions?

The few that I've been able to think of:

- "Strict hierarchy". DPR.2.1 can advise DPR.2, but DPR.2's decision overrides DPR.2.1's.
- "One em, one vote". DPR.2 gets a vote, and so does DPR.2.
- "One subjective year, one vote". DPR.2.1 is running twice as fast as DPR.2, and so DPR.2.1 gets twice as many votes.
- "Prediction market". The DPRs implement some sort of internal currency (which, thanks to blockchains, is fairly easy), and make bets, receiving rewards for accurate predictions.
- "Human swarm". Based on [[https://www.singularityweblog.com/unanimous-ai-louis-rosenberg-on-human-swarming/]] .

How many reasonably plausible methods am I missing?
