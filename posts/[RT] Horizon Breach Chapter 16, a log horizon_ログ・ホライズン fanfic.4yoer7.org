** Caught up.

Definitely becoming much better now, and the fight scene, while it would need some improvements, was pretty well done.

Not a bad idea to just send the characters back home, since it's so difficult for them to come back. Should clear up the roster quite nicely, while providing a clear understanding of the strength of Nureha.
