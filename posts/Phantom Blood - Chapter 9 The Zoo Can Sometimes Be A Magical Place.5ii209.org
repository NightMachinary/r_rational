** This is a rational murder mystery in an urban fantasy setting. Well, at least it /tries/ to be rational. I'm not really sure how well I'm doing on that front. Chapters go up every Thursday. If you're in the mood for "Anime!Dresden Files" then check it out!

**** It's my avatar on FictionPress. My username over there is Kyubey the Kid. I don't know why it shows up, though. Maybe see this as a tone promise? My aim is to write something as dark as Madoka, after all.
