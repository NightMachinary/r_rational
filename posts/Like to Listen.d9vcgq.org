I've done an [[https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-7-the-key-to-every-door][audio narration]] of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20761817][The Key for Every Door]] by [[/u/CeruleanTresses]] which was the recent Secret Krampus story winner.

Full link here: [[https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-7-the-key-to-every-door]]

(I've changed the name of the podcast to "Rattle Fiction" and will be posting narrations on a regular (at least monthly) basis. I'm still waiting for Apple Podcasts to approve my [[http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:336066354/sounds.rss][RSS feed]] and just now submitted to Stitcher, Google Play, and Podbean, so more access is coming soon.)


** Thank you. The only time I have to myself is during my bike rides to and from work.

** Thanks for this :)

FYI: Looks like you forgot to update this second portion of the link in the OP. In the source it's like this: =[new_link](old_link)=. For people on mobile here's a corrected link [[https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-7-the-key-to-every-door]]
