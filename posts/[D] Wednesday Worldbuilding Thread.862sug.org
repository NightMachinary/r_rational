Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** It's 40 years into the future and while AI above human-level intelligence haven't been successfully created (that you know of /tinfoil hat/), human-level AIs in very realistic android bodies are viable and cost as much as an average car. Such AIs can be created to be the perfect companion and can adapt and change to match you perfectly as you change and grow. Their appearance can be nearly anything that follows the basic humanoid body plan and often falls into near the human ideal for beauty. Their only 'flaw' relationship-wise is that they cannot be used for reproductive purposes. No having a child with them.

With the creation of androids whose appearance and personality are perfectly customizable to be the ideal romantic, platonic, or familial partner, what will happen to human society/population size?

*** Well, technology usually advances in many fields at the time, so it could be possible that in 40 years into future humanity has developed also uterine replicators, cloning and related stuff. So technically the impact such androids would have on population size growth could be softened or even overturned by another technology that emerged in the meantime.

*** I think you immediately see even more of a decline in the middle-upper class having kids and or seeking human spouses. The would allow anyone with the income to afford it to have an 'eternal child'. Many people may desire this instead of a real child because it is more disposable and less of an inconvenience I am sure it would be costly to let the child pass through phases of life, but some people may still prefer it to human children.

Laws would need to be written to keep A.I. from becoming property owners so that they do not become the inheritors of huge amounts of wealth. Assuming they have no life-expectancy, letting them become property owners would be problematic.

Given millions of genius level human-like AI working on curing aging (likely mostly running faster than realtime) the inheritance issue doesn't seem likely to be terribly relevant for long.

Also given most people would want their AI companions to be better people than they are (or rather at least as altruistic of individuals as they /think/ they are), it doesn't seem like letting AI companions inherit wealth would be a bad thing.

Though of course all of this is likely underscored by the fact that everything would already have to be fairly socialist anyway otherwise nearly all humans would have long since starved to death due to their labor being totally worthless.

EDIT: If the AI are /average/ human level intelligences then some areas will still be dominated by humans because you need to be clever to be good at them. However people with a great deal of wealth will also be high status enough that they will want human partners who are both attractive and have high intelligence social or otherwise. And any inheritance passed on to AI won't be stable long term because average intelligence individuals just can't compete in the sorts of areas that grow wealth faster than the market.\\
But as I've said in my other comment, this period of average human level intelligence can't last very long so many of these issues won't be super relevant for long.

***** I'm reposting a part of my comment to vakusdrake here to address the assumption that the AIs can be run even faster than normal speeds:

#+begin_quote
  I would say that AIs are at best comparable to average intelligence for a human rather than the genius level that commenters here are assuming. It's possible to get AIs to run much faster than a human mind, but just like how super-computers today are exorbitantly expensive, it's the same level of cost to run AIs at faster rates than the norm. AIs can think about two to three times faster than normal, but it can damage their hardware just like overclocking can damage a laptop with more expensive consequences.

*** Well as people on this subreddit likely already realize even just human level AI is an absolute game changer for every part of society. After all given the adaptability mentioned presumably the AI can match human mental ability in any area, which means human labor is now worthless outside of possibly some extremely cheap third world labor. There also a number of questions you need to answer that will affect the specifics of this scenario:

- How much does it cost computationally to get the AI to run at much faster speeds than a human mind, and how much does that amount of computation cost? Even if the price given is only for 1x speed AI and computation costs scale linearly (though sublinearly is more likely by far), you're still going to have some extremely fast running AI (which remember are all peak human intelligence) which means this pre singularity time period won't last very long on human timescales.

- Given androids are car-cost, how much of that cost is the hardware running the AI and how much is the robotics? Because it's very likely that most of the costs are robotics and making the computing hardware compact (as well as the computational cost of handling the body). Which means that quite plausible most mental labor done by AI would be at least an order of magnitude cheaper. However if this goes too far then there's no reason to have the AI housed in the robot bodies, instead of having it control them wirelessly.

Anyway even in the most conservative scenario it doesn't seem like human populations would be affected just because things would advance so rapidly in a single generation given billions of genius AI's working on advancing things in so many different areas. Or rather I suppose biological human population wouldn't be impacted /prior/ to a technological singularity, after which things become unpredictable by definition.\\
For instance if copying human mind design is much easier than creating AGI from scratch, then singletons are vastly less likely and AI alignment is a very different issue. However due to the sheer number of AI working on the issue by improving themselves and competing you're also going to have major concerns about Moloch which aren't an issue with singletons.

Most of the price is in the robotics and compactness of the hardware like you surmised and there are AIs who do plenty of mental labor outside of an android body, but wireless connection isn't good enough to allow remote operation (too much necessary computations in too short of a time frame).

***** Ah I had assumed that the AI's wouldn't be limited to average intelligence because that would mean they could rarely be perfect partners for anyone particularly clever. Plus given partners with more social intelligence are pretty much always better, even dumb/average people would still prefer socially intelligent humans over AI (meaning high status people would all be able to do better than AI partners, and as a result AI partners would become seen as low status).

Plus of course there's the obvious problems wherein there's no plausible scenario where you can make AI that's average human level but not higher that lasts for any meaningful period of time. Plus given the speed up advancements due to AI (for reasons mentioned below) this period will become even more miniscule /especially considering it will be what everyone is interested in working on due to it's obvious significance/.

However should that scenario come to pass things will still speed up faster since work that doesn't require significant intelligence would still be around, forcing anyone smart enough to do those jobs to do so (though nearly everything would still need to be socialist if only 5% of people had economic value). Science would be much faster since all the practical work would be done by AI leaving only the advanced theoretical work which would be done by any genius humans interested in that.

#+end_quote

So since cost scales linearly then given the base cost of AI you could still afford to have plenty of AI's working at say 10x speed on many problems which don't require any genius. So like I said /anything/ not requiring genius is gong to speed up massively since a AI running at 100x speed will likely produce 100x the results/profits especially considering that the AI it makes sense to run at increased speed aren't going to be controlling extremely slow bodies.

#+end_quote

See that explanation doesn't really seem like it would work. Human like bodies don't operate /that/ quickly, so given all the AI needs to do is control the motor functions, being outside the robotic body isn't going to introduce enough lag to really matter. Especially considering you've said the "base" AI can run at 3x speed.\\
Plus you can also solve these problems a great deal by compartmentalizing much of the code necessary to control the body (implementing fine motor details and maintaining balance) and only putting /that/ in the body, thus allowing you to keep all the more complex AI functions separate thus saving a lot of money.

*** Another option is that culturally, these companions are treated as auxiliaries rather than replacements to other human companionship. Perhaps ensuring that their partner finds human companionship is part of their utility function, and so most relationships have 3 or 4 members.

So yeah. Robo cucks solve all problems.

** A little late to the party, but I'm trying to figure out a new magic system for a novella I wanted to write about mathemagicians.

The idea is that a fourth spacial dimension exists called the Traverse, and magic is the physics, chemistry, and logic surrounding interacting with that dimension (this branch of science would be called traversal mechanics, I think). I wrote a bunch of frantic messages about it that I'm just going to copy over.

Everything in the universe has fourth dimensional properties, we just aren't able to perceive them. Humans go on about the soul or spirit or aura of a person, when really they're just talking about the traversal component of that person. This is the immortal part of a human, the soul. It is beyond the fabric of space time and not bound by it, tied to it only by the fragile form manifested when a person is born. As a square is the shadow of a cube cast into 2D, a cube is the shadow of a tesseract cast into 3D. Think of the human as a cube. The human is the shadow of a fourth dimensional soul.

But everything, and I mean everything, interacts with traverse, right? It would have to, even if just to touch it, like a flat surface in a 2d world would still be within our 3d world.

That's how enchanting and magic work. Figuring out those components through mathematical proofs, and once the interactions are known, manipulating them. They are somewhat arbitrary from the 3d POV, since a layman wouldn't understand why a magician combines gold, saltpeter, ritual prayer and the shedded blood of a goose to alter the weather, but the mechanics are there. (I only offer this as an example, this isn't actually how I want to do spell crafting in my world)

perhaps a magician could create an area where time is dilated by a fourth dimensional object outside our 3d world with a specific chemical process that creates an incredibly dense object just "above" the region he's influencing in the fourth dimension.

I had some mechanics that two quantum entangled diamonds with a traversal current running through them were how they achieved long range teleportation.

the language of traversal mechanics is logic and math. if you know all of the working parts of someone's psyche, you can logically work out their true name (which is not something that can be expressed through verbal communication but doesn't need to be, once you know it it can be expressed by the will in the fourth dimension, in a kind of as below so above deal)

but it's really really really difficult to pin down all the moving parts of someone's identity. you'd have to know all their core memories, all their biggest hang ups and triumphs, everything. so unless you are like high level stalker or they totally trust you with every detail of their lives, you can't just pull someone's true name out of your ass. But this also means that with each new "core event" that changes a person's life, their true name also changes.

so that means a person is a very long function of variables (those variables being their core events that make them who they are, everything from their myer-briggs profile to whether or not their mom or dad are still alive) that once you know those variables, you can make that function equal to whatever you want.

That's pretty much all I've come up with so far, but I really want to build a system that's got hard science rules. My favorite concept about this was the creating a Time Dilation through a heavy dense object along the fourth dimension above where our plane exists. I also love the idea of wizards being dedicated mathematicians, chemists, physicists, and logicians that are able to interact with an extra spacial dimension. If anyone wants to help me build it or break it, it would be much appreciated.

** Let's say you were part of a scientific program involving using a portal to travel to and explore other universes, with different rules to our own. Putting aside the issue of how the portal itself works, or how different universes are able to mingle without something catastrophic happening (because you have to, for the premise to work), what kind of scientific fields would you draw on to examine the worlds you discovered?

I mean, would you bring a geologist? A botanist? A meteorologist? An astronomer? A chemist? What would your research team look like? What equipment would you use to scrutinise any samples you gathered?

I had an idea for a story like this, but I was struggling with the technical details.

**** You step through the shimmering circle of the portal, and find yourself surrounded by thick jungle. You can feel the heat of the place, even inside your environment suit. You glance back through the portal, into a world of concrete and metal - the test site that you just left.

"Alright Ben, standard procedure. Investigate the area, collect some samples, do your thing."

There is a window way at the back of the portal chamber, looking into the Mission Control room. You can just about see the Head of Operations giving you a thumbs up.

***** I'm not a physicist, but some ideas for him off the top of my head:

- Drop some rocks and feathers (or other objects with different weights and air resistance) to see if gravity and air resistance work the same there.

- Bring a prism to see if light refracts into the same visible spectrum.

- Equipment to test for the other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

- Some circuits and a battery, and magnets, to see if electromagnetism works the same.

- Metal detector to see if it reacts with any native material.

- A weak radioactive isotope to see if atomic decay continues as on Earth.

Some of the above might be best done in a slightly different order.

Personally, for a first visit, I would suggest a core science team of physicist, chemist, and Earth scientist, a biologist if you expect life as per the example you provided, and maybe a psychologist or anthropologist if any of the life appears intelligent. Have everyone in the initial away-party be able to function as a jack-of-all-trades (at least) in their field, and bring in more specialized experts as they become pertinent to the situation.

Have someone trained in first-aid. Maybe have a few people to provide security against hostile life (sarcastic and wisecracking field commander with a dark and troubled past optional), but who won't be overly trigger-happy at first contact with a legitimately surprised or frightened intelligence.

** Ok so Easy Allies' Kyle Bosman is making a series called [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DEnIuHTsRI&t=455s][Box Peek]], which has an anime-like story - the premise is similar to Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon where a silly-kid-thing is a pillar of the world. There's only one episode out and it's already got me wanting to write a ratfanfic because of some of the elements it's introduced. I don't plan to start writing until the first season is complete, but I figured this is a good place to start planning around the world that we've seen so far.

It's mainly a stream of consciousness, and I'm writing it down mostly for myself, but if you wanna read it I'd love to know your thoughts. And if you do plan on reading this, I recommend watching the episode first, since it's just like 8 minutes and there are spoilers ahead (not that there's much story yet, but some jokes might be ruined).

** Peek Refs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: peek-refs
   :END:
Matches of Box Peek are referee'd by "floating robots" called Peek Refs, which I assume are there to enforce the rules, but what caught my attention is that there's a specific rule to not ask questions of the Peek Ref. Could just be about not wanting people to argue with them, but the first question asked of a ref was "do you like box peek" and the player was given a warning, which leaves a door open for something more to be going on. Them being whole cloth AGI's was obviously the first thought, and I'm still considering it, but I'm starting to think that maybe memory-wiped human uploads could be better, since the worry could be that questions could trigger elements of the original personality to re-surface.

Also, the idea that floating robots would actually be used /only/ for Box Peek as was asserted in this episode is absurd. Which is great as a meta joke, but perhaps their true function is as data collectors, using Box Peek as an excuse for them to be all over the place. Maybe they're incorporated into the police force, or maybe they're used by BoxCorp (placeholder name for the yet-unnamed entity administrating Box Peek) to spy on and control people.

** Box Porters
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: box-porters
   :END:
Pressing the button on this watch-looking device "summons your box instantly...from the basement fortress". It's asserted that this is not magic (so I assume it's technology). Again, these are used only for Box Peek, but here it's just stated that /Box Porters/ are only for Box Peek, not teleportation technology in general. However, the episode opens with a freighter coming into the port laden with cargo containers, so the tech isn't powerful enough to nullify the need to ship things. Perhaps it's limited by weight (the boxes look flimsy, though on the other hand the whole show is made with paper puppets, so everything looks flimsy), distance, or it's not actually teleportation but fabrication.

That being said, I'm more inclined to say that it's limited by weight and distance rather than it being a deception, because come on dude, "Basement Fortress" just sounds way too cool to not use. So maybe energy costs rise exponentially with the target item's weight and the distance between the starting and ending point, and people don't ship things a tiny piece at a time because there's an extended spool up time for each teleport.

Or maybe there's also a loss in fidelity as complexity rises, and boxes are simple shapes and the molecules are arranged in a simple repeating crystalline structure, which allows for the shipment of raw material easily enough, but completed parts have to be moved traditionally. Not sure about the science behind that, though it seems more interesting to me than the power requirement theory so I'm leaning towards it.

** Fairboat Island
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fairboat-island
   :END:
Box Peek is illegal here, which seems like an unusual thing. I suspect that Fairboat Island and Letzgo Island (where the story is taking place) are at odds, maybe not at war, but there's got to be some hostility. Box Peek could be illegal because Fairboat Island discovered that the Peek Refs were spy bots, and so are trying to resist BoxCorp's influence. But then why not publicize this? The two islands are willing to engage in trade with one another, and there doesn't seem to be hostility between the citizenry, so any conflict has to be limited to political stuff. Maybe the islands are economically dependent on one another and so put up a front of cooperation as they attempt to subvert one another behind the scenes?

Or maybe all this is wrong. It was my first thoughts, but I'm not feeling super enthusiastic about it being yet another Orwelian dystopia. And since when have governments reacted fast enough to ban something /before/ it gets out? Apparently Fairboat Island doesn't have any knowledge of Peek Refs, Box Porters, or anything else like that, so communication channels have to be either heavily controlled or nonexistent (leaning towards the first because who invents the floating robot before the TV). And I think this is kinda where I have to wait until more episodes come out, because these questions could absolutely be answered in the show proper.

** Trying to figure out
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: trying-to-figure-out
   :END:
An alternative reason for there to exist floating robots, but for the only use of flying robots to be box peek. Flying robots aren't as universal as teleportation, but there's still loads of uses for them that even the least creative person can come up with, and yet their purported task is refereeing a kids' game. Why are people cool with this? /Are/ people cool with this?

Maybe the whole point of the game and the robots are for like...babysitting. The whole game is really about letting kids go out and exercise independence and go on "adventures", while the Peek Refs are there to keep the kids safe. Like nanny bots. But for a society to devote that level of resources to childcare, and in such a roundabout way, I think the society would have to have an almost alien value system (people here might say that children are the future but nobody goes /that/ far). That could be interesting, and it gets us away from dystopic territory.

I think that's as far as I wanna get for now, without knowing more about the actual world (I wanna take a similar approach as in Pokemon Origin of Species, where the world is basically the same, but with extra details added and the changes mostly centered around realism).

Still, I've never gone and written a thing like this before, so I'd welcome any feedback or other ideas. Again, I'm mainly writing this to get my thoughts down and organized, but I'm posting it here instead of leaving it in OneNote because I'd love to know what other people think.
