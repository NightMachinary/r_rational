Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Talking about rational fiction ruining normal fiction, Re Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is sadly way less consistent than I hoped it would be.

Pity, I love those kinds of time loop/reset/redo stories.

*** Anime\Manga suffer from this in general, unfortunately --- I think I would be hard-pressed to name even 10 different titles with actually consistent logic in this aspects. Often it seems like the writers just don't give a crap about plot consistency and are more interested in building (romantic) character relations, drawing backgrounds, etc.

I just don't get the point of things like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boku_Dake_ga_Inai_Machi][basing story's entire plot on time travel]] and then completely screwing up time travel and character motivations both. Urgh!

**** I just experienced this myself. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was my favourite anime for a long time. I've watched it twice now and the first time I didn't even know about modern rationality, let alone rational fiction. After watching it again, I was just... I guess more disappointed than anything. Part of the premise had potential, but it was filled with huge inconsistencies and terrible deathist / anti-progress morals. It killed my enjoyment of the good moments, and I ended up thinking that maybe anime just isn't for me any more.

About your problem with consistency. I think you mean the sudden tone shift to a SoL episode that seems to do almost nothing for us? If it's that, may I elaborate on that and tell you the author's intention behind that :)? You'll see that it isn't a case of lacking consistency but more like a way of setting something up in an unusual way.

********* I'll keep it spoiler free and just say that the checkpoints of his "ability" are tied to the reason he has this ability at all and how he was brought to this world.

Now about your Problem, which is completely fine to have by the way. I can't blame you for thinking like that since the content and character of this show only makes really sense to you once you see the result in Episode 5.

I guess you've noticed the various tone shifts from Light hearted And Genre-savy comedy to mysterious and dark, vice versa of course. It's always a back and forth.

This actually serves a certain purpose that the author plays around with at the start.

You could see it as two extremes clashing together.

On the one side you have Subaru's wrong expectations about this whole world and his situation. Due to his interests in games and such Subaru has the expectation of a cliche fantasy world, basically how it is portrayed in various games and other mediums. Episode 1A, parts of Episode 3 and the majority of Episode 4 were like that.

On the other side we have the harsh reality. Through moments like Episode 1B and Episode's 4 ending we have seen that this world is nothing like Subaru expects.

The fact that we still experience these light hearted genre-savy moments although we've learned how reality is in Episode 1B only leads you to one conclusion. We see the world in the eyes of Subaru.

Let's take Episode 1A. We had all this meta commentary and behavior because Subaru honestly expected this world to be like that, so we had an overall tone according to these false expectations.

Then Episode 1B happened and we got a climbse of how this world actually really is which resembled the other extreme. You could say that reality pushed back Subaru's expectations of a cliche Fantasy world for a moment, That's why the tone was extremely dark and tense for a short time.

Soon after that Subaru fell back into his behavior in Episode 3 because he thought he overcame this obstacle and he disregarded it as the enemy "the Hero from another world has to beat". He won in his book and that happens to be what is chsracteristic for cliche fantasy stories in his opinion.

Now to Episode 4. Subaru is still in this mindset of his and he actually believes that the whole thing with Elsa was the one thing he as the hero had to beat in order to get his happy end ( remember how he said he will get his happy end in Episode 3? ). Now what does Episode 4 resemble? It's basically him enjoying his supposedly happy ending. All he cares for at the moment are his desires which is basically Emilia, Emilia and Emilia. He even wants to earn his livelihood in a peaceful manner while he now enjoys his life to the fullest.

Once again Subaru's expectations of this world are a light hearted and peaceful fantasy world in which he will enjoy life. Sooner or later The episode becomes SoL like because this are his expectations now, to live a simple but peaceful life. Since we see life through his eyes we get a lighthearted episode.

Now what does the author achieve through this way of storytelling? He's basically setting up what will be major character development and a huge tone shift and episode 4's ending basically said to us "And exactly this will now begin".

The ending of Episode 4 shattered Subaru's false view on his own Situation in an instant. The exact opposite of what he expected from now on happened. He now realizes that he is part of something bigger, that the Situation he is in never ended.

You now might think: Why didn't the author do this earlier?

Well he didn't it earlier because the constant clashes of these two extremes serve one purpose. Making the shattering of Subaru's beliefs, expectations and dreams even more crucial. The author basically weighted Subaru in safety to make this whole Realization even harder on him.

If you don't expect anything at all and then everything is going to shit is nowhere near as harsh as having positive expectations and then getting these expectations destroyed in an instant.

So to sum it up, the author used a "show, don't tell" kind of way to build up to the moment he begins to emotionally and mentally break his character as well as introducing the true nature of this story.

You could say the author played Subaru and even us.

I Hope this helped :)

********** Thing is, the problem remains that Subaru's characterization is botched. He is a NEET and a long term gamer, yet it took him 3 restarts to even realize he was on a checkpoint system, despite him being characterized as so out of touch with reality that the moment he came into this world he started testing for superpowers...

Not only, but from your explanation itself Subaru's characterization doesn't make sense. Which gamer would EVER think the game is over after 1 boss fight, especially when the boss ran away? Which gamer wouldn't IMMEDIATELY start training after having died so many fucking times to the previous boss? Which gamer wouldn't be terribly curious on why Elsa wanted the crest in the first place?

At least for Kazuma (Konosuba) it made sense. He wasn't excited at all about being in that world. He just wanted to be left in peace to relax and enjoy life, which he did as soon as he could (in the novels). And every time he ended up fighting he did so unwillingly. But Subaru immediately and continuously shows enthusiasm and interest in the world, yet afterwards he doesn't push, in his growth, in his knowledge, in anything?

And even later, he doesn't act until his ass starts to burn, sometimes literally.

Plus, [[#s][which moron wouldn't wake up and stop behaving like a cretin after being burnt twice?]]

Though, now I would like to see Kazuma in this world. That would make for an amusing story.

EDIT: and let's not talk about the powers he absorbs being useless on him...

******* LOL I expected as much. Always get lots of flak from supporting the Incubators but if there's no other technique available the rational thing to do would be to continue the Soul Gem process until a more suitable form of energy became available.

Same with humans, we require coal and fossil fuels because we haven't yet developed a more efficient mean to power our machinery. We can't for example leave a hospital without energy just because the solar generator happened to work on a cloudy week.

And nuclear is a good option but we still haven't overcome the contamination and security risks (dirty bombs come to mind for example). Not to mention the economic interests at play that delay clean energy development.

Rebellion Kyubey felt even more like a bureaucrat interested in selfish gain actually. At least up to that point I considered their efforts as valuable and necessary but given that the risks involved in tampering with an universal and potentially conscious force were too big, there was no need to attempt it. Especially not in such a careless and direct way (explaining what was happening, not using escape valves or shutdown interrupters, something that is very common on industry and that an advanced civilization dealing with higher energy forms should have known even more).

********* For Gretchen I can understand given that she was planetary or galaxy scale at most. It was never explained in the series how much energy she produced but if it was enough to continue powering the universe until a new race emerged that could make up for the lack of humans (like if it took a million years for humans to appear and Gretchen can keep it going for ten million years) then I can understand the intention.

Also in the PSP game its explained how the Incubators are getting energy from other planets too and actually shows [[http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Itzli][the witch of a magical girl from outer space]] so the lack of one of their resources while potentially bad in case no race like humans appeared again is not universe ending.

Walpurgis was like a metheorologic phenomena and was city scale at most. It was like a forest fire that burns established structures and causes suffering to force more contracts at certain time periods. It laid dormant at other times and makes me think of the Endbringers from Worm.

Problem comes from Akuma Homura and Madokami given that those are universal scale at the least and have unknown properties, not to mention its unknown whether they retain sentience or not. Incurring the wrath of something that holds the power of a god isn't the wisest or most rational thing to do. I think its doable but proper caution should be taken as its a massive endeavor. Not something you can do by just "observing" the force in action and monologuing what you plan to do to the person that can stop you while at the same time not setting any countermeasures.

While Kyuubei's wish to lower the entropy of the universe is of course admirable, they can probably do better by mind raping a large number of suitable girls (if they are technologically sophisticated enough to cause illusions of their choice). Or really, just spawn someone like Homura, and gather immense amounts of energy from moving objects with 0 dt.

Actually I wrote a fanfic like that once, its called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9516592/1/198Homu][198Homu]]. Problem was that I think I took it too far and could have improved it. I'm trying to remake all my fics into rational ones and improve the quality.

The Homura attempt was good although I still think even more precautions should be taken. I mean it becomes a problem when the being of infinite potential has a say in the matter. It would be like creating someone like Dr. Manhattan with Ozymandias ambition. Or someone like Punisher/Rorschach with Manhattan's power which while good, is a huge risk to let loose on the world without means to stop it.

And thanks for the To the Stars recommendation. Its on my to read list and plan to once I catch up with Mother of Learning and Power Games.

Luckily I had an appointment with a professor of psychology who has sorted all that out, and I now have a piece of paper I can show at the next appointment and things seem to be moving in the right direction.

When you do get on meds, if the ones you get don't work perfectly in the first place, don't be afraid to ask after different kinds. I had issues with that as a kid -- one of the antidepressants I tried out made it really hard for me to get to sleep, and another made me lethargic.

** Now that the pathfinder campaign I DMed has drawn to a close, I'm gearing up to play in a new Bash campaign. One of the character ideas I was lobbing back and forth with a friend was a brilliant planner, a perfect strategist. From limited information he can perfectly deduce what's going on, or what's likely to go on, and use the tools available or make plans to deal with it. While you can use the Bash chargen system to make mages, psychics, superhumans, mutants, healers, people who have laser eyes, and so on, the actual rules are very flexible, and allow for someone to be made like this.

The basic problem, though, is that /I/ am not a perfect strategist. So, how do I make a character whose power is "very good at predicting things and is properly prepared" in Bash? Actually it's fairly simple, and quite hilarious. I take the Conjuring and Summoning powers, with the restriction being mundane things. So, as a player, I don't need to actually explain how I figured things out beforehand. I can just make things up post-hoc! For example:

/Ah, the hapless victim Donnie is actually Dr. Don Hieseldorf the mad scientist? Well... (rolls for conjuration)... you see, Dr. Hieseldorf, I saw through your disguise the moment you walked in. That red dust on your fingers, that only comes form 3 different mesas in the area, and the tear on your cuff would only come from a left-handed man using this kind of saw, whereas you were faking being right-handed. So, naturally, I deduced... etc etc. And that's why I'm now holding a plasma pistol that happens to counter your field effects! I've had it hidden on my person this whole time!/

or, for the summoning....

/Oh, the self-destruct mechanism is triggering a Pietium overload? Well, as it happens.. (rolls summoning)... from your microexpressions, I knew you were going to press a self-destruct button, and I already have a team of Pietium reactor engineers shutting down the reactor as we speak! How did I know it was a Pietium reactor? Simple, elementary even! it was the smell of almonds. which led me to believe.../

Basically roleplaying the character will be "post-hoc explanations and rationalizations: the game" to explain all his mundane summons and conjurations. Spending the entire sessions bullshitting every time my character does something, and having that actually be a mechanic, is going to be a lot of fun.

** Any Fate/Stay Night or Fate/Zero fans?

I woke up this morning thinking of how a rational Fate/Stay Night Holy Grail War would be. I assume either the masters would organize and sacrifice all the servants at the same time in the ritual to open the path to Akasha or grant the wishes without needless bloodshed or have some warfare Punisher style where everyone stays in their haven waiting for information on the other and doing lots of scouting.

I think learning the mystical and psychological weakness of the opponent would be essential and everyone would take measures to learn the enemy's identity without being discovered and procuring artifacts for scrying and mind reading/wiping.

I think as soon as a master was discovered the information would be made public and everyone would nuke the enemy haven to take him out and wait for another to be discovered to minimize exposure.

Either that or it would be about hiding all the time and wait for the other masters to slip and wipe each other although that wouldn't make for much of a compelling story.

Now as for the classes, I think a rational combatant would purposely avoid classes that require high upkeep or frontal assaults as that would expose to danger so no Saber, Berserker or Lancer classes. Probably Rider or Assassin would be the best bets given that most combatants are immune to Casters despite their sheer versatility and Archers have a certain knack for betraying their handlers.

Personally I think I'd choose a Rider given that they have high mobility which would be essential for scouting and hit and run tactics, generally good stats that make them able to hold their own against Sabers and Lancers along with a special and highly powerful ability which would be great as a last-resort/nuclear option in case there was no other escape and that would be a great end game.

Thoughts?

*** First of all, it seems to me that if I had knowledge that the previous ~4 times that the ritual known as the Holy Grail War was undertaken, everyone died and got nothing... the real winning move is to go to some city preferably not in Japan and bet that everyone would die again and again accomplish nothing, if the grail war had started up again. It seems like if you want to do something really fantastic with the power of the grail ritual then Counter Guardians etc will show up and kill you, and if you just want something mundane and easy then using another method than the grail war is probably easier.

That said, as far as rational actions go - if characters just murdered each other without playing the "I'm going to show off how cool I am and how much you suck" game, like 80% or more of the fights would have gone the other way. Waiting for the heroes allies to arrive instead of just killing them instantly, explaining things to your victims, doing really horrible stuff gratuitously for no payoff, giving people a fighting chance for no reason... among the canon cast for either of F/Z or F/SN, anyone who could keep their pride + sadism under control for a couple weeks would have really good odds of winning. Like, if in F/SN any of Caster or Illya or Gilgamesh had read the Evil Overlord's List they could make a pretty good go of winning the whole thing trivially.

***** It was shown that shirou was leeching off of archer's abilities. "Projection" copies not just the material item but the original user style and instincts, so shirou copying archer's blades basically resulted in shirou being uploaded with martial instincts he would have spent decades building specifically for him. Furthermore by the early climax archer was more less not really trying to kill shirou, while shirou was give it his all. Furthermore archer specifically is significantly weaker than basically every servant, in his fight with lancer he was described as being too slow to follow and fight the way most servants do, instead he has fighting style where he makes obvious openings for the explicit purpose of being able to deflect the obvious attacks there.

Basically archer is servant whose raw ability isn't that much on it's own, whose indeterminate on whether he really wanted to kill shirou, and was lacking peggy sue knowledge on shirou's abilities which were changed by his presence in the grail war.

*** Escapement's answer is the only really rational one for someone with sane human values... but if my reasoning is skewed enough or my motivation is warped enough (i.e. like most Magi) I see some other options. First, I don't think there is a single right answer, even given a single consistent set of values/goals, because the Meta of the war can change so much...

If you are against six other Magi, proper Magi that is, a seven way geass scroll ensuring that all of you will fight "fairly" or at least to some prearranged terms would make it almost rational to participate in the first place. The geass would guarantee the kind of fight Kayneth was expecting. The Magi's servants fight, and each magi fights each other, matching mystery for mystery in a proper duel. When a loser surrenders, they are allowed to go to the church and actually be safe. For a no name magi like Waver Velvet its a great opportunity to build reputation (canonically he ended up as one of 12 lords of Clocktower, a pretty high rank for someone with no crest, no OP mysteries or special techniques, no connection). For an established magi like Kayneth its a resume builder (show some fighting ability, network with your competitors, etc.). For a serious magi, even if the other 4 times have been a bust, it is still a much closer chance to getting to the root than they would otherwise have.

If the war is like the canonical 4th war, then a ruthless strategy of hiding and trying to catch each other off guard would probably be dominant. Kiritsugu was really close to winning in canon.

If the war is like the 5th war... if you are fighting to save bystander lives make friends with the other masters and just promise not to fight. If you are fighting to win, hide and let the other masters kill a few servants, then bomb their school (or workplace, or whatever other public location they are stupid enough to go to in the middle of a war) with powerful conventional explosives.

In general Beserker counters saber (and somewhat knight classes: lancer/rider), saber (and somewhat knight classes: lancer/rider) counters caster, caster with prep time counters anyone except saber, assassin counters any master alone but loses to any servant, assassin is hard countered by caster with territory creation. Rider strategy depends on NP.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If you are a powerful intelligent heir to a 8 generation magi family, I think the upkeep cost isn't an issue. If you possess some good defensive mystic codes, participating in the front line might even be a good trade-off for getting a servant without any kind of independent action.

#+begin_quote
  Either that or it would be about hiding all the time and wait for the other masters to slip and wipe each other although that wouldn't make for much of a compelling story.
#+end_quote

I think this would be the logical dominate strategy. If all the masters try this though, the ritual will fail because it needs at least some of the heroic spirits to die to even manifest the lesser grail. If the rest of the master hide but two of them are dumb enough to fight I would try to gank the winner, and then steal the lesser grail while the other masters hide.

#+begin_quote
  Personally I think I'd choose a Rider given that they have high mobility which would be essential for scouting and hit and run tactics,
#+end_quote

If I don't have a catalyst, assassin and try to gank the last surviving master after a week or two hiding. If I could pick any catalyst... maybe Gilgamesh. After summoning him, I would use all two or three command seals on a single order "Bind yourself in loyalty and obedience to me with the power of your treasures". Somewhere in the Gate Of Babylon I bet Gilgamesh has some obedience/loyalty inducing NPs. If he doesn't... maybe he will kill me quickly, or maybe I can blow the last seal and killing him. If he does... gg, I can then just have him Enuma Elish any serious competition. As for other servant choices... Nero can copy any skill, so if this war is jacked up and has more than 7 servants like Extra or Grand Order this might start to pay off in terms of shear number of skills copied. Emiya is a good choice for sheer versatility in an efficient package. He has a large array of NPs and can instantly identify other servants based on their weapon. Zealot Assassin from Strange/Fake has like the ability of all the other hassassins, if I can find some method guaranteed to persuade her not to instant kill me for being an infidel.

One more caveat though, I think the focus on raw power in a servant is only relevant prior to summoning. After summoning, its about teamwork and compatibility.

Edit: forgot to give credit that my idea with Gilgamesh was from a one-shoot fanfic snippet where Rin summons Gilgamesh. Can't remember where I saw it, so if anyone else has seen it and can credit author that would be nice.

The idea is that Gilgamesh should, in theory, have as least some mind magic Noble Phantasms somewhere within his Gate of Babylon. Given the shear number and variety of Noble Phantasms Gilgamesh has used in the various spinoff works, I think this is a reasonable assumption. You use the command seals to order him to use whatever mind magic NPs he has on himself to make himself loyal and obedient to you, presumably, the command seal effect can last long enough to force him to use at least a few NPs on himself. Given that all the NPs he has are extremely powerful, him just using a few on himself should create a lasting effect.

Of course, this is kind of a gamble. Maybe he doesn't have any NPs that are really good at imposing long term loyalty and obedience. Maybe Gilgamesh has a bunch of weak obedience and loyalty phantasms so he uses those first until the command seal effect wears off before he gets to the stronger ones, then he breaks the effect of the weaker phantasms through shear willpower. Maybe his willpower/rage is strong enough to kill you before he even starts binding himself. Maybe he binds himself with every NP he has, and then he resists there effects long enough to kill. Or he outright ignores their effects because they are his NPs in the first place.

Even so, I think that taking the risk is better than putting up with Gilgamesh's arrogant, self-sabotaging attitude.

I think I've got an explanation based on [[http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v38/versteeg15.pdf][the quantity from this paper]]: this would be great because it would explain the Blessing of Abstraction and "deep learning" as two different manifestations of one underlying statistical phenomenon.

To try to measure the quantity from the paper as it applies to the models from the book and paper, I rigged up the models in [[http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/venture/][Venture]], which is built on Python, along with a plugin based on [[https://github.com/gregversteeg/NPEET][NPEET]] to do the estimators. Venture has a dynamic type-tagging system for passing data into and out of plugins, which is kinda buggy and bad, especially since it treats Monte Carlo samples from the posterior distribution (the trained model) as second-class citizens (they don't actually get formatted as standard Venture data).

Instead of dealing with these annoyances, I may just rewrite the models in [[http://indiana.edu/%7Eppaml/][Hakaru]], which is a lot like Venture but it embeds the [[http://alexey.radul.name/ideas/2015/how-to-compute-with-a-probability-distribution/][Sampler monad]] into Haskell, thus allowing it to reuse Haskell's general-case tools for stuff and throw up fewer interpreter dumps that have nothing to do with my actual problem.

Once I've got nice numbers and can make graphs out of them, I want to look at the first paper I linked above (the one under the word "thing"), because they constructed a case in which the Blessing of Abstraction /didn't/ apply and general knowledge was /harder/ to learn than specific, and being able to retrodict the behavior here would be stronger confirmation of my theory. That would also let me construct cases in which I can "tune" the learnability of the abstract knowledge up and down.

This will eventually help robots to acquire well-grounded concepts of paperclips so they can convert the whole universe into them, because as it turns out from computer vision and the success of modern "deep learning", even seemingly very basic concepts are actually quite abstract from the statistical/dataset point of view.

*** It depends on what you want to do.

If you want to just publish it, then as [[/u/blazinghand]] says, Kindle Direct Publishing is probably the way to go. You can go from raw text, to .mobi file, to having it available on Amazon in about half an hour. However, you can't give it away for free through that platform, which means hoops to jump through for anyone that wants to read what you've written. (On the plus side, possibly there's some profit in it.)

If you want your own website, there are a bunch of options out there. If you want a blog format, Blogger is free and just has the standard "we have an unlimited license to publish your stuff on the website you're making with us". Wordpress is the other heavy hitter, but probably overkill unless you want lots of the other stuff it offers, and then you'd have to find your own hosting. And if you have your own hosting, then publishing online isn't too hard to do even without Wordpress.

Let me know more about specifics. I've published through KDP, published a serial on my website, distributed through Patreon, and have used FictionPress and AO3, so I have some experience with the various ways to get fiction to people.

*** Well... when your best argument for what makes it rational fiction is, "It doesn't, I was borderline on posting it," you kind of lose the right to complain about it being removed.

Past that, I don't think it was rational at all. It was just pretty basic political flag-waving. It isn't that it was a story with a political slant. It's that it was a story specifically designed /only to complain about anti-trust laws./ It reminded me of [[http://imgur.com/a/zh1s9][this laughable comic.]] (Skip to somewhere in the middle. The farther you go, the more laughable it gets).

Contrast it with "The Cambist and Lord Iron: A Fairy Tale of Economics," which is a story designed to teach a few points about economics *but also stood as a story on its own.*

Whether or not you personally believe in it, what you posted wasn't a story. It was a bad argument masquerading as a story.

**** That comic is a delightfully insane read.

I especially enjoyed the section where it talked about instituting a tax on voting, on the grounds that without it even people who don't care will vote.

It then goes on to preempt the question about whether the tax should be relative to your means with a resounding "no". After all, you don't pay more for any other service just because you have more money, do you?

Of course, for a wealthy person the relative utility cost of the fixed tax is negligible. This means that an apathetic wealthy person could vote, which would have exactly the same deleterious effect as an apathetic poor person voting.

It's all a hilarious mix of idiocy, really. In the next section it talks about how, when "the island" removed the voting tax it really degraded the political process. One big point it raises is politicians buying votes.

Never mind that they could have bought votes anyway, and indeed doing so would have been even more advantageous with a voting tax (as a smaller proportion of the population would vote).

There are so many little touches that are just adorable.

** I had [[http://i.imgur.com/XqSk7fP.png][a very entertaining conversation]] (images mentioned: [[http://i.imgur.com/8JurE9R.png][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/ZYCyNuV.gif][2]]) on Friday evening, when several schoolmates for unknown reasons pushed me to attend a party to celebrate our impending graduation, and I pushed back. I probably shouldn't have bothered to make any response at all--but, after four years of near-silence toward these people, I was just /itching/ to speak my mind, at least once...

If any bridges were burned (ha! he says that as if he thinks any existed in the first place!)--(shrugs) well, I can't say that I care /too/ much about the opinions of three dozen people with whom I probably never will interact after the end of this week. Heck, maybe some of the dozens of people who didn't actively participate in this exchange actually /agreed/ with me, and were attending the party under similar duress! After all, isn't "reclusive nerd" rather than "partying jock" the /proper/ stereotype of the engineering student? (On the other hand, though, from my [limited] observation of my classmates, I can't think of any people who have a high chance of fitting the "reclusive nerd" description. Indeed, /two/ of my four groupmates in the senior design project mentioned at the top of the email chain engaged in enough weightlifting to have developed bulging muscles!)

Really, though, I think my responses were reasonably level-headed. /My interlocutors/ were the ones who insisted on continuing to pressure me, and my rebuttals to their challenges were perfectly relevant. Feel free, however, to prove me wrong.

--------------

This incident, by the way, recalls to my mind a challenge against which I didn't bother to mount a defense. Some months ago, the esteemed [[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] made [[http://archive.is/Fpcv6][this reply]] to me when I described myself as "just an ordinary student in civil engineering":

#+begin_quote
  (a) You're an engineer. (b) You hang out on [[/r/rational]]. You're not an 'ordinary' anything; be proud of that.
#+end_quote

I guess that, at the time, I didn't care enough to argue (or even to downvote the comment)--but I certainly didn't forget about it.

/Is being an engineer worthy of pride?/ Well, in the first place, I'm only a /student/ in engineering, while I'd count as an "engineer" only a person /actively researching/working/ in an engineering field. In the second place, even if I /were/ an engineer, I really don't consider obeying well-defined guidelines and conducting simple mathematics (or maybe typing numbers into a program) to be significantly more praiseworthy than most other occupations. "Engineering judgement", phooey!

/Is being a frequenter of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] worthy of pride?/ In the first place, being a /writer/ of books or articles (fiction or nonfiction, rational or nonrational) is worthy of pride, sure--but merely /reading/ such works most certainly is not. In the second place, being "rational" obviously is worthy of pride--but to assume that frequenting [[/r/rational][r/rational]], or even disproportionately reading "rational" books, implies rationality is, in my opinion, a /totally/-unwarranted leap. I've read and greatly enjoyed /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662][Atlas Shrugged]]/, /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271][Black Beauty]]/, and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ several times each--but that /by no means/ implies that I'm interested in pushing objectivism, animal rights, or polyamory.

--------------

And, as long as I'm being an uppity ingrate toward my betters, I might as well go all-out:

The subtle art of attention-grabbing! How much is resting on your laurels, and how much is introducing new material? For example:\\
- The esteemed [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] recently has raked in the +moolah+ useless Internet points for posting on topics as banal as [[http://archive.is/b44Zx][a newly-born child]] and [[http://archive.is/lUeXL][a recently-burned hand]]. Why did people choose to give upvotes to these comments? Did they do so in order to encourage more writing from the commenter by making him happier? (I'll admit that I almost upvoted them just for this reason.) Were they /actually interested/ in the topics that he presented? (I guess there /are/ rather a few people subscribed to [[/r/upliftingnews][r/upliftingnews]]--but [[/r/gore][r/gore]] has been quarantined, so I can't see its subscriber count.) Or--cue [[https://youtu.be/admQ2Ideh0M][sinister music]]--did they upvote on reflex these comments merely because they were made by a highly-regarded writer?\\
- (insert [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophasis][cute rhetorical device]] here)

Yes, this section of this comment obviously is +partly+ largely born of [[http://archive.is/dHqFQ][resentment]]--but, on the other side of the coin, I /genuinely do not see/ why /photographs of sloughing skin/ should receive so much karma. I find it unlikely that the overlap in subscribers between [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and [[/r/spacedicks][r/spacedicks]] is /that/ large.

RES shows that I've given [[/u/eaturbrainz]] something like 500 upvotes, which means that I've read at least that many comments he's made.

(I believe this is one of the big reasons that fanfic is as popular as it is; once you've watched dozens of hours of a character on TV, you have a concrete visual of them and care more about what happens to them. A story about two students at magic school falling in love is typically less compelling than if those two students are Hermione and Draco.)

For what it's worth, I tend to share off-topic things here mostly because this is the internet community that I'm most active in, and consider a lot of the people who post here internet friends, or at least acquaintances.

Hell even going to restaurants that are too loud for conversation irks me enough that my friend group knows about my aversion, and since I also don't drink alcohol the few times I've agreed to go to bars with them have left me mostly just hoping everyone would be done soon. I'd say you made the right decision not to go.

That said, while your responses were definitely level-headed, they also had the tone/feel of antagonism to them. Maybe that's a subjective thing, but if this is something that's been building up and finally released, it makes sense that you'd be a bit more acerbic than you might otherwise be. Maybe in the future remind yourself that such people, whether they be classmates or coworkers, having a lack of understanding for your perspective doesn't automatically make them malicious in their insistence, and stick to straightforward points: "I don't really like parties or drinking, thanks anyway." Maybe offer to grab a pizza slice instead sometime if they keep asking why not, if you prefer that.

Of course, I said all that while missing the years of context that your interactions with these people have provided you, so maybe they've often been snide and mealymouthed about your "otherness" before, in which case this kind of send-off is probably more deserved, if no less constructive.

Without any additional context I'd thought this wording was rather rude just by itself --- like they're deigning to invite /even/ you to their party, lol. Your then unnecessary complication of the conversation made me think that they may be used to similar shenanigans from you by now, and if so then it may've been an inside joke aimed at that (in which case you yourself may or may not have been part of that particular in-group depending on your attitude towards the situation).

Regarding the issue in general, what was the point of generating walls-of-text at a simple party request? If you wanted to explain your unwillingness to participate, one simple paragraph would've sufficed. If you wanted to show you were smarter than that --- again, what's the point? It's just one of those situations in which the more you complicate things the more /you/ start looking like the negative side.

  How does one's physical fitness define whether they are (not) a reclusive person, a nerd, or both? 
#+end_quote

I wonder how much something like physical fitness or athleticism covaries with generalized traits like "intelligence" or "charisma" or "willpower", and if the patterns of association are consistent across countries and cultures. I think stereotypes in the U.S. invoke a sort of "game-y" model of physical/mental ability, where you have a finite pool of points that you can distribute (e.g. through hard work and effort, which may be regarded as limited resources if for no other reason than the finitude of time) or that are distributed for you (e.g. through particular sorts of pleiotropy or exposure to different environments during development or w/e. And while I've not looked into it at any depth, I've heard mental disorders like Asperger's can make people both more analytical and socially inept). And so someone who is very smart will necessarily be awkward and weak; conversely, a hot, muscular jock is usually assumed to be dumb.

However, my personal impression (colored though it is by stuff like halo effects, confirmation bias, and sampling bias) is that these traits more often covary positively, and that, say, the smartest people I meet tend to be more athletic and attractive and charming than you might expect given no or an inverse association, or that the strongest people at the gym seem to have a more "intellectually impressive" occupation, and so on. This, in turn, would be expected if there are a lot of positive feedback loops in play (e.g. you're smart, so you can train your body or social skills or w/e more effectively. Or you're very diligent, so you can study and work harder, or resist harmful temptations better and be healthier overall. Or you're really attractive, so you have more self-confidence and can more easily pursue your goals).

What are all y'all's thoughts? I'm sure someone out there's looked into this more formally, so is anyone familiar with whatever relevant lit's been produced?

***** Being healthy has several well noted positive effects on energy levels and amount of work done. It also as noted invokes the halo effect about you, meaning the cultivating a healthy appearance is a good way to achieve more positive interactions. Plus it makes people live longer. The game model of physical vs mental has several problems, not least that a properly optimised gym goer can look pretty damn fit with only a few hours of effort a week, and it is entirely possible to trick your brain into finding the gym or other exercise types enjoyable. Or just be lucky and find an exercise type that you find enjoyable by default.

To put it more simply, being physically fit is a good idea in most cases. Since in theory more smart people should come to correct conclusions than not smart people, I would expect fitness to at least weakly correlate with intelligence.

A quick google to test my theory and yes, [[http://psychcentral.com/news/2009/12/03/link-between-physical-fitness-and-iq/9914.html][The study shows a clear link between good physical fitness and better results for the IQ test.]]

The meta analysis states there was only a very small positive effect, and it's not clear what kinds of cognitive tests they were looking at.

Also it would be a bit hasty to draw conclusions about it making you smarter from the study that looked at brain blood flow. It's not like we have the knowledge of neurology to identify intelligence with just a brain scan (other than being able to see obvious damage)

Overall based on the information I can see in the abstracts that isn't behind a paywall. It would seem that the cognitive benefits to exercise are small and limited to what you would expect from a stimulant like caffeine. Yes it may prevent cognitive decline in old age and increase reaction time and concentration a bit, but still no evidence it would provide much actual boost to say a iq test.

***** Well, empirically, there's a pretty good correlation between "physical attractiveness" and intelligence - in the studies I've seen, r is usually around 0.4, a finding that continues to hold when the subjects being rated are young enough to not be affected (very much) by the causal chains you suspect.

Geoffrey Miller, in The Mating Mind, suggests that the main cause may be that because people +combine genes on the basis of associative sorting WRT the sum of physical and mental attractiveness+ care about both looks and smarts, you get inter-generational reinforcement of the correlation between the two.

That is, the (physically) attractive get to pick the partner which they like the most - which tends to be because they are smart and/or hot - and so you end up with children who grow up to be hot AND smart (or hot/hot, or smart/smart) - within the confines of the heritability of these traits.

I'm not very good at pushing symbols around, but my intuition of the relevant math says that this would work as the primary cause of the world we see (where r(IQ parents - IQ child) = 0.75 and r(hot - smart) = 0.4) so long as mental and physical sharpness are roughly equal in importance and the sorting effect in human matchmaking is pretty strong.

The other effects, like hot people being judged as more competent, and so getting hired for harder jobs, are also true.

***** I think the way you "unnecessarily complicated" the interaction with your classmates is more interesting than their motivations for pushing you to accept their invitation. Especially since you have revealed that you haven't really spent time with them at all.

It seems simple to me - when you rejected their invitation with a, "Enjoy your hangover", they read your response as an attack on their intelligence. And I don't mean this as an accusation, but you /did/ mean to do so, right? Actually, even if you didn't mean it that way, all you needed to do was to say something like, "No thanks" and the conversation would have ended there. Instead - and I think this is what [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames]] was noticing as well - you otherized yourself by declaring that you don't imbibe like the rest of them and then you even expressed your disdain (it's hard to read "Enjoy your hangover" any other way) that /they/ actually /enjoy/ such /base/ and /superficial/ temptations. And so they felt that you were insulting them (and in your comment, here on reddit, you do insult their intelligence! People you barely know!), and sought to injure you back as politely as they could - by insisting on enjoying their company....

Which, at that point, was not what they were really saying. At that point, the bridges were burned, as you said. The subtext of their persistent invitations was that you were a charity case - the poor social pariah - /look/ at how /kind/ and /lovely/ and /polite/ we are, including this fellow in our festivities even though we no longer wish to.

Mystery solved.

(P. S. plenty of nerds work out nowadays and have bulging muscles. Exercise helps increase mental strength as well, improving one's ability to concentrate and maintain focus. It also helps regulate mood... It's probably not a good idea to associate a healthy behavior with an undesirable trait. It's also probably not a good idea to otherize yourself if you wish to increase your chances of success in the job market. Employers hire based on referrals first - most jobs nowadays are attained thanks to nepotism.)

*** There was a time in my life where I could have written the emails you did. Some assorted advice I would have given myself in your situation:

- You wouldn't have enjoyed that party, at all.

- Find people that you can be unguarded and relaxed around, and whose company is easy to enjoy.

- Parties can be enjoyable if there are people there whose company you enjoy.

- It's not a lot of fun to be sober while others are drinking, or to drink while others are sober. Accordingly, it's useful to partition parties into drinking and not drinking and only attend if you're aligned.

- Alcohol is a social technology. It's easy as a nerd to underestimate the value of social experiences and community. I've gotten good mileage out of a deliberate decision to drink only socially, approximately once a month. This would have been a surprise to my younger self.

*** You've been given good advice already. But yes, you portrayed yourself as arrogant and rude and I'm inclined to take the side of your peers.

From your first statement, it shows that you are unable to empathize with your peers. It was clear from the thread's topic that the OP felt it was a special occasion to socialize and indulge in alcohol. You dismissed his feelings by stating it was not a good reason. You phrased it in as if to claim that it objectively and obviously was not a good reason, and that belittles his feelings and intentions. Furthermore you ended it by implying that you wished them harm. This not only implies that you think you are better than them, but that you don't even care for their wellbeing, which is increasingly insulting given that you've spent a significant amount of time together as peers, and they've considered you somebody worth their time. It is not unreasonable for them to feel insulted and jaded to find out that their feelings towards you were not reciprocated, not even on a false pretense.

Your addition remarks cemented that opinion. You even go so far as to laugh at the notion that you might enjoy spending time with them.

I find your choice of words quite rigid and impersonal, which may be what you're going for, but for such a casual conversation, it lends itself to appear arrogant, which it did.

To convey the same message, I personally would have said, "I don't drink, not even coffee. I also don't like such social environments, so thanks but no thanks. Please respect my personal choice. You all can enjoy yourselves with my absence on my behalf."

And if I wanted to reciprocate their feelings of camaraderie, or at least let them know I do see them as more than strangers, I'd include, "Watch out for the hangover." Or to be even more personal, "I wouldn't know it, but I hear hangovers are pretty terrible, so have fun and take care."

You'll soon find out, if you haven't already, that in life, it's very important to build and develop social skills. To be human is to be social. You'll find out that every single job out there, regardless of what it is, is looking for a team player or will require you to interact with people, sometimes with people you don't even like, and if you can't deal with them tactfully, you're going to have a lot of problems.

ToaKraka had mentioned that he wanted to speak up since he usual held back, so silence was out of the question. I also assume from his messages that he did not want to lie, so saying something like, "Sorry, I'm busy," wasn't on the table either.

Ending the message on a lighthearted tone would help diffuse the tension from that previous statement and help convey to the recipients that he means no offense while finalizing his opinion on the invite.
