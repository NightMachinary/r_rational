We get some interesting discussion of prisoner's dilemmas and naturalistic metaethics in this one. Also, there's at least three references to other pieces of rational fiction that you might be able to spot. This is a crucial chapter so any feedback or comments would be very helpful. You can catch up on Corbin's story [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/chapter-xv-succession/][here, with chapter fifteen]].
