*** Yes. See, in real life, when you have unintended program behaviors like this, your national phone network crashes, your hard drive gets erased, or your cellphone dials everyone on your contacts list repeatedly at 3am without letting you hear their attempts to call back. Having software this buggy in an armed military drone is likewise strongly net-negative in expectation in real life. A /fictional/ story about a case where a software bug just amazingly happens to cause behavior for reasons that a human could map onto moral reasoning, does not mean that it is okay to have heavily armed drones with software of this quality. Good-story bias up the /wazoo./

I might actually be a bit peeved at this point with the "buggy AI algorithm causes aligned moral reasoning" genre of fiction. Peter Watts executed the trope way better than most, I mean, his AI does not suddenly get inhabited by an anthropomorphic spirit, but this is still NOT WHERE ALIGNED BEHAVIOR COMES FROM IN REAL LIFE.

**** This is only broken in the sense that any literal genie is broken though; it carried out it's task of eliminating people who caused civilian deaths. That's not a bug - just a poorly written specification/optimisation goal. And /very poor judgement/ from those who deployed it...

In short: the program is a tool, not an agent, and it's behaviour is merely unexpected (not unforeseeable or unpreventable). No moral reasoning takes place in the machine. All it does is resolve the conflict between human-supplied 'ethical architecture' and the action of humans.

****** I understand your frustration, but come on. Not all unexpected behaviours are equally unexpected. Bugs are not the result of some unknowable eldritch influence. Given the amount of testing such a system would presumably go through, it's likely that the resulting AI behaves /almost/ as intended, rather than displaying some seemingly random high-complexity behaviour.

I think there is even a case to be made that the AI is actually functioning properly as the people who programmed it intended. Saying that the AI is malfunctioning in this case is alike to declaring a microwave oven to be poorly designed because some moron decides to stick a living cat into it and turn it on. Engineers cannot foresee and prevent every way the idiots might misuse their product. They intended to install an 'ethical architecture' and they did that, it's not their fault that humans don't actually behave ethically (as defined by the said reasonable architecture). I'm mostly with [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] on this.

I guess it comes down to the question of whether the humans overriding the ethical constraints were actually acting reasonably or not. My impression from reading the story was that they were acting unethically, in which case the AI's ethical architecture recognising that fact doesn't really count as a failure.

Although, given the presumed difficulty of alignment problem, I guess one can trust this AI to be faulty in some way just on priors. From this perspective, it's surprising that it's faulty in this particular superficially moral way.

That's not a coincidence, that's the *ethical architecture* that the UN insisted was built in. Isn't your major work to ensure humans can determine the moral framework of machine intelligence? Here's an example!

******* I can't tell whether you're trying to defend the story on a literary level or claim that this is the sort of thing that would happen with reasonable probability in real life. On a literary level, Peter Watts did an excellent job of rationalizing something that wouldn't happen. On a real life level, your strength as a rationalist is to be more confused by rationalizations of things that wouldn't happen in real life than things that would, so you need to see past literary devices and say 'but nonetheless, in real life...' as part of that skill.

******** My original contention was that, arguably, the drone was carrying out the intention of it's designers - who did not anticipate it's operators crimes.

My second point was that the drone /did not/ spontaneously derive moral principles - they were explicitly built in (cf 'ethical architecture').

Yes, this would be staggeringly unlikely to happen in real life. I'm not claiming otherwise - simply that the events depicted don't involve unintended target selection (merely unanticipated), nor moral behaviour emerging from any source but deliberate input.

********* It's usually very hard to properly predict how software will function without a lot of testing and debugging, even for very simple tasks. For something like a complex morality function, it's seems very, very unlikely to me that it would work in unexpected ways that happen to line up with the designers desires. In the real world, for every unplanned accident that leads to a surprisingly good result, there are 99 accidents that just lead to failure.

The fact that the creators of a complex function did not rigorously plan for and expect a certain happy outcome is itself evidence that the happy outcome should not be expected.

********* No Just No. The only reason that architecture led to a moralish result was because The Author Said So. That quality of programming would not pinpoint that result in real life, and would instead slaughter children on the full moon, so you cannot say that morality was built into the stated architecture or emerged from it. Peter Watts can make it happen in the story; he can't make it a natural or logical consequence.

********** I have to ask. Why is it more logical that the ethical architecture results in the slaughter of children on the full moon than the actual end of the story?

Obviously, a lot of the programming is very implicit. Most importantly, one major unanswered question is how exactly the program assigns colors to targets. This seems like a major challenge, and would probably be something that could cause a slaughter of children on a full moon (or any of billions upon billions of unintended consequences) by marking them as reds for some reason. I would say however that the in-story assumption is that that part of the programming has been done. Aside from that, some ethical architecture was 'grudgingly put in'; this is the part that results in the unintended behavior (and has possibly not been tested carefully, since the army probably didn't care about that too much).

[[/s][Spoiler]]

"Children on the full moon" do not violate the above rules; they don't 'attack', 'cause attack' or 'override abort'. Mission control does.

I can definitely see other outcomes than the one in the story, but nothing like the 'children on a full moon' scenario. For example, Azrael could self-destruct, since in principle, Azrael attacked six or more blues. This at least seems to require fewer logical steps than mixing up the three definitions above.

So why the slaughter of children? Do you have some set of ethical rules in mind that would cause the slaughter of children in fewer steps than those outlined in the story?
