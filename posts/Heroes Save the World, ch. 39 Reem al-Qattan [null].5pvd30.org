** It's the last chapter of the sequence, so you know what that means... Except, it's a little different this time. >:]

This is also an appropriate time for a few public service announcements:

- Feedback is appreciated, especially the kind that tells me what you think I'm doing wrong.
- I love, love, love reviews, but if you want to support this story financially too, then [[https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks][check out my patreon account]] and see if any of the rewards interest you. HSTW is a Creative Commons work, which means that my ability to monetize it in a traditional fashion is limited-to-nonexistent.
- If you were wondering, Heroes Save the World is now ten-percent complete, not counting bonus chapters that may or may not happen.
- For those who are interested, the average word count of Awful Shadow is 1,565 words/chapter, a slight increase from Not Too Small.

Thank you all for reading. The next sequence, /Sharp as Sword Blades/, will begin this Friday.

** New guess: this cabal is playing a game where each person is allotted a certain group of the 100. I imagine the prize depends on the pawns assigned to each player. So if the precognitives are the last ones standing, their patron gets a fraction of what Hannah's patron would get if she wins.

I still think they're extradimensional beings who can't quite get used to existing in fleshsuits.

They would have been fine if only they had gone in for custom fittings before the suits were purchased.

(Important: The above was a joke, and should not be taken as confirmation of the extradimensional beings theory, just as this notice should be taken as a denial of it. Just making that clear.)

**** All their other suits fit so well, you'd think they'd have good tailors by now!!

Obviously the ill fit of their human suits impressed upon them the importance of getting a good tailor from then on out.

No problem! I just didn't want to be accused of misleading/spoiling the audience.
