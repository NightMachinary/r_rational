** #+begin_quote
  John Young, commander. Kenneth Mattingly, pilot. Fred Haise, lunar module pilot.
#+end_quote

So,apparently in this world, Mattingly didn't get sick and replaced by his backup, but Lovell did. I wonder what the kabbalistic implication of that is.

*** | Position             | Reality      | UNSONG            |
|----------------------+--------------+-------------------|
| Commander            | Jim Lovell   | John Young        |
| Command Module Pilot | Jack Swigert | Kenneth Mattingly |
| Lunar Module Pilot   | Fred Haise   | Fred Haise        |

It may be that the name "Young" is significant, or that somebody whose surname starts with "love" wasn't on UNSONG's Apollo 13. Maybe Lovell gave away all his possessions and Charlie Duke never contracted Rubella from one of his kids, or something like that.

I can't come up with any Kabbalistic explanation for favouring Mattingly over Swigert. Apparently Mattingly comes from Mattingley, which means "woodland clearing of the family or followers of a man called Matta". May be transformed UNSONG-wise into followers of Matthew, I guess.

Matting is also the process, and material used in the process, of forming mats. I, uh, don't have any real ideas there either.

It may be explained in a future interlude, one of those things (like "KNEEL" = "Neil") where a clever bit of lateral thinking can reveal the answer ahead of time. It's highly unlikely that I'll ever be that thinker.

**** John Young+Kenneth Mattingly+Fred Haise+Richard Nixon is the only possible combination of crew members that includes Richard Nixon where the syllables in their names add up to the number 13.

Edit: removed some unnecessary qualifiers.

Edit 2: Kenneth is actually his middle name. His real name is Thomas Mattingly. Doesn't change the syllable math, but it does mean there's someone on the flight who was faking something. A kabbalist would at least point out this, even if it would be trivial, so I have as well.

** Of the three Names given to Ana:

#+begin_quote
  The second the Airwalker Name, which granted the power to tread on air as if it were solid ground. And the third the Mistral Name, which according to the document's somewhat ominous description “called the winds”.
#+end_quote

If you got two people bound together, one to use the Airwalker name and the other to use the Mistral name, could they together stand on air forced upwards by the Mistral name to ultimately reach a sufficient height to rise to the Celestial Spheres and the putative location of Heaven?

Riding a moving cloud would fit nicely with the Dragon Ball theme established in recent chapters with the collection of 7 dragon-themed items (plus of course Journey To The West), and finally of course we have Revelations 1:7

#+begin_quote
  "Look, he is coming with the clouds," and "every eye will see him, even those who pierced him"; and all peoples on earth "will mourn because of him." So shall it be! Amen.
#+end_quote

Everyone mourning because of Aaron (who we are informed will end the world in the beginning of Unsong) does not seem unlikely.

**** You and [[/u/redstonerodent]] are using different conventions for describing typos. Currently, the chapter contains this sentence:

#+begin_quote
  I believe that just there is a gate to Hell inside the Earth, so the edge of space may be an outer gate which leads to Heaven.
#+end_quote

when it should be this:

#+begin_quote

****** "Phantom Tollbooth" is 17 characters, and TK17 has the number 17. The Apollo 17 carried rocks back from the moon. "Rocks in your head" is an insult to someone's intelligence or stubbornness. I can't be bothered writing 17 sentences of kabbalah.

Not a coincidence, etc.

***** The name is well-known, but heavily regulated. Aaron says the names for the animal souls and ethical souls have been discovered already, and the one he discovered is for the divine soul.

Also, since technology ceased working a while ago and they still have mass produced clothing, cars and portable computers my guess is that golems are heavily used in industry.
