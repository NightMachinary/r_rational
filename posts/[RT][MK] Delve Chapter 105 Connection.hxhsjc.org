***** Yeah that's probably for the best, besides waiting a week for the next chapter is really not that bad, I remember when we had to wait at least a month for a new mother of learning chapter.

*** If you signed up for Patreon, there should be an email with a Discord link. There's a lot of theorizing about how the System and world works, and a lot of the conversations remind me of this subreddit. Plus a few trolls.
