  And yes, I did make sure with Bohriam that the Beleric terms for north/south/east/west all meant the same directions as in English

How? This does not seem like a trivial thing to check...

*** Perhaps I should have included a "respective to each other," because I really just meant that they have the same clockwise order on a compass, and that there's no [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cajYS08Xbmc][funny business about swapping their names]].

**** Ah okay. So I /think/ that even if Era and Earth were identical planets they could simply have rotated our compass by 90 degrees and kept it clockwise to produce this outcome.

#+begin_quote
  Curiously, planet Era appeared to rotate in the opposite direction as Earth---the sun was setting in the east instead of the west.
#+end_quote

I think it would be appropriate to say that Era axis-rotated in the opposite direction (rather than a rotated compass) if you compared it relative to the direction of rotation around the sun, but that seems hard to figure out. Or, I suppose you could also use the axis rotation of the sun itself as reference. If there's discrepancies between Era and Earth you can use that to deduce which reference frame God's language cares about, which could be some fun worldbuilding.

Fun fact, astronomers use a geocentric north. Which is to say, they decide the north and south for all the planets in the entire solar system based on Earth. Seems inelegant, when venus rotates the opposite way and uranus is sideways! [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_of_astronomical_bodies]] It doesn't say how they decide where North is for items on other galaxies. So our English doesn't help.

** Not sure if it fits in rational but it takes more than 6 chapters to be sure anyway. I like it so far.

Is there an rss?
