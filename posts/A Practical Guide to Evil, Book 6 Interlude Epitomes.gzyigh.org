** Interesting that the severance cuts something every time it moves. If it's not a target then it cuts the wielder instead. Saint was very careful with the use of her aspect bit now it's been forged into a weapon that makes it impossible to be as careful.

Combine that with the fact that the sword's cuts can't be healed properly, and we have a weapon that's even more dangerous to its wielder than its wielder's enemies. Just like the aspect was a danger to Saint as well, iirc.

The weapon doesn't need to go to a hero. It creates a story and role for anyone who wields it. The story involves a nasty disfigurement so it's as likely to be a villain as a hero. The GA do like their champions to be pretty after all.

Truly a nasty mcguffin they've all created.

That said, Cristophe may be the only one who /can/ wield it safely, unless there's someone else with as strong of a defensive ability we don't know about. The WK's fingers got nicked when he sheathed it, but the MK only had his sleeves cut when he unsheathed it. Safe being a relative term, since how safe can it ever be it to be around someone that volatile with a deadly weapon?

Truly truly a nasty mcguffin. (Technically not a mcguffin in this story, since it gets used in a plot relevant way a toaster couldn't be, but close enough. )

*** I would like to see the villain who thinks they can use that sword without it trying to kill them.you know so i can laugh at them for the 5 mins they live before severance turns in their hand and cuts their head off.

**** For sure. But anyone wielding that thing more than a few times is going to end up with the kind of permanent disfigurement that only villains have.

*** I think it's also meant to be a double edged sword (sorry) in that Black likes to point out magical swords always fail their users at the most dramatic point so if the DK or some other revenant gets their hands on the blade it'll be useless to them.
