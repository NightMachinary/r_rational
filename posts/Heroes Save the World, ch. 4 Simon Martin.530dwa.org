** Simon's reasoning is certainly ropy, though I'll forgive that given how freaky his power is. But "if the future can't be changed: his usefulness will be in mitigating the damage by giving forewarning."? If it can't be changed how there BE any mitigation?

*** Since it cannot be changed, he was always going to mitigate the damage.

Or, more plausibly, he means "future in the vision cannot be changed". Leaving room for changing things outside the vision.

** *Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

Is there a missing word here? "Something" perhaps?
