** Pinkie Pie's surprise party is going to go over in worse than in canon... Maybe this can be a learning experience for Pinkie Pie? In canon, she was really slow to grasp that some people don't share her sense of fun/humor.

I'm sorry for the quite long delay on this chapter. University finals, computer problems, a vacation, and a copious amount of drugs have made life pretty hectic for the last month or so.

Comments are especially appreciated for this chapter. Please let me know what you think about Tinder Heart! It's very tricky, adding in another main character, but I think the reasons for doing so outweigh my reservations.

As always, thanks for reading! =]

Tinder Heart was okay for an OC, but... 'another main character?' I'm hesitant at that implication...

***** The implication that he will be both present enough and important enough to be considered a 'main character.' I'm not interested in him as a character at all.

****** I see! I assumed you meant plot-relevant implications. Can I ask whether your lack of interest in him is a product of how he's written, or just of a lack of data?

******* A lack of data, an aversion to male characters in MLP fiction, a strong aversion to straight/non-queer romance in MLP fiction, particularly with the main 6.

...Yeah. I'm a shipper. ._. I'm not psychotic about it (any more), but it just /feels wrong,/ even to approach a plot where it becomes slightly probable that straight romance will happen in the future. I do read stories with male characters and straight romance in them, though, they just need to be better written. You have a good handle on that, I think.

******** Hmm, okay. I'll say that that aversion to male characters in MLP is one of the (many) reasons I believe Tinder's existence is warranted; it's one of the themes I want to touch on (but not really explore in-depth).

Regarding romance, I don't want to say much, but I advise you not to worry about the concerns you brought up. Wait a few chapters and see. ^^

Also I just noticed you've got category-theoretic flair. /brohoof

Heheheh, are you going to have a matriarchal privilege thing? That's always interesting.
