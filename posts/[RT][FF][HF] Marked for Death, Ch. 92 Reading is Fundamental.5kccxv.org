*** I honestly didn't intend for that to happen. I had a plan for you guys to walk around the library seeing stuff. Then Auntie walked on stage and told me to sit down, shut up, and write what she told me. I certainly wasn't going to say no; she's scary!

******** Hahah. Well, at least with Kagome, Mari exists to keep him in check. I doubt she expected /Hazou/ of all people to blow up at this, although I'm sure she'll be privately beating herself up for not.
