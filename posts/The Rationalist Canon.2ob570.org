The core reasons for [[/r/rational]] to exist is to share and create rationalist fiction. Due to a shortage thereof, we also recognise rational fiction - both are defined in the sidebar - but this thread is only about explicitly rationalist fiction.

*What is the 'rationalist canon'?* The stories that stand out, that helped define the genre or are seen as ideal expressions of it?

The 'old masters' - rationalist published literature. Does anyone know of more?

Online Serials - some original works, and some derivative ([[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/other-universes][it's easier]]). Are there more that meet the full gold-standard definition? Or some on the list that shouldn't be?

Make no boxes and we'll have no arguments about what deserves to be in them.

That said! Maybe a Rational Tropes sort of setup? List the elements of rationalist fiction, and note where they were first observed, and fiction that uses them?

True. On the other hand, we won't even have an empty box!

I think it's worth occasionally at least discussing what we would see as the canon, and the reasons behind our choices - to find new things to read, build a shared understanding of what this 'rationalist fiction' thing is, and reflect on our own thinking.

Challenge: write a dialogue between a constructivist and a positivist, about the definition of "rationalist fiction" :p

**** Challenged accepted!

P: "I would posit that the basis of an enjoyable rationalist fiction is one with believable characters who react appropriately to existential threats and utilize all tools necessary to steer the future where they want it to go. The rational actors will at least be able to predict their opponents. Superior optimized players will always try to think at least one level higher than anyone expects them to."

C: "It is impossible to write "rationalist" fiction. Your human qualities with cognitive dispositions, heuristics and biases lead you through deep unconscious pathways and you can't go "one level higher" than them, no matter how much you try to "simulate a theoretical objective decisional computer in your brain." The closest type of fiction you can write is "fiction that appeals to left-brained thinkers who value cool calculation over warm emotion based on shared constructed "memes and models."

P: "Are you proposing that in order to write a rationalist fiction, I would need to construct a story devoid of humanity? As in, I'm banned from using human language or social cues for my story? I'm merely talking about instrumental rationality in maximizing the quality of interactions between characters in a story."

C: "Additionally, you cannot call it "fiction" without recognizing that is a social construct, not based on reality. Using the "cached thought" of the map-is-not-the-territory, what is the territorial basis for your fictional world?"

P: "Ugh. You know, normally people consider me to be overly pedantic. Thank you for showing me that it is possible to over-think things."

** I personally would have put up the original Friendship is Optimal by Iceman over it's derivative fanfic; the derivative didn't really add a whole lot of interest, it mostly felt like it was an exercise in going through standard objections to uploading. That said, even for that story going strictly by the sidebar I am not sure how much there is of the Rational/ist/ techniques and the like in the story - one character conducts a very limited investigation of a virtual environment, but with zero stakes and a pretty silly investigative methodology (play with a toy until you start to get puzzled, come to a conclusion, and havsan omnipotent AI trying to maximize his happiness 'confirm' the results of testing. There is not a lot of puzzles or rationalist techniques in the story. The story has a LOT of transhumanist and LessWrongian trappings, but I don't know that it actually qualifies as rationalist merely because of having plot devices like omnipotent artificial intelligences derived from Lesswrong or related organizations.

**** For obvious reasons, I don't feel entirely qualified to pass judgment on Saga of Soul. I would, however, submit for your consideration that one of the most central aspects of the story is that, when the protagonist is faced with an afterlife and physics-defying power, she refuses to accept "it's magic!" as an explanation, and immediately sets out to analyze, quantify, and experiment on her discovery - and that, furthermore, the knowledge garnered from her experiments plays a large role in allowing her her victories.

***** Hey ouri, yeah the experimentation is what I said is "rational trappings".

It is only my opinion, but for me there is some pretty big breaks in rules 1, 2 and 4 in the sidebar.

Eriko left alive several times by people who are characterised by wanton killing. Outright evil factions with no other real motivation.

And there are plenty of examples of applications of her power that either get nerfed after a single use for story reasons (the kaiju popper, for example) or have been ruled out by you for "story reasons", like cutting enemies with portals.

The story is still fun to read, but it just doesn't fulfill the criteria. Some rational elements, but not rational enough that a reader can extrapolate solutions to problems.

****** The bit about portal cutting I'll concede.

Being left alive... Downfall retreated twice, mostly cutting his losses (even if he later retells it differently). Murder was toying with her the first time, but WOULD have killed her if she hadn't retreated.

Outright evil factions... Well, the demons have their motivations. It's just that those motivations are no more rational than those of the Holocaust's showrunners. The Elysium is imperialistic. He Who Laughs is pursuing his own interests while treating the multiverse as an entertaining show.

As for the kaiju popper, it requires a few elements to work. One of them is an enemy who's not moving quickly even while you're somewhat close.

Your mileage may vary.
