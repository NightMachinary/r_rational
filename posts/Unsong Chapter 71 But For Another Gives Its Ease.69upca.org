#+begin_quote
  “I don't buy it,” said Ana Thurmond.
#+end_quote

I also don't buy it.

So, this is fun-theoretic modal realism theodicy. The claim is, to maximise total utility you have to actualize every possible different 4-dimensional block universe where the total amount of goodness is positive. Some of these universes will include instances of unimaginable suffering.

This entire setup is just a temporal version of one of Derek Parfit's [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/][repugnant conclusions]] - the repugant conclusion is a major paradox of Utilitarian reasoning that is still unsolved, but its a paradox for the reason that the conclusion is so repugnant. *If the message of Unsong is that God is moral to actualize all worlds with total utility >0, then it forces us to also accept the repugnant conclusion and all its consequences.*

Unsong will presumably conclude with all the prisoners in hell, freed and able to enjoy a wonderful existence for some enormous length of time. Just as in the repugnant conclusion, for every person suffering immense pain in Hell we can add another person suffering more intense pleasure/happiness for a longer period of time in heaven, making the total utility of that world positive.

These extreme worlds that God occasionally actualised, where everything would turn out best in the end even if there are intervals of extreme suffering early on, would be disqualified by the verisons of consequentialism that were created to avoid this kind of paradox (e.g. a critical level view). He should have actualized only all those universes where the welfare of individuals didn't fall below an absolute level.

So, God has his normative ethics wrong. It's wrong in a more subtle way than in actual religion (where He only cares about individual salvation, rather than individual happiness, thus justifying any amount of human suffering for the sake of greater salvation through faith), but still just mistaken - our values diverge because God's ethics falls victim to moral paradoxes.

Thus, at the end of Unsong, God's answer reduces to essentially the same, first and obvious answer to theodicy that intelligent people have recongised since the time of the ancient greeks - God is all powerful, he does things that are inconsistent with morality as we understand it, so his morality is not ours. If God has values that allow for the existence of Hell, then he may be good according to those values, but he is not good according to a sane human normative ethics.

It's not enough that the total trajectory of the Unsong universe makes it turn out good in the end - worlds containing large numbers of people whose welfare falls below an absolute level shouldn't be actualized. A moral theory that doesn't have this feature will fall victim to the repugnant conclusion and similar arguments. We might not be able to know exactly how to fix our version of Utilitarianism to account for this flaw, but it's clear we do need to fix it somehow.

However, Unsong is also playing theodicy on easy mode considering its God doesn't allow /infinite/ punishment, and isn't testing people based on their level of faith, unlike the Christian God

  “All of them? That would be...a lot of universes.”

*** So, God will create and sustain a universe where the net total utility is positive over its existence? There is no point in making two identical universes since merging them into one will not result in the loss of any sapient experience, but God can create two universes that differ only very slightly. And, in this story that is exactly what he did. He created a perfect universe, then another that had a minor variation, and another, etc. From the story:

#+begin_quote
  THERE IS A WORLD MADE OF NOTHING BUT BLISS, WITH A GIANT ALEPH IN THE CENTER. THERE IS ANOTHER WORLD MADE OF NOTHING BUT BLISS WITH A GIANT BET IN THE CENTER. AND SO ON
#+end_quote

Apparently that small variation is sufficient for these to be distinct universes. So it stands to reason that there are a pair of universes which are COMPLETELY IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY except that in one universe there is a box containing a sentient being who endures unimaginable suffering for trillions of years- and in the other universe this does not happen. Without the suffering box in universe 1, there would be no reason for both of these universes to exist simultaneously. This means that God has created a sentient being and tortures it for trillions of years for no reason.

In fact, since even minor variations are sufficient for there to be a new universe, God would create and torture every possible sentient being in a box in the middle of their own universe surrounded by bliss. In fact, he would create nearly infinite universes for each possible sentient wherein they are tortured in a differently shaped box or one with different markings on its surface. So long as there is sufficient bliss outside these boxes, the net utility of these universes is positive.

***** Let's suppose God is an algorithm that creates universes. Before a universe is created, Go checks:

1. Does this exact universe already exist?
2. Will the net utility in this universe be negative?

If the answer to both of these is "no", then the universe will be created. These criteria will allow, for example, the existence of a perfect universe with a giant Aleph in the center, another perfect universe with a giant Bet in the center, etc. Despite the fact that these universes are functionally identical, the algorithm views them as distinct enough to both exist.

There isn't really any reason for these to both exist since the experiences of the inhabitants will be identical, but algodrithm creates both anyway. It isn't accurate to say that the total utility is the sum of utility^{Aleph} and utility^{Bet} because there is no new experience in Bet.

Now suppose you have two almost identical universes. In both universes there is an impenetrable, opaque box in the center. In one universe, this box is empty; in the other universe, the box contains a sentient being who is being tortured. In this case there /is/ a new experience in the second universe, but is is one of negative utility. Algodrithm looks at universe 2 and determines that is is distinct from universe 1 and calculates that even with the torture victim, the net utility of universe 2 is positive. So God creates universe 2.

It has already been established that there is no reason to create two identical universes, and since the experience of those outside the box is identical, the only new information is the experience of the victim. So, yes, I can't claim that there is no reason for God to create universe 2, but functionally, the only reason for him to create this second universe is to torture that one dude for trillions of years.

Assume, however, that the presence of a box containing an ever screaming being might have effects on the sapient beings in that otherwise perfect universe, causing them to differentiate significantly from the other non-screaming box. If you don't take the box having no effect on the other inhabitants of the universe as a given, said inhabitants may be significantly differentiated individuals.

The important distinction is that in both universes, there are trillions of sentient beings who are in a state of bliss for trillions of years. By adding the universe with the one suffering entity, the amount of total happiness has increased by trillions minus one.

If you suppose a parallel universe that mirrors ours exactly except for the fact that you didn't brush your teeth this morning, you have two universes that are demonstrably different. Your experience is certainly different, and this may cause some small ripple effect to change the experiences of those around you. But for nearly all of the experiences outside your cone of influence, the universes are fully mirrored. Since these universes are actually different in some substantive way, there would have to be a difference in starting conditions.

If Unsong God does not create redundant minds, or if he has some minimum threshold for considering universes to be distinct, or if the giant Hebrew letters are enough to impact every mind in these universes, then my agrument would not hold.

**** God only creates the initial conditions of a universe (the seed which forms the highest celestial realm Atziluth) at Time 0, so the suffering sentient beings in their boxes have to get there somehow and persist for trillions of years. Let's name the sentient being in the box Robin.

How did Robin get in the box? God may work in mysterious ways, but I don't think absolute bliss would abruptly self-transmute into torture. It's a punishment from God - let's name the representation of the severity of his punishment Thamiel.

We know at least one instance of a universe with a suffering Robin tortured by a Thamiel, but we also know that its "neighborhood" is almost completely barren of other universes worth instantiating. I take this to indicate that God, generally speaking, doesn't instantiate many universes with Hells. If he does instantiate it, there must be something worthwhile there -- God's utilitarianism might be one of the refined flavors that doesn't completely skewer itself on the repugnant conclusion

No need. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism][Average utilitarianism]] suffices to address this particular concern.

(Side note: I'm not an average utilitarian; nor am I convinced that the Repugnant Conclusion is all that repugnant in the first place.

"Its own internal logic" sounds like it has rules that it abides by. And this is not implied to be unusual.

We have no idea what a "typical" universe in this space is like; although we know what the centre of the Garden is like, and we have one other sample near the edge, we don't have much of a probability distribution. It could be that universes with smaller descriptions are privileged somehow - that the universes whose laws of physics fit on one page are more common than those which have no coherent laws and whose shortest description is just a list of every event, moment to moment, with no pattern to it.

I mean, the total number of universes God is considering must be finite, right? Consequentialist ethics breaks down when dealing with infinities, the whole system has to be finite to work as Metatron describes. Very large, maybe, but finite (Answer to Job says it's more than 10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{984}}}}} ) And if it's finite, we don't know how many of your "chaotic" universes are even under consideration.

It could be that the typical universe is chaotic with no consistent rules. It could be that the typical universe has consistent rules that don't support life (e.g. there are no stable atoms). It could be that the typical universe is something else entirely. Answers on a postcard, please. But we really have no idea.

Indeed, one could even argue that to determine whether a universe is worthy of being created in the first place, God must perform a computation to determine its goodness. Such a computation would likely be equivalent to simulating the universe in question, which in my view is no different from instantiating it directly. Hence, by the very act of determining whether a particular universe is worthy of instantiation, God simulates (and therefore instantiates) every possible universe, including those that fail to meet his criteria.

Hypercomputation can be thought of as a turing machine with several oracle machines tacked on. With the right set of oracle machines, you could do such a computation without it being equivalent to simulating the universe in question. Various things in unsong suggest that god has /some/ access to one or more oracle machines, as their laws of physics don't seem computable on just a turing machine.

In universe, finding yourself in a world with cause and effect that also doesn't seem turing computable implies that hypercomputation (and some set of oracle machines) is possible.

******* [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine]]

You can simulate any turing machine on a turing machine. Being turing complete means that you can simulate /anything/, because reality/math is turing complete.

But imagine if your world, your reality, /wasn't/ turing complete. None of your computers could run a turing-complete program, your reality couldn't contain anything that could be used to make a turing machine. Certain mathematical functions would just be impossible, civilizations rise and die, all without being able to run a certain set of functions. As far as they're concerned, the laws of physics simply don't let you do X.

Now imagine that our reality is like that, it's turing complete but it's not super-turing complete. There are functions that are computable by the system "simulating" us that we wouldn't be able to.

Imagining hypercomputation is kind of like that. We don't know what an oracle machine could do, or where they get their information, because they can't exist.

Now there are a lot of things in unsong that seem uncomputable, but cause-and-effect still exists. That implies that the world of unsong is /deterministic/ but not /computable/. That's impossible, so they must be able to compute the uncomputable. When the uncomputable is computable, we call that hypercomputation.

The other hypothesis is that the uncomputable /isn't/ computable, and the universe we see is the result of random noise. If you were to find yourself in a universe like unsong it would be reasonable to assume that your multiverse /isn't/ composed almost entirely of random noise, probably. The explanation for that is a bit more complicated and a bit more dubious.

**** At the same time, we have heard that UNSONG!God created worlds until they were just marginally more good than bad, and that they are in a world close to or at that border. So at least compared to many other worlds, it seems it will be a small contribution indeed.

***** Not necessarily the case. We must distinguish between two things: the boundaries of which hypothetical worlds are sufficiently net-good to be worth creating, and the boundaries of actualized created worlds which were able to fulfill those standards. The answer talks about how the world of UNSONG exists surrounded by a metaphysical vast waste of possibilities which were never actualized. This suggests that as you grow nearer to the edges of the garden, the actualized net-good worlds become less and less frequent from among the many possibilities. Because of these wastes of unrealized possibility, there may actually be a very large metaphysical distance in net-goodness between the hypothetical least net-good world and the actualized least net-good world.

I interpret that somewhat differently. The way I read it, even the reason the thicket of non-actualization exists is because even one coincidence less is enough to drive the net-good into negative values, where the world is an "[abomination] of wickedness". Additionally, it appears that net-goodness decreases monotonically as distance from the center increases, and UNSONG's universe is quite far from the center. It would seem that this means that UNSONG is almost certainly about a reality which is only barely worth actualizing by UNSONG!God's standards, and likely not worth actualizing by my own.

******* It's interesting to see how the same chapter can be interpreted very differently. The chapter strongly implies that in the UNSONG universe, hell will not be eternal. I interpret this to ultimately result in an infinite degree of net-goodness. However great the degree of past suffering and iniquity, an eternal future without such evil will inevitably produce an unlimited quantity of good to outweigh the finite amount of evil.

Since we are told that this universe is towards the outer edges of the garden, and yet we can still expect an infinite degree of net-goodness, then I interpret the meaning of the garden edges differently. I think this implies that God's omnibenevolence results in all actualized worlds producing an infinite degree of net-good. However, the edges of the garden are where it becomes increasingly difficult and infrequent for a world with such a large quantity of evil to still end up resulting in such an infinite net-good outcome.

Thus all of the coincidences. Rather than one slipped coincidence changing the result from (Good - Evil = 1) to (Good - Evil = -1), I take it that one slipped coincidence would change the result from (Good - Evil = Infinite Good) to (Good - Evil = Infinite Evil). It becomes very rare for seeds in the vicinity of the UNSONG universe to manage to defeat and destroy evil to produce a net-infinite-good eternal future. So that is why God declines to create the worlds that do not produce the favourable result.

******** On the other hand, God describes infinite good and states that no more worlds can be infinitely good. So I don't see the destruction of hell as producing infinite good. Eliminating a source of future infinite evil, definitely, but the living world will still contain evil and an insufficiency of good. Eliminating hell is a big and necessary step towards infinite good, and may even be the push towards some net positive goodness, but I don't see it as a sufficient step. Of course, it sounds like the dead and dying go to heaven, but the living will still suffer, and why not simply start in heaven? I suppose we may see next weekend what the correct interpretation is.

********* There are infinitely many infinities.

One can be reached by counting up one at a time: 1. 2. 3. 4. etc. One which is identical to the first, except you start at -0.5. One can be reached by doubling: 1. 2. 4. 8. etc.

If UNSONG world consists of an eternity with at least slightly positive utility and without hell preceded by a temporary period where hell (and its very, very large negative utility) exists, that would eventually produce infinite utility.

But it's still different than the always-maximal-utility paradise described.

You've got that backwards. The "center" is the perfectly good world by which all others are generated. Distance from the center is a calculation, stating how different it is from the center. One way of viewing the highly dimensional data that is worlds.
