** Kind of. It definitely has rational elements, and it certainly tries to be one. But a lot of it is lost in the moral morass of Social Justice. I'll spoiler it just to be sure, but the MC sits down and tries to figure out how to most effectively use her power for good, and ends up [[#s][tag]] What's rational about that? She doesn't munchkin her unique advantage of superpowers at all, instead it's only relevant to the extent that it allows people to complain about how privileged she is. If she were rational, she would get involved in politics or something instead.

Also, again as a result of the SJ overtones: There's a very creepy bit where one of the female 'heroes' [[#s][tag]] Seriously, that sort of thing creeps me out, and it's totally anethema to what rationality is about.

Edit: Please note that the above criticism does not take away from the fact that the comic is very well made and engaging - I still read it in its entirety, after all!

*** I agree that the organization she ends up building is not the highest-utility application of superpowers, but I also don't think it was supposed to be. I think it's meant to be a critical stage in her development, but not her "final form." The "rational" aspect of it is her realization that she can accomplish her goals more effectively by networking with other capes, rather than by trying to independently punch the world's problems to death with a powerset that's not really equipped for effecting large-scale change. She has a long way to go, but she's making progress by correcting that flaw in her approach.

The actions of the character you refer to in the second paragraph are certainly disturbing, but they are not portrayed as heroic in the narrative. They're a reaction to a systemic injustice, sure, but a misguided and self-defeating one. That character is the /antagonist/ of her chapter; she's not portrayed as a wholly unsympathetic sadistic cartoon of a villain, but SFP's antagonists rarely are. She comes across as a foil to the protagonist, an example of what she might become if she gives in to her impulse to solve problems with violence.

*** Actually, that is a deconstruction of the entire justification of /having/ vigilantes. Rape has two characteristics which makes it unusual as crimes go.

1: The recidivism rate is very, very high. Rapists are rare, but rape is common, because rapists re-offend over, and over and over. Rapists stop when they are stopped, and not before.

2: The conviction and apprehension rate is abysmal. The formal legal system does a really shitty job of fighting rape, and will often put the victim through hell in the process.

Therefore, if vigilantism is ever justified, it would be against rapists, and it is perfectly logical that in a world with capes, one of them would embark on that crusade. It is really hard to argue against it without completely de-legitimizing caping full-stop. Which is the authors point. Beating up drug-dealers and muggers does not address any social problem which the formal justice system fails at. The cops are, in fact, pretty good at that job.

Uhm. Now I kind of want to write a story about an oracle-expy that goes after financial sector criminals... Who also reoffend a lot and dont serve time very often.

**** Ok, that all sounds fair enough, but that's not really what's bothering me. There are plenty of stories where heroes do violent or evil things, but it's not an issue because the reader is expected to understand that you can't solve the world's problems that way.

It's the fetishization of violence against the dirty mongrel enemy that disturbs me. Especially when combined with the trope that these evil mysterious creatures are widespread on e.g. college campuses, and could be anywhere amongst us.

Or to interpret it more charitably: That particular character is presented as a pitfall that the social justice activist is not to fall into - but the line is drawn precisely at deliberate torture and murder of an otherwise deserving enemy, /not/ at the idea of treating fellow college students as being potential monsters deserving of death in the first place.

***** I didn't really get the impression that the comic was fetishizing the violence. The character made spectacular displays of violence and torture because she wanted to make her motives obvious and inspire fear among her target demographic--not because the readers were supposed to be like "nice". Speaking only for myself, even though I despised her victims for their crimes and believed they deserved punishment, the brutal nature of their deaths made me feel uncomfortable pangs of sympathy for them--not triumph or gleeful satisfaction.

I know fiction has a fine line to walk between simply showing extreme violence and gratuitously reveling in it, but I don't feel that this story crossed that line. That might just be my own opinion though.

As for the trope that rapists could be anywhere among us...well, they could be and they are. They're rare, but they don't wear an identifying facial brand or anything.

It's also true that rapists could be anywhere among groups of black people just like they could be anywhere on college campuses. But if she was stalking black people for this purpose, we would see a lot of objection.

Going after a particular group implies that that group is particularly dangerous, above and beyond the fact that there is danger everywhere.

We don't actually see her kill any women, probably because rapists are mostly men. (She does try to kill the female main character at one point, not for raping anyone but just to get her off her back.)

She does say that the victims of the rapists she killed were "women, mostly women, but men as well, and kids." I found one example of her referring to her targets as "guys," so it's probable that they have been overwhelmingly or exclusively male.

************ It's just one thing that kind of bothers me with SFP. I'm not exactly opposed to the SJ themes, but if we're looking at creating awareness, a lot of domestic abuse victims are men. Like, 40%. And a vast, vast majority of abuse /shelters/ are for women - way out of proportion with the abuse statistics. SFP organizes a women's abuse program, I think, when a program to support and protect /everyone/ would do more to break down the perceived line between men and women.

It's a theme that SFP doesn't seem to touch on very much. In its effort to focus on the strong female, it forgets about the weak male. Or that's what I think, anyway - I could be wrong?

***** @Sophronius

I really don't understand how that was what you took away from SFP. The whole "are regular people good or evil" question is as old as dirt and it's not entirely obvious to everyone what the actual answer is because there is evidence for both sides. Also, serial killers ARE people too, and not all of them are psychopaths. In the story the reason the main character even felt an impulse to kill all those bystanders at all was because she felt like they were threatening the life of one of her best friends by inciting violence against her.

SFP is NOT a fic for social justice warrior ideology, it's a fic for social justice. If you cannot see the difference between these two things then you've been fooled by SJW ideology just as much as any true believer.

****** Hey Vulcan. My impression might be partly coloured by reading the comments to those sections and being particularly dismayed by them. I'll agree with you that SFP is much more even-handed than most SJ stories, and the protagonist does try to be a reasonable and decent human being, which is great. And I do think the story is good and well written.

However, the underlying assumptions of SJ ideology still shines through. What we have here is a character [[#s][tag]], and the protagonist going "You know I can totally see where you're coming from but violence is not the solution." Imagine, instead, if a white character were shown killing POCs and another white character had that as a reaction. Would that seem reasonable to you?

As @CeruleanTresses put it, this antagonist is put up as a foil to the protagonist - someone who the protagonist could potentially become. It's something meant to inspire the audience to think and go "Huh, do I agree or disagree with this?" However in doing so it places the Overton window to the extreme left, and anchors you to consider anything less extreme than that as normal.

By contrast, look at how the MCs most controversial action is treated. She... bent a libertarian's arm once. That's all she did, and everyone lost their shit. She couldn't sleep, and literally threw up in disgust of herself. People in the audience reviled her for it. Seriously, I mean, what?

Does it not cause any moral dissonance in you, to see these two completely different actions treated in such a completely perverse way?

FUCK that was so frustrating. [[#s][spoilers and ranting]]

Of course there were plenty of people taking the opposite side too. But I guess the lesson here is to keep the comments section well divorced in our minds from the actual story, because there's always going to be some real infuriating shit in there.

I will say I don't really see much celebration of that other character's actions these days. The readership seems to largely agree that she was wrong. I think the composition of the audience might just have been different at the time those pages were posted.

I suspect that there's not much crossover between "people who think the other character's actions were good" and "people who think Alison's actions were evil." A lot of the "Alison is evil" rhetoric I've seen has gone so far as to accuse those who /don't/ condemn her of being social justice warriors, for defending the "torture" of a cishet white man.

And the comic does show Moonshadow to be in the wrong, so maybe I'm overstating my case a bit here. I don't think the comic is anti-white or hateful of men or anything like that. But I do find something to be incredibly /off/ about a worldview in which building woman's shelters is a logical thing to do for someone with superpowers, hunting and torturing rapists is considered merely controversial, and taking someone's bodily autonomy (bending their arm) is considered to be the worst thing in the world (TM).

********* Don't know if this makes a difference to you, but--dropping spoiler tags since we're this far down the thread--Valkyrie isn't a women's shelter. It's an organization where biodynamics get matched up with women who've recently left abusive relationships, and protect them during the period where they're most likely to be murdered. So it fulfills a similar need to a women's shelter, but it is something that specifically calls for superpowered individuals, not something just any group of baseline humans could do.

It also arose organically out of the events of the story. Al decided to organize Valkyrie because she was inspired by her conversation with Dr. Rosenblum about the serial killer. If you recall, Rosenblum's side of that conversation was basically "I don't see why I should care about this one serial killer murdering a handful of people, when many more women are being killed by their partners every day and that doesn't get nearly as much attention." Which is a pretty [[/r/rational][r/rational]]-style line of thinking, really--being objective in how you allocate your time and resources so you don't focus on dramatic problems at the expense of more serious but "boring" ones.

So I think that got Al thinking about these forms of suffering that are more systemic, less spectacular, don't make the news the way Moonshadow's murders did. Then combine that with Moonshadow calling her out--paraphrased, "you could be doing literally anything else, but you're here, trying to apprehend me." (Of course she was there because she wanted to help her friend, but I do think that hit a nerve.) And those conversations, I think, inspired Al to focus less on the adversarial "find a villain and punch them" approach she's used to, and instead try to address a systemic problem that causes a lot of harm in ways that are easily ignored. It's not the /most/ effective thing she could do, but it's /more/ effective than what she'd been doing.

Regarding the comments section--I mentioned this before, but it was in an edit and you may not have seen it--I really don't think the readers who applauded Moonshadow's killings and the readers who condemned twisting Max's arm are the same people. I wasn't reading the comments during Moonshadow's arc, but I've definitely seen the people who most loudly condemned Al's actions refer to Moonshadow with a similar degree of contempt. That set of commenters aren't motivated by social justice stuff; they're mostly just deontologists who are deeply opposed to the "ends justify the means" approach. I've even seen a couple of them insisting that the utilitarian crowd would hate Alison as much as they do if she'd hurt someone other than a rich white cishet man. (And I'd also bet good money that Rosenblum would have approved of Al twisting Max's arm if she knew about it.)

Cheers, I forgot that bit. That makes slightly more sense, but still not really - funding women's shelters with your millions of dollars and government support would still be more effective, and the thought of "we have a giant squid person here who can shoot explosive water bolts from her hands - let's use her to support women in abusive relationships" doesn't /quite/ seem intuitive to me.

More effective than eliminating invisible supernatural serial killers? I dunno, I think it actually does an amazing amount of good to have a photogenic hero like her fighting villains, letting everyone know that an invincible superhero is looking out for them. Look at how much damage the mere fear of terror has done to America - reversing just a bit of that fear could be worth as much as a thousand shelters.

It reads to me like she is more interested in making a great display of being humble and sacrificing, by getting her hands dirty and lamenting over how privileged she is, than in actually using that privilege to its maximum potential. But to be fair, she does worry and wonder about these things a lot, and she really is trying to be a good person despite it all.

*********** I take the comic's numbers as accurate in-universe, but I don't know how accurate they are in real life. I do know that it's true that women are disproportionately likely (compared to men) to be killed by intimate partners and ex-partners.

Re: "More effective than eliminating invisible supernatural serial killers?"--Well, yes, that's what I'm saying. Moonshadow's scary, but she was ultimately killing only a handful of people. Alison has realized that there are more serious, systemic issues that are more broadly harmful even if they aren't as spectacular. As for the deterrence effect--she's tried being a photogenic hero fighting villains for years, and by the start of the comic she'd come to the conclusion that it didn't fix anything. I agree that fear causes a lot of harm and expense, but either Mega Girl wasn't enough to alleviate it, or Alison hasn't made that connection yet. (I do agree that making a lot of money to fund women's shelters would be more effective, but it's probably valuable for Alison to learn all the skills that go into building an organization like this from the ground up--especially anything in the area of negotiation and diplomacy.)

I don't think the comic really treats Moonshadow's and Alison's actions one way or another--I don't think it passes a value judgment. I think /Alison/ treats the acts differently, for understandable reasons. On the one hand she's reacting to the actions of an old friend she knows she's treated badly, whose descent into villainy she feels responsible for. Whereas on the other hand she's reacting to /her own/ actions--actions that created cognitive dissonance because they violated what she thought was one of her core principles. If Alison had slashed a rapist's throat open, she surely would have thrown up, etc the way she did after hurting Max.

Honestly, wanting and threatening to kill the angry mob that is trying to incite violence against one of your best friends is wrong, but it's not unprovoked like twisting a random guy's arm AND kidnapping him in order to save one of your best friends from endless torment. While the latter is more defensible from a utilitarian stand point, it isn't as relatable to the emotions of humans who don't intuitively understand scope. I will repeat myself: By treating social justice and social justice warrior ideology as equivalent, you are letting yourself be fooled by social justice warrior ideology just as much as any true believer, and in the process seriously misrepresenting a great work of literature.

Nevertheless I still take issue with some of their object-level beliefs (which I'll agree I could have steel-manned better).

Regarding those object level beliefs: You seem to be referring to the case where the MC got angry at the mob that threatened Feral. I haven't discussed this issue (I was talking about Moonshadow) but I found that to be totally reasonable and understandable, and don't blame the MC for killing that one person in the slightest. The thing that made me uncomfortable was the disturbing torture-fantasy played out against suspected rapists, which I don't think is unreasonable.

Anyway, I remember you liking my story, Scar's Samsara, which also touches upon some issues of social justice. Surely I wouldn't be able to write about that in a favourable light if I were "fooled as much as any true believer"?

**** Rape has a third characteristic: It has a high false accusation rate, and the fact that it may not leave evidence (especially when there is dispute over whether someone consented) makes it convenient to use for false accusations. And that characteristic makes vigilante justice against accused rapists particularly bad compared to vigilante justice against other crimes.

***** Do you have a source on that? Everything I've read says that the false accusation rate for rape is roughly the same as the false accusation rate for other crimes. I'm pretty sure the false accusation for rape only appears to be higher if you assume that all acquittals and dismissed cases were false accusations--which of course is an unjustifiable assumption, since there frequently isn't enough evidence to convict in cases of actual rape.

****** It's hard to get accurate numbers in this, considering rape is viewed as such a "special evil" in society (even though it is at worst a violent assault, but that's another conversation). Being accused of rape will turn the angry mob loose almost instantly, and they'll be out for blood, truth be damned.

I mean, you yourself said in another comment in this thread that "victims" (not alleged, but "victims") go "through hell" when they are part of an investigation of an alleged rape, a statement you're very unlikely to make for any other crime investigation where the victim must testify. If we're already ascribing some sort of special consideration for alleged victims, the reporting skews. Add in the absolute madness of post-hookup regret being spun into rape allegations, and the numbers skew even more, especially with the modern SocJus "listen and believe" ideology.

We'd likely have much better numbers for rape if people didn't think of rape as the "worst thing ever" (which is patently absurd, since murder is the worst thing ever. You can recover from rape, but murder is forever.), and just lumped it in with severe assault/battery of a non-sexual nature.

******* You are talking to two people here. And, frankly, go watch court tv. Most rapes dont go to court because women damn well know the defense council will try to make them out to be a lying slut. In front of a room full of people.

That is an extremely unpleasant experience. The police very frequently do the same thing before things go to court. And every woman on earth knows this is what happens. Nobody sane files those charges without cause.

Apply some theory of mind. Would it be worth it to you? No? I did not think so. There is no emotional payoff to sending an innocent to jail, and there certainly is no hope of reputational or financial gain either. The entire reason this is a common perception is due to adversarial courts. The only defense against a testimony of rape is to undermine the credibility of the witness, and therefore approximately all* rape cases end up including a false accusation of perjury.

*Not saying it never happens. Some people are, after all, insane to very high degrees. But to suppose it is common is laughable.

The only reason women elect to go through with pressing charges is a desire for justice and the fact that - as I said, rapists reoffend. A lot. So getting the guy who assaulted you off the street is vital for the safety of all your friends.

Are you unhappy women tend to view you as a potential predator? That is fair. The large dollop of fear which taints a lot of heterosexual dating is not pleasant. Lending camouflage to the actual predators out there is, however, not helpful.

But is television really a good source? There's an inherent bias here - any material that's worth being televised must have a story.

Is this what happens? I'm honestly asking. The defense council's job is to present a defense. Whatever defense they present must be supported with evidence.

Or rather, what I'm asking is, what exactly does the defense council do? If they're presenting the possibility that the woman may have lied, that's what they're supposed to do. If they deliberately belittle and try an emotional argument to make the woman seem like a lying slut, then that's awful. But the two are very different things and deserve a distinction.

#+begin_quote

I don't think this is a rational argument. Someone who makes a false accusation is a criminal to begin with - they've clearly already thought it through and decided it's worth it. Applying the average person's mindset to it is like asking the average person if stealing or murder would be worth it - most people would say no, because most sane people aren't criminals.

There are examples of women who falsely accuse others, including one who falsely accused fifteen men. I don't have the source with me at the moment since I'm stuck on mobile, but I'd be happy to get some sources if you'd like to continue this discussion.

Somewhat more horrifyingly, there's also precedent of false memories being created by unethical therapists or psychologists. This is perhaps the worse case of all - the trauma is real, and the victim certainly believes it's real, but the perpetrator is still innocent. I believe the study done for false memories was a female scientist. Again, I'll grab the sources if you'd like to make this a discussion.

Well, yes, and it's very brave for the victims to do so. That's why false accusers are so bad - they undermine the real victims.

There's one thing I'm genuinely curious about, and it's the clear difference in cultural perspective between me and a lot of others. I live in a very safe country; we have one of the lowest crime rates in the world. I can't conceive of policemen or courts deliberately making fun of and/or putting down victims.

But my question is - how much of that is an exaggeration? Because remember, there's a cognitive bias in place here. Negative memories are a lot more prominent than positive ones, and negative news tends to be a lot more lucrative. If a victim is treated correctly through the court procedures, there's nothing to write about. So you only really hear about it when things go wrong.

Which is to say, how much is the media a reflection of your society, really?

But yes, people are routinely total scumbags to women who report rapes. Not just individually, systemically too.

Let me use the example that boils it down to its essence. In order to get a conviction of rape, you really need a rape kit. Do you know what a rape kit involves? It is a checklist and a set of containers for samples.

In order to do a proper rapekit, the person who just got violently assaulted needs to get up, and go /directly/ to a medical facility. Do not take a shower, do not change your clothes. Then you have to tell a complete stranger- a medical professional, but still a stranger. That you were just raped, and you still have your attackers DNA all over you. Then that professional will /take your clothes/ - because those are now evidence. Count your bruises and the location of them. Including the ones you almost certainly have in intimate areas (.. vaginas dont bruise during consensual sex.) And oh yes, take scrapings from everywhere there might be secretions left. It is, even with the nicest doctors possible, not a good time.

And you know what then happens in a lot of US states? Those kits just sit around and never get tested. Because there has not been allocated enough money to run dna scans on them. This, while politicians proclaim their devotion to law and order.

You are being misled by popular culture, movies, and hearsay on the internet. A majority of sexual assault cases are won without direct physical evidence of rape, because a vast majority of sexual assault cases are not about violent assault (what is legally termed rape in many jurisdictions, although the term has caught on socially to mean everything related to sexual assault) but sexual assault in either an existing relationship, related to intoxication or drug use, or by someone either related to or well known by the victim.

The idea that only some applications of violence--specifically, those that defend against threats to the status quo--are seen as acceptable/admirable is a major theme of that arc. The vigilante says it herself: "You killed so many innocent bystanders [as a superhero], and it was all okay...You ever see a soldier get called a serial killer? ....They're trying to tell people that I'm fighting the wrong war."

Basically, she's arguing that society has shown it has no objection to her /methods,/ so the problem must be with her /targets./ Hence the deconstruction of superheroes as a concept: The reader, faced with this apparent hypocrisy, has to decide whether the answer is "it should also be okay to murder rapists" or "it shouldn't be okay to murder anyone."

Actually, an anti-financial-criminal vigilante could probably fill a similar philosophical niche. It just wouldn't be as compelling of a story, because most readers wouldn't have the same visceral reaction to a financial criminal as to a rapist.

Re: evidence, the vigilante in this case does go to great lengths to confirm to her satisfaction that the rapists are guilty. Most of that happens offscreen, of course, so it's hard to say exactly what her standards for evidence were.

Given that the central question driving the protagonist's actions is "How can my superpowers be applied for maximum utility?", it's definitely the kind of thing that appeals to this sub. There's also a lot of philosophical tension between deontological and utilitarian perspectives. Keeping it vague to avoid spoilers, but I think people here would particularly enjoy everything having to do with the character Feral.

One thing that distinguishes it from a lot of power munchkinry content is that the main character isn't especially idealized; she is /trying/ to do the best she can for the world, but she is very much human, and her powers don't include either superhuman intelligence or superhuman emotional regulation. So there's a lot of struggle between her lofty ideals and her flawed, human impulses, and and a lot of introspection in the vein of "I need to stay cognizant of this personality flaw I know I have" or "Okay, I see now that this is how I fucked up." I don't /dislike/ brilliant, hyper-rational protagonists, but I've really enjoyed this character's more relatable struggle to do good.

Note that the story spends a lot of time exploring social justice concepts, as part of the broader theme of "how can we actually make the world a better place for everyone?". For me that's very appealing, but I know some people find that kind of thing offputting, so fair warning.

** So, I just binge-read this comic over the weekend since seeing the post.

I think you could call it rational fic, yes, though the titular protagonist is not herself rational. In fact, she is surrounded by people who approach problems rationally, and she might be the only main character who /doesn't./

My main criticism of her is that she doesn't leverage her comparative advantage. Rational problem solving is about identifying strengths and exploiting them to achieve your aim.

Her strengths are obvious, yet she pointedly avoids using them to directly solve problems. The only thing she does that benefits from her abilities is firefighting. Honestly, she should just be doing more of this. Rather than trying to think about the whole world's problems and solve them all at once somehow, she should focus on problems she can solve that others can't.

Disaster relief is something she is trained for and has abilities that would make a huge difference. Simply cooperating with firefighters and the national guard to help with catastrophes could save thousands of lives without the need for violence that she seems worried about. And that's just thinking locally. If she actually got her head out of just helping the western world, she could work with relief groups in at-risk areas and make a HUGE difference. Just transportation of food and medical supplies to hard to reach areas could make a world of difference.

These are obvious things she could do that would be personally rewarding and help others, without all the philosophical hand-wringing over how to fix the whole world with "one punch."

She's really a poster child for hipster college students who want to THINK about saving the world but not actually DO anything directly useful.

*** I think you make excellent points here. I've had similar thoughts about Alison, and I hope to see her come to those realizations--especially since I think the narrative frames her "one punch" obsession as a flaw that's holding her back. She would really be an incredible boon to any disaster relief effort, I'd be thrilled to see her doing that.

What did you think of [[#s][explicit spoilers]] That's probably the most direct application of her super strength to save lives on a global stage, but it was extremely controversial among the reader base. Some [[#s][implicit spoilers]].

**** thanks, it was a really fun read! I'm glad this post brought it to my attention.

Per max -- I agree that the act is reprehensible; I also agree it was correct from a utilitarian standpoint. Obviously, if there were a route to a non-violent solution, she should have taken that - finding a better way to convince him, incentivizing it in some way, etc.

however, for the purposes of the story, this was set up to be impossible. I was disappointed in the trajectory of Max's character arc in general. He was really turned into a strawman very quickly.

To be clear, I'm not much for libertarianism as a practical set of policies, but the ideals can certainly be made out as self consistent and commendable. For some reason the author felt the need to make him almost villainous and hateful. The sudden anger at being told what to do, the careless disregard for people, it was all just an unlikeable caricature and complete strawman.

I would have much preferred a slightly more generous execution of the same story, where Max argues for the values of personal freedom persuasively, instead of just acting like a dick for no reason. Genuine moral conflicts like this around personal terminal values or "axioms" are interesting.

Were I to write the story, I would have it such that his power to amplify others comes with a cost to himself, and show that he is unwilling to pay that cost at Al's behest. They could even still have some existing friction between them, though maybe less trivial and morally one-sided, where they had heatedly argued about personal responsibility and social good vs individual freedom, both coherently.

I think THAT would be a much more interesting conundrum. Max would have a point - he isn't obligated to help Feral, especially at cost to himself. But Al's decision would still be the best Utilitarian solution. Using force could even be said to be justified, given that it didn't just end Feral's self inflicted torture, but increased the total capacity to save many lives.

(though, I'm not sure the logistics work out on that, either. moving all those organs around the world coming out of a single facility operating just 40 hours a month would be a nighmare.)

Given that he had no reason not to comply, though, and it was costless to him, using force may be justified. She didn't need to physically HURT him, though. Kidnapping and just waiting in the sky till he gave in and agreed would probably have been enough.

I suspect the author doesn't have any sympathy or understanding for Max's position, though, which is why he wasn't written to be more compelling.

***** I think the reason Max was written to be such an unbelievable jerk is because the scenario was supposed to be extreme--the question being, basically, "at what point does it become okay to twist this dude's arm? If he can save this many lives at essentially zero personal cost, and he won't do it, and the reason he won't do it is that he's a spiteful prick with a bootstrap where his empathy should be, /then/ can you twist his arm? Why or why not?" They wanted to give Alison every possible reason to feel justified in her actions, and then show her conflicted and wracked with guilt /anyway./

Basically, I think he was a dick with poorly conceived ideas because that arc was about utilitarianism vs deontology /more/ than it was about autonomy vs. cooperation. But I agree that it was a missed opportunity. If they'd made him an unlikeable piece of human garbage without the emphasis on personal autonomy, they'd have left those libertarian ideals open for a more nuanced exploration later. I'd like to see the autonomy vs cooperation debate fleshed out in its own right, not just as a facet of the utilitarianism/deontology debate.

****** Jerkiness has 0 bearing on whether force is acceptable. None at all. All these serve to do is provide emotional investment for the reader (or fail to) but it's never a reason to hurt someone. I agree the philosophy should have gotten better treatment.

******* Well--that depends on the reader's perspective, right? /I/ don't believe jerkiness has bearing on whether force is justified, and /you/ don't, but there are perspectives from which his jerkiness would be relevant to that question. I think the idea was to cover all the possible avenues by which someone could justify harming him, and then say, "OK, in spite of all that, there's still a debate here".

But yeah, they unfortunately kind of threw his ideals in general under the bus by making him both the designated trolley problem villain /and/ the mouthpiece for libertarianism. Their antagonists are usually a lot more nuanced. I'm no libertarian, but there /are/ important conversations to be had about the value of personal autonomy and how it should be prioritized.

******** if someone can justify harming him because he's a jerk, that's not utilitarianism. that's just punishing jerks. it's a completely different conversation. his actions weren't even really immoral, they were just presented as and /signalled/ jerkness.

agreed on the rest.

********* Sorry, I don't think I explained myself very well. I didn't mean to connect the jerk aspect with utilitarianism, but I see how it came off that way. I definitely don't think harming him for being a jerk is justifiable from a utilitarian perspective. What I meant to express is that by making him completely unsympathetic but /not/ allowing that to close the debate, they highlight the philosophical dilemma in play. Like, if he'd been a really nice person it would b be more "obvious" for Alison to feel guilty, just because it feels bad to hurt nice people, but he's a complete asshole and she still feels guilty because she's questioning her principles.

I could be reading too much into it. I guess it's also possible that they just really don't like libertarians.

** I think so, yeah. Granted, it's not a munchkinry fic, lots of things could have been done better, but I think it's very realistic, because you don't just go straight from superhero into a perfect social munchkin. She /tries/ solving problems through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources, and that's what counts, even when she makes mistakes or outright fails.
