** Jesus Christ, Hakram.

So now I'm wondering if the last line of the previous chapter--"In the game, as in all things, it was always better to be the betrayer than the betrayed"--was not a statement of intent, but a description of the main obstacle to the trust he seeks? Like in the Prisoner's Dilemma, when the risks of cooperation are too high, betrayal is incentivized--and by offering what he seems to believe is tangible evidence of his precommitment to cooperate, he changes the incentive structure to make trusting him rational, so that he and Vivienne can cooperate and avoid the real-world analogue to his game's "Callow takes all" outcome? I don't know. I think Hakram's a few steps ahead of me.

** The Aspect 'failing to bloom' feels important. In conjunction with the recent comment upon Vivienne's physical appearance not being set (hair still growing) unlike other named it seems like the grasp on her Name is...weakening? Perhaps failing to fulfill or lean into her Role to such an extent has caused it.

The main argument against this is that Hakram seemed to know that Thief would be unable to Hide, otherwise that whole gambit at the end would not have worked. I believe Hakram has a third aspect slot open but I don't recall any dialogue from him that sounded like a trigger for some kind of new nullifying aspect.

*** She hasn't been doing that much thieving recently - is it possible she's transitioning between Names? She seems to be filling the Role of Spymistress or Chancellor for Cat these days. We saw Masego change from Apprentice to Hierophant on screen, which was very flashy, but it makes some sense to me that Named could also have more subtle transitions over a longer period.

I do think it's more likely that she's just losing her Role, given the physical changes. Maybe she'll lose her Name entirely, then gain another?

Squire, Apprentice, etc. And all the shit that's going on with Cat, of course, but as always she's a special case, and Squire was a transitional Name anyways.

I didn't get the impression that most Named ever got the opportunity to get new names. You either have it 'til you die, or the necessary conditions that made you eligible end, making you no longer eligible and it's just gone.

Thus I strongly suspect Thief is transitioning due to having a new Role.

She's noted that he has never taken the opportunity to build the support he'd need to publicly run Callow, so it's hard to buy the misuse of power angle. And orcs having basic rights isn't orthogonal to Callow's well-being unless you're a racist (which she clearly is).

Edit: I re-read the passage, and she fears he'll manipulate Cat into a war for orcish independence, which /would/ be orthogonal to Callow's interests. She just happens to be overlooking that Callow is basically already at war with Praes, things will probably escalate, and orcish allies could only help Callow.

The problem isn't whether Hakram is demonstrably altruistic, the problem is that Vivienne think's he's incapable of understanding altruism altogether, and attributes that inability to a fundamental character flaw. Hakram asked why she supported the Liesse Accords, not because he couldn't imagine altruism as the motive, but because there were other possibilities. He tried to understand her, and she turned it into an insult.

That doesn't really work, considering the political ramifications would be bigger than a slap on the wrist (no matter how forgiving Cat might be), but you worded that in a way that made me realize the better way to arrange Hakram's epiphany. Here's the relevant passage:

#+begin_quote
  “Your life is in no danger,” Deadhand calmly said.

  She laughed, right in his face.

  “Is that so?” she mocked. “Why, because Catherine would be cross if you killed me? It would pass. She needs you too badly, and you'll be able to tell her you tried before I so regrettably forced your hand.”

  “Your murder would be seen as a greenskin coup, regardless of context,” Adjutant said. “So if you cannot believe in my own intentions, at least believe in the practicalities involved.”

  “Spot on, Deadhand,” she snarled. “There's nothing quite as reassuring as hearing one's death would be politically inconvenient.”

  “So that's the kernel,” the orc said, sounding surprised. “You do not believe you have worth.”
#+end_quote

It would make more sense to cut out the political bit altogether:

#+begin_quote
  “Your life is in no danger,” Deadhand calmly said.

  She laughed, right in his face.

  “Is that so?” she mocked. “Why, because Catherine would be cross if you killed me? It would pass. She needs you too badly, and you'll be able to tell her you tried before I so regrettably forced your hand.”

  “So that's the kernel,” the orc said, sounding surprised. “You do not believe you have worth.”
#+end_quote

Vivienne states the view that her murder wouldn't be punished, Hakram sees she undervalues herself.

(As a strategic asset, of course. She's still a worthless human being.)

Bear in mind that her Name and the Role it plays are classically very paranoid, especially when Thief is played as an Evil role. It's likely true that she's heavily pressured into being paranoid in the same way that Diabolist was heavily pressured into monologueing, in addition to both already naturally fitting those roles heavily.

If I am suffering from PTSD (from being lit up by mages) and am afraid that someone is a violent psychopath, having them randomly cut off their own hand in front of me would not make me less afraid.

It would trigger my PTSD, scare me even more, and result in both horrible nightmares and an intense belief that it is only a matter of time until the individual snapped the rest of the way. Violently.

Thief has questionable loyalty, true, but this all comes from her perceived lack of worth. That perceived lack is making the possibility of the Woe losing her (either her name or by betrayal or just parting away).

Hakram cut off his arm in a "bargain" - his arm, in exchange for /her/. And afterwards, he states that it was worth it - she is far more worth to him and the Woe than his hand is.

Imagine you are talking to someone you are worried is unstable and violent. They let you know they know you are worried, then they break their nose on the table, getting blood everywhere, and tell you that you are worth losing their nose over.

1) the person never expresses you breaking your nose will help them feel better 2) you never ask if breaking your nose will make them feel better 3) there is no tradition of breaking your nose as a form of apology

So in-story, we have the believed-to-be-violently-unstable-orc just doing the thing and assuming it will help. no discussion about it, just did it. Then he tosses out that she is worth it. We the reader know what he means, but I am not at all convinced she would based on the words used.

Yes, it is made clear to the reader what he hopes to gain by cutting off his hand, but there is no buy-in from her. Meanwhile violently and unpredictably cutting off his hand does nothing to help the perception that he is violent and unpredictable.

** I've been skipping the interludes, hoping to eventually get back to the main plot, but I read the bottom of this one. Could someone please explain why the hell Hakram just randomly cut off his hand?

*** Thief has been incredibly suspicious of Hakram since that time he threatened to snap her neck if she ever turned on Cat, and her self-worth has taken a beating in the last few books because she hasn't ever had a real solo victory like any of the other Woe. The two issues kind of fed into each other now that Vivienne is stuck with Hakram and basically no one else to talk to, so Hakram decided to kill two birds with one stone by unequivocally demonstrating that he both values Thief and that she can trust him by chopping his (living) hand off.

**** ... That's it? I had assumed that there was some prior "I will protect you even if I lose a hand" or something. This makes no sense... How does self-mutilation send an "I trust you" message? If someone did this in front of me it would make me MORE nervous, since they are clearly unstable and unpredictable.

***** It's symbolic, I think- Hakram vowed to snap Thief's neck with his skeletal hand, and now he's rescinding that oath by giving up his remaining hand. It also serves a double purpose in demonstrating that Hakram values Thief more than his own limbs, which is something that she needs pretty badly right now.

*** I suspect it may be political optics. It looks like Hakram had a disagreement with Thief and lost his had for it. Callowans will believe she is in charge now.
