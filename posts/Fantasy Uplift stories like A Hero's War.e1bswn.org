Just got through reading Destiny's Crucible and the Hero's War web novel. Any books similar to those would be appreciated.


** Release that Witch is a Chinese novel that is very similar to Hero's War. The MC is an engineer that woke up in the body of a prince in a fantasy world with magic and different warring races. He starts off in charge of a tiny town in terrible conditions because no one expects him to inherit the throne. A lot of the story involves him finding witches and using their magic abilities to kick-start the industrial revolution.

*** I've read a fair bit of Release that Witch, and yes, there are parallels. However, victories felt cheaper in that one than in A Hero's War. It seemed like timelines were too optimistic and without the slew of complications that any real world project would have. And the consistency with which everyone was amazed and delighted by a more egalitarian society doesn't mesh well with the level of prejudice that is supposed to exist outside said society.

It's still decent writing, and an impressive quantity, I just find A Hero's War to be much more impressive.

**** RTW basically uses witch magic to instantly get around issues of research and production which took decades or centuries in real history.

It doesn't /quite/ go "Oh hey a nuke would be useful to our medieval-level army" and five pages later, guess what, there's a nuke-witch knocking on the door asking for work, but it's not entirely escaped that kind of thing.

*** I read until the dream world stuff started happening, and that /really/ turned me off from the story. I don't know if that part gets dropped later or just handled better, but it genuinely ruined my enjoyment of the novel.

**** I agree the Dream stuff is terrible. It felt like I was suddenly reading two stories where one was the original uplift story that I like, and the other was the typical trashy story where an OP protagonist uses random magics he didn't work for to beat up enemies head on. And it does not get dropped or handled better.

But if you push/skip through the trashy second story, the first story is still there and still awesome.

** Not exactly what you are asking, but in [[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] the protagonist finds that the Industrial Revolution has already been started years ago by another reincarnated person (A bit similar to Worth the Candle). This is pretty compelling in that you don't need to suspend the disbelief of the protagonist not using his knowledge to his advantage, as most of the useful stuff is already in use.

*** His predecessor was also imbued with superhuman photographic memory and talent with machinery whereas the current MC was not. The question of memory is a plothole I find often unsatisfactorily addressed in more casual uplift stories, it often requires much suspension of disbelief to accept how Average Joe protagonists can remember how to make everything from memory alone.

The story even explains how the world Klein lived in still looks like early industrial era with steampunk influences due to lack of significant deposits of crude oil. However, they do still have coal for some reason.

** With This Ring is a fanfic set in the DC universe (specifically Young Justice) in which the MC suddenly is isekai'ed from our world to that one with an orange power ring (they run on avarice). It's really long and goes all over the place, but it's pretty dang good, and the MC (in one of the timelines, there are multiple occuring in different dimensions I guess) is all about the uplift, both with technology and magic.

*** I love WtR, read it every day. And while the MC's primary goal is societal uplift, and it happens throughout the story, the actual uplift things are /usually/ backgrounded, occasionally coming to the fore for a few chapters. If uplift is your /primary/ interest, I'm not sure that WtR will really scratch that itch. Especially because it is very much NOT about developing the tech himself, but more about trying to get people to intelligently use things that exist/have been developed elsewhere and connecting people to better use their ideas/technologies.

**** It's a lot about the MC getting the people and super-technologies (ftl, mass teleportation, freeze rays, zap guns) which already exist in the DCU into mass production, which they obviously can't be in mainstream DCUs because that would make society rapidly diverge from our own.

Plus going around plinking some of the supervillains and external threats which are sandbagging the world. Either removing them from the equation or giving them channels to go legit and make a ton of cash.

I'd peg it as being less about uplift per se, and more about being a fix-fic for the DCU, using uplift as one of several methodologies.

***** Except there's almost no actual uplift, at least not in the first million-ish words that I read before giving up. Sure, the MC makes noises about it, but he doesn't really /do/ much. The exceptions are:

1. Gets some upgrades for some of his teammates' tech. Also for their bodies in the Renegade sideline.
2. Talks to Atlantis about using their magic for uplift... And then only actually used it to make anti-magic tech for himself and his friends.
3. Talked to the Greek gods and the Amazons about making industrial amount of some of the special metals they have access to. Never actually did it, though.
4. FINALLY, hundreds of thousands or a million words in, starts talking to London about setting up portals for public transport. AFAICR, it never actually happened before he wandered off into space, but at least he had the meetings.

Zoat doesn't seem that interested in making society change and having to do the work of figuring out what that would mean. He wants the SI character to point out that it COULD change, and show how rational he is and how irrational all the locals are for not having done it (which is entirely true!), but he doesn't actually want to make it happen. Either that or he's just forgetting about plot threads as he moves on to the next shiny idea. The story isn't super tightly plotted.

There are too few good stories on this genre, it's definitely a good one for a new author to make his / her name in.. Destiny's Crucible sounds promising until you read the first goodreads review then you go, NOPE.

*** I like parts of Frankowski's work - specifically, he really believes in showing his work in his time-travelling technological reintroduction fiction. More so than anyone like David Weber or David Drake or Eric Flint who have done that 'time traveller reintroduces technology' schtick in recent times, Frankowski really believes in writing out the details and making it seem believable and plausible. You can tell he's passionate about and interested / knowledgeable about science and engineering, and he does a remarkable job of writing about it. It's the most detailed and interesting competency porn about uplifting technology from medievalish levels, I think.

That all said, I have some problems with his work. They're really really bad for women in general, in an extremely fucked up way, across pretty much all of his work. It's not subtle. Frankowski's work is much, much more overtly and rampantly sexist than, say, Heinlein, as a point of reference. Also his main character in the Conrad books seems to come across as something of a Mary Sue way too often.

Even if you do enjoy the great things about his books enough to ignore the weaknesses, the series goes downhill after ~ book 4, The Flying Warlord. Book 5's science and technology stuff isn't great, and in the books after that the whole story devolves really hard and fast - book 6+ basically don't have redeeming features and indeed Frankowski doubles down on the worst parts of his writing while omitting the better parts.

**** I'm...not going to disagree. Conrad is a bit of a Mary Sue from day 1, and the series gets increasingly weird about women as the series progresses.

For some reason people who write this sub-genre tend to get weirdly sexist. I loved the Destiny's Crucible series but the last few books got weirdly sexist.
