** All right, let's break this down:

- Plot: so far, it's a pretty generic "get pulled into a video game" plot crossed with a generic rescue plot. This early, "generic" isn't a bad thing: it allows you to set reader expectations so that they can be subverted later. I'm hoping to see some interesting subversions of the standard conventions of those plots.
- Setting: not much to say yet: the "real world" feels real from your descriptions, but the interesting part of the setting is the game, which we haven't delved very far into yet
- Characters: I really like the interaction between the main character and his sister; in fact, I think that's the story's biggest strength right now. I think the story got a bit weaker when she disappeared; hopefully, she's found soon, or the new character (again, too early to say much about her) is able to establish a similar rapport.
- Themes: I've spotted a few candidates for the core themes of your story (it's clear "family" is going to play a large role), but, again, early.
- Writing quality: Very good: good introspection by the characters, good reactions to events and conversions, and all around, it seems to be well-structured.

In short, a good start; I hope to see more interaction between characters now that you've established the combat system, and I'm interested to see where you're taking this plot.

** Read Chapter 1, and I like it. When I get through more I'll give you more critique, etc; so far -

Your writing and characterization is solid and effective. I have a good idea of who even just these three people are and the life they're in. Same goes for the pacing and the literal word-craft.

I very much did NOT expect "little sister" instead of "partner", the first few paragraphs definitely seemed like they'd be about a wife, instead.

*** Read the rest. I think you're still solid, but I'm not finding it fun enough to read the fights and info dumps about mechanics. I think in those sections the main character's emotions and viewpoint aren't as present, so that may be why I'm not liking them as much - maybe I think they're too dry? I would like to more of his internal emotions in fights, I think? Try to convey what it feels like be in that fight more than what happens?

Also, you've got what could be an interesting and deep character, but we're still really only seeing the one side ("protective older sibling"). I would really like to see more of the other sides of this character (outside of his own head - where you do a great job of conveying them).

Edit:

I do really like this story! I'm interested in seeing where it goes. At a later point I'll try to write up more about what I'm particularly liking about it.

** I don't have the time to read right now, but I have to say, after like 3 paragraphs, I'm already hooked :D

** I read it almost all of it in one go. So... I like it! The comment from Nimelennar are pretty spot on imo.
