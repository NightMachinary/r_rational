**** In my opinion your hatred of Brandon is based more on emotions than objectiveness. Additionally you're responding to him when he didn't ask whether or not you like the author, he would have wanted to know if it was rational or not.

***** Yes, I note he repeats a 'fact' which we discussed, he agreed was wrong, a century of time when people were doing nothing. His ideals of why the story are irrational are fact insensitive. What actually happened in the books has minimal impact on his opinions.

That's obviously a bit awkward for a discussion on foreshadowing and one on how engrossing the world is. That's a very fact dependent discussion.

I definitely like how Brandon's books tend to tie the magic system into the world and science and the weather and people. There's very strong visual imagery in all of that. That would be something I'd enjoy seeing more in worlds, a pervasive impact of magic on technology, nature, and culture. It's a fairly standard thing for magic to have it be a rare thing that a few experts use which is sad for most of the populace.

I disagree with you though and think you're wrong. It looks a lot more like you treat arguments as replaceable soldiers than that you have a strong central point. You challenging me to some sort of public duel or debate to be voted on likewise didn't seem like a reasonable causal process.

***** I mean, booljayj didn't ask me /anything,/ to be fair. I jumped in with an unsolicited opinion, which is why I qualified by saying "I upvoted you, too" ... that was me signaling that I knew I was butting in and wasn't trying to start fights or nuthin'. In general, I like there to exist a balance of opinion, so that third parties can weigh both sides, and me being on one side of this issue doesn't mean I want the other side unheard or underweighted. It's just my personal feeling that junior writers looking to improve their craft should very much avoid trying to emulate Sanderson and not lend any credence to his musings on the concept of writing.

Also, I don't think the basis of my criticisms of Sanderson's writing is really an "opinion" domain. Like, opinions are for matters of taste, but the /source/ of my opinion is a question of fact, about which you're making predictions/suppositions. In fact, I don't hate the author, and based on my exposure to ~5 books that he's written, am simply stating /my/ claim that it's objectively low-quality on basically any metric that a reader, writer, critic, or teacher might offer. If you're interested in proving me wrong in the court of public opinion, then name a metric and start posting quotes. I'd be happy to respond on the level of, y'know, /actually discussing the writing/ instead of on the level of casting vague aspersions.

****** I don't care to prove you wrong as I don't enjoy Brandon's books personally either but I don't think he's objectively bad either. It's just not worth discussing to me. Even with what you said posting your opinion still doesn't fit this context and doesn't change that fact. You shouldn't be posting it because it's not relevant. I don't care whether or not you like to share your opinion and keep balanced views. When you share your opinion like this in such an unsolicited manner which doesn't fit the context it makes you look like a jerk. And that's what I'm saying. It's not a discussion of Brandon's quality it's the fact that you feel so inclined in your hatred of his writing to post it whenever it's not relevant.

If your point was to discuss Brandon's rationality that's different and requires a different write up than the one you linked to.

Additionally if your point was to actually spread more of your opinion perhaps a different top-level post would have been better than replying to someone asking about Brandon's rationality as a writer. Which I haven't seen anything to make me question significantly his rational writing.

Edit I made a lot of edits. Also I'm using speech to text and not at my PC so my grammar may be off sorry.

******* I note that you're quite ... strident? ... about this. Like, I seem to have triggered you in some way, and I regret that (though not enough to back off of what I think is a true point, or to refrain from defending myself).

I disagree with your claim, though, which seems to cash out to "unsolicited opinions are bad and unwelcome here." Like, I guess if you want reddit threads to be echo chambers, where no one is allowed to disagree with OP? Or if you want them to be relentlessly topic-focused and monotone, so that each thread answers one and exactly one question?

As far as "looking like a jerk," well---that's not the same thing as /being/ a jerk. Basically, I think the crime I'm guilty of here boils down to "having a contrary or unpopular opinion." I mean, your reaction to me at least /feels/ like I've personally offended you, or something. You're not reacting with the sort of dispassionate irritation that I'd imagine coming from, say, a moderator who thinks I'm unproductively off-topic.

And given that I posted what amounts to a one-word /link/ to a separate thread, clearly labeled as an OPINION, I think I went about chiming in fairly innocuously, until you started grumping back. Wasn't a derailment of anything raymestalez was trying to do, and seemed like a pretty low-cost, low-hostility way to weigh in with the opposite opinion. And I /do/ think that getting that opposite opinion into the mix is extremely important---from my perspective, at least, there's a real danger of junior writers attempting to improve their craft by trying to learn from Brandon Sanderson, and ending up mediocre (or worse) as a result.

As a final note, *the write-up I linked to /is/ about rationality---*explicitly.** The whole point of the spoiler-tagged Elantris rant is that /reality doesn't work like that./ Just look in the rules for this subreddit. Rule number one is "Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it,'" and in the cited example, 'the plot required' that an entire culture collectively hold an idiot ball for like a hundred years so that his Mary Sue character could get a cool moment. That criticism is extremely germane to discussions of rationality in fiction.

I note that /now/ this /has/ grown to the point of being a large distraction from the original point of the thread. If you'd prefer to continue in private messages rather than here, I'm down.

Alright well since we're not going to delete this chain of comments and I still disagree with your premise why don't we take it somewhere different. Do you have anything specific about his advice or lectures that you think is bad? I've listened to quite a few of his lectures and his advice I think is well thought through and gives a good starting point for any rational writer.

*********** I'll be completely honest: I have listened to very little of his specific advice on writing. It could be that he's full of all kinds of useful wisdom that just doesn't show up in his own work. I poured about sixty hours of my life into the five-ish books of his that I read, and regretted it, and made the decision not to throw good time after bad, but it's indeed possible that the lectures themselves are good. I'm taking a risk, making a gamble, by assuming that [amateurish writing] --> [unhelpful advice], and that could be the wrong call.

For instance, I'm personally pretty bad at certain kinds of gymnastics which I can teach and explain quite well, and this might be an analogous situation.

What would you say are a couple of his more useful and interesting points? The only one I know of is his bit about how magic as a solution to the character's problems is effective only to the degree that the magic has been clearly defined and explained prior.

************ I think if you went and listened to a lecture or two, you would find him being agreeable to the standard tenets of rational writing. Since you asked here's a few of the ones that stuck out to me- his suggestions on character creations and writing methods. Brandon takes the architect approach where he designs everything and in the lecture he discusses that. From what I understand though is that he does a top-down approach where he says this is where I want the story to go now how do I create characters and the world that takes the characters there? He also discusses grr Martin's writing style which is more organic and more of a growing system which lends itself two non-rational writing.

Another point that he made that was particular rational is that in the world the character needs to do their thing because that's what they do. Like sure have the main character go on the quest and save the world but make sure that that fits in the character that they're doing that because that's who the character is and that's what they want to do.

His discussions on character creation are really good though and he discusses other writing styles which is from bottom-up perspective where you create your cast of characters and you put them in situations and you see how they inside their personalities would work through that. If there are any lectures you might want to check out, i suggest checking out the character creation ones as that's what I've watched most recently and can vouch for its quality.

If you watch any of the lectures and find any problems with the rationality of any writing produced with those methods and advice let me know.

******* That's a fair point, but I think that if he came up with a different description it would be obvious what he was referring to (let's make one up: Smashed gaslights) It would be even more jarring because you know exactly what he is referring to (broken windows) while making a rather pointless change in words. So in reality you are totally correct that a different society would be VERY unlikely to come up with that term, but changing it for the sake of changing it would be even more immersion breaking for me.

***** They were much less well written. Far less revisions, weaker plots. It's hardly too unexpected. Alloy of Law, the book where the broken windows theory came in, was written while taking a break from Memory of Light within a four month period, and he rushed its release date so he could make sure to release something in 2011 so it didn't go through his usual revision schedules, and it was a thriller, and he wrote two other books at the same time.

I remember reading somewhere that he did research with a gun professional to ensure accuracy. So, the guns and ammo stuff is probably accurate and well written. That's the sort of tone the book has. He probably didn't do much to research sociology.

**** I'm not sure what you mean by "irrational" or "hate" in your comment here. My criticism of Sanderson's writing is based entirely on its content and style and quality, all things I can cite in specific (and did, in the post quoted). And I don't hate the person himself, nor do I actually hate the writing so much as groan over people going rah rah rah when I think their lives would be improved by exposure to better authors (of which there are so, so, so very many).

Essentially, my "hate" of "Brandon" (since you're on a first-name basis, I guess?) boils down to a very slight moral outrage that someone is getting far more love and exposure and acclaim than their work deserves. It's the exact same grumps I have for how much money Zack Snyder made with Batman V Superman.

Which has all the Hallmarks of the classic Fanboy hate. If you ever feel inclined in the future 2 post about Brandon's qualities how about instead of calling Brandon a bad writer you suggest writers you think are superior outside of yourself.

****** And I think you're willfully interpreting me in the worst possible light, when there is a spectrum of explanations that fit the facts equally well.

Do you honestly think there's /no/ value in responding to someone's "here's an author's advice on writing" with a statement of "don't listen to that author's advice; they're not good at writing!"? Like, *maybe I should've done it as a top-level response to the thread, instead of as a counterpoint to booljayj in particular*? But I mean, this subreddit is /about/ how to write, in the end. I post my criticisms of Sanderson because I think steering readers and writers away from his works is an actual instrumental good.

Writers who are superior to Brandon Sanderson by at least a factor of two in their creation of solid plots and realistic characters who behave in believable ways that less frequently break the characteristics of rational fiction on the sidebar:

- Orson Scott Card (who has loads of advice on how to write, too)
- Gary Paulsen
- John Irving
- Frank Herbert
- Robert Jordan
- George R.R. Martin
- George Orwell
- Dan Vyleta
- Catherine Ryan Hyde
- Bryce Courtenay
- Lois Lowry
- Michael Crichton
- Timothy Zahn
- Arthur C. Clarke
- Chuck Palahniuk (before he went insane)
- Alan Moore
- Robert Kirkman
- Michael Dante diMartino
- Robert Graves
- William Golding
- Sam Shepard

... those are off the top of my head. If people are interested in further recommendations, I'll happily provide.
