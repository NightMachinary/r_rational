This challenge topic was chosen by popular request. It's a reasonably frequent topic of conversation on this subreddit as well; see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3ztgp1/why_isnt_our_universe_munchkinable/]["Why isn't outr universe munchkinable?"]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/383w7f/any_rational_novels_based_in_the_real_world/]["Any rational novels based in the real world?"]]. I'll try to avoid repeating anything in those threads, but one of the big difficulties is that you're working with a smaller scale and you're far less able to use author fiat because people will know where you're faking it.

(There is also the perennial argument that /any/ story that takes place in the real world is a rational story, at least by the criteria in the sidebar, but I won't touch that here.)

If /I/ wanted to write a rational story set in the real world, I would probably look to real life stories of people being clever. [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][The sequences]] have lots of that stuff, but it's not too hard to find a historical example of someone who got to some low-hanging fruit. The truth is, the world has seen a few revolutions, the most successful of which we now take for granted.

This is the challenge companion thread, link applicable stories below or leave some feedback. I am curious what sorts of stories we'll see for this challenge. By my estimation, this is the hardest challenge that's been put up thus far (though I think when we eventually get around to "Romance" that might be harder, partly because it overlaps).


** People do things for no plausible reason /all the time/. They solve problems by accident, or without even realizing they've done so. There are no supporting characters - much less main characters - in human society, techniques which work in fiction don't necessarily apply outside it, and there is a distinct lack of puzzles with ideal solutions.

The rules of the real world are consistent, but I'd be uncomfortable calling them "sane". Many of the most common logical fallacies stem from confusing reality with narrative. It is not a just world. Correlation is not causation. Qualities you imagine in people you meet, or in yourself, are less likely to be character traits than accidents of circumstance.

We can make narratives out of real life, of course, and I look forward to writing one... but /we/ make them. Stories are not simply built into the natural order.

** It very much depends how strict you are being about the reality of the world. I mean the majority of crime stories /act/ as if their world is real - they don't have magic or the supernatural and most killers have to have some kind of motive; even when they are supposed to be mentally ill, their illness has to have a narrative (one could argue too much of one) and not just me kill random people because I can (Dr Shipman, anyone?)

But crime stories are often deeply irrational. Amateur detectives stumble across murders all the time without being suspected, a ridiculous number of murders take place in charming out of the way locations, female serial killers, child murderers and multiple personalities are far more common than IRL (even while Criminal Minds for instance keeps saying how uncommon they are it still does loads) all crimes are solved and most are interesting.

*** Have always wanted to do a sorta-deconstruction of the common crime story world where the villain protagonist is a serial killer who makes a reputation as a detective by framing people for their crimes.
