** Why do Harry's grandkids sound like they're not going to see him again when they literally have mass produced necromancy? Sure at the moment he wouldn't be able to change his mind, but eventually they'll probably find a way to upload spirits into new bodies. Just give the thaumoengineers a few centuries to work at the problem.

*** IIRC, one of the requirements is someone who knew the person closely.

I don't think someone who was brought back via the stone could bring someone else back.

That doesn't explain his apparent lack of being frozen, though.

****** Oh! I see what you mean!

I /thought/ you meant that a spirit who had been implanted into a new body wouldn't be able to use the stone.

** Wow. That was a beautiful ending.

I was confused by a few parts though. How can a squib charge Magion tanks? I was under the impression that they were stored magic. And what's the significance of the scene where more a Magion than expected is used to lift crates?

*** My understanding is that Squibs /have/ magic, just not enough of it to do anything useful. There's a lot of Squibs -- far more than there are actual wizards. Take a drop of magic from a million people, it adds up.

As to the crates, that scene was about showing that mundanes could now do magic given appropriate prosthetics. The funkiness with the crates was just to add some interest.

** Very nice story. I haven't been able to take the time to read past the first chapter until very recently and I was glad that I accidentally only started after you finished everything. Thank you for taking my bet on writing a chapter and expanding it into a meta-meta HPMOR fic.

I noticed that fanfiction.net doesn't mark this story as complete. Are you planning on posting another chapter?

Nope, it just means I forgot to change the radio button. Thanks for pointing that out; it's marked properly now.

Also, you're welcome. :>
