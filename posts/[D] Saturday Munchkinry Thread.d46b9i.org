Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You can evolve any animal according to its current situation extremely quickly, and the result will follow your orders without question. This does not work on people or anything more advanced than pigs, or less advanced than Moths.

You can also adapt slightly to the current climate, (I.e. gills underwater, body resistant to vacuum, etc)

This is the important part. Forget evolving to their current situation, that just streamlines them a bit; they'll follow my orders without question.

I've got a personal army.

An army of what? Well, dogs (wolves?), spiders, ants, locusts... anything I want, really. I can easily make money as a lion tamer if I want (I just need to evolve the lion first) or other animal-taming entertainer; I can create and sell spider-silk clothing; I can protect myself with an army of ants (and use them for pest control, too, if I want); I can have an army of super-moles plough fields.

********* I'm not following. The situation is that there's selective pressure on this population of animals to secrete the cure for Alzheimer's, since the ones that don't will be killed and never reproduce. Selective pressure applied by humans, or even applied by me specifically, is still selective pressure; I saw at least one other person proposed using the power on factory farm animals, which are selectively bred for growth rate, etc and are therefore under evolutionary pressure to develop those characteristics. I mean, if you want you /could/ add a caveat to the power that it doesn't work on situations that I personally arranged, although that takes some of the fun out of it.

I'm especially not following the distinction you're drawing between "speed up evolution" and "rapidly evolve an animal according to the current situation." If we're talking evolution, then what's relevant about "the current situation" is what kinds of selective pressure are being applied. It doesn't make sense to say, like, "you haven't shot this specific animal yet, even though you intend to shoot it if it fails to pass your test and have been shooting other members of its population that failed to pass your test, so it's fine and won't evolve"--because in that case literally nothing would count as selective pressure as long as the animal hasn't actually died yet, so the power would never be able to do anything at all. Natural selection works on populations, not individuals. I don't see how what you're describing could work in any other way than "evolving" the individual animal according to the selective pressures currently being applied to its population.

Another person suggested that the animals would be more likely to just evolve resistances against whatever methods I used to kill them, as long as doing so was easier than actually secreting the Alzheimer's cure or whatever, which I think is a very sensible argument against the idea I originally proposed.

********** Wait, they did? Must've missed that. Anyway, since even I'm losing track here, here's a quick rundown.

Animal is fine - Animal gets shot unless it cures Alzheimer's - animal is not being shot, has insufficient grasp of cause and effect to understand why - animal is shot for not producing cure for Alzheimer's.

Animal 2 sees animal 1 get shot - Animal 2 is not being shot - animal 2 continues as normal - Animal 2 is shot for not producing cure for Alzheimer's.

See? You can't threaten the concept of evolution. Shooting one animal because it didn't do what you want is the same as if you shot an animal in the other hemisphere.

*********** I don't see how the animal's comprehension of cause and effect is relevant. Animals in the real world don't evolve because they understand what's killing some of them. They evolve because their environment is such that some characteristics make them more or less likely to reproduce, so the population gradually shifts toward more individuals having the "useful" characteristics, or toward those characteristics becoming more pronounced. If I take a huge population of grey moths and start killing all the ones that are too light-colored, I'm going to end up with a population of dark grey or black moths. The moths who die don't know that it's because they were too light in color, the moths who live don't know that's why the /other/ moths died, and evolution will occur even if I myself have absolutely no idea what has to happen biologically to produce a dark-colored moth. Extrapolating that to the idea of "rapidly evolving" an animal, I should be able to choose a moth out of this population and turn it dark, because the "current situation" is that there's evolutionary pressure on this population of moths that favors dark coloring.

I suppose you could argue that there's no conceivable series of intermediate steps between "doesn't secrete the cure for alzheimer's" and "secretes the cure for alzheimer's" that would make it possible for the animals to adapt to this pressure instead of just going extinct. But then again, real organisms have ultimately evolved amazingly complex structures and we can't always figure out what the intermediate steps were. Evolution is a blind idiot, but on long enough timescales it produces pretty elaborate stuff.

Actually, I think the bloodline thing might actually make it impossible for the power to work at all. The whole point of natural selection is that not every bloodline actually continues. If we're taking it /as a given/ that this specific animal's bloodline persists for millions of years, then that kind of throws a wrench in the whole concept. I mean, if the animal as it currently is is well adapted enough to its environment to successfully reproduce generation after generation, and it's a given that /every/ generation of this lineage will succeed no matter what, then this animal's bloodline is basically exempt from selective pressure and it won't change in any way.

***************** Well...no, it doesn't make sense to me, because evolution doesn't mean getting bigger, or getting "better" in any sense a human would think about it; it means adapting to the environment, whatever that entails. If my rat lives in, I don't know, a network of tiny tunnels, and rats that grow too big get stuck and die, then "evolving" doesn't mean "getting bigger" for that rat. Or if whatever advantage increased size gives in fights doesn't offset the increased energy cost of maintaining a bigger body (plus any other disadvantages it entails), then evolving again doesn't mean getting bigger. Similarly, if having waterproof fur or not doesn't substantially affect a rat's chance of reproducing, then that population of rats probably isn't going to evolve waterproof fur. Maybe some individual rats might have mutations that make their fur a little more waterproof, but since they're no more likely to reproduce than any other rat, the waterproof-fur trait is unlikely to end up predominating in the population.

I think maybe you meant something other than evolving? Like maybe we're using different definitions of the term and that's why we're not on the same page? Did you mean like, Pokemon evolution?

********** The thing is, what you're doing here is generating near-instant [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation][evolutionary computation]] - that is to say, it's quite possible to get very similar results in only slightly slower time-scales with properly designed software and suitably beefy hardware. If it were /that/ simple to use this power to create a cure, then you'd be able to define a similar methodology as a computer program and evolve /that/ into a cure - taking maybe in the order of weeks instead of in the order of minutes (and depending on the beefiness of your hardware that might be even further reduced).

The problem there, though, is that in order for evolutionary computing to work, you need a function that tells you how close to the desired solution your current options are, so that you can kill of the ones furthest from a solution and breed with the closest ones, repeating until you're actually close enough. Without that function, though - without some way to tell which creatures are secreting something closer to the cure than others - all you're going to do is kill all the ones not resistant to bullets.

Evolution's not magic. It'll only move towards secreting the cure if a /partial/ step along that path improves its odds of survival. It's kind of like a ball on a surface - it won't seek out the lowest point. It'll only roll down the slope it's on, even if that slope only takes it to a local minima far away from your desired target.

If it can't, then I'm restricted to traits that are on some kind of gradient.

Someone previously pointed out that the animals would more likely just become bulletproof, which I think is the best argument against this strategy. I mean, I could vary the execution method, but then they'll just get really good at escaping, or really good at killing me before I can kill them.

I'm imagining immediate Lamarckian changes, somewhat similar to that of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(2001_film)][implausible science fiction comedy]].

I'd probably visit factory farms. Elephant-sized spherical cows without appreciable brains that grow as fast as you feed them would be a boon, reducing animal suffering immensely. If cows are more advanced than pigs, then I'll jumpstart the mutton industry.

Actually, maybe I'd just start with an ant farm. If the situation is 'being harvested for food' it should work on them just as well, right?

I could also become pest control. Although the pests would get better at being pests, since they follow my orders without question I can order them to uninhabited areas where they become better at not interacting with humans. I'd have to be careful that I don't turn them into some sort of deadly super organism, but alas.

Have you read Worm? Imagine making spider-silk armor, but instead of spiders you've got eight-foot monstrosities extruding cable an inch thick.

Once you have start up cash, build a center where intelligence helps them get fed and gives them advantages, and uplift an animal to superintelligence. Through a series of rapid advancements and harder and harder puzzles you should be able to develop very intelligent beings.

** I am writing a fanfiction about a desperate zorian who returns to the start of the loop with most of his powers and has to quickly advance to solve problems.

Given the power to mind control people but not give them or you new skills, much combat might, and the ability to make spell items and new spells and such which offer moderate advancement, along with a time loop, what's the best way to ensure rapid singularity advancement?

Tech is Victorian level, and its a hard rule of the universe that you can't mind magic skills. Zorian has limited mana, and can't easily solve this problem, but can do a lot with mass mind control. Mass soul manipulation is risky because of an ethical goddess with him, although manipulation of necromancers is allowed.

*** Does the singularity have to happen within the time loop?

If not, one of the first things that comes to mind is using mind magic to implant suggestions to make mages (especially professors) more interested in mind magic, as well as looking into what causes someone to be an empath/natural mind mage and seeing if it can be reverse engineered. The eventual goal would be for there to be some critical mass of mind mages such that city or world size hiveminds could be (voluntarily) formed, which may or may not directly result in a singularity like event, but certainly provides a good foundation for one. This could easily take a century after exiting the time loop though.

If it needs to happen within the time loop, it depends on the mechanics of magical animation. Most of them seem like they work on a simple scripting-type system, where it's just “if this happens, do that”, and that doesn't necessarily mean animation codes are basically magical computers. If they are though, or other constructs are close, Zorian could just study and experiment the same way he always has.

Part of the problem with this is that there's no lasting infrastructure or objects between loops, besides souls.

Making people more interested in mind magic does sound good. States have immense powers of research when desperate and could do a lot of work for him designing more powerful mind magic so he could then control even more powerful people, identify the top mind mages and annex them.

I do intend for him to upgrade his memory later with access to divine magic, so making super computers sounds good.
