Basically a story where there is an uber-rational version of Superman and how that would play out.(Preferably including all the other characters.) Most people think that Supes is too strong of a character to do that with and would break the setting, but there are certain forces, entities, and mundane dilemmas that would present a problem even for someone with his powers/skill sets. Chief among them being other aliens, the emergence of meta-humans, non-human races/civilizations native to earth, and just magic in general(that more than anything else can really stump most versions of him).

I know that it wouldn't really be Clark Kent anymore, but the same is true of Luminosity, Naruto: The Need to Become Stronger , and even The Metropolitan Man and those are good stories regardless.


** I started writing one, which was meant to be a companion piece to Metropolitan Man. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to write all the things that I want to write, and I don't have a good grasp on the actual /plot/; the opening chapter is about what changes Clark from wanting to be a reporter from wanting to be an effective altruist, and the subsequent chapters take place some five years later when Man of Steel Incorporated is selling contracts for his time in order to make the most money (which then gets funneled into the most reliably effective interventions).

Possible plots that might develop from that:

- Superman is using virtually all his time in order to do the most good, at the expense of his mental and social well-being, which he's been pushing to the breaking point because so much depends on him, and "the plot" descends from that.
- Some bad actor (potentially Lex Luthor) gets within Man of Steel Incorporated's decision loop, either to extract value from Superman, to sabotage him, or something else, ideally with parallels to the ways in which capitalism can undermine concerted efforts to do good.

The problem is, I don't particularly like the idea of Superman facing metahuman threats or other aliens, I like the idea of him facing coordination problems, immoral businessmen and politicians, and perverse incentives. There's a bit in what I've written that gets to the heart of what I find most compelling about 'rational' Superman, which is that airlines will pay him to go check on an airliner that's lost signal, which is almost always a false alarm, utterly unheroic, but dictated as necessary by the insurance companies due to the enormous cost that would be incurred from an aircraft actually crashing. So Superman spends his time checking in on aircraft, fixing undersea cables, lifting satellites, etc., all while feeling unfulfilled by any of it. There's an inherent tension between 'doing the most good' and 'feeling satisfied by do-gooding', because these are different things.

(Saying this here because there's almost no chance that I'll actually finish writing it, and hopefully someone can make something of the ideas.)

*** It seems like him engaging in any kind of money-raising venture would be pointless. Couldn't he single-handedly kickstart the asteroid-mining industry and produce enough mineral wealth to overwhelm the entire world economy overnight?

Just thinking as I type here, any rationalist superman story where he doesn't have villains or similar roadblocks is essentially going to turn into a project management fantasy- how to get the most utility out of a single human being, with typical human needs but virtually no physical limits + the ability to fly? If I were Superman in this case I'd immediately try to come up with a committee or something with absolute authority govern my time on the assumption that doing it myself would be less optimal, and probably self-destructive as I wouldn't take time to rest. But how would it be selected, what kind of tensions would it cause- what can you do without creating a dependency on your existence after you're dead?

Superman's concept of "Doing good" would probably be so far removed from any ordinary human standard that it doesn't really look recognizable to us. Instead of running insurance claims, I'm thinking "Repositioning the earth to solve global climate change" or "Subsidizing the construction of the first extra-earth colony with nearly free/un-weight-restricted space launches." Humanity's primary problem would stop being... well, any of the current existential threats, actually- it'd just switch to "Making more supermen" and then ultimately "Policing the supermen we have created."

As an invincible* weapon of mass destruction, Superman is, will he or nil he, the Emperor of the World. Everyone who lives does so only with his implicit permission; he possesses all the coercive authority of the state, unified and unchecked.

So, eventually, everything becomes a question of how Superman chooses to use the power of being the embodiment of all government.

Hell, especially if it's an explicitly economic line, a lot of people currently below it /really wanna be above it/ and are trying hard to do so. I /guess/ Clark could just kill anyone whose bank account hits enough digits, but that sure doesn't sound like a way to get an abundance of willing cooperation.

Incidentally, there's a scene (I think in “Injustice”?) where Supes is arguing a version of this with the Flash, re: direct rather than economic violence.

**** I watched the first season of the CW show, and thought about how I would have done it differently. Aside from that ...

The thing that I like about DC is that everything is so much more /mythological/ than in Marvel. Superman isn't one story, it's a character that's been involved in a hundred retellings, different every time, and the way that all these Supermen can kind of meld together as a coherent whole, or split apart from each other is what's most compelling.

Unfortunately, that's not really a strength that extends to Supergirl, who doesn't have as firm an identity to play with. Even if she did ...

Well, if I were writing Supergirl, there were two primary approaches. The first would be as a simple gender swap, with almost nothing changing in the story because of it (love interest is the only one that has to change, usually, and maybe not even then if you're set in the modern day). That's typically the approach that I favor when seeking out media, but not necessarily when writing. Supergirl the entity has her own history and struggles, so it's not /really/ a genderswap, but I don't really find her surrounding characters/villains that are unique to her compelling, nor the 'trapped in Superman's shadow' stuff.

The second approach is to in some way make it about gender, with varying levels of subtlety. Unfortunately, I don't feel like I'm quite equipped to handle that, not in the way that I would want to read someone else handle it. Like, I would want to read a sequel to Metropolitan Man, or even a genderswap version of it, where Kara Zor-el comes down to Earth and there are these issues of sexualization and gender norms that are touched on in some way ... but I wouldn't want to write it, and if I read it, it would need to be dealt with in less of a dropping anvils way. (Mind you, I would love the same thing with Superman.)

The problem is that most people write about powerful characters by either giving them problems they can easily solve or they take away their powers and give them a problem they could have solved if only they had their powers.

A rational story would be fine if someone sat down and went about it intelligently.

There is usually a reason or reasons, but that doesnt mean they are automatically good ones (though plenty are) and sometimes the reason is people didnt think of it at the time.

For instance, Superman is usually written in certain ways because his stories do not sell as well when written in other ways. They also have other characters that fulfill certain types of stories, so there is no need to write Superman stories outside his general tropes as long as his stories continue to sell. Those are good enough reasons for his writers (and fairly compelling!), but are not terribly relevant for this discussion.

Even the fic recognizes that it's not the *only* solution, but ultimately, Superman merely fell victim to overconfidence, and in a fairly believable way. He didn't know that Lex had learned how to make more kryptonite, so he probably didn't view a lead lined room as posing any reasonable threat.

Making her drop the ball would not necessarily make going through the doorway safe. If he were vulnerable in that close of proximity to it, it would be reasonable to suppose that Lex had positioned additional traps there to capitalize on that.

That is, honestly speaking, a small part of his character. Little more than an excuse as for why Superman doesn't effortlessly defeat him.

That's kind of the point: His complex, when triggered, is extremely damaging to his relations.

Luthor is an impossibly smart and adept human being. One that could have saved the world dozens of times and foster in an age of good far beyond what Superman could do by himself.

But instead, due to his insecurity and superiority complex, he cannot stand the idea that someone could be better than him in any way and thus ruins his life trying to destroy someone that doesn't even want to fight him.
