** ". . . The moral point remains, madam."

Now, suddenly, she knew the answer. She wrote.

#+begin_quote
  Dear Commander /HMS Vanguard/,

  Some will claim retaliation is irrational and immoral. This is not so. With your actions, think not of what you owe the dead, but what you owe the living, and the generations unborn. They deserve a world where it is known that murder on the scale the enemy has committed will be avenged, however inadequately and imperfectly, in order to deter any repeat of such behavior. Punish the enemy because it is entirely moral and rational to make future efforts at deterrence more credible, especially now that deterrence in pure prospect has failed. It will not bring back London, but it may save the next one.

She now paused and considered. /What do I do, now, about this high-ranked monster -- or mere idiot, perhaps -- who just claimed in this room that this order could serve no military or political purpose?/

** Dear John:

I won't beat around the bush with introductions or niceties. Now is not the time for nice, is it?

Do not simply make them die. Whoever did this, they do not care if their largest city dies. They factored that into their decision, and it was not sufficient to deter them. Death is not enough.

Make them /suffer./ Now, in this moment, you have the ability to remind humanity of what we are capable of, to write an epitaph for our civilization in the agony of those responsible. Create for yourself a legend, become The Thing Who Goes Bump In The Night. Make sure we cannot be forgotten, and ensure the lesson we teach is carved forevermore in the collective psyche of man.

This will require creativity. If it was China, do not simply destroy their two largest cities, for that is not enough. Destroy the Three Gorges Dam instead. They killed us, so we will bring enduring calamity upon them. If it was religious extremists, do not target their nation, but their holy sites. If it was someone else, do your research to determine how best to maximize their misery, for the longest time you can, for the most of their people as possible. Whatever their goals in destroying us, become the antithesis of all they value.

I do not command this in vengeance, for vengeance is pointless. I do not command this out of spite, for such concerns are meaningless before the consuming void we find ourselves cast into. I command this so no-one can again question what humanity will do, to what depths we will sink, when faced with annihilation. We cannot allow the consequences of nuclear holocaust to be a nebulous unknown ever again. Our last lesson must be that we can be made monsters, that no god or nation or other thing of human design can save us from the consequences we mete out upon ourselves. You must destroy the present, so the future knows what is truly at stake at the next turn of the wheel.

Good luck. May whatever gods there be grant you all their wrath. Perhaps, one day, we will no longer need to remember it.

** Surprisingly good decision/game theory for a normie play. The part below is when I knew I had to post it here:

#+begin_quote
  *PRIME MINISTER:* Look, John -- the thing is -- this is all very well but it's -- I don't -- I mean it's all so hypothetical --

  *JOHN:* I don't catch your meaning, Prime Minister?

  *PRIME MINISTER:* There isn't going to be a devastating nuclear attack on Britain. London isn't going to be wiped out by bombs from Russia or whoever... I don't know.

  *JOHN:* Iran

  *PRIME MINISTER:* All right, Iran but the fact is the political conditions are just -- it's impossible in the modern world. Maybe during the cold war but nowadays it's...who would do it? Who would actually launch the missiles? Which leader of which country thinks an attack like that on a country like this would have any kind of... would have any meaning?

  *JOHN:* Still.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* I could write a nursery rhyme on this piece of paper, John, it's never going to be read. The events that require it to be opened are quite simply impossible. They're never going to happen.

  *JOHN:* Except of course that they have happened.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* What?

  *PRIME MINISTER:* The events have happened.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* No they haven't.

  *JOHN:* They have.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* London has not been attacked, John.

  *JOHN:* With respect Prime Minister London has been destroyed.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* Look -- London -- trees -- sky -- bird -- cat -- night.

  *JOHN:* The only circumstances in which this letter will be read are those in which there are no longer trees, or birds or cats... or London or you. As you write this letter you must assume a world not as it is now but a world as it exists in the circumstances of the letter's reading. As soon as you put pen to paper, Prime Minister, London ceases to exist.

  Dear John,

  Do you believe in a multiverse? I do. I think, on some level, I always have. I think you have to account for the possibility that things could have gone differently to appreciate what choice means at all.

  They nuked us, John. It's over. We're dead, your family is dead, BBC Radio is dead. (I'm assuming you have checked that one.) Someone made a decision, history went a certain way, and now England is gone. Wiped right out.

  If you had a time machine, you could go back and fix it, stop the person - president, party functionary, general - stop whoever did it in their tracks.

  You don't have a time machine. You have a nuclear warhead. And your only goal now is to take this universe - this entire branch of time - and snuff it out, to the greatest degree you can manage.

  This should never have happened. Now we need you to make this future not exist. You need to take this entire malign branch of the multiverse, this failure of history itself that you have unfortunately found yourself to inhabit, and squeeze it shut behind yourself.

  You need to understand that we have /lost/, John. The game has already ended. We played, and they cheated, and they won and we lost. What you need to decide now is if you're gonna just accept them taking everything from you or if you're gonna throw over the table and shank a fucker.

  Someone in the past looked into the future - into this moment, and they saw a /victory/, a glorious and shining future for their people. To varying quality, people want to believe what is true. This observation cannot be allowed to be true. The point of your existence now is to make it untrue.

  The United Kingdom can no longer give you orders. But my honest recommendation is that you nuke Beijing, and then shoot yourself in the head.

*** I don't think that this is consistent with the mainstream understanding of multiverses, or with rationality in general.

If John nuked Beijing, or shot himself, that branch of the multiverse will not be 'snuffed out'. A universe that's devoid of people still exists, it will merely have less potential life, less potential humanity, less potential joy in it. Sure, John's existence and much of the post-nuclear Earth may be pretty awful, but in the long term? Whether modern life recovers or civilization collapses, that branch will be worse off if John blows a tiny part of it up or not.

**** I'm simplifying the game theory into symbolism for the sake of not having to write an entire introduction to timeless decision theory. I'm trying to translate the logic into gut level emotions.

The point is to make the branch of the decision graph that John inhabits one that, for predictable reasons, contains no benefit to anyone. This causes it to always have been impossible. Time of course doesn't /actually/ work like that, but the multiverse stuff is more an intuition pump. The point is to make John think of the past as real and mutable.

Frankly, if I could, I'd admit to it and argue TDT and the legitimate military purpose of mass murder of non-military targets on the stand of the ICC. This is of course a terrible idea. Practically I'd just hint at my ruthless commitment to fairness in diplomatic conversation.

(The problem with the irrationality thing is it's strawman irrationality. Second-striking Beijing is an entirely rational thing for John to do, and for me to order.)

***** TDT and multiverse are a bet, though. If reality doesn't work like that, retaliation is net loss in terms of human lives.

So assuming your aim is to minimize death, it should go something like this (I think?)

E(lives lost | retaliation) = (1 - P(TDT)) * (n(Beijing) + n(London)) - P(TDT) * n(London)

You'd need to be quite sure that there's such a thing as a multiverse for this bet to be rational, right? And since it's an unfalsifiable hypothesis, I fail to see how you'd have a high prior for it.

******** You can't causally effect an agent outside your light cone, but given a good enough model of the universe you could predict what sort of agents exist in the unreachable (to us) universe.

Imagine you were some powerful agent, and had reason to believe the universe beyond the visible was very large; you might be able to make trustworthy (to yourself) predictions about the sorts of powerful agents that might arise throughout the wider universe, based on the likelihoods of them appearing from the statistical distribution of starter states. If you have high confidence that a very powerful agent or class of agents exists, and are yourself powerful enough to understand this class of agents very well (i.e. run its source code) and they you, or in other words, you can be superrational wrt. each other, then you could acausally trade with them.

Alternatively, you could do it with an agent in the past or future, but that seems less likely as you'd expect any agent powerful enough to engage in acausal trade to rule its future light cone.

********* Granted. In this thought experiment where you and your opponent can both basically read each other's mind, yes, true commitment to retaliation is the only deterrent.

That is not yet the case with today's geopolitics, though. I think there is still a difference between "you need your opponent's model of you to retaliate" and "you need to retaliate".

It will probably not always be the case, of course, and when it is not then TDT it is. But I'm still not sure the chinese model of british military is that good today. Not sure enough to bet Beijing on it.

  What you actually write doesn't matter. All that matters is what the world thinks you've written.
#+end_quote

Yes, the Prime Minister needs to write "retaliate" in the Letter of Last Resort.

But that's not necessarily what the Commander needs to read.

The entire point of writing the letter is to allow the Prime Minister to behave to other nuclear countries as if they'll be annihilated if they attack, even if the UK is obliterated.

However, John from Arrangements knows that these aren't the orders that the PM would give under those circumstances. She has written a letter with /those/ orders, which are "Don't retaliate."

If Arrangements can surreptitiously retrieve that letter and use /it/ as the Letter of Last Resort, then the PM can behave as if the post-annihilation retaliation directive is in place (because she'll believe it is in place), while acceding to her desires about what should actually be done in the case of annihilation.
