[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6xj599/biweekly_challenge_effective_altruism/][Last time]], the prompt was "Effective Altruism". Our winner is [[/u/vi_fi]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6xj599/biweekly_challenge_effective_altruism/dmhplhw/]["Death's Door"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/vi_fi]] for another win!

This time, the challenge will be *Emulated Intelligence*. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading][Whole brain emulation]] is a hypothetical technology which would allow a human mind to run on a computer simulating neurons rather than on physical neurons. This would allow things like time dilation, copying minds, reverting thoughts, and all sorts of other things that currently apply only to data (because a brain, in this scenario, becomes data). Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, October 4th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be *SCP*. [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP]] is a community wiki where most entries are in the form of official documents pertaining to some kind of horrible anomalous thing. These documents usually hint at the shadowy SCP Foundation and are redacted for either effect or verisimilitude. You do /not/ have to work within the existing SCP canon(s), nor do you have to write in government-speak; it's fine if you want to write a purely prose story about secret government response to a play which induces psychosis when performed. If you want to do a "real" SCP, then maybe [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/guide-hub][look at their guide]], but for the purposes of this challenge, SCP-esque is fine. If you're super into related works and want to write fanfic for those (/Delta Green/, /The Laundry Files/, etc.), feel free. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/4.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/71kgso/challenge_companion_emulated_intelligence/][is available here]].

*** (I put this into a comment because it contains commentary of the story as well as *SPOILERS*.)

I have to give credit where credit is due for some of the ideas in /Matryoshka/. First off, the idea that the Machines use humans as computers was actually in a very early script of the Matrix. Executive meddling led to the "humans as batteries"-story we all know and love (to make fun of).

The story of John was heavily inspired by [[https://web.archive.org/web/20000304044736fw_/http://whatisthematrix.com:80/cmp/neil_g.html][Goliath]], an officially licensed Matrix story by Neil Gaiman. This story is based on the earlier version of the script and serves as a nice example of what the Machines might use humans for.

Of course, my story is set in the Matrix as it was released, and is, in effect, an attempt at reconciling the early script, /Goliath/ and the final version.

Thank you for reading.

**** I noticed the similarities with <spoilers> and wondered if it was deliberate. Liked it a lot.

The layered form of the story was intriguing, something i've ony really seen before in historical stories, or used as a gimmick in a way i find annoying, but worked well in this context as the various layers made sense to connect. Adds some interesting unreliable narrator questions.

***** Thank you! It's really nice when people comment on stories I've written months ago. Feels like my time investment is paying dividends :)

Among the various stories I've written for the challenges, this one won by the smallest margin. I wasn't quite sure whether it was just not interesting or whether the structure was not to everyone's taste. It's certainly nice to know that someone liked it :)

I'm working my way back through the monthly post archive :P

I think the structure works best when the majority of each story is before the transition to the next one. Which makes the new story something of a conclusion for the previous, and allows for a cascading of conlusions at the end. The stories where I've found it more annoying have been where the split was roughly 50/50 so I had to try and recall what had been happening in the previous one

*** Bit hard to follow what exactly the point is. I think the story would work better if the payoff was that the Machines were on their way to colonizing space, and that's why they needed spaceflight routines...

I wonder what else they'll need skills for, out there in the black.

I originally sent this as a submission to the MIRI "Intelligence in Fiction" call-out, but the theme of the story didn't quite capture what was sought after by MIRI - which was a fair assessment!

This story is more heavily /inspired/ by the concept of emulated intelligence than a story /about/ it, but I think once you read it, you'll hopefully see where I'm coming from :) EDIT: (okay, it's quite focused on emulated intelligence - just slightly... unorthodox.)

I hope you enjoy reading it - I definitely had fun writing it!

*** Very interesting premise and elaboration on it.

The thing that surprised me most was that the character didnt seem to spend much time looking into teh cause of the new state, and that question was never answered by the end.

**** Thank you for the feedback!

My intention was showing that everything she did was one step on the path of clarifying the cause for her new state, and I kept the cause unknown so as to more focus on her process rather than another sci-fi premise. But if that comes across as more frustrating and the story unfulfilled, I'll keep that in mind for next time!

This was written collaboratively with a friend as part of an exercise to figure out if we could coordinate well, before deciding if we'd make good housemates or not. Two more parts to come (probably). I'll update with a comment reply if/when this changes.
