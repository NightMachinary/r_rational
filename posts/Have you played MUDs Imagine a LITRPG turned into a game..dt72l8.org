Multi User Dungeons are basically text based MMORPGs. A lot of them a very roleplay heavy too. Because it is all based on text that means that it is relatively cheaper for new content to be added. The reason that I felt like posting about it here is because LITRPGs can if handled properly be proper rational fiction. However in a lot of LITRPGs it seems that the stat screens are totally meaningless whereas in MUDs they are not. I think that LITRPG writers who want to write rational fiction could take some cues from MUDs.

Anyway I would be interested to know if there are any writers here who have been affected by MUDs. A lot of players in MUDs are pretty good at roleplaying so sometimes it really does feel like being the protagonist of a LITRPG sometimes.

*** Oof. Clearly not the most rational of player bases...

** I've only really played BatMud, where people don't really roleplay. But it is an awesome game with shitton of races, classes, skills... It's damn old, but actively developed. I think they call rp muds MUSHes.

** What cues would you take from MUDs, and which MUDs? There seems to be very little overlap between the actual mudding experience and what makes for a good LITRPG story, as far as I can tell. Can you expand what you mean?

** I'm familiar with MUDs, but have never really played. Would you happen to have a specific example of one you think is good, a screen cap or a link or whatever, of the stat screen from an actual MUD? Or a representative sample from several MUDs for comparison purposes?

*** [[http://www.slothmud.org/][Slothmud.org]] is the best one I've played. It held my interest for almost 20 years.

The world constantly grows, and there's a seemingly infinite amount of content to explore. (I guess it's easier to make a huge open world when you don't have to draw it!)

** I haven't played, but [[https://www.starmourn.com/][this]] is supposed to be the most modern/awesome one from what I've heard. At the very top of the website there are links to more MUDs made by the same developers.

** I used to play WotMud, based on the Wheel of Time.

I do have to remark on the irony of "turning a litrpg into a game" though, considering that litrpg is basically "what if this game were instead a book about being in a game". The Wheel of Time turns, indeed...

** Back in the early 1990s, I was Whitehawke on IgorMUD ([[http://igormud.org/]]), which is apparently still around and presumably the oldest MUD in existence. I created a major castle and the Loremasters Guild, which is also still in play.

Damn, I wish I still had the password, or the email address. I would love to be able to log in again and see the old stomping grounds.
