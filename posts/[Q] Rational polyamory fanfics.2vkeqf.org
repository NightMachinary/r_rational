It occurs to me that I've never read a story in the romance genre, or with a romance component, that takes the same approach to romantic "everyone wants someone that wants someone else" problems that HPMOR does to saving-the-world type problems.

HPMOR gives Harry a gift---an operational understanding of human cognitive biases. But it strengthens the setting, such that this doesn't automatically solve everything. In fact, rational!Harry's gift makes him "dream bigger"---set his sights on goals canon!Harry could never achieve. Because of this, rational!Harry's life is actually /harder/ than canon!Harry's, despite his gifts.

Imagine a fanfiction for your standard harem anime (let's say Ranma): one male protagonist, lots and lots of girls that want to be in an exclusive relationship with that protagonist, and other guys that want those girls, and so on. A canon!Ranma, who actually had shrugged up enough determination to not be stuck in negative-episodic-continuity-land, would likely merely be interested in making a choice of one girl, and permanently discouraging the rest.

If one were to give Ranma a gift for romantic insight, the canonical problem-set would be decimated. But a rational!Ranma would dream bigger, wouldn't he? I would imagine a rational!Ranma would actually want /everyone/, not just him, to be in a happy relationship; for no one to continually attack him out of jealousy, for none of his friends to pine over him, etc. And because of all the unrequited love, love for those already in relationships, mutual-exclusivity conflicts, etc. in his own relationship isocahedron, creating multiple overlapping pairings is really the only way he could create any sort of long-lasting equilibrium.

Now, I've seen a lot of stories where characters who are monogamous in canon end up spontaneously entering into polyamorous relationships by author fiat. Real people don't do that. Have you ever tried to convince a monogamous partner to practice polyamory? It's /hard/, and in the end, just not in some people's natures.

What I've never seen is a story where some characters start as /really monogamous/---not just "lipstick monogamous"---but where this is causing them lots of pain that could be solved by them being /not/ monogamous---and then it occurs to one character to just /not be monogamous/, who then starts trying to get everyone else on-board with this with every shred of pain that might entail. An author-granted gift for romantic insight, in this case, merely ensures that this venture won't be doomed before it even begins.

So, I've never seen that in fanfic. I'm not actually sure that I've seen it in regular fiction either - every time I've seen someone make an "open, honest attempt at polyamory" it's been in a very negative light, and either it ends in a trainwreck or with monogamy having been proven to be the One True way to have relationships.

If you were to write this, I think you'd start running into problems really quickly, mostly through derailing characters. As you've said, polyamory just isn't for some people, and if you want the conclusion to be that everyone is in one big multiple-pairing situation, you have to make the call that they're all for it, which ... is basically author fiat, which you want to avoid.

(If you want to write it, I think this is the sort of thing that would work better as original fiction. If you're having trouble thinking up characters, just use characters from your favorite shows/books and file off the serial numbers.)

Ah, no, I never said I wanted the conclusion to be anything in particular. I would expect the result to be a /more optimal/ relationship graph than the original one, but not a /maximally-connected/ one. In the end, it really just wouldn't work out optimally for /some/ people (and they'll have to settle for the protagonist introducing them to someone who is almost-but-not-quite the person they wanted, and might be an even better fit for them though they might not agree, etc.)

I really agree with you on this -- you almost never see poly romances, or even ATTEMPTS at poly romances onscreen, and if you do usually either the people are shown negatively and it ends up not working.

That said, I think I may have thought of a counterexample. [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219965/][Bandits]] is a story about two men and a woman (Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett) who do crime. The bulk of the movie consists of the two men trying to get with Cate and Bruce Willis sabotaging BBT. The ending, however, suggests that /possibly/ there might be a poly relationship afterwards. That's the closest I can get.

Also, it's a good movie and I recommend it.

** Polyamory is an extra type of relationship (sub)graph and keeping it on the table would be helpful for some people, but it's weird to me to portray it as a rationalist's solution to relationship problems. It solves a specific handful of cases, but doesn't even touch the actual problem. Relationships are dramatic because not everyone's ideal relationship graph is the same. (And I like that problem; it's part of the human experience.)

Your question does remind me of [[http://qntm.org/gay][this hilarious post on Things of Interest]] where the author takes a rigid database schema that only allows heterosexual marriage, iteratively applies good database design principles to it, and finds the database's concept of marriage getting more and more liberal with each improvement. Eventually he blows past allowing gay marriage, into polyamory, and then further still into something truly strange.

Here: [[http://soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/kbdh/]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5844698/1/Kyon-Big-Damn-Hero]]. The relationship-building starts effectively at Chapter 18, so you should read that one first. Sadly it wont be updated anymore, but I'm sure you'll find what you search for here.

Alternatively, I point you towards "Time Braid" ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid]]), but it's much less pronounced here than in KBDH.

** "She's the Man"/Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" rational fic?

Viola and Sebastian are twins from a faraway kingdom. Viola is a sorceress, Sebastian is a knight. When they get shipwrecked in a chauvinistic enemy kingdom, they become separated, each believing the other to have drowned. Viola must pretend to be a man in order to find employment. She finds work as the personal bodyguard of Duke Orsino, a jolly, insightful and unfortunately sexist older nobleman, who she eventually falls in love with. Duke Orsino however is in love with a countess named Olivia, who falls in love with both twins before she realizes they're different people. Sebastian is generally oblivious to anything involving people and relationships.

Realizing the messy web of unrequited affection and accidental deception between her friends and acquaintances, Viola must find a way to resolve all of their relationship troubles, defend Duke Orsino from assasins, thwart a plot to ruin the reputation of the household of Olivia, not be discovered as a woman or illegal immigrant from a foreign kingdom, find out what REALLY happened to Sebastian when they shipwrecked AND all this without losing her job and current residence in the process.

** It's not a fanfic, but "The Moon's a Harsh Mistress" features polyamorous relationships, is SciFi, and is mostly rational (not rationalist). A relatively plausible explanation is provided, and at least one healthy family relationship is explored.

Personally I'm skeptical about the concept of long term, committed (in the context) polyamorous relationships, particularly if the relationships form a cyclic graph. Seems like too many opportunities for factions to form with 4+ individuals intertwined.

Granted, given the current cultural norms, it seems like there aren't many opportunities for these situations to arise so it's hard to find evidence one way or another, and the deck is stacked against people who are interested in pursuing such a relationship.

Polygamous relationships usually have an external force (cultural/religious) which probably helps to mediate issues and increase the incentive to resolve problems instead of dissolving the relationship.

** Wow...looking back on history and at today's issues with marriage, there's so many possible discrimination against potential marriages. Let me count up the ones we've thought of so far. Including types of marriages we've abolished.

First started a marriage of husband and wife of the same ethnicity and religion.

Then came marriage of husband and wife. (Eliminate prejudice against race and internal beliefs)

Up came marriage of adult husband and adult wife. (Generate prejudice against marriages to anyone under 18)

Next is marriage of person to person. (Eliminate prejudice against gender or sex)

Now it's marriage of person to person to person to..... (Eliminate prejudice against number of partners)

What will we think of next?!!

Marriage of sapient being to sapient being to sapient being.... (Eliminate prejudice against uplifted animals, AI, aliens, and anything else in the set of mind space who share utility functions corresponding to the idea of intense commitment)

Is there any type of marriages I missed? I can only think of open marriages, but that's about having sex with someone you aren't married to and not who you're marrying which doesn't really fit the theme above.

(This is a pretty ubiquitous setup in romance settings, no? Without it, things are /too/ easy.)

Outside of polyamory (or posthuman multiple instantiation), the only way this kind of story usually ends is in tragedy for at least one party, if not all.

I'm unsure what your referent is for "this", but from context I'm understanding it to mean "polyamorous relationships." If you mean something else, please say so.

Polyamorous relationships, including marriages, exist. I know one triad who have been married for over three decades -- society won't give them paperwork, obviously, but in every other sense they are married.

"Oh, jealousy makes polyamory impossible" is a common objection, and one that shows little thought. Jealousy is an emotion, not an unstoppable kaiju god. Anger is also an emotion; the difference is that we all receive plenty of training in how to manage anger.

Society provides anger management skills by default, but does not provide jealous management skills. In fact, society goes a fair bit out of its way to claim that jealousy cannot be managed -- see practically every Hollywood movie ever.

Monogamous people do not seek out training in how to manage jealousy. Poly people deal with it all the time, and it's not hard: Recognize you're jealous. Take a deep breath. Use your words. Use "I feel" statements instead of "you are" statements. It's not rocket science.

The story prompt was about the idea of converting already monogamous people who presumably have lots of jealousy and such into polygamous people. Polygamous people and the success or failure of their relationships aren't mentioned. Your rather offended response was mostly predicated on the assumption that I was saying that polygamous people can't have good relationships and as such, there's not much point I reply to most of it.

People receive a small amount of training as a child to avoid anger at minor things and to avoid public tantrums, though they receive little training to manage avoiding anger at things that are rationally enraging.

People receive a small amount of training on jealousy to avoid blatantly unfair displays in public likewise, but not to avoid the emotion when it's rational to be jealous.

Since it's a fairly publicly ingrained and likely partially genetic emotion changing it requires substantial reworking of the mind, as say, stopping people getting angry at popular triggers would. Taking a deep breath and saying I feel doesn't change that much- that's more useful when your emotions are clearly against your reason, if say you're angry or jealous at someone for talking to another person. If rationally you dislike when someone sleeps with your partner (for example because you want them to spend more time on you) you taking a deep breathe won't change that.

Pushing your sexuality on others is a popular goal of fics, but, as with ones which force everyone to be homosexual or straight, is morally iffy.

#+end_quote

First of all, "polyamory" is not the same thing as "polygamy", although that's a common mistake. The OP specifically asked about poly/amory/, not polygamy.

In my opinion (YMMV) there are three primary reasons that polyamorous relationship are so rare:

1. Most people don't encounter the idea
2. If they do encounter it, most people believe that jealousy cannot be managed, so they don't try
3. If they do try, then once they get into the relationship and experience jealousy, they lack something that would be necessary to make it work -- perhaps their communication skills aren't up to the difficult task of having an "I am unhappy about the current situation and want something to change" conversation in a way that is productive instead of escalating the situation. Perhaps they lack a strong desire to make it work, so they don't try. Perhaps they don't realize that that glow of New Relationship Energy is going to fade, and that it's not worth sacrificing a valuable existing relationship because of it. It could be a lot of things.

The story prompt deals with most of these issues. It assumes that the protagonist tells the other characters about the idea, and that s/he can convince people to at least try it. That deals with problems 1 and 2. Presumably, the protagonist then provides ongoing help in making it work -- most likely serving as a mediator during difficult conversations, providing support so people can process their emotions offline, etc. That won't necessarily fix point 3, but it will help a lot.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Actually, society provides a /lot/ of support for the idea that expressing anger above a fairly minimal level isn't allowed. It's not okay to punch people because you're angry. It's not okay to yell at people in public. It's not okay to curse at your spouse. It's not okay to yell at your boss. It's frowned upon to yell at your subordinates.

Do these things happen? Sure. In general, however, people receive social censure for doing them.

None of this applies to jealousy. If A sees their partner B macking with someone else and A therefore causes a scene, B will receive censure and people will think nothing of A's angry outburst. At worst, if A becomes physical people will say "well, s/he shouldn't have done that I guess, but I totally understand."

Anger and jealousy are trained very differently in our society, and receive very different levels and types of reinforcement.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Anger is also publicly ingrained and likely partially genetic. And yes, we all manage it.

#+begin_quote
  Taking a deep breath and saying I feel doesn't change that much
#+end_quote

The fact that people can have arguments with each other without cursing and / or punching each others' lights out tends to indicate that emotions can, in fact, be managed. If you don't think that "take a deep breath" is sufficient, that's great -- there's a ton of other well-known techniques, the simplest of which is "go off by yourself until you're not so strongly in the grip of the emotion, then come back and have the discussion."

My point is that (a) anger and jealousy are, in many respects, the same thing, yet (b) they are treated differently by society. If you disagree with either of those ideas, please explain why.

So, here are three different kinds of changes that one might make to a character:

1. Alter someone's personality. For example, make Naruto not dumb, or Kakashi not lazy.
2. Alter them physically. For example, give Naruto a byakugan and/or a sharingan, or genderbend one or more characters.
3. Alter their sexuality. For example, make them (hetero|homo|a|poly)sexual, or make them polyamorous.

Please explain which of these, in your opinion, are morally okay and why.

#+begin_quote
  If rationally you dislike when someone sleeps with your partner
#+end_quote

First of all, why is it rational to not want your partner to sleep with someone else? You're assuming the premise.

It might help to read up on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory#Compersion][compersion]]. The fact that there is actually a word for this is strong evidence that it exists and weak evidence that it can be trained.

#+begin_quote
  (for example because you want them to spend more time on you)
#+end_quote

Getting your partner to spend more time with you is as simple as saying "Honey, I'm feeling left out right now, and I'd like it if you would spend more time with me. Could we <X>?" X might be "schedule a couple of date nights next week?" or "go off on a cruise together" or whatever.

If your partner says "no, I'm not willing to do that for you," *then* it's rational to be angry, but that's not directly an issue with your partner having a relationship with someone else, it's an issue with them not being willing to support and care for you.

You are mostly seeing emotions and something to be dealt with, I and many others see them as often rational expressions of internal logic.

The sort of assumption that others are different for purely irrational reasons and any views they have are purely a matter of their deficiency in reasoning is rarely an accurate view.

At worst, if A becomes physical people will say "well, s/he shouldn't have done that I guess, but I totally understand."
#+end_quote

You're not really supporting your case- as you have noted people accept violence if it's a socially sanctioned cause. If you make a good scene when your partner talks to a store employee people will socially censure you. People treat jealousy like anger when the jealousy is irrational.

  So, here are three different kinds of changes that one might make to a character:
#+end_quote

I don't object to changing the personalities of people in stories, though 'mediating' their personalities to be different, realistically, is unlikely to work. If Naruto is bi making him be asexual through rational reasoning because sex is unproductive is unlikely to work.

#+begin_quote
  First of all, why is it rational to not want your partner to sleep with someone else? You're assuming the premise.
#+end_quote

Rationality is about supporting your values through the use of logic and reasoning.

Suppose you highly value avoiding disease. If your partner sleeps with others then that value will often be harder to achieve. Suppose you highly value having your partner available often. If they are often attending to someone else then you'll have them be available less often.

Suppose you highly value compersion. Then polyamory will be easier for you. Suppose you have a relationship where you mutually support each other. Polyamory will be easier for you.

#+begin_quote
  My experience and the experience of literally tens of thousands of polyamorous people disagrees with you.
#+end_quote

Perhaps because you are polyamorous, and have different values from other people?

I think there is value in being able to manage your emotions; if you can't, they will control you and thereby narrow your list of possible actions, which will most likely prevent you from getting what you want in the most efficient way possible.

On this subject, your initial comment (whitespace ellided) was:

#+begin_quote
  Given the commonness of jealousy, [creating multiple overlapping pairings] wouldn't work. You'd have to have some sort of brain washing or mind rape device which would put the story in an unusually dark category.
#+end_quote

You are claiming that jealousy exists ergo it is not possible to have multiple overlapping pairings without mind raping people. I'm trying to explain that yes, it IS possible, if people want to do it and are willing to make the effort of controlling their jealousy.

#+begin_quote
  Most can manage them [their emotions] if they had to but they have no desire to manage them.
#+end_quote

You are using "emotions" where I'm actually only talking about "jealousy." I'm pretty sure that what you mean is jealousy, though, so I'll respond to that: you're right. Most people don't have the desire to control their jealousy, nor do they have the training. I've actually said this multiple times now.

#+begin_quote
  The sort of assumption that others are different for purely irrational reasons and any views they have are purely a matter of their deficiency in reasoning is rarely an accurate view.

I literally said that people view it as okay if people yell and/or get physical due to their partner sleeping around. (Actually, I said "macking", but sleeping with other people is included by implication.) In fact, you even quote the part where I said that in your very next sentence.

I'm unclear why you're using this as a counterpoint.

No argument on either of these points. However, most people have other values as well...things like "make my partner happy" or simply "be happy myself." The point that I've been trying to make through this entire discussion is that:

1. It is possible that a monogamous person could decide that they value the "be happy myself" goal higher than they value the "be monogamous" goal; and,
2. They might therefore decide to experiment with polyamory because they think that it could help them achieve the "be happy myself" goal; and,
3. If they make that decision, they will encounter issues caused by jealousy; and,
4. That jealousy can be managed such that they are able to maintain the polyamorous relationship in a way that they find satisfying; and,

That's it. That's all I'm saying. I am not saying that polyamory is better, or that monogamy is irrational, or anything else. Just those four things. As it happens, I have actual real-world experience with all of these things being true, and I've shared that fact with you, which makes it puzzling to me that you're arguing against them.

For the record: I agree that not everyone will be successful when they experiment with polyamory, either in the real world or in a well-written fic for this prompt. Also, I agree that some poly relationships that are solely composed of poly people will fail, just like some mono relationships will fail.

[[/u/derefr]] is, as I understand it, calling for a fic in which the protagonist attempts to convince people to try polyamory and people actually try it. S/he is /not/ calling for a fic in which it works because /plot/, but for a fic that actually explores the issues.

You, Nepene, seem to be asserting that no such series of events could possibly happen absent mindraping everyone. I'm trying to explain why the real world does not support your view.

******** Your 1-4 was exactly my premise, yes.

As well, I was assuming that nobody in the situation was "polyamorous by default" or "poly-curious" or however you'd term it.

I was instead assuming that a bunch of monogamous people, at least one of whom is rational (in this case meaning "tries to optimize for their own happiness even at the expense of some of their cherished self-beliefs"), and the others of whom are at least able to be swayed by rational argument to try things (like e.g. HPMOR!Draco is), all end up /giving polyamory a try/ because they've been through hell for years trying the alternative (everyone in the relationship isocahedron pining for---and fighting one-another for---affection, and nobody ending up happy) and are ready to try something, anything, different.

It might not work out! They might, one or all, give up! It might anneal down into single stable pairings with some open relationships and some extra friends-with-benefits and some overlapping asexual hetero-/homo-romantic partnerships and so forth, out of everyone's mutual concern for actually trying to make things work out. But they /are/ trying, because they've decided to stop doing the alternative to trying.

Because, you know, that's what polyamory is in real life.

(On a lighter note, insofar as a rationalist might see an advantage in "killing Death", /rational polyamory/ would be the idea that there are many seemingly "unfair" advantages that can be gained by /killing Jealousy/ wherever it is encountered. There are a lot of stories where the heroes mostly win by solving coordination problems that the villains cannot; indeed, many "adventure" stories containing a heroic couple justify their mutual success by pointing out the trust they give one another, that allows them each to far go out on a limb assuming the other will be doing the right-and-necessary thing without them. When this dynamic is expanded beyond a couple, it usually becomes a "team"---for example, SG-1 in Stargate---but there's no reason you couldn't have e.g. a poly triad that all adventure under an assumption of underlying trust. It'd just be, y'know... an /unfair advantage./)

I'm not going to comment on this much except to note that the first reference to the term /I've/ heard of appears [[http://www.paganicon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-Boquet-of-Lovers.pdf][here]], which dates from the year 1990. If that's what you mean by "recent", then sure.

#+begin_quote
  I personally see emotions as something in your brain that can work well or work poorly, just like logic. They can help you or stop you in getting what you want. They often expand your list of options and increase your ability to get what you want.
#+end_quote

Er... what? An emotion is an evolutionary adaptation, a shortcut mechanism in your neural networks to get you to behave in a certain way. As an example: you feel anger at a perceived slight because in the ancestral environment, anger was a useful emotion when it came to punishing defectors in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas. Evolution is mindless; it does not promote rationality as an end in and of itself. If emotions propagated through natural selection, it means only that they were useful to survival and reproduction in the ancestral environment. /Nothing more./

This means that emotions are /not logical/. They are /not rational/. Emotions can be used to /fuel/ rationality, because they have a powerful effect on your brain which you can use to kickstart yourself into doing something, but they are /not in and of themselves/ rational. Basing your values entirely on your gut emotional responses will reduce you to little more than an animal, acting purely on instinct. If you have some argument as to why jealousy as an gut reaction is a good response to have in today's society (why it "expands your list of options", why it "increases your ability to get what you want", etc.), feel free to articulate it. Right now, though, I'm not seeing anything but a flat, unsupported assertion--and a bad one at that.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes... except when it comes to relationships, at which point suddenly jealousy is "A-OK!". If your claim is that jealousy is not tolerated by society, much as anger isn't, then this claim seems blatantly false where romantic relationships are concerned. (Whether or not social stigmas exist against jealousy in /other/ contexts is entirely irrelevant to the current discussion.) On the other hand, if your claim is that it is somehow "rational" to be jealous when your romantic partner engages in "extra-relational" affairs, while it is /not/ "rational" to be likewise jealous if your friend plays more with someone else, then I should note that you have not provided a single shred of evidence in support of this claim. Either way, you're standing on shaky ground here.

Again, you conveniently take this argument outside of a relationship context, which is where [[/u/eaglejarl]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vkeqf/q_rational_polyamory_fanfics/cojm4do][originally]] made said argument. I'm not sure if you just didn't understand his point or if you deliberately took said point out of context, but in the former case I'd recommend reading people's posts more closely, and in the latter case... well, that's really disingenuous of you.

#+begin_quote
  What I've never seen is a story where some characters start as really monogamous---not just "lipstick monogamous"---but where this is causing them lots of pain that could be solved by them being not monogamous---and then it occurs to one character to just not be monogamous, who then starts trying to get everyone else on-board with this with every shred of pain that might entail. An author-granted gift for romantic insight, in this case, merely ensures that this venture won't be doomed before it even begins.
#+end_quote

This is a description of a situation in which characters have an explicit preference for monogamy, but decide to /try out/ polygamy because /they are convinced to do so/ by a /rational character/, most likely because a relationship graph involving polyamorous nodes would have more connections and thereby be more optimal than a purely monogamous graph. /That/ is what I, and (I presume) most other people on this subreddit are talking about when we say "rationality". Convincing people to try a different way of doing things, because it seems plausibly better or more logical. (It might not /actually/ be better, but the point is to at least be /open to consideration/.) /That's/ rationality. /Not/ a instinctive gut emotional reaction of "OH NO HE SLEPT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN KILLLLLLL!!!!!!!"

/Note also/ that there is /not a single mention/ of "conversions in story", "erasing sexualities", or whatever the heck you seem to have been reading into this discussion. Whatever you meant by the quoted section above, it has very little to do with this particular thread.

#+begin_quote

I would be fine with such a story... /if the protagonist actually considered the issue rationally and came to his/her conclusion using sound logical reasoning/. However, most stories with a premise like that are /not/ meant to advocate logical approaches to emotionally charged issues, but rather meant as a mouthpiece for the author to espouse whatever views he/she holds on sexuality. Therefore, were I to encounter such a story in actuality, I would most likely give it a pass, simply because the probability of it being propaganda (as opposed to the probability of it being a genuinely rational story) is far too high.

I'll conclude by saying this: you don't really seem to have been engaging with [[/u/eaglejarl]]'s actual arguments. Rather, you have been using slippery, debate-team-style rhetoric to dodge his (very good, IMO) questions.

Your logic and reasoning sides of your brain are also subject to evolution. They are also parts of your brain. It's in your interest to ensure your logic, reasoning are all appropriately triggering according to rational scientific evidence. It's also in your interest to ensure your emotional parts of your brain are appropriately triggering. Both logic and emotion are useful in some situations, not just for motivation. Logic isn't innately more right than emotion, both use different systems to evaluate the world. I prefer to trust science, which is external to our brains, and use that to optimize logic and emotion. The closer something is to direct sensory evidence the better.

Sexual crushes on friends and teachers were common, and I often saw similar training on appropriate behavior for that. For example a fellow student stalked a student home after some comment was made to a favorite teacher of his whom he had been sexually flirting and his conduct wasn't permitted, he received a suspension.

Jealousy as an emotion is just fear and pain at the thought of the loss of a valuable thing. Training for jealousy with friends, also relationships, carries over to training for relationships with lovers.

#+end_quote

I was answering one of eaglejarl's questions, not replying to OP. Eaglejarl explicitly talked about altering people's sexualities.

On OP's intentions- as I understand it, his premise was that a rational character realized that their monogamy was serving them poorly by being inferior to polyamory, tried to change, and then tried to convince others who had some sort of feeling that they had a problem that that reason was due to them not fully exploring their sexuality (in a nice, non pushy way) and try to show them the benefits of branching out and that this would be successful thing because most people hadn't explored their sexualities. He would then try to alter their sexualities with cognitive behavioural therapy and whatever else worked.

I see this as extremely authoritarian. Many humans have a vague dissatisfaction and sense things are wrong and so are open to any person with a solution (more nodes has to be superior, this graph says so!). This sense is frequently used by snake oil salesmen to push some non effective treatment that hurts their victims.

Rational charity shouldn't be about just asking questions as that's just anecdotal evidence, it should be about doing measured scientific studies to see what problems are common and then finding cheap and cost effective solutions to those problems that have a proven efficacy. Lack of polyamory is not a proven problem CBT is not a proven way to enable polyamory polyamory hasn't been proved to be generally superior to monogamy.

Rephrased.

While I'd be fine with an exploration of a rational protagonist optimizing romance throughout this discussion you've mostly been implying that jealousy is an irrational emotion that should be overcome for greater happiness. You haven't paid much attention to the possible failure of polyamory due to timing issues or std issues that people commonly worry. These issues often cause jealousy and people are rationally worried about them and so in promoting polygamy among people who strongly wanted to avoid those problems you'd worsen their lives. As such the majority of the experiments to promote polyamory would likely be failures, just as people would fail if they tried to convince you that you being asexual would better fulfil your values "Be happy myself" and "Make my partner happy."

  As such the majority of the experiments to promote polyamory would likely be failures, just as people would fail if they tried to convince you that you being asexual would better fulfil your values "Be happy myself" and "Make my partner happy."

On a distinct-but-related note: how would you feel about someone who had hypogonadism that had caused them to reach their 20s while having never gone through puberty? How would you feel about someone else suggesting that getting hormone supplementation therapy would be an optimization of that person's life?

There's a very underexplored subfield of epistemic rationality, concerning how to "value" various self-modifications. This question in particular basically comes down to: is it a good thing to add an extra term to your utility function? In a eudaimonic sense, adding more utility-function terms that only require human-level-effort to optimize for can seemingly only be a good thing.

On the other hand, while puberty is a process that introduces an otherwise-optional utillity-function term, so is drug addiction. We have very different feelings about these: while sexual adults claim that they would rather be sexual, and asexual adults claim that they would rather be asexual, both drug addicts and non-drug-addicts claim they would rather be non-drug-addicts. That might say something, but I'm not sure precisely what.

Am I a trained doctor who has diagnosed this via a blood test or am I a random person who has decided someone else has hypogonadism based on a visual inspection? Have they refused advice from a trained professional who understands and has diagnosed them more testosterone?

I'm not a fan of random armchair doctors diagnosing others and advising them to get expensive and potentially dangerous treatments, like a person seeing a pregnant woman and deciding to tell her to get plastic surgery because they perceive her as fat. I am fine with doctors giving competent advice based on the latest medical knowledge.

I'd prefer to evaluate these things on a case by case basis with science than say, in general, that it can only be a good thing. Most medical and biological conditions are complex things with hosts of different components and symptoms and pros and cons and evaluation of the best one requires careful study.

************* Let's say this is your friend. The friend told you their doctor diagnosed them with hypogonadism when they were 12. The doctor asked the friend's /parents/ what they wanted to do, and the parents said they'd just let their child's body do what it does without trying to change anything. So, now, your friend is 20 and has no secondary sexual characteristics, no sexual attraction to anything, doesn't really "get" romance, etc. Also, they never had a growth spurt, so they still look kind of the way they did when they were 13.

Would you suggest to this friend that, now that the choice is in their hands rather than their parents', they might want to talk to their doctor about reconsidering the previously-discarded option of hormone supplementation, if it is by any chance not too late?

******* Effectively, I'm presuming that a sufficiently-powerful AI would be able to "talk you into" being polyamorous, as much as it could "talk you into" letting it out of a box. I'm then substituting "person with a gift for romantic insight" for "sufficiently-powerful AI."

Note that there is a definite difference between "talking someone into" being homosexual---this would require /creating a terminal desire where one doesn't already exist/---and "talking someone into" being polyamorous. Talking someone into polyamory would "merely" require getting them to rerank one terminal goal (enjoying the affection of relationship partners they already /want/ to be with) higher than another terminal goal (avoiding being in a relationship with someone who is in a relationship with someone else.)

If you're /attracted/ to a person who you could be with, save for the fact that they are already dating someone---and you have both of the above-stated values---then there's no way to /maximize/ your happiness in this situation, only to optimize it. If you decide against being with them, you'll be sad that you didn't get to be with them; if you decide to be with them, you'll be jealous that they're with someone else. In neither context do you win 100%.

The cultural bit of this---the assumption embedded in monogamous characters' heads at the start of such a story---is that while the jealousy is something you shouldn't tolerate, the /sadness/ is something you'll just have to put up with. If someone or something can talk the character into flipping those beliefs around---that the loneliness of depravation is intolerable, and jealousy is something you'll have to put up with in order to avoid that pain---then the switch can be made.

Now, some people don't really experience jealousy; and some other people don't really experience romantic attachment. For these people, the problem is already decided one way or the other. But for people in the middle---which, I would hazard, is the vast majority of people, and fictional characters---there are compelling arguments, and social contexts, that can sway them to one side or the other over time.

Talking someone into homosexuality is also just a goal reorientation. You can talk them into valuing not sleeping with people they find unattractive less than trying out new sexual activities, as several homosexual and bisexual men have tried to convince me I would. A mouth's a mouth and all.

Maybe an AI could convince me to be homosexual. I'd likely also find that rather unpleasant and would likely become very depressed and self hating because I value sleeping with attractive partners quite highly and value an emotional connection with females quite highly.

Human values aren't a matter of just weighing up values relative to each other. Many values are hardcoded, perhaps by culture, perhaps by biology, and when triggered cause aversion and disgust. If you optimize their values by trying to pressure them into a more optimal solution the end result is just a confusing mix of pain and dark happiness, not a happy ending.

In particular with jealousy and sadness for many, the sadness can be overcome by avoiding the stimuli, the jealousy is a permanent fixture since you are repeatedly reminded about it. Any jealousy related hang ups are triggered repeatedly in a polyamorous relationships. Any std or time worries can be triggered a lot more too.

Humans are generally aware of various pros and cons of polyamory, an AI couldn't negate your knowledge of those pros and cons. If a person says "I would prefer to have Ramma all to myself as I am rather clingy and I wish to spend lots of time with him/ her" if the AI limits the techniques they can use to ethical ones they won't be able to negate that desire.

You can exposure away specific scenarios but you can't exposure away the brain's emotions. If a monkey chases you and tries to rip your face off you may be unable to avoid fear because you're in danger even if you have had exposure therapy about monkeys. If you have less time with your partner then you may be unable to avoid jealousy because there is rationally a threat to something you value.

What I suspect would happen would be that he would detach them from their aversions and then situations would occur that would cause them pain and depression and they would continue their actions because he had reordered their goal priorities away from avoidance of harm.

Like if you did exposure therapy on playing with fire.

This super rational person thinks all this aversion to polyamory is just an emotional reaction of jealousy and hasn't considered negative consequences to his victims. That could turn out as badly as a super rational person trying to use cognitive behavioral therapy to remove people's aversion to playing with fire.

Not that playing with fire isn't safe and fun for some. It certainly is for me. I do like setting things on fire. I have successfully set many things on fire and am safer because of my use of fire.

*********** The fire thing is actually a great example, thanks. Let me try to take it further.

Some people do edgeplay: things like playing with fire, or knives, or asphyxiation, for the purposes of sexual arousal.

Most people have an inbuilt aversion to the kinds of things edgeplay incorporates, for good reason---thus why it's, y'know, called that. But a not-big-but-not-tiny portion of the population also get strongly aroused by one or more of these things, /some/ to the point of it being a deal-breaker if their partner won't explore their kink with them.

Given a relationship between two people, two people who love each-other and /want/ their relationship to work, where one of them has a strong edge-play kink---let's say they like, for example, cutting their partner---and the other doesn't: would the simplest global optimization be to make the non-kinky partner /kinkier/---to give them the same desire their partner has?

Well, it depends. But I don't think it depends on /much/---mainly, one, does their partner do the cutting in a safe-and-responsible way? And two, would the hypothetical person /they'd/ be with the kink be safe-and-responsible with it? In other words, would they both only act on the kink insofar as it increases both of their total utilities?

Now, mind you, if you gave someone exposure therapy to take away their pain-avoidance, or perhaps even supplant it with a different reaction, you could potentially end up creating people like [[http://kushiel.wikia.com/wiki/Ph%C3%A8dre_n%C3%B3_Delaunay_de_Montr%C3%A8ve][Phèdre nó Delaunay]]---people who are much more vulnerable to abuse by random strangers, and might also not function as well in "normal" relationships going forward.

But remember, here, that we're talking about taking an existing, mostly-static set of people in a one relationship graph, and working with them on elective goal-function self-modification to allow them to create a more-optimal set of edges on the /same/ relationship graph. In other words, we don't have to worry about how these people would be affected by the outside world; they've got these people as their tribe and this isn't going to change. Their only /control/ comes from what relationship they'll have with each of the other tribe members.

(It might also turn out that some people "make bad poly partners" in a /different/ way than some people "make bad [monogamous] relationship partners"---that, even though someone is good in any given pairing, some emergent property makes them a horrible member of the graph. You might have to /eject/ some of the nodes from the graph if you wanted to ensure the happiness of the rest---and for a given tribe, it might be more optimal for the tribe as a whole to not be poly, than to lose this tribe member.)

Pain avoidance therapy. That sounds horrific. Causing people ever increasing amounts of pain to build up their resilience. I suspect you'd get someone depressed and suicidal like someone in [[/r/chronicpain]] more than you'd get a sexy masochist.

It's not necessarily about outside influences destabilizing the perfect system. Internal problems within the relationship could also cause destabilization. Your system is about using super rationality to convince people to enter into 'elective' goal-function self modification without considering the internal reasons people are for monogamy. Any sort of cognitive therapy or such won't work well if they frequently experience rational pain at internal issues.

On that specific note: CBT actually works /great/ at getting rid of "high-level acute sensations" like idiopathic itchiness, or phantom limb pain, or disgust in response to a smell. Anxiety or jealousy or rage that come with a "trigger" are no different.

Not arguing against this at all. This is why I said that, even in the cases where people would be successfully convinced to try it, it could turn out to not work out. Polyamory is not a guaranteed win! It's a /potential win/ when the positive utility you get from being in given relationships is sufficient to outweigh your own jealousy, /and/ all the implementation costs.

But, to play propaganda mouthpiece for a moment, there are /positive/ side-effects to other terms in each person's utility function, too, than can actually make polyamory /easier/ than the alternative. More shared income sources; more people to raise a child; more chances that any given interest you might have will be shared by at least one partner; etc.

Really, it comes as not being a clear win or a clear loss, but rather a practice whose marginal value for a given group of people has to be individually and separately found.

I'm not presuming a lack of creativity to support your goals.

Polyamory has various internal issues that are against some people's values more than others. Trying to desensitise them into a relationship with your superior rationality upsets more of their values and is riskier.

There are lots of ways to deal with the spiritual bond. For example a person could be smeared with the blood of Bella to improve their scent.

What solution would be best actually would involve talking to the people, considering their issues, working out how they viewed monogamy and various issues, what their sexuality was like, lots of things. Once you understood their entire personhood you could work out the most optimal solution and which had the lowest risk. Possibly that would be polyamory. Possibly not. Probably not in most cases and definitely given how obsessive these individuals are and how violent. You'd actually have to consider them as an individual, not as a potential polyamory machine.

And that is... exactly what I was asking if there existed fiction where there was a character that went around to their group of friends and /did that/ for all of them.

So I guess I wasn't clear in the title. "Polyamory" can have two meanings. One of them is "specifically-more-than-two"-amory. The other is "any-number-of"-amory. I sort of intended it to refer to the latter; or, more generally, trying to get everyone to open up their sexual and romantic horizons to the widest possible point each person's values would allow, to get more people in more satisfying relationships than would happen otherwise.

Spreading Bella's blood on some other girl is totally within the confines of what this person would do. But frankly, I would sort of consider Bella and that girl to be /in a relationship/ of a sort---similar to the one between biological and adoptive parents, or between a sperm donor and a mother.

I guess my more general thesis---the thing this character would think---was "adding nontraditional edges to the relationship graph will allow for the conversion of some negatively-weighted edges to positively-weighted ones." Polyamory is the /simplest/, but not the /only/, example of that.

Your fic request has a heavy assumption that therapy or talking it out will change innate sexualities. It's a common sort of thing in fanfictions, but it tends to be handled quite poorly because it's using a toolset to solve issues with an extremely limited range- therapy is not normally that effective at dealing with major personality things so when someone monogamous reads it they will just go "I wouldn't react anything like that, that's completely ignoring my values."

I'm doubtful that there's that many people more who you could effectively convert without massively subverting their values and goals- most of those that might benefit from more edges may already have done so.

Not trying to convert anyone! More than anything, I just want to read "rational optimization process vs. incredibly complex relationship jumble" because rational optimization processes are entertaining and incredibly-complex-relationship-jumbles are entertaining.

If anything, I would expect the end result of such a fic-writing attempt to be a /thorough exploration/ of the search-space of human romance and sexuality, and a demonstration of a lot of both potential advantages and potential pitfalls that a reader would be unaware of, expressed fairly and worked through with as much compassion and charity as each subject would allow.

This could also be done by having the protagonist of the fic /be/ a relationship counsellor, and giving them a lot of /little/ one-off problems rather than one big ongoing one... but that wouldn't be nearly as enthralling, I think.

**************** That would be fine and fun to explore.

As I mentioned though, in trying to find a good portrayal of it seeking one where people's sexualities are converted wouldn't be a good main target. If you want to fulfil everyone's values better if therapy effectively changes a person's core personality then they'll explore pitfalls and advantages less. I've seen a lot of stories like that, though normally focused on making everyone gay or bisexual.

I'm considering doing some romance stuff in my fanfiction later like that. It's a gaming one and he gets stat bonuses for having more party members so he needs as large a group as possible.

***************** I might be projecting a bit from my peer-group when I say this, but I believe a large portion of the population actually has very weakly-held default values about romance and sexuality; that they're just going with whatever their parents'/society's expectations are of them, and that, if left alone in the wilderness without anyone to tell them what to be, they'd honestly not be able to answer self-reflective questions on the subject of gender or sexual identity.

These people who are just going with the defaults have /very likely/ made at least one flawed assumption about their own preferences (though some might be very /small/ mistakes---like turning out to be bidemiromantic instead of heteroromantic), and experimenting to at least get away from the defaults can only do them good.

Or, to put it another way: everyone experiments in their late highschool/early college years to find their true gender and sexual identity, right? But usually they don't /explore the entire search space/; they just experiment /a little/, never straying far from the origin, and so either learning one or zero new things about themselves.

This feels, to me (as someone who has spent years doing such experiments) similar to the ninja in Naruto who only ever bother to /try/ one technique, or one weapon, without even stopping to think that another technique/weapon might not only be a better fit for them, but also /easier to learn/ than the one they started with.

I feel this is a helpful article on polyamory and how I feel about it. In particular.

#+begin_quote
  If there's one thing everybody loves, it's a salesman. If there's anything that people love even more than a salesman, it's a salesman who tells you that he's better than you, and will continue to be until you buy his product. Also the salesman probably wants to bone you, and that's extra fun.

  I'm neither a soothsayer nor a sociologist, but probably neither are you and even if you are, societal trends are a slippery thing at the best of times. The point is that maybe polyamory is the next stage in human social development, and everybody has a little polyamory in them. I don't know. You don't know. Nobody knows.

  Because you don't know, it's important to acknowledge that you are not automatically more evolved for having come out as poly. This isn't a magical relationship structure discovered by the authors of The Ethical Slut and we are not approaching the polylarity to become a glorious single global-spanning relationship structure governed by a monolithic Google Calendar.

  The practical thing to take away from this is that polyamory is not the natural state of humanity and it is not for everyone. Don't be an evangelist. No one is keeping score, there is no free toaster, you do not get discounts at local businesses.

  I'm not saying that you can never suggest polyamory to anyone. If you think someone you know would really benefit from polyamory, feel free to talk to them about it if you are already having a conversation about relationships. People tend to be more comfortable with polyamory when they feel that they arrived at the idea organically, and often they get there via information they received from friends. The critical distinction is that of approach. Did they invite you to speak about your relationship model? Or did you bring it to their door and try to spray it in their face?
#+end_quote

As it noted, the spray in their face approach of the rational protagonist you mentioned has been tried a lot and people see it as extremely annoying, especially when it's coupled with some sort of view that those who are poly amorous are superior or optimal in some way.

Don't imagine any form of "polyamory is objectively good" being implied anywhere in the text, by a character, by the narration, anything. Instead, just imagine a bunch of characters who have arrived at the conclusion that "what we're doing /now/ isn't /working/", and so they're willing to try alternatives, /whether they're good or not/---just so long as they're /different./

(And polyamory is /one/ of the things they would try. They would try /many/ things.)

Note that the point of the rational optimizer character wasn't to /persuade them to try/ these things. The rational optimizer just opens up the possibility of a character A. bucking societal trends to even /think of/ trying something nobody else is trying; and B. being really good at /helping people with the problems encountered along the way to implementation/.

Most patients probably don't have Lupus, they don't have edit a problem not being able to practice asexuality or demisexuality or polyamory. They're normally just drunk or high, or having problems not from bucking society's trends but from being drunk or high or bad at communication. You shouldn't use rare conditions as a basis for what you treat people with. Most people's relationship issues would likely go a lot better with better self esteem, communication, and guidance on consent. Making them polygamous is unlikely to fix their issues.

That is clearly not true, grammatically incorrect, and shows a blatant disrespect for the topic. Those religious extremists who think the opposite are /crazy/ (and usually in the closet themselves), unbalanced enough to try a Clockwork Orange approach to something people are born neurologically wired for.

Okay, this is a basic conceptual issue and I think this post displays your biases with debating this topic.

Monogamy is a complex emotional disinclination, largely linked to socialization, not a simple avoidance or preference mechanism. True, like basic sexual response it is something we may have /some/ varying levels of genetic predisposition towards; /unlike/ sexual orientation (whatever that might be), adding in polyamory doesn't involve ignoring a strong genetic imperative by cutting off a basic lizard-brain response, only dealing rationally with a complex emotional trigger, one mostly socialized. Something modern rationalists are well aware of and often skilled at doing.

You seem to disagree with this, and what I see as OPs basic thesis and brainstorming topics. Instead of a simple statement of disagreement and request for concrete scientific citation (which might not be possible), you've made a huge, unreadable rabbit hole of a comment thread.

Maybe this isn't the place to have this discussion. Or maybe a new post is in order, one that clarifies what "convincing someone to be homosexual" means. In any case, I'm having trouble thinking how I could disagree to any greater extent with your mostly disjointed arguments.

But I thought focusing on that would derail the discussion. I was wrong to worry about that, it seems, as little rational debate is to be had. So I feel no need to hold this sort of thing back.

Double down on that and don't pull back from it, like you did in the original thread where you said your tone might have been off.

A little abrupt with the ostracization signaling, however. Need to ease into that sort of thing. More rallying statements of ideological unity first. Something like, "as all the rational people on this subreddit know." That sort of thing.

Shouldn't have started with a negative in you post, either. The general pattern in most western cultures is: positive praise, weak negative correction, redefining positive statement of collective future action.

#+end_quote

That's not a good study for this purpose. It's one of those reasoned extensions of a known fact pieces. Not even in the same league as the other article.

Also doesn't say /anything/ about polygamy or polyamory. It's about studying successfully monogamy based on genes rewarding social pressures against cheating (which it does poorly). This is something people in both polygamous and polyamorous relationships won't be feeling the same way, and will feel differently depending on their own social perception of their situation and how they mentally approach and model it.

You know, the kind of thing modern rationalists like to optimize?

Look at this waffling:

#+begin_quote
  /Not only that, men with two copies of RS3 334 were more likely to be unmarried than men with one or none, and if they were married, they were twice as likely to have a marital crisis./

  /Given that everyone surveyed had been in their relationship for at least five years, the team suggests that having multiple copies somehow contributes to commitment problems in men. Because the results were collected for a different study the team couldn't quiz the men on whether they were faithful, says Wallum./
#+end_quote

That's simply not very good. They're guessing, in a scientific sense, while maybe waiting for some more funding to actually do their own study on it. Maybe.

But here's the good part. You should try to *read* this.

Next, this mediocre article (and the much better one, but this is shorter) links this genetic mechanism to /social perception/ reward structures in the brain, not sexual responses, /which is what I said in my post/:

#+begin_quote
  /In some animals, the theory is that the brain has two "motivational" systems: one for reward, the other for social perception. In prairie voles and marmosets, receptors for the two systems sit on adjacent cells, so social activity is highly rewarding, leading to monogamy. To see if the same mechanism is at work in people will mean using tissue from post-mortems to map where vasopressin receptors lie, to see if variations are linked to the number of copies of RS3 334./
#+end_quote

But wait. They don't have evidence for this physical mechanism affecting humans /or/ for the genetic link in humans being linked to this physical brain structure. Even if this were true in humans, this is the sort of thing a lot of rational brain hacks deal with anyway.

It is not linked to a sexual response, thus the comparison between "talking someone into homosexuality" (whatever the fuck that means) and being convinced of polyamory's theoretical benefits enough to counter the possible downsides is clearly incorrect. Which is what I said in my post.

**** I get the impression that Nepene's suggestion is not that polyamorous relationships are impossible, but that they are not likely for people that are not inclined in that direction. In a way you could compare it to sexual orientation, and you're rebuttal of showing that polyamorous relationships do in fact exist in real life doesn't really negate that..

Though in the end both are assumptions and when it come to the human psych there aren't that many things which are definite so i wouldn't say its impossible for that to work, the author will just need to show model of the human mind that on one hand will enable "conversion" and on the other will not contradict with the reality where such relationships are so rare.

I think that would be a fairly interesting premise for a story. Don't you?

(Also, considering the fact that people in polyamorous relationships in real life have not reported being less satisfied with the quality of their romantic lives overall, I don't think it's an ingrained thing. The whole issue of there being far more monogamous people than polyamorous ones seems more like a societal-norm-type issue than anything else, although of course that doesn't change the fact that it does exist. It does, however, raise the probability that someone could be "convinced out of monogamous practices", though such a conversion would probably be extremely difficult and would, as a result, require an extremely skilled writer to pull off.)

sure, if done properly it could defenitly be interesting, though my general impression would be that if i was a rational character in such a situation i would not (rationally) assume that polyamourous relationships are the solution, unless i either had background in psychology and had reasons(research?) to believe that polyamourous relations are indeed something which is reasonable for people to learn to accept.

Or if i were such a character and i knew some people(anecdotal evidence) that were poly, and i wasn't fully rational, meaning i would have made the mistake of assuming that just because i know something it is somehow applicable to other people even though i wasn't a psychologist and didnt do\read research that implied it is correct..

Why would ingrained imply they should be less satisfied? are gay\bi people less satisfied with their relationships?

As i said i accept that as a possibility, but i find it to be less likely to be the explanation by itself. Meaning i would presume there are practical reasons that made it the societal norm, and would not be quick to dismiss them without understanding them..

#+end_quote

If we assume that it is not ingrained it indeed makes it possible to convince people, i don't know if by itself that would be more likely to succeed then not, i tend to believe the probability of success would be lower then for failure, simply because if it was more likely to convince people of polyamoury, and we know for a fact there are people who are polyamourous then it would stand to reason that the public would slowly be converted. Seeing as that is not the case, unless we isolate some specific aspects that makes the conversion more likely for the given scenario(for example if you have a bunch of people that live on an island and thus are not as effected by societal norms, such as in [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou][Nagasarete Airantou]]) then i would have to assume the conversion would fail,or at the very least that even if people gave it a try eventually they would decide it is not for them.

As you say, as long as the writer is good enough it could definitely be good, yup..

This is original fiction, not fanfic, and not really rational, but it does explore polyamorous relationships and how they can be better for everyone. It is a well written story and on is going (~4.5 books written), warning it is quite explicit as you might expect from the website it is hosted on. The first book was edited and expanded a bit on kindle and can be found here [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TBSZF2A][www.amazon.com/dp/B00TBSZF2A]] .

** One thought that the discussion so far has prompted is:

How do you demonstrate that a character *is* /really monogamous/? Because of the sociological 'default' status of monogamy, you certainly can't take simple assertions, actions, or thoughts that are stereotypically 'expected' as evidence. The characters would have to be put in a position where non-monogamy occupies a clearly privileged position, in societal terms and in terms of fulfilling their values.. except they reject it because they value monogamy sufficiently (and of course, that would also have to be made crystal clear.. that the rejection was not instead because X would be disappointed, or because of rebelliousness, etc).

Most universes you might look at for fanfic don't even TRY to do this (Ranma 1/2 being no exception since it runs on slapstick). It's basically only universes with invented species who have invented biological drives(eg. Twilight) where you can actually know what you're working with.

(or author fiat, but that is ugly and often inconsistent with canon)

IMO being able to establish this would be pretty important to the story premise working.
