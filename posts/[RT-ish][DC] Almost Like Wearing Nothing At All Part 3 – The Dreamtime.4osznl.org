** Tanya's quest continues. Only one more piece to go (it's written, will be published next Sunday).

I was hitting gaming tropes more than anything else in this one.

** I laughed at the agent bit; could totally see some dickish Gamemaster doing that in a D&D campaign.

"Wait, Stan, how the hell did you get that armor? We're like level 7!"

"Oh, my agent hooked me up....what, you guys don't have an agent? Silly halflings...."

** Also, just because I feel obligated to say it as this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]]; her decision to fight a possibly giant lizard was a bit at odds with the pragmatism she's shown throughout the rest of the story. It's somewhat easy to accept her bikini chainmail; the world convention she lives in literally stops her from getting anything else. But, based on how intelligent she's been, I find it doubtful she'd one on one a lizard larger than herself while blindfolded. Especially considering she doesn't have all that much experience fighting blind.

Just a small nitpick. Still a great read though :)

*** My rationale for that bit is exhaustion, lack of proper nutrition, her not being in a very smart or rational place mentally. That level of ongoing stress can do interesting things to you.

**** Fair excuse. She has been on that island for weeks after all, and the journey over wasn't all that relaxing either.
