** Ah, this story. Does it ever get any better? I read up to where a bunch of people get on the abandoned ship, and by that point I was bored out of my mind. You wouldn't think you /could/ be that bored when the story is about a giant intelligent spaceship waging war across space and time, but it somehow manages to be an incredible slog to get through.

A much better, more enjoyable story is Chrysalis: [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/][[Reddit Link]]] [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0MRQBkXgY3_OTlEWFJGUkM1MDg/view][[EPUB File]]]

*** It's hard to recommend or not recommend when your criticism lacks, well, criticism. "I was bored" is your reaction, and it's kinda like saying "Thor did it" in terms of predictive power.

Ah, I recognize Chrysalis. Failed to grab me. Did a lot of telling, not so much showing, and the narrative voice lacks... Presence? It tells me about what happened to it, not what it /is/ happening; gives me a somewhat descriptive blow-by-blow but doesn't really convey the experience the entity is having. It tells me /that/ I should care, but kinda fails to actually deliver on pulling those heart strings.

Red One's hatred is palpable, and although it's not as pronounced as in other works, I do feel like each character's sections have a distinct feel to them.

The story has progressed substantially from where you got to; that abandoned ship /is/ the main character, so if that's as far as you got you didn't really get past the intro. That said, I don't really feel like the story has changed much in feel, although there's a lot less crawling through corridors and a lot more ship-to-ship combat. Check out some of the Red Hand side stories if you want a better idea as to how it reads later on.

**** Okay, well, here is some more detailed criticism then. The ship AI is handed an idiot ball the size of the moon, since it never branched out or even harvested resources from planets after many hundreds of years, the pacing is all out of whack, it's way too slow and adds a huge amount of pointless detail toward every aspect of the story, the fact that there even needs to be any crawling through corridors says volumes about how nonsensical the worldbuilding is, and what I've seen of the problems faced tells me the solution is often brute force instead of anything clever. Whereas your experience with Chrysalis seems more to do with the writing style, The Last Angel's problems stem from the fact that the writer had no idea what they were doing and made a subpar story---seriously, compare the amount of telling between the two stories, The Last Angel is practically /drowning/ in it and most of it's not even needed for the plot.

***** I can't speak to a lot of your criticism, but it's revealed that basically the entire galaxy (both the Compact /and/ the Compact's enemies) really fucking fear and hate AIs, so it's not like it can find a friendly star nation and ally with them. Additionally, it does try to branch out, but it's pretty much always on the backfoot. It's a single ship fighting against a star nation that spans hundreds of solar systems -- its logistically outclassed by several orders of magnitude, and while using AI builders helps some, it still needs a manufacturing chain that it just doesn't have. Also, it has to spend decades or even centuries recovering from battles with the Compact; that's what it was doing before the Compact discovered it at the start of the story.

Why doesn't it copy itself onto a bunch of future disks and place them everywhere? It just doesn't look like it's trying to actually fulfill its utility function.

It did, actually, that's literally what the current plot is about. Also the insurgency (the Red Hand) it shadow-funded over the last ~50 years. All of this starts to show up as you get past what's basically the intro, while they're repairing Red without knowing what she it.

****** Remember, I haven't read to the current plot. I did read that it had been drifting around for hundreds of years at a time, and never once harvested resources while that was going on, which is what I was referring to.

And sure, details are well and good, but the way they're introduced here don't actually progress the story most of the time. The text is clearly aware that the readers don't have the details of the situation of the universe, and painstakingly tells us, directly, everything that's even tangentially relevant, even hammering these points home over and over again. Humans are low on the totem pole around these parts, it says, and then says again, and again, and again, each time more explicitly.

And sure, it might get clever later. Again, I read only a fraction of the story. The problem is what the narrative has shown is the norm. If strategic ploys suddenly happen where before it was brute force against force, worldbuilding crumbles, because the question has to be asked: why now? Why never before?

Telling is directly providing exposition to the reader within narrative or dialogue. Showing is generally description, action, or dialogue that may have exposition in it, but always serves to advance the plot.

******* Sure. I think part of what's going on is that it was originally written as a form of creepy pasta - just the horror show that is "wait, this ship is alive is wants to kill us", and then grows from there.

The cleverness shows up in ship battles a bit, but more so the strategic maneuvering, which is usually Red doing feints-in-feints... although yeah, at the end there's always a brute force punch. It's not so much that it's clever about how it fights, but about which fights it fights.

So, the simplest answer to "why now, why never before?" is "scale", battles with bodies to battles with ships to battles with fleets, etc.

Re: show/tell, I'd agree except for the need to advance the plot. Character development and establishment is also very important. I find that Chrysalis does almost no showing (more near the end) and generally sticks to telling; I hear you that LA does a lot of showing that doesn't advance the action, but I like that.

*** Okay, trying the epub, as the line breaks on the Reddit formatting feel like stabbing my eyes.

I think this has lost me what after firebombing the /planet/, the Terran does a ground sweep in... hours? Of the entire thing? And then /walks/ the two other survivors to the spaceport? The levels of destruction seem wildly out of proportion.

Also, drive wakes, or did I just skim a section that described why they're not a thing? Because moving ships comparable in size to one that's 27KM - that's a lot of reaction mass, or even just raw energy.

Also also, if you've got that kind of acceleration (demonstrated when ramming), why pop into an orbit when you could pop into a fast injection trajectory; what's the detection range of the warp tunnel*, why not jump a few AU out in a stealthier way, and I mean, for that matter...

Why would you not just get near the system and spend a year making a doomsday comet? Is there something preventing that kind of stealth? Your review of Last Angel implies to me that you think the combat in Chrysalis is clever, but so far (first real battle, nuking the colony) I don't see it at all.

And, if you can jump into orbit around a planet with a warp drive, doesn't that imply you can arrive with (relative) velocity of your choice? Again, just jump in with a lot of high-speed mass, either with completely disposable ships, or just big engines that can detach from the mass and save themselves. The entire tactical approach here seems like it for the purposes of telling a particular story, rather than having well-thought plans by the characters.

- I like that warp tunnels are detectable long before they arrive.

I definitely like the ambassador characters tho, that was a nice section.

**** Well yeah, the Terran is an actual human-level intelligent AI with all the capabilities being a computer entails. It's going to be able to do a ground sweep really quickly if it uses its abilities to its full extent. Also, doing a ground sweep of everything isn't the same as doing a sweep of population centers. Or former population centers.

You skimmed the section that described why that's not a thing. Don't skim this story, it tells a lot in a few words.

As to the warp tunnels, gravity, I think. Been a while since I read this. Jumping out a few AU father away won't work, not with their detection capabilities.

Doomsday comet might work. Not sure. Do be aware that Terran isn't entirely sane, and that gets a whole lot worse. It's a conglomeration of many different people, and then it loses the personality that's the most stable.

I don't actually think the combat in Chrysalis is that clever. It's standard space warfare. However, it at least is internally consistent, unlike in The Last Angel.

This is entirely for the purpose of telling a story, though there are well thought out reasons. If you had read it, anyway.

Not that Chrysalis doesn't have flaws. Of course it does. The difference between the two stories is that the writer of Chrysalis is competent, where the writer of The Last Angel is not.

I think it's usually a problem that Chrysalis tells a lot in a few words; that's usually a good thing, but you have to celebrate those words, and I don't think Chrysalis does that. The words are there. That's it.

I don't think CHY had enough to establish consistency or inconsistency. I find that LA has about as much as most military SF. What's something you feel is internally inconsistent in LA?

That may be why I don't like it as much; scifi is about consequences, fantasy is about narrative. If you warp things so that you can tell the scene you want, I see that as lazy writing: Go back and edit the starting conditions and players so that the scene you want occurs, don't kludge it in. Or, if you do, embrace the fantasy-ness of it.

I would absolutely disagree about CHY and LA. I don't think the writer of CHY is as good as LA; although I think that's mostly one of experience. Prox's writing style feels much more developed, BraverFur feels like they're still a new writer.

I would call neither one of them incompetent, and I think you should look into yourself to see where that haterade is coming from.

Last angel and the sequel have their flaws, but not one of the reasons brought up here have any substance, asides from the slower pace.

The first book starts as a type of horror and branches into something more, the second focuses on political and social matters, while on a grand scale everything is coming together.

Why not just make a full copy of herself instead of trying to create new ones? Since she's quite sane and functioning "properly" (bar possible damage induced issues, like what we've seen not so long ago) a full copy-paste into an empty hardware should result in creating another AI. If she's still hardcoded into not doing it, she could just ask the saner sister to do it for her.

Why reinvent the wheel when you can just copy a "perfectly" fine one.

The thing is- Wouldn't now be the WORST time to delay/defer retaliation, even if it temporally compromises the Hand's position?

--------------

#+begin_quote
  There's never a good time to ignore an attack on your people, but not every incident like this leads to a full-scale clan war. The threat of something like it keeps syndicates from up and killing each other all the time, but there are lots of instances where they might or must let something slide - as long as it doesn't embolden rivals.

  Think of it like gangs or mafia syndicates today. They hate each other and will kill a member of a rival gang on principle, for being on their turf or other seemingly minor reasons but gang wars themselves are relatively rare as it takes something particularly egregious to really start the bullets flying. This doesn't mean they'll let the murder of one of their own slide, but they can't go to war every time they get slapped in the face. Normally, retribution will be more low-key. In this instance, it's a mid-level underboss that is starting shit. Someone the Blotted Suns can't easily write off and who is high profile enough that they can't let a retributive killing pass - else the rest of the middle management may start causing problems (i.e. 'what are we paying tribute to you for if you won't protect/avenge us?') So the Blotted Suns would have to answer that, just like the Red Hand would have to respond in some way else the same "minnows" may start thinking they can start poking the bear. It's a situation that could spiral out of control very quickly and at a terrible time. The Blotted Suns don't want to get into a clan war, especially not against a faction that they saw dismember one of their peers. The Red Hand doesn't want to get into a clan war and squander its resources. But the traditions and mores of the fringe may demand it.

  It would be a very delicate, very chaotic situation that could completely fuck everything up for everybody.

  Let's watch.

A relatively un-cordinated mass migration event is, according to the word of the Flame, an EXISTENTIAL THREAT to the compact- as in a physical threat, not something capable of undermining their doctrine, potentially capable of Destroying the compact as a polity completely.

Well, perhaps not that, but the deadtone getting uppity would probably trigger quite the void on them.

#+begin_quote
  Let me put it this way: Red will go Chariot-hunting as a matter of course, but even she doesn't want to go up against a Naiad monarch.

  As it stands, the Compact is in the ballpark of Naiad capabilities (but it's a very big park). The Naiads are scattered across the galaxy in small hunting packs, or larger assemblages a few hundred strong. They currently have no inclination or overriding interest to band together. If they were to notice that some of the 'insects' were about to/had become a threat to them as a species, that would be very bad. For everyone. As we've seen, the Naiads don't discriminate. Deadtone are deadtone. Prey and toys. You really don't want them to be thinking of insects as competitors, enemies or - even worse - potential predators.

  If the Compact decided to try and invade Naiad territories and attack them directly, they'd probably have a string of successes, bought at great cost. Then, word would spread amongst the Naiad packs about a dangerous nest of insects. One that needs to be destroyed.

  And if one hive can become dangerous, then what about all the other squeaking, deadtone insects sprinkled across the galaxy...?

****** It could be that I'm just hating on The Last Angel for reasons I don't understand. I don't think that's the case though. I'm a writer, but first and foremost a reader, so I'll often see things through that lens. And something I can say that is the objective truth is that when reading The Last Angel, I feel bored. That's a subjective experience that can't be argued with. Now, what can be argued with is whether that feeling is /right/. For example, we could take a bunch of popular literary masterpieces and see if I enjoy them at the expected level to see if my taste in books is oddly calibrated. Or I could just write down what flaws I see. Both The Last Angel and Chrysalis have their flaws. Chrysalis sometimes doesn't focus on the plot as well as it should, there are a few plots holes in it, and while the ending was a good one, in my opinion it wasn't a satisfying one. The Last Angle's virtue is content. By which I mean, it has a lot of it. It also has an interesting premise, but everything else is, charitably put, deeply flawed.
