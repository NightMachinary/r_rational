Hey all,

Today marks the release of [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NKBSZGF/][*Six Sacred Swords*]], my latest hard fantasy RPGish novel.

It takes place in the same universe as my *Arcane Ascension* books, and like those books, it involves a lot of RPGish elements like dungeon crawling and general adventuring. (The universe is sort of a reconstruction or rationalization of RPG tropes, where I've attempted to explain mechanics like respawning monsters and giant dungeons and integrate them organically into society, culture, religion, etc. There's less of that here than in the Arcane Ascension books, but you'll still see bits of it.)

I'm recommending this because it has a hard magic system and a fair bit of problem solving, with the protagonist often using non-standard solutions to the presented problems (often prioritizing routes that work for his skill set over the clearly intended solutions). I think this will appeal to some rational fiction readers. For those of you who haven't read my books before, my style tends to be Sandersonish, but with more "gamey" elements and more quippy dialogue.

I hope people enjoy the book if anyone decides to check it out!


** Thank you! Added it to my Kindle Unlimited library.

So frustrating that the Kindle application recommends all the possible garbage but it doesn't bother to inform me about new releases from authors I'm following... What's the point of following an author at that point...

Anyway, thanks for the interest, and I hope you like the book!

**** Don't worry, it's not just you, there is never any notification from any of the authors I'm following and the new releases from them are not shown in the app homepage, just a mountain of "recommended for you" garbage.

Thank you! For now it's cool, though the use of "they" for Reika was really weird. Usually most authors use "it" in those situations.

Gotcha. Huh. Sounds like they just aren't doing much with that feature, then.

#+begin_quote
  Thank you! For now it's cool, though the use of "they" for Reika was really weird. Mais bon, English doesn't have gender neutral pronouns so you have to work with what you have.
#+end_quote

Interestingly, singular they has been around for a long time. It's been used more or less constantly for centuries for situations where a gender is unknown, ("I couldn't read their writing").

Meriam Webster has some info on that [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they][here]], if you're interested.

With Reika, "they" is used until Keras figures out which pronouns are appropriate to use, although I do have some strictly agender and non-binary characters that use "they" pronouns consistently in other books.

** You said that it's a prequel to /Arcane Ascension/, so I assumed that it's just the one story set before the main series. But on Amazon the title is followed by (/Weapon and Wielders/ */Book 1/*). How many books are you planning to have in this series and in /Arcane Ascension/?

Also, I'm curious about why you have decided to have your books on Kindle Unlimited?

EDIT: Actually, how many books are planned for /The War of Broken Mirrors/ as well? And are you planning on making any more series set in this world?

This will be a series, but I don't have a set number yet. At least one more, possibly several.

Arcane Ascension is planned for six to seven books, but that may change.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It's both good for readers and extremely good for me, in my experience. Kindle Unlimited reads account for a huge number of my total "sales".

#+begin_quote
  EDIT: Actually, how many books are planned for The War of Broken Mirrors as well?
#+end_quote

That one is only three books in the series proper, but it will potentially spin off into other stuff.

#+begin_quote
  And are you planning on making any more series set in this world?
#+end_quote

Yes.

*** I'm trying to get this recorded sooner, but it still really comes down to when my publisher can arrange for the narrator to record it. If believe they may already have a recording time booked for this one, but I don't know the exact details.

**** Awesome that you have that; authors don't typically have that as much as they should, imo. It's been quite awhile, though, since I read book 1. If we were chatting when book 2 first came out, then fine, but right now? A reread is probably a better idea.

In any case, I'm sure I'll enjoy the reread!

** What amazing timing... I just finished reading books 1 and 2 a few days ago, and was looking for something new.

I've really enjoyed the world you've built. Characters are great, and the quippy dialogue works really well. I really enjoy the magic system, even if it's a bit convoluted, and would love to see more about what's happening to the other characters outside of the dungeons (eg, Jin basically didn't exist between the end of book 1 and the test in book 2, which I get is part of his attunement, but seems to happen to other plot elements too.. like what happened to his enchantments teacher teaching him how to use his magic sword?). Overall, pretty hard to put these books down once you start reading.

Now to change some work mana into payment mana and channel it from my left hip into the clicking attunement on my right hand

*** Great timing, then! I hope you end up enjoying this one.

I've absolutely considered writing about what other characters are up to when Corin isn't watching them at some point. There's a lot going on off-screen, some of which is implied, like Corin hearing the tail end of a conversation between Sera and Keras, or Derek going out at night a lot without telling anyone where, or what happened in Sera's judgment, etc. Corin will eventually find out about /some/ of that stuff, but some of it may end up being better explored through other mediums.

** Totally new reader giving it a go: thanks for the chronology and Series information at the start! That makes it a lot more inviting to new readers, and tells them where to go once they've finished the book.

It's certainly a lot better than having to hunt through chronological order vs reading order lists online

** First time I hear of the series, and as a big fan of LitRPGs (and Sufficiently Analyzed Magic as a trope) it sounds fantastic!

Sadly have little time for direct reading these days, so I wonder will the first series become an Audio Book (audible or otherwise) at any time time soon?

It kind of felt too short, though, both because I finished it in barely a day and because it felt like not so much has happened. I'm way too used to million+ words webserials haha

Thank you, and let us know when the next book is released, since Amazon clearly won't!
