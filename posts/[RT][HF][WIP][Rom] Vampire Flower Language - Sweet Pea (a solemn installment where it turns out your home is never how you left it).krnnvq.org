** A lot of character development, and we introduce a new vampire character: Erlis, the duke of Columbus.

Erlis has some interesting beliefs and motivations, which you see hints of here.

We're on the home stretch: two chapters left, MAYBE three if we end up with a lot of content and a natural break point. We're struggling to write fast enough to keep pace.
