**** It may seem like the story is abandonded, but Thinker6 has a habit of updating every couple of months, while he's not writing another story( The Number Girl is really worth the recommendation here). I'd put the probability of this fic updating this year at 80% at least.

** I wouldn't call them so much more rational than they are in canon, but born into places where their natural abilities, reactions, and habits serve them better. In canon, Taylor was really good at winning over allies, but the approaching end of the world prevents her from making the most of this. Likewise, Jack Slash is extremely persuasive, lucky, and determined, but wastes his talents on a managing a small band of murder hobos.

**** It's a term from table-top gaming. Many groups in games like Dungeons and Dragons devolve down to a wandering band of adventurers killing everything they come across in their fervent search for more loot/magical items/lulz. So, they're homeless and wander. Like hobos. And all they do is murder everything that looks like it's worth more than 2 gold. So they're murderhobos.

In Worm, the Slaughterhouse 9 are a band of nomadic, omnicidal psychopaths, so the term gets used on them too.

I love this fic, espeically compared to other Worm Fanfics, but I have issues with some stuff in this work. Mostly:

1. The Leviathan fight's over-the-top Endbringer escalation, especially the bypassing of the Manton effect and the ridiculous ending of that fight.

2. Weaver is too successful in recruting parahumans for her organization. Parahumans are notoriously terrible at working in big groups-- unless she has enormous help from Cauldron or a couple of strong/subtle/wide Master powers helping to keep Parahuman neuroses at bay, she shouldn't be so successful in her society.

*** It doesn't look so much as she has the help of cauldron, but more that she's subverted it wholesale. We see a few people who end up high in the cauldron hierarchy in the normal timeline, as integral parts of the Society's power structure.

It's also the only polity that actually mixes and matches the mix and match superpowers for best effect.

**** When I saw she has help from Cauldron I mean:

1. Given that natural!trigger Parahumans in canon don't work well together in large groups
2. Given that the large groups of capes we see in canon are all supported by Cauldron through Cauldron!capes or carefully timed avoidance of accidents through Contessa magic
3. And that Weaver's Society is huge and involves a ton of Parahumans -->Cauldron is either helping a ton or Weaver is using a ton of top-notch, subtle, Master/Stranger powers to keep control of her group.

** I had previously read this one.

I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop... I mean, come on! This is Jack Slash! How is this not going to end badly for everyone?
