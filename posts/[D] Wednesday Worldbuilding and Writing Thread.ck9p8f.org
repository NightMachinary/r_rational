Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** The year is 21XX. Artificial Intelligence and Robotics have advanced tremendously, and almost all menial professions are fully automated. Sometime in the 21st century, the rise of automation caused a worldwide economic collapse as too many blue-collar workers, and those in the service industries, were replaced by machines, and the societies of the developed world became unstable. But the world recovered, not by removing all automation, but by pushing it to its limit -- now, everything is automated, from manufacturing to farming to cooking, all of it overseen by semi-autonomous artificial intelligences that can quickly repair anything that breaks. The developed world has transitioned into a post-scarcity society, with the second and third worlds quickly catching up with the help of automation.

Humanity is now served by machines. The colonization of Venus and Mars is in the early stages, as machines guided by passionate humans and artificial intelligences build early colonies and begin the long processes of terraforming necessary to create an environment for sustainable life. Back on Earth, almost anyone can get a machine to do almost any/thing/ - “build this house”, “cook me this food”, “design this in this way”, etc. But the machines are bereft of any creativity (A true human-like Strong AI is as yet an unsolved problem), leaving humans a niche left to fill.

How is society structured in this new world? How do people find meaning in their lives? What replaced the concept of “work”? How have government structures adapted? Are they still run by humans, and to what extent?

--------------

My idea was that society has broken into a few distinct social classes, based on what people choose to do with their lives:

- The Creator class, people who create art, stories, videos, games, music, etc. that other people can enjoy. Also includes people who ply trades just for the personal fulfillment of doing so, such as cooking or woodworking.

- The Explorer class, people who, assisted by machines, do scientific and cultural research that AI just can't. Of course, machines help where they can, making such research much easier and faster to perform.

- The Consumer class, people who don't contribute actively to society but simply consume the things created by the other classes. There's always more media to consume, after all.

This would then lend itself to a story of class conflict and an exploration of the human psyche and the extent to which humans require stimulation, and how social structure and social interaction have been changed by these new technologies. But I'm having trouble both coming up with ideas, and convincing myself that this is a sufficiently rational exploration of this premise. Would love to get some feedback/thoughts.

Regarding structure, it sounds like you're probably describing a democratic communist technocracy. The state has seized the means of production, guarantees everyone a minimum standard of living, guarantees universal employment, and pushes heavily for all remaining vestiges of "work" to be automated away.

Regarding how people find meaning, that's easy. Progress. Keep systematically automating the most boring and unpleasant tasks that still face humanity and the remaining work will increasingly become just a form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs][self-actualization]].

Regarding "work", that would obviously still be around, but it would no longer be a necessary evil that has to be maintained so that workers can avoid becoming homeless and impoverished. Instead, it would be merely a societal nuisance to be eradicated at every opportunity.

*** Somethings will still be scarce in the world you have created. I would imagine what conflict over those remaining scarce resources might look like. I think the biggest problem might be conflicting usage of the same resources.

For example, someone wants to build a place to live right next to the Yellowstone geysers. They like making rainbow-colored wooden cabins. Many people that visit the Yellowstone geysers do not like seeing this rainbow-colored wooden cabin right next to it. Who gets the resource?

That might feel like an easy one, you think 'well Yellowstone geysers are pretty unique so maybe we just leave that alone'. But what happens when someone wants to enjoy what New York City looked like a few centuries ago and they start ploughing down modern structures and replacing them with old structures just to look nice?

Land and locations will still be scarce and unique. How will they be allocated? Realize that whatever method you pick will likely still create some level of conflict.

--------------

Certain people will be more socially gifted than others. Interacting with them will become more valuable. There are already people in Hollywood that are essentially paid to be socialites. Researching them and what their lives are like might give you an insight into the "Socializer class" within the consumer class. New York City also apparently has a class of people like this, the wealthy highly intelligent wives of the rich men in the city.

--------------

Time will be scarce.

--------------

Effort and work ethic will be scarce. I imagine anyone in your story, even the most dedicated hard workers are going to look lazy in comparison to modern humans. Just as modern humans look pretty lazy compared to people two centuries ago. Farmers typically worked as long as they had daylight, 14 or 15 hour days with one day a week for rest (and only getting that rest day because it was a religious obligation). Nowadays 8 hours a day with two days of rest is the norm.

One reason why work is rarer, is that leisure is cheaper. If you are a worker and you have an option of working 4 extra hours for additional pay, or going home and staring at the clouds, you might choose the extra cash pretty often. If your alternative to working an additional four hours is that you can instead browse the internet (with all the fun shit it has to do) then you might be far less likely to take the additional hours.

As the amount of entertainment expands, and the price of that entertainment goes down, everyone is faced with the same decision of trading off unpleasant work with pleasant leisure activities. Your world is set up in such a way that they don't even how to do /any/ of the unpleasant work bits.

You could theoretically reach a point where almost no one is creating new works of art. Because they can spend their entire lifetime just consuming the art of others. I am currently writing a story in a small subgenre (gamelit). Part of why I am writing is that I run out of new stories to read or run out of good stories to read, and writing kinda scratches that itch. If I was born thirty years later, and there was already a lifetime of content accumulated in this genre, I'm not sure I would have ever bothered to start writing.

I also believe that working hard to get something done is a muscle that people develop. Hard work and a good work ethic is a habit that one has to practice. Playing sports or doing chores as a kid is a good way to develop that habit early. If robots are doing all physical chores then fewer people are going to develop that habit when they are young. They'll be more likely to be consumers when they get older.

The people that work hard will be an aberration. They might even be treated as if they have a mental disorder. If hard workers become a tiny minority (less than 1% of the population) then it is increasingly likely that what separated them from everyone else is an actual mental disorder. Artists in today's world are already comprised of a bunch of mentally heterogeneous people.

--------------

I think the challenge of writing a post scarcity story will be to make the conflicts seem interesting and meaningful. If two angels are having a competition in heaven, it doesn't really matter who wins. The worst that happens to the loser is that he is in paradise after losing a meaningless contest.

*** I could see there being conflict over going fully for colonizing other planets and using every possible resource to its fullest vs conservationists/environmentalists who want to preserve resources not because they need to be (because that's probably not an issue now) but because the alternative is humanity eradicating everything that doesn't serve it enough.

Also, AI probably could generate entertaining media at that point, given that AI can write almost coherent text now via GPT-2. It would lack creativity, but it would probably be just as good as like a second rate sitcom.

Maybe think more about the transitionary point to try and develop the culture? Like, if AI was good enough to automate away 90% of work tomorrow, how would the world change? It probably wouldn't be as utopia-like to begin with.

I ask because it, too, takes place in a post-scarcity society with massive automation but no creative AIs.

** So a perennial problem I have with writing a story is starting them. Specifically, writing a hook to instantly grab a reader and make them want to read more. The problem is, I can't currently tell whether a hook is good or bad without posting the story, and I'm hesitant to post stories if I don't know people will fall for my hooks (because I tend to quickly abandon stories that don't get attention, and then feel like shit for disappointing the few interested readers I did have.)

So can anyone give me advice on hook-writing technique? I've included a few sample hooks I recently wrote. I'm not looking for specific feedback on a hook-by-hook basis, so much as I need more general advice. It would also be useful to know which hooks work and which hooks don't. (And of course, I can do the same approve/disapprove thing for anyone who needs it, so just reply to me with your own story snippets.)

*** From most to least effective: 2 3 4 1 5 (in my opinion). #5's first sentence seemed too long, so splitting it into a few shorter sentences is worth considering.

To be honest, I probably don't worry about hooks as much as I should. Even so: starting to write can be a sticking point, so if I were you I'd just not worry about the hook at all until after you've written the story. I've had luck looking for the first 'interesting' part of my story and cutting or moving everything that I wrote before it.

An example from yesterday:

#+begin_quote
  “Hello, Inquisitor,” she said. “Are you here to grant them permission to burn me?”
#+end_quote

That's much better than my original:

#+begin_quote
  The first thing he had noticed about her was her controlled expression.

*** I don't have anything better than item-by-item reviews. But my ranking: 5, 1, 4, 2, 3.

5 immediately sets up a conflict, teases at a setting, and places the PoV character in that setting's conflict. It's short, to the point, and grabs my attention. (I'd called => I called)

1: "like the final tumbler in a lock" I think is an odd turn of phrase and is a little jarring, but again... setting, conflict, introduction. Short and gets me interested in reading what follows.

4 could work well with some changes; I'm really not a fan of present tense, and overall it seems to indicate a genre I wouldn't have much interest in. Just my personal opinion.

My main gripe on 2 is the technical quality of the writing. The repetition of "the king" and use of "reached up" is ick and turns me off from reading further. Here's my take on improving it (which would put it #1 on my list, but I'm not biased or anything):

“How many men were sacrificed to make these?” The king weighed the cloth pouch in one hand.

Maria sighed. “None, my lord. It is simply a variety of bread mold.”

He clasped her shoulder with his free hand. “Maria. My hands are already covered in blood. You do not need to preserve my conscience, although I appreciate the gesture. How many men were sacrificed?”

3... I look at the wordy paragraphs and already it's a chore to skim the first one. I see some purple sentences, and you've already lost me.

*** I recommend checking out [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGOodOMBYVk][Brandon Sanderson's lecture on description and viewpoint from Jordancon 2010]], which he specifically describes as being about writing the first page in a way that will get the attention of an editor (or reader).

Some salient points from the first several minutes as he lays out a few general principles:

- "Page 1 is about two things, when it comes to science fiction and fantasy. Number one, being able to describe and worldbuild in a way that does not infodump and bore the reader, and number two, about being able to do viewpoint and voice in a way that is engaging and evocative without boring the reader."
- A good opening sentence isn't just good "in a vacuum," it should lead into whatever the rest of the opening scene is going to be. (Bearing that in mind, it may be hard for people to offer critiques of your work without more context.) A zinger of an opening that doesn't tie into the rest of the opening scene often feels like a non-sequitor and can actually be counter-productive, as it sets up expectations that you're not going to meet: "Creative writing classes talk about the need to hook the reader, and writers have an exaggerated sense of what they have to do to hook the reader. ... I see this in new writers' writing sometimes. They obsess so much about that opening sentence, so much that you end up reading twenty stories by new writers that all have to begin with something like, 'The world exploded that day,' and then the rest of the chapter has nothing to do with that. ... You do want to capture the reader's interest in your first line or first paragraph. But capturing readers' interest is different from saying something that absolutely has to be a zinger. If you've read my book Elantris, I have zingers at the beginning of the first three chapters, and I think they may actually be too much. ... Maybe that zinger is drawing way too much attention to itself." (The opening line of Elantris reads: "Prince Raoden of Arelon awoke early that morning, completely unaware that he had been damned for all eternity.")
- Introduce conflict as quickly as possible: "You do not have to introduce the main conflict of the book in this opening scene, but you do want to introduce /a/ conflict where something is going wrong. A struggle will immediately start to build sympathy for a character. And you want to do this with as little backstory as is necessary."
- "You want to start with motion or conflict. You want to start with something going wrong. Note that when we say 'motion or conflict,' we do not necessarily mean a fight. ... A fight is often a bad hook." Conflicts are only as interesting as the people that they happen to, which is why opening on action can sometimes be a poor hook. Simply describing a series of punches and kicks can be boring if we haven't yet given a reason to care about the characters.

Bearing all of that in mind:

#+begin_quote
  I was king.
#+end_quote

This strikes me as a bad opening sentence. It is a statement describing the state of the world, rather than describing an event. You can tell this, because the verb in this sense is "was." Try to avoid any form of "to be," because it means that you're just stating static facts, rather than describing things in motion.

To comment more on this selection:

#+begin_quote
  The king reached up to clasp her shoulder. “My hands are already covered in blood. You do not need to preserve my conscience, although I appreciate the gesture. How many men were sacrificed?”
#+end_quote

Later in the lecture (I think around the 30 minute mark), Sanderson gets into a discussion of what he describes as "the pyramid of abstraction." In the pyramid of abstraction, abstract items are at the top (least abundant), and concrete items are at the bottom (most abundant, laying the foundation). In fantasy, we get to spend time soliloquizing about honor, and justice, and sacrifice, but we have to /earn/ those moments, largely by laying the foundation with lots of concrete description. This, to me, feels like an un-earned soliloquy, or something resembling it. It's the kind of thing that is only as interesting as the man saying it, and I have no idea who this man is. Rather than hearing his speech about the nature of sacrifice, I might like to read something about how he just learned about the deaths of several men, and how this fact hit him like a punch to the gut. I'd like to follow along as he tries not to let the pain show on his face, even as he feels his stomach clench. Perhaps then you might follow with a bit of context about how this bad news was unexpected (because the mission had gone sideways), or completely expected (because the king had knowingly sent them off to perform a dangerous mission).

I think that you describe a lot of actions that don't really have meaning. For example:

#+begin_quote
  The king reached up to clasp her shoulder.
#+end_quote

This just describes a physical action taking place. This is how an impartial observer who knows nothing about the intent of the characters might describe the scene. The viewpoint is, presumably, /not/ that of an impartial observer; in fact we are getting things from the perspective of a character who /does/ know the intent behind the action (if this is a third-person limited POV from the king's perspective), and so we could get that additional insight. Is he placing a hand on her shoulder to comfort her? I assume that's the case. If he placed a hand on her shoulder to comfort her, the physical placement of hand on shoulder is the /least/ interesting part of the act; as a reader, my attention would be more on the fact that he was trying to offer her comfort, and yet here I'm reading about the physical actions of the characters and not their emotional state.

Even after reading the entire opening, I'm unsure of what the king's emotional state really is. Is he a cold, calculating, pragmatic bastard, plainly stating that he's aware of the blood that's been spilled in his name, and unfazed by the fact that blood continues to be spilled? Or is he saying it with a sense of sorrowful remorse, a man deeply regretting the lives that have been lost, and wondering if he's beyond salvation? The king's feelings are probably the most important part of this scene. If this is a third-person limited POV from the king's perspective, the "narrator" should have perfectly accurate insight into the king's emotional state. It would be nice to see that reflected on the page. Oh, and I'm not even sure if the king is the POV character. If it's actually Maria who is the POV character, I'd like to know about /her/ emotional state. If the king's mood is supposed to be inscrutable to our viewpoint character, how does the viewpoint character feel about that?
