** How's the translation? I remember trying to read it when it just got released on shitdian and even though grammar and spelling were pitch perfect the translation itself was garbage - some sentences made no sense. So I decided to skip. Has situation changed, improved? Also I highly rec same author's other work - Throne of Magical Arcana.

** I wanted to start reading it, but with the whole censorship debacle, I held off for now. I just couldn't figure out if the censored parts will be translated or not.

**** I read about it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/criqup/chinese_government_censors_lord_of_the_mysteries/][here]]. Short version: Chinese goverment outright deleted a part of a chapter without telling the author. The part seemed to be crucial in understanding the later chapters.

**** Quotes from the translator [[https://www.webnovel.com/profile/1657837878]]

#+begin_quote
  There is a crackdown in China on "undesirable content." That definition is vague, which makes platforms like Qidian unable to know what actually constitutes as undesirable by the government. There are guidelines, but it's not sufficient to cover all possible ideas so many authors come up with. So to protect itself and the author from being rounded up by the police, it uses an automated bot to flag and censor sensitive terms, in this case some mention of a sacrifice. Just 3.5 lines or so.

  The point about the author not being able to carry on is that there's a risk of the government banning the book because of the occult elements.

  Personally think it's a not a big deal for translations in terms of the censorship. But it might be bad if his book gets banned in China.

  #+begin_quote
    Can we get uncensored chapters from author for translation?
  #+end_quote

  I already use the uncensored versions.

  #+begin_quote
    What would happen if his novel can't continue in china, would the translation also stop due to that?
  #+end_quote

  The translation will continue to the last chapter previously released in China.

** I'm trying to read it on boxnovel right now (only on chapter 4 so far), is there a better translation out there or does the translation get better? So far it's been pretty painful trying to ignore all the bizarrely structured sentences and weird word choices.

edit: every time I read something like this where I'm already making mental fixes to the text as I go, I find myself wishing there was some program or website that allowed me to edit the story as I go and submit it as an alternate translation or something. Does anything like this exist or would it require permission from the author?

*** I haven't used them but there are several annotation extensions that let you basically mark up the document and share it with people. I've only seen them used academically but you could use them for this if the author is willing to read your notes.

The most popular example I know of is: "Hypothesis -- Web & PDF Annotation"

I wish these were more widely used, it would save time, trees, and the frustration of translating professors handwriting.
