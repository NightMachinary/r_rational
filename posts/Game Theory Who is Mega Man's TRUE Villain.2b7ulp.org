** "The entire series presents a great battle between two scientists, the builder of free robots, and the conquering creator of killing machines. And when you are the robot, it makes sense: Wily is out conquer, and he must be stopped. But when you think about it, who is the real mad scientist: The one who built tools to achieve his goals, or the one who built increasingly powerful thinking machines and then released them into the world, to do what they might?"

** IN WHICH Dr. Light is the /real/ villain, because he created Proto Man, Rock, and Roll with human-style free will and independent decision-making, thus failing at machine ethics forever.

*** Depends on how you define machine ethics. If all that matters is human intelligence, sure. If you're willing to expand your empathic sphere to include all sophonts, what's so bad about Proto, Rock, and Roll that they can't be considered another species of intelligent life?

It's not like they're free-from-the-box self-improving AI, They're limited to a single brain, even if it's artificial it's still similarly solid-state, does Roll ever go out, graft another lobe in, and start the upward spiral?

Heck, in another version of the timeline, they could have been the result of the scientists learning how the brain develops, and ran a cell-resolution simulation of the process until consciousness formed, to better understand the risks of using artificial neuron transplants as a stepping stone to a slow upload. In that scenario, how could you ethically /not/ give them agency?

**** Good point. A good counterpoint to the idea that self aware automatons with agency being bad, is the much overused, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar][robot revolution]] where robots, justifiably, as self aware beings with agency, overthrow their biological overlords.

<sarcasm> /After all people aren't that special, we're just badly optimized neural network code running on meat./ </sarcasm>

** Most of the Game Theory videos belong on this page, like the one where he figures out the velocity of the moon in Majora's Mask.
