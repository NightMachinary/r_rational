*** One of the /really/ weird things here, which I don't see covered in the paper up to where I am, is that on the one hand, cognition is inherently probabilistic, but on the other hand, admitting a probabilistic foundation for mathematics does /funny things/, like refuting the Continuum Hypothesis by ordering between naturals < measurable reals < reals.

** Great resource! Reminds me a lot of these two sequences:

This type of thing has always bothered me about philosophy, and maybe I just haven't been exposed to the right philosophers, but many of the questions that are asked don't seem to fundamentally mean anything. Whether one answers 'do numbers really exist?' in the affirmative or in the negative, I don't expect the answer to tell me anything new about the nature of reality.

*** Well, philosophers tend to think in terms of words, sentences, and some mathematical logic rather than maps, territories, and statistics. If they tried the latter, they could get a lot better. I'll pass you an example link later.

  Instead, categorization and conceptualization may work based on the similarity to stored examples, as in prototype theory (using a single stored example) or exemplar theory (using many) (for an overview see [24]).
