In my upcoming science!avatar fic, in which the Avatar-verse actually integrates bending with the level of technology shown in-universe, I /had/ made it so Waterbenders bent H2O, Earthbenders bent SiO2 (sand is SiO2, metal has SiO2 impurities, and those green crystals are probably quartz), Airbenders bent N2, and Firebenders bend electrons. Yes, I had planned to munchkin that to the /fullest/ extent, don't worry.

I want the universe to have laws (at least laws which are known to me, if not the reader). LoK just showed Earthbenders bending mercury. Is there any sensible rule by which platinum isn't bendable, but mercury and SiO2 (or some other compound present in both earth, sand, and green crystals) both are bendable?

This is pretty much the worst thing since "how the hell do you get something that looks approximately like fire without involving hydrocarbons or reducing agents" that I've faced in writing this. Please help me come up with a law, or I just might have to pretend this episode never happened!

Edit: Or I suppose you could also think of some earth-bendable substance that this poison might have been /other/ than mercury.


** It's one of those things that I'm not sure you're going to be able to make work. It's clearly mercury, not just in form, but in the symptoms (though the volume was a little extreme). The platinum thing is also troubling, since you should be able to form unmetalbendable bonds out of any metal that's had the impurities refined out of it. So it's going to be difficult to be truly coherent if you want to involve actual physics instead of just having more vague rules in place (like the show does).

On the other hand, this episode was some really great story-telling, and I think returned this show to the heights it hit during the original series. So I don't think it would be good to uncanonize it for your fic.

*** The current point-of-divergence is shortly after Aang defeats the Fire Lord and the events of The Search, of which the episode is downstream anyhow - though I'll certainly be using the characters and borrowing some plotlines.

The inconsistencies with the mercury really do bother me. They went through /so much trouble/ to clarify how metalbending wasn't really bending metal but manipulation of bits of earth stuck in the metal, despite how it would be really easy to just handwave and say that metal actually is Earth...in fact, up until today I was fairly certain that the writers had actually intended Earth to be SiO2 all along. But then, after /all that/, they just go ahead and let characters bend something which is all metallic down to the atomic level straight through Korra's bodily tissues in a manner that is completely impossible to explain via impurities, in total violation of everything set up prior. (And how do they even figure out that it's a metal poison in the first place?)

That aside, I totally agree about this episode being amazing, both in story-telling and in execution.

**** I'm not sure how canon it is, but I always thought that "sensing the impurities in the metal" was sort of metalbending with training wheels, and the true form involved actually bending the metal itself instead of the impurities. This is somewhat backed up by the show and the comics.

Of course, in the show, their physics work differently, and I think the world is best understood as actually being composed of spirits and the four elements rather than trying to go reductionist - but that is probably not the story you're trying to tell.

***** Well, I think you're probably right because of the mercury bit, unless that was just oversight. However, I had the feeling that back when they were writing TLA they intended to stay with the impurities thing being necessary, especially because of platinum being unbendable.

It doesn't need to be reductionist, but it /does/ need to operate based on logical rules. (The distinction being, a logical but non-reductionist universe might have complex laws. "Conscious beings can bend elements to their will in X, Y, Z ways" is a law implicitly containing a lot of complexity, but it's still essentially logical").

Bending and spirits aside, their physics seems /mostly/ the same. They've got stuff like mercury and nitroglycerin and it seems to work the same way as it does in our world. I think the best way to model it is our world, but with an overlapping spirit realm from which stem /additional/ laws.

**** If you didn't like season three, I doubt I'll change your mind, but here's what I liked about it:

- They removed all the relationship stuff that wasn't working.
- They added in character development for Bolin that I think was handed really well, culminating in the final episode.
- They created some really compelling villains (who also weren't wholly unsympathetic).
- They expanded the bending powers in ways that were logical and long-theorized.
- They put some new twists on old locations and somewhat returned to the adventure format of the previous series.
- The fight choreography was stunningly well done - it's always been a high point of the series, but I think in this season it was taken to another level. You could compare and contrast the airbending styles of Tenzin and Zaheer to see their philosophies in action.
- The finale specifically had so many cool "oh shit" moments - cool deaths, cool bending.

I'm not going to pretend it was perfect, but the original series wasn't either. The first two seasons were marred by large issues that I felt the third was almost entirely devoid of.

  the liquid fully disappears, leaving the skin visually intact but causing Korra to gasp in pain

  Jinora witnesses this in astral projection form

  Korra experiences hallucinations, is forced into the Avatar State (natural defense mechanism of Avatars; power and skills increase, but Avatar becomes more animalistic and focussed on survival. Can apparently purge poison with focus)

  Fight breaks out, Korra escapes. Korra experiences physical weakness, finally collapses because the fight means she can't focus.

  Jinora calls a metalbender to remove the poison, saying the poison is metallic.

  metalbender moves hands, the visually same liquid as before comes out of korra's mouth)

  two weeks later, Korra is still confined to a wheelchair. Doesn't seem to move extremities, but it could be explained by the inherent simplicity of animation.

Notably, waterbenders who have well-established healing powers (put water, preferably "pure", over an injury (indeterminate red sore spots, because kid's show). Focus. The water starts to glow and make a noise.

I know you said you haven't seen it, but people who presumably have seen it are up-voting so I'll briefly explain why it's ruled out: The Avatar was poisoned by the substance when the bad guys infused it through her skin, after which the Earthbenders drew the substance directly out of her tissues. Her tissues would have acted as a sieve. SiO2 isn't toxic. If what was drawn out was SiO2, the toxin remains behind. We /could/ have the unnamed substance which looks awfully similar to mercury be a poisonous compound bound to SiO2, but then we'd have to say that SiO2 can permeate tissue, which it really can't.

** Why not go the simple route: it's states, dependent on a combination of the bonding energy or density of a substance at the molecular level, that determine what can be bent by a given style of bending.

What "can't be bent" is based on mental blocks society has taught, or some strange quirk.

Don't hand-wave it but find/make some good or suedo-physics that can be used in your head to explain why these substances are easiest to generate a macro scale quantum effect that is "bending" first sudo-science that comes to mind is that the a fractal pattern the brain/effect can map to and influence, (it helps as it means the brain isn't affecting molecules individually it's affecting a pattern it somehow corresponds with) and a bender's versatility is based on the level of variation they can apply the pattern.

*tldr* Make it work for you, Ang is the way the physics says benders should be, because physical forces work on ally elements just to lesser and greater effects, benders can only do one style, because they have trained into it and you have to train to get brains to impose a quantum effect.

It actually does happen. Firebenders can manipulate the heat within the lava, cooling and heating it. When they cool it, the heat appears to go out through their other hand, as if conducted through them.

They haven't been shown controlling its movement, despite frequently being in situations where that would be useful. Earth benders can bend the lava itself.

In the sequel, which (i think) has been slightly more liberal with the extent to which they add additional fantasy elements in the middle of the plot, two earthbenders so far can heat earth into lava. Visually, it looks as though they're doing this by twisting it around until the friction gets it really hot, though that's open to interpretation.

Nothing so far with waterbenders and lava, but both waterbenders and earthbenders can work with mud.

In general, Avatar is actually fairly "rational" to begin with as far as kids shows go. They do generally explore the limits of the alterations made to the universe, and most of the little exploits you'd immediately think of do eventually happen.

Most would be good at the basic particles you listed at the beginning, but others can branch out in their range to specialize in mercury and similar particles if they practice with them enough. The basic particles are easiest to learn to bend, and some are harder than others so only masters do, which would explain why some people don't know about it.

** I'm going to go rain on the parade a little and question the basic premise of trying to combine bending with modern chemistry in general. It feels a bit like a fake answer, to explain bending with 'it's because they can manipulate SiO2!', because that just shunts the issue from 'how can they manipulate dirt?' to 'how can they manipulate Silicon Dioxide?'. No real analysis is really given, it's pretty much the exact same equivalent of dropping 'because god' as the final answer to a question.

This is a world where spirits exist and a spirit world exists somehow parallel to our own, which was somehow split apart from the real world at some point in the setting's past. I don't think it'd be too strange to postulate an alternate underlying set of physics that doesn't utilize our concepts of electrons and atoms and whatnot. Can't there be some sort of physics that involves spiritually-essential fundamental particles, like fundamental Water particles, or fundamental Earth particles, in the setting? It's not like elements are fundamentally complicated like minds are, they can still have particular properties that match their equivalents in the real world without having the same reasons for reacting the way they do as they do in the real world.

From that standpoint, it's not hard to see why the metal would also be controllable by waterbenders. The liquid metal and water share the property of being liquid at room temperature and pressure, and I don't think it'd be all that irrational to worldbuild your story such that these properties are associated with a fundamental spiritual essence of water.

This is all just a suggestion, of course. If you're going to work with explaining magic, though, explaining it by saying 'well it's because chemistry' doesn't always make for the most interesting or even realistic process. Modern knowledge of chemistry is merely the RESULT of the application of the scientific method to /our/ universe. The application of the scientific method to a different universe's physics may well yield- and ought to yield, in my opinion- completely different underlying mechanics of How Things Work.

No, you're right, it wouldn't be strange. But I cannot write the rules of that physics from the ground up, whereas I /can/ borrow the rules of our current physics.

You could make a really fun "soft" fiction with completely different rules, but the only way to make a "hard" fiction with an entirely new physics is to really write the physics and think through all the implications beforehand. The scientific method is a bit weird in a "soft" fiction because you're making up the physics on-the-fly and it's really tempting to just have the results be whatever is convenient for the plot.

In my opinion, one of the things that make "hard" sci fi and fantasy fun to read and write is that you aren't allowed the flexibility to introduce plot elements willy nilly, because you have to have a fairly well defined world /before/ you create a plot.

If you have control over electrons, you strip the electrons from the bonds in CO2 in the air so you get elemental carbon (and possibly molecular oxygen, possibly single atoms of oxygen) this would then naturally react with oxygen in the air in the same way that burning coal would. You can even handwave the "needing a source of flame"-bit as requiring some way to heat up the carbon to get it to react (carefully ignoring the fact that single atoms will react instantly while larger lumps of carbon generally dont).

As for needing heat, the heat is supplied by the recombination of the atoms, this is exactly what makes normal fire hot. And you can create even more heat simply by moving the electrons around a lot (lightning is apparently around 30,000K).

If you have control over electrons you have control over everything we can control with technology except nuclear (powerplants|bombs|radiation|etc.). All of our technology is based on the electromagnetic force=moving electrons around (bar nuclear*), so anything we can do with technology from creating fire to sending information to space and back you can do by controlling electrons. And I think the author knows this by the "munchkin that to the fullest extent" comment.

**** I feel like we're basically saying the same thing. Fire is a slightly ionized gas that is fairly hot, but it isnt a full explanation if you just say "firebenders control electrons", as you actually need to give a reason as to how the fire is created. Also, co2 isnt at a very large concentration in our atmosphere, which is why I said that n2 or o2 ion control would work a little more, and even if you could separate out the carbon from co2, it wouldnt recombine unlese heated sufficiently. However, if you could separate nitrogen from itself, it woulf react extremely violently and produce a gas hot enough to look like fire.

The reason I said that firebenders should control nitrogen and oxygen ions as opposed to electrons comes down to balance. Not balance in the sense of "I dont want firebenders to be more powerful" but more like "I dont want firebenders to be gods amongst insects compared to the other benders". If you control electrons, you are basically a matter manipulator, as most of the characteristics of matter come from how electrons interact. A master "firebender" would rearrange matter with a thought, dissolve any possible enemy at a molecular level, have energy weapons on the level of nuclear weapons, be able to make new types of matter with almost any desired property, and many more. Compared to airbenders who could maybe make a tornado or strong blasts of wind, or any other benders that would only be slightly different.

This is why firebenders should only be allowed to make ions from molecules in the air, as it would basically allow what is seen in the show with maybe a few extra powers, and doesnt completely break the world once firebenders realize how their power works.

***** Yeah, I was going to attempt to get around that by limiting the level of control they have over said electrons.

N2-O2 splitting may work better. I'd have to think about how it would work, if it would actually look like fire, if it could make lightening, and so on.

I'm not sure there are any elegant answers here. Would it be weird if fire-benders can just generate heat, light, and electricity at will?

****** You could also have them able to produce plasma, which works decently and is simpler than some other answers, even if it isnt as reductionist.

Splitting n2 would yield a huge amount of heat when it recombines, as the n2 triple bond is one of the strongest in nature. Then if they could control the ions after splitting them, maybe you could make a charge gradient to produce electricity, I think. Electricity isnt my strong suit.

I think any of these answer is preferable to having firebenders be severely restricted matter manipulators compared to the other benders who control a few molecules or elements at most. It would be really hard to have a plot when a strong firebender can rip your molecules apart, shoot you with lasers, make impossible materials, and electrocute you.

******* Firebenders can /already/ shoot you with lasers, rip molecules apart, and electrocute you, in canon.

The implication that [[#s][spoiler]] is a rather major plot point. It doesn't even matter how firebending works exactly - the fact that they can /somehow/ control lightening in canon means it's possible to do to at least some extent no matter how it works precisely. [[#s][spoiler]]

But you're right, I don't intend to make it possible for firebenders to make impossible materials, manipulate all matter in general, or mess with the nucleus at all. All they have is a /blunt/ control of electrons - and explicitly /not/ the matter that the electrons are attached to. And for that, it doesn't relaly matter if they bend electrons directly, or control charges through some sort of proxy like splitting a specific molecule or something.

******** They can destroy molecules with fire, but they cant look at you and have you explode a la Watchmen, and they dont have lasers at all. But yeah, they do have electricity. I think the chemistry approach is really good, as it allows a wide range of possibilities, but isnt inherently op. Maybe they have ion control and also very precise control over heat? This allows some creative stuff that isnt electron control. Idk, maybe ion control alone is good enough.

***** I understand now. Also you are right about the concentration, which I hadn't considered. In order to get a stoichiometric Carbon flame you'd need to increase the concentration significantly. Even a candle is 96-97% efficient, so with .04% CO2 in the atmosphere compared to 21% O2 you're going to have a bad time.

Actually, if you can split the CO2 fast enough, then you simply break it and recombine it over and over again - you need to concentrate to keep the flame going but it would work I think.

Ha, that's actually /exactly/ the solution I had in mind.

It's especially important that the /carbon/ is ripped out, because the orange-yellow color of flames comes from the carbon spectra.

I still haven't worked out how Azula's doing the color thing, but note that hydrogen flames are blue and have a tactical advantage of being very hard to see, and there is hydrogen in the air, sort of. Or the carbon might just be more excited, I'm pretty sure carbon has a blue band.

***** Umm, normal fire gets its color from black body radiation. Fire is red/orange because it is hot enough to look like that. Blue fire is hotter and the emission spectra peaks in the upper ranges of visible light.

******* You can color flames with additional elements and compounds, but combusting hydrocarbons, which most of our flames are, create a flame that gets its color solely from black body radiation. Thats why you can have mutliple colors from burning the same material, because a more efficient burn yields higher heat and an emission spectra that peaks towards the upper regions of the visible spectrum

** Personally I always imagined that science!waterbenders manipulate hydrogen bonds. That's why they can control water and change its state so easily. I have no idea how firebenders, earthbenders, and airbenders operate.

In the show though bending definetly involves a spiritual component. The air nomads were all airbenders because they were more in tune with their spirituality. Don't know how much of that you'll put into your fix though.

** My advice would be to give up and declare that canonical bending can't really coexist with real world physics. Come up with a basic, uncomplicated alternative system of physics that gels with the idea of bending and arbitrarily justify any inconsistencies this creates.

Aristotlean physics is a pretty good basis. Four elemental atoms and all that. Maybe make spirit the fifth atom.

** I did not read the other comments, but this is my take on Avatar and any RationalFic of it:

I don't think you should have our periodic table. I don't think Oxygen and Nitrogen and Electrons are a thing in that universe. It's a universe with Spirits of Good and Evil, it's a universe where the moon is a spirit, and so is the sea, it's a universe where souls knowably exist, etc.

So I say /roll with it/. Benders don't bend /elements/, they bend the /idea/ of an element. Or rather, earth /is/ in fact a fundamental element, as fundamental as Oxygen or Helium are in our world; same goes for air, fire, and water. That world is one where thoughts and ideas have physical form, are ontologically basic. I think trying to put chemical elements and our science in it will feel... /forced/. Not natural. It's not the point of the story, and it doesn't feel a part of it.

So the reason earth benders can bend this or that and can't bend that or this isn't because they can bend SiO2 or anything. It's because they can bend /earth impurities/, and earth is a fundamental element.

Or something like that. In a world where there is a spirit for /everything/, I'm not entirely certain that the thing and the idea of a thing are different.

To make the rationalist in me sing: write a story where the map /is/ the territory. Where map and territory affect each other mutually and aren't different things even in principle. In our world, the map /isn't/ the territory, and we develop our rationality techniques around that; in a world where it is, what would you have to learn?

** I've done something similar to this in a fiction universe I made for a roleplaying game. However in my universe the Hydrokinetics controlled H2O, the Psammokinetics controlls SiO2, Ventrokinetics controlled N2 and Pyrokinetic controlled O2. This meant that pyrokinetics were actually feeding the flames to control their shape, direction and intensity rather than controlling the flame itself directly. I also had a X-kinetic ability for pretty much any chemical with that super high level of ubiquitousness.
