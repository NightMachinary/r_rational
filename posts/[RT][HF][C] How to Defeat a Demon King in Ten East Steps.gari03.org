This book is my loving and comedic homage to NES games like the original /Zelda/, /Final Fantasy/, and /Dragon Quest/. You've seen a lot of those influences in my previous works, but this one gets more into parody territory. It's a lighthearted LitRPG with a lot of references to those works, as well as some gamier stuff that may feel a little more D&Dish. It plays with a lot of the tropes those stories created, similar to works like /Maoyuu Maou Yuusha/ or /Rokka no Yuusha/.

In terms of rational elements, this is a parody/deconstruction of the Hero and Demon King style of the aforementioned stories, with someone who isn't the Hero attempting to defeat the Demon King. It lampshades the hilariously specific systems that are in place in many games to work to the advantage of the Hero, and you see the protagonist using a number of different exploits in a hard magic system to try to problem solve. It's a comedy, so don't expect to be the world's most extreme case of rational fic, but I think some portion of the sub would enjoy the style of humor.

This is a novella, not a full novel, so don't expect the kind of length of my usual works. It's not in the same universe as my other books, but you don't like my other books, you probably won't like this, either. It's pretty similar in style to the others, just sillier.

** I'm a little confused. You say that it's $7.99 in most regions if I'm not an Original Member, but when I try to buy it, it says that it costs $29.95. Does this mean that for people in Eastern coast of the US, the audible book is meant to be significantly more expensive?

*** That sounds like something went wrong. I've been told that the discount may only apply to the US, but if you're in the US East Coast, it should definitely be applicable. I just e-mailed Audible to ask.

**** /raises eyebrows in shock/

Er.....it seems like my computer has just made a liar out of me? For some reason, it's now showing the appropriate pricing now?

Sorry about that. I should have taken a screenshot when it was over-priced earlier.

** Fun little story! Perfect distraction from work today. Funny, well written, nice trope inversions and good narration too. I like the separate voice for system messages! I'd have paid for it for sure if it wasn't free.

I can definitely recommend it to any Zelda fan, but wouldn't say it's more than rational-adjacent. It also kind of lacked dramatic tension but maybe that's difficult (impossible?) in any parody?

I'd call it rational-adjacent, too. It's definitely not perfectly rational, since most of the other cast members play so heavily to their tropes. They're more like foils to Yui and the Demon King, who are closer to rational actors.

And yeah, I agree, it wasn't really intended to have a lot of dramatic tension, except maybe when the demon king starts destroying the temples. *Six Sacred Swords* is similar, but has just a bit less humor, and that enabled me to have more of a feeling of risk. I wanted this one to be more relaxing and silly than anything else.

** Just finished the audiobooks. I loved it! I only wished it was longer but maybe this can't of story couldn't support that kind of length. Anyway, really good.

*** Glad you liked it!

It was actually /over/ the requested word count from audible - they wanted a novella, not a novel. I may do a full novel in the same style at some point if this one gets enough interest.

*** There will be eventually, but currently there is an exclusivity contract with Audible. So Andrew Rowe is actually not allowed to publish a text version until the contract runs out. I forgot how long it's supposed to be, but it's either 6 months or a year.

I'll probably post about it to here when it's in text form since I follow the author.
