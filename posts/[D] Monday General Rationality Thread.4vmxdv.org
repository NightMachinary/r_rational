Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** So, as of about last week I'm commited to living on a boat. Or at least owning one.

I purchased [[https://docs.google.com/folderview?id=0B_SibNDpnu01R3ZDWDdHT2ZtM0U&usp=gmail][a boat]] for $CAD 400.

A paid $CAD 1000 to get it moved to my grandparents house, out in the middle of nowhere.

At the end of the month, when me lease expires, I'm moving to my grandparents house for however long it takes to get the boat livable.

It should theoretically be able to sail today, but there's a drainage hole in the bottom, so it doesn't fill with rain. Also, I don't know how to sail.

I think that living on a boat is going to become a lot more practical in a little while, thanks to the oneweb satelight constelation. I'd like to have the skills so that I can know what I'm talking about.

Since my previous attempt at taking over a small bit of the world (a 3D file repo, eventually providing services similar to 3Dhubs) failed, I figure it's a good opportunity to get ahead of the curve.

Are there any big social changes you expect, thanks to the oneweb satelite constelation? What industries would it be good to invest in now, under the presumption that oneweb is going to significanty improve them?

**** The big one? Probably difficult housing prices.

I'm not seeing my being able to actually buy a house in the next ~5-ish years. If I moved somewhere with more tech employment and worked 40 hours a week I might be able to do it. Or if I had more persistence, and was willing to work a job with minimal professional development for the next 20 years...

But realistically? No house.

But, I can moor a boat somewhere near downtown pretty much anywhere for a reasonable price. It's something that I own in pretty much every way I can. It's not relying on my neighbors not bringing housing costs down. I don't have to pay an unpredictable amount in taxes to the government.

I'm not putting 40% of my income towards housing...

Since I do a lot of remote work, it seems like it will work pretty well for me.

Us as a society investing heavily in green technology is nice, since a lot of that technology works great at very small scale. It's made this a lot more practical then it was even a few years ago.

A new coat of anti-fouling paint every 3-5years, some fiberglass patches. Occasionally some replacement hardware....

The high-maintence thing looks like a myth to me. But then again, my boat is cored with a slightly better material then most, so a small hole in the outer fiberglass isn't going to spread rot throughout the inside.

Now that could be considered high, if you weren't expecting it. Or you weren't doing the labour yourself. Or you weren't comparing it to rent.

But the maintenance costs seem like they're not even going to even approach 3 grand a year, by my estimates.

Living on a boat really relies on a reliable weather service. There's a decent chance it would survive being in a hurricane, if it was moored well away from anything. It could just flop around in the water. That /probably/ wouldn't be enough to kill it.

But it's much preferable to just move away from the storm. And in that regard, a live-aboard has an advantage.

Really it does require a flexible schedule.

** This is an insight from the recent Origin of Species thread.

I realized a while ago that there was a category of stories that other people tended to dislike that I really really loved. I had noticed that one feature these stories didn't have that other stories did have was the "I'm about to state the plan, and then we fade to black"

I place a >50% confidence on that being this "law of conservation of detail." If someone has a cool plan, I want to hear it described over and over again, even in repetitive detail. I read over the abra plan about five times just because it was so neat, not because I was doing any deeper analysis.

Part of this may be that I (believe I) have a poor mental picture of actions that expand beyond a single instance of time. I can fully picture a single "frame" of action, but when something involves multiple "frames," I can't really picture the whole thing coming together.

As a general rule, plans which are stated will go wrong in critical ways or at crucial moments, so that the protagonists must react quickly and improve... while plans which are left unspoken work flawlessly, and reader enjoyment is in witnessing their brilliance as they happen.

Stories of the latter type are often purposefully elaborate and confusing, with twisty resolutions and layers of deception in order to create dramatic tension... and I can imagine how that would frustrate your mental models.

I usually upvote people who respond to things I write if I think it adds content. I try to do upvotes on basically every submission in this sub that I think is on-topic, too.

Looking back, the only submissions I've /not/ upvoted in the 50 most recent, sorted by hot, are the SENPAI Protocol, the Comeback Kid double post (though I upvoted the original), and that's it.

So yeah, even if people commenting on your stuff get downvoted, you're still pretty visible. Going 50 items back on this sub only goes back 2 weeks; it takes quite some time to get bumped off the front page.

Does it? I think that if they downvoted your OP, it would make a difference, but downvoting each person in the thread at once shouldn't make any real difference.

It might send newer posts to the bottom (because new posts that are downvoted are punished heavily, while older ones are punished less heavily), but I think that's about it.

And that discourages posting within a certain while of the original posting, as that gives the original posters an overall smaller chance of getting to the top of the thread because whomever does the downvoting is more likely to do it to a newer thread (no sense leaving a thread un-downvoted once they spot it.)

Or maybe I'm just post-justifying my desire to optimize my own laziness.

Reddit, like all social media sites, is a type of game. In this case, we try to maximize the little point numbers on top of our comments. It's not the only way to have fun, but why not?

Then we could poll them periodically on their desire to use reddit, while also averaging the posts per day of the three groups. The rub would be that we'd tell half of each group is that the point of the experiment would be to test posting response to karm.

Then we can compare:

- propensity to post more or less often based on karma
- enjoyment of using reddit (as defined by polling)
- z-tests for significance between the groups who were and were not told about the purpose of the test.

My theory would predict fewer posts/less enjoyment for people not recieving positive reinforcement in the form of upvotes, and that the z-tests would fail to show a significant difference.

I mean, I guess it's hard to falsify from a /practical/ standpoint, if that was your meaning, but we could probably run a straw poll or something.

*** Real next-level cynicism about the US legal system actually should address the problems not of people who get trials, but people who don't. As it stands, whether or not you like the exact setup of the jury system, it's largely irrelevant; only 5% of criminal cases go to trial [[https://www.bja.gov/Publications/PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf][(link)]]. The remaining 95% end in a guilty plea / plea bargain, which is when the defendant admits guilt and waives rights to a trial by jury in return for more lenient sentencing.

There are a variety of reasons that this happens. Some of these reasons are:

- The state often only brings cases it's reasonably sure it can win to trial. The defendant, recognizing that a guilty verdict is inevitable, pleas out. Unlike the other reasons on this list, this one isn't really a problem. It's just the defendant making a reasonable decision based on the information available.
- Many defendants lack the education or the knowledgeability to recognize that they have a good chance in court, and plead guilty as a result.
- Many defendants are cowed by the possibility of spending decades in prison, and plead guilty in hopes of getting a reduced sentence that has no chance of lasting that long.
- Many defendants lack good legal representation. Many are too poor to afford private attorneys, and pro bono work doesn't cover the gap. Public defenders are overworked. Many have less than half an hour to spend on each case.
- The state can't afford to give trials to all the criminals it arrests /regardless/. As it is now, even accounting generously for efficiencies of scale, giving trials to 100% of defendants instead of 5% would require 10x more infrastructure, judges, bailiffs, prosecutors, public defenders, and so on.

Effectively, the vast majority of criminals do not get a trial. Some of this is for normal reasons, like the state having caught the right criminal and having a watertight case. Some is for really bad reasons, though. Many who do not get trials would probably have better outcomes if they did have trials, but through a combination of poor circumstance, fear, and lack of education, are coerced into guilty pleas. This kind of problem applies equally to the innocent and the guilty. Happening to be innocent of a crime (or only guilty of a lesser crime) doesn't make you less impoverished, terrified, and poorly represented.

US trials take so long that pleas are something like 98% of results ... I've never been empanelled in all the times I've been summoned .... the defendants see the jury March into the room and the guilty ones plead.

Prosecutors often theaten to.punish defendants who demand a trial by asking for 10x or more time than those who plead out. And such offers are not admissible.

Tl,dr the irrationality of jurors may be a flaw, but it's a very minor flaw in the system. I recommend friedmanns blog and Legal Systems Far Different From our Own manuscript for much interesting reading on the topic of legal system design.
