So you may know that me and [[/u/CopperZirconium]] are working on [[https://thegothicman.wordpress.com/][The Gothic Man]], a fan sequel/quest thingy for Metropolitan Man that follows Bruce Wayne.

Well, CopperZirconium has a ton of work, and they've had to beg off the art side of things (at least for the foreseeable future.) So we're back with no illustrator again.

So! I'm going to keep it running for now. Does anyone think they'd be up for drawing a black-and-white picture of Batman-y stuff, every couple of days or so?
