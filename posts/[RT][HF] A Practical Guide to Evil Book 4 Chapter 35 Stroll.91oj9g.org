*** Same. And the amazing thing is how it's not inconsistent at all how Akua's behavior has changed pre and post-mantling. She still has the same core philosophy and arrogance, but the only difference is that she's now on Catherine's side (pending inevitable betrayal).

  /“We have our exalted,” Akua said. “Triumphant, Traitorous. The Maleficents and the Terribilises/
#+end_quote

Triumphant was the most famous one for conquering all of Calernia (might and ambition), Traitorous is the lethal joke character who betrays and is never betrayed (courtroom intrigue). I can see why they are the "exalted" of all Dread Emperors.

But what are the Maleficents and Terribilises exalted for?

**** Additionally:

Maleficent II ended the secret wars with the Kingdom of the Dead and managed a highly successful military campaign in the Free Cities.

Terribilis I appears to be the Praesi equivalent of Rome's Hadrian, third of the Five Good Emperors. Hadrian first codified imperial law and commissioned the Ars Tactica (seems like Terribilis I wrote it himself).

***** Maleficent II is considered the highest (if you don't count Triumphant, anyway) peak of Praesi influence on Calernia by most Guideverse scholars. At the apex of her reign the Empire ruled most of the League of Free Cities, sunk Ashuran war fleets repeatedly until there was an uneasy detente established and Praes controlled some of the most lucrative trade routes on the continent. It lasted long enough that there's still a bunch of Mtethwa loan-words in tradertalk by the time the series begins.

Terribilis I is the father of most the functional aspects of Praes as a state: codified nation-wide laws, the Imperial court as proxy for the otherwise constant low-key civil wars and Ater itself turning into the largest and most powerful of Praesi cities (it was previously a toss-up between Thalassina and Wolof). His reign wasn't a golden age in the traditional sense, but it was long and stable - which is arguably much rarer, in the Wasteland.

** Cat encountering the Dead King's philosophy and realising that the games played on Creation are just that - Games. Closely followed by her sort of warming up to Akua... she's getting into that mindset. Although this difference in perspective might be quite hard to work with since most of her plans are relatively short term (5-10 years).

** *Stroll*

/noun/

1. A short leisurely walk.
2. A victory or objective that is easily achieved.

Chapter title game's on point, as usual. Now was it a victory by Dead King, who easily got into Cat's head; or by Cat, who'll likely get her joint war effort because he treats the crusade as a game?
