freefall is available [[http://freefall.purrsia.com/][here]] it's in the format of an old-school sunday morning comic strip, and most of it is fluff and one-liners, but there is an overarching plot which is very interesting

the story follows Florence Ambrose, a prototype genetically engineered FAI called a "bowman's wolf" after her creator and appearance.

she finds herself, through the mischief of our other main character (who plays more of a supporting role) Sam Starfall. it's been hinted at that this may end up having the unintended consequence of ending her product line.

she notices the robots on this colony act a little strange, and discovers that [[#s][spoilers]] as well as a mysterious plot revolving around ecosystems unlimited- the company that created her.

overall, it's a good serial that raises some good points, such as [[http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff2600/fc02537.png][even FAI may end up being disastrous]]

[[http://tangent128.name/depot/toys/freefall/freefall-flytable.html][this]] is the best place to start reading- it's the entirety of the story laid out on one page, instead of combing through links


** Seconded. Freefall is one of my top favorite comics of all time.

** Thirded or fourthed. It starts out as a kind of wacky adventures in space comic, but there's this whole complex backstory that keeps getting unrolled bit by bit as the comic progresses.

** I quite enjoy this strip. Thank you. The author clearly is using a lot of humor at the expense of lawyers, politicians, telemerketers and managers, but behind that there seems to be a simple, but fairly thoughtful consideration of alternate intelligences.

It's fun to be able to get a chuckle out of something that is actually serious. It's almost like the author is trying to hide his serious thoughts under lowbrow humor so more people will actually read it. If that's the intent, I'm impressed. It it's accidental, I'm amazed.

** Of course it really shouldn't have escaped your notice seeing as its been on the rational fic TVTropes page for ages. So if it did escape your notice... read the TVTropes page.

** While it doesn't sound wholly disinteresting, I just cannot get into that art style. It's not aggressively incompetent, but it's so painfully bland that I feel like my eyes will turn into mashed potatoes if I try to read it.

** With regard to the comment about FAI ending up disastrously, that has a fairly obvious resolution by turning 'human' into 'sapient'/'sentient.' That was at least the implied objection. I'm not sure what could be wrong with maximizing all sapients' satisfaction.

*** consider: would you destroy, say, yellowstone national park to build a hospital?

whether you would or not (I would, by the way) there's obviously a trade-off, a downside accepted for the superior upside; and in the case of FAI, we don't know exactly what we're trading away.

that is to say, FAI has all the drawbacks of a X maximizer, where X is something we think is really neat and we should have more of. those being: what if we're wrong and what if we end up needing some Y every now and again, too?

** Eh, I really don't like strip comics - the pacing's wrong. Each strip has less time to justify itself individually, leaving less time to serve the overall plot.

*** Plot segments of strips don't need to justify themselves, the plot does it for them. Look at how EGS does it (at least, how they do it now).
