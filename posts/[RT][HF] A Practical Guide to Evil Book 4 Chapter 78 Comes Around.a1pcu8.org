** The Ubua heroic turn is even better then I thought it might be. And, concurrently with that, its a FANTASTIC story. Evil villain that doesn't really believe in good but follows the praxis of it to see if it works, snarking the whole way? I know that the names are grooves worn in creation but I feel like in a world that runs on metaphor, novel arcs have to give you a little more metaphysical juice. So excited to see where this goes.

** Oh shit... we were sent in an entirely wrong direction about the plot!

How could I forget, EE is the master of hiding important things in plain sight all the while redirecting us elsewhere.

All this time we argued about whether Winter would Devour the night or the other way around, but Catherine doesn't work like that! Either way is /bad/ because it's playing /into/ the narrative, /into/ the story.

Cat breaks stories!

And so, we come upon the foreshadowing set up that the sisters are two beings in one body? soul? anyway, there's two of them. And Catherine's now found, perhaps, the "good" sister of the two!

Catherine wants to be mortal again, but she doesn't want to lose all the powers and ties that come with being the Sovereign of Moonless nights. Some of us thought that *Akua* of all people was going to inherit the mantle (seriously?). But now we have another option! Talk with Antonike, find out what she wants, and help her take control of the night. I assume because of her background as a sage, she will have a better time controlling the alienation.

Her request is likely going to be the salvation of her people, which Cat can definitely help with. And so the /real/ sixth ranger enters the Woe, reducing Akua's role, maybe enough that she can try for her redemption and subsequent destruction.

** Love this!

The idea of Akua loving and trying to be better is a fascinating idea and shows that Akua might still be trapped in the stories that Cat cuts through with gusto.

Too bad, it's a great dream. I suspect she is pushing Cat to win so Akua can usurp the mantle that she now has a stronger attachment to.

The option I think would be the most fun is for cat to walk out of here with her new Name finally solidified and two new aspects, Night and Winter, that are less continent-breaking and suitably confusing for her foes. Or even just finally gaining a full Name. Godslayer is starting to seem appropriate.

I think the other sister taking over Night/Winter as a new goddess is better than Sve doing so, but it feels waaay too narratively easy. Like Cat shreds the story to victory, but somehow the "obviously" dark sister who seems nice ends up in power? I think those excited about this idea already forgot the lesson we just learned (again)...our amazing writer is sneaky and tricksy like the hobbitses!

I am filled with tension over these last few chapters. I dearly love Cat and seeing her soul ripped out, ripped open, and then devoured while she watched has me emotional üò≠

****** I think Hierophant is an old and uncommon name. I believe his parents would have been considerably more interested if it were brand new, and more knowledgeable about how tough it would be to keep him prisoner if it were recently used/known.

Adjutant on the other hand seems unknown. Everyone was blown away that he had a name and based on my understanding of his culture in aeons past, it doesnt seem to be a Name they would have had. If I recall correctly, Warlock mentioned that he wanted to study Adjutant as well.

Since Cat breaks stories and narratives like she does, it makes sense to me that Names would be weird around her. Old/New ones appearing and existing names sometimes reacting oddly.

I wonder if reality itself is demanding change. All this stratified good/evil looks like it is heading for Arcadia's fate...stagnation. With reality being the "dynamic" part of the universe, Cat might be a result. Ripping up the things that are too unable to change. Not even Winter, with all it's power, froze her entirely and her influence has clearly affected Akua as well.

  ‚ÄúI need you to do something for me,‚Äù I said.

  She turned to face me completely. In Masego that would have been a notice I had his full attention, but with her I always had that. Even when she pretended otherwise.

  ‚ÄúI had role given in the battle to come,‚Äù Akua said.

  ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut this is more important.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAnd what exactly do you need of me, dearest?‚Äù she asked.

  There were a lot of ways I could have answered her. Some true, others euphemisms or a hundred different shades of flippant. It'd helped me over the years, the quips. Allowed me to make it a joke or a game, anything but a reality so often ugly. But if I was to let the monster off her leash, then she should be given her due.

  ‚ÄúFolly,‚Äù I said.

  Akua Sahelian smiled, and in that smile lay the promise of things great and terrible to behold.
