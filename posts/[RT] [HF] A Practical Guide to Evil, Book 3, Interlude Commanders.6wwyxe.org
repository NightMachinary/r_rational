Sounds like Winter came from the East.

  The hills to the west couldn't be marched through from the other side, as far as the goblins could tell, but that meant fuck all when the opposition had wings.

  “The hills,” Adair murmured.

  There was, Kegan saw, a single person there.

And Ranger is in the hills to the West.

#+begin_quote
  “Just a contact, then nothing,” he agreed, then flinched and turned west.

  The madwoman was still sitting on her perch, the former Matron saw. No, what had drawn her officer's attention was the gate that had just opened in front of the hills.
#+end_quote

And the gate opened between Ranger and Summer.

#+begin_quote
  Three thousand of the finest cavalry Calernia had ever seen ploughed into the western flank of Summer and Ranker began laughing.

It would appear the cavalry is hitting the ~40K that remain after 20K peeled off to deal with Winter.

** Awesome! Ranger is here!

On a slightly more serious note, how do you think powerlevels compare? Cat has 30k forces, Summer is at 60k-ish. Call it 80-90k effective force due to fey being stronger than mortals, and add 5k to Cat's force due to Watch. Knights are another 3k, doubled for awesomeness for 6k effective. Cat is probably 3-4k in her own right especially if she uses her Naming advantages properly, same with Deadhand. Winter is another 20k (more powerful than mortals, but have inherent we-lose-to-summer-in-direct-battle malus, so I think effective number is the same). Ranger is probably another 10k by herself based on the hype. Robber is god knows where, but probably prepares another trap-call it another 2k in power. If Apprentice and Archer join the field (and they are supposed to be reasonably close, I think), that's another 8k. 87k-ish total lead by a marshal of the legions of terror and a Named with the Junior Calamity bonus vs 90-ish total Summer, lead by two people with blatant reasoning biases, before you account for whatever traps Summer might have.

To be quite honest, I think Catherine wins this one easy.

*** I pretty much agree with your assessment. Nauk estimated that the allied armies could beat 30k fae with difficulty. The winter fae drew off 20k. Leaving Cat to deal with 40k summer fae.

3k elite heavy calvary mounting a surprise attack on an unguarded flank is a horror to any commander in the other side. In their initial surprise charge I'd bet they could reduce summer's effective cohesive fighting force by as many as 15k. I doubt they'll be able to actually kill more than 6k in the long term, especially as the summer commanders react and account for their presence. Reducing the amount of soldiers summer is capable of using against Cat too 34k, and perhaps 25-30k for a few crucial minutes.

That's enough to make this a tossup by Nauk's standards.

I'm assuming Ranger's main, and perhaps ONLY role in this battle will be to neutralize the summer princess. Who's an army unto herself. I'm not sure how that'd factor into Nauk's read of the battle, but it's a big deal.

Cat and her allied commanders doubtless have a few other cards up their sleeves, and the force of narrative. Pretty much assuring victory.

*** There's also the narrative causality at play, since this is Arcadia. Cat's flipped the story from a brave retreat under fire to the Battle of Minas Tirith, where disparate allies join together to beat a previously overwhelming unified force.

We've got the besieged defenders. We've got the surprise arrival of a supernatural army of death (Winter/Dunharrow) flooding onto one flank. We've got a force of formerly-exiled cavalry (Callow/Rohirrim) smashing into the other. We'll soon have the equivalent of Legolas swinging under their unbeatable monsters. All we need now is for one of the royals to have an ambiguous prophecy about their invulnerability.

Even Summers' own plan allowed for that, with the last through the breach fighting a desperate but doomed defence to save their commander. Even without Cat doing anything she'd survive. She'd just lose someone dear to her (say...Adjutant).

**** I really doubt it's that severe. If we were talking against a mortal army, I might have agreed, but this is /fey/. For one, their whole army can just decide to fly up to avoid the charge entirely. That'd still cost them something (otherwise, I don't see why they wouldn't be flying all the time), but it's a possibility. Morale damage is likewise basically nonexistant against them. I think charge will be effective, but not /five times multiplier/ effective.

*** "Prince's Graveyard" might be the one were they shot the exiled prince in the throat, which would make the battle of the 4 armies and one the 5 sided training game

For that interpretation the battle of the camps would already have been fought, and i'm not sure which one it would be. Defending marchford or the assault of Liese don't really match.

Alternatively, the current battle is the battle of 4 armies and one. But we have Winter, Alfobi's army, Rankers army, Kegan's army, the knights and summer. That's 6, not 5. Unless we count Kegan, ranker and alfobi's army as one, and there's another ambush upcoming

  When historians try to pin down Foundling's methods they point to the Battle of the Camps or the Princes' Graveyard, but those came later.
#+end_quote

It's pretty clear we haven't seen "Princes' Graveyard" yet. Also the placement of the apostrophe is relevant here(which I messed up in transcribing the quote); "Prince's Graveyard" implies a singular prince while "Princes' Graveyard" implies a graveyard belonging to multiple princes.

#+begin_quote
  4 armies and one
#+end_quote

The definition that I'm following is the four armies are:\\
* Legions of Terror (Alfobi, Cat, and Ranker)\\
* Winter\\
* Summer\\
* "Callowan" (Deoraithe, Knights of the Broken Bell)

And the "One" is Ranger in the hills.

Edit: Alternatively, the Knights are part of the Legions of Terror (that what their official status is anyway) and the Deoraithe are their own Army. I lean towards the previous interpretation myself. However, you're right there is room in the story for another army if you have all armies under Cat's direct chain command(Alfobi, Cat, and Ranker, Knights) or embedded (Deoraithe) as one Army and only have Winter, Summer, and Ranger left. It'll be interesting to see what happens next.

***** You're right, we haven't seen any battle that killed multiple princes.

i hadn't considered assigning Ranger as the "One", on one hand it kinda fits, on the other, i don't think Cat would risk trying to get Ranger to do anything for her. Meaning she is here uninvited. Which means her plan doesn't feature Ranger.

If Ranger were to do anything in this battle, it be taking out the princess. But if Cat's plan doesn't feature Ranger, then she would have her own plan for taking down the princess. (Though maybe she fucked up and Ranger bails her out. Akua also underestimated the princess)

****** I saw speculation on the story page that Cat offered Ranger the Summer Princess's eye to complete her set. However, I think it is actually the Prince's hand that was offered (like literally his hand, not a marriage proposal). She has Winter Prince of Nightfall's eye (who's conveniently in this battle) so I think this is a ripe narrative connection.

#+begin_quote
  “Speaking of that,” Foundling said, popping her neck with a gruesome cracking sound. “If you want to avoid me beating you like a rented mule it's not too late to make peace. I'll need hostages and reparations, of course, but you can still get away with losing only a hand.”\\

******* Would be a weird ass offer though, can't exactly use a hand as jewelry. And Ranger would probably be able to just waltz into the realm of summer and get it herself whenever she fancied, given that she wanders into the realm of winter every year to grab the eye. Which i suppose is a bit of my problem with Ranger being her at Cat's behest. Cat can't offer anything that Ranger can't just go fetch herself whenever she fancied.
