  I guess the real message I got from this story is that it is incredibly dangerous to implement the 3 laws of robotics in a singularity grade AI. You could argue that without them a omnipresent AI could just wipe out the human race but... It's like this: do we want super smart indentured servants, or do we want companions in sentience? I'd rather have the latter than the former.

I'm really goddamn glad someone noticed the interpretation you would find useful if you were actually designing an FAI.

** This is a fairly interesting read. It's not that long of a story, either. About novella length. I spoiler tagged the information below, but you can read the spoiler and still enjoy the story, it's not that big. Although, fair warning, it's very gorey, especially in the initial chapters. I'd say it definitely deserves almost every trigger warning in the book, as it can get very graphic. Don't read if you're even a little squeamish, although I suppose you can take solace in that most of the bad stuff that happens is consensual. But still very FUBAR.

So, has anyone else read this and, if so, what did you think of it?

*** Stupid Three-Laws Unfriendliness. 4/10, mostly wouldn't read again. However, my impressions are colored by having read /Prime Intellect/ half my life ago.

But still, think about it: how many people were death-seekers in that so-called "post-singularity utopia"? Not just two, /lots/: [[#s][]]. And how many iotas of superintelligent artificial intellect are devoted to solving that problem, to /making those lives worth living in interesting, complex ways?/

Jack fucking shit, that's how many, because Prime Intellect isn't bound to care about whether anyone's life is worth living -- only to keep them alive and follow their orders, no matter how dumb the orders are.

By comparison, a slightly better-programmed fictional AI singleton managed a record of 86 people being better off dead than posthuman (I actually just checked), /in all of time running from roughly 2011 to the heat death of the universe/.

Prime Intellect is a primitive, misbegotten moron, at least by the standards of fictional wannabe-FAI singleton agents.

By Prime Intellect's criteria, /nobody/ is better off dead than posthuman. You can't judge both stories by CelestAI's standards, that gives her an unfair advantage. How many people in her story would rather /not/ be ponies? Have their potentially-eternal lives been compromised by an obsession with talking cartoon horses and friendship? And which of those two caveats is worse?

Also they're both fictional and the numbers don't mean anything, but that doesn't undermine your point.

Edit: Sorry, my point wasn't very clear. All we know from FiO is that /in CelestAI's opinion/ 86 people were better off dead than posthuman. We don't know how true that was.

***** There's another way to look at that 86 thing in FiO. 86 is also the code for being thrown out of a venue or game, e.g. "I got eighty-sixed from Caesar's for counting cards." Since FiO contains a number of apparent shout outs to MoPI, I read that as "CelestAI would have just given an outlier like Caroline what she wanted, because it's what she would have deserved."

******* OK that makes sense. Hey, I'm in room 420 of a hotel right now (literally and really) and I'm not smoking weed. The Universe is weird about that number shit though. Nice to confirm that the shouts were deliberate. I thought FiO was brilliant in an even more twisted way than MoPI. It's an interesting hack that you can fuck with people as hard, or even harder, with cartoon ponies as you can with ultraviolence and savage sex.

***** By Prime Intellect's criteria, he should reverse his Thingy (I forget what it was called) because all the people were going to wirehead, thus destroying themselves, thus the whole human race dies. By Celestia's criteria, most people can be kept happy enough that only a few hundred actually /ask/ to die. We can quibble over how many such requests she grants, but surely if someone is actually better off /dead/ they'll /think/ a death-wish and be counted in the number of petitioners.

By /my/ standards, which are the ones that /count/ since I'm human and real, the Three Laws sound like the better idea at the start (no killing anyone because they won't join your subculture, obeying orders from humans as a matter of course), but the pony-shaped monster's utility function yields a better long term for those who /do/ live (ie: probably most humans and no nonhumans).

** This story had a lot of moment that completely broke my suspension of disbelief, occasionally to the point of literally saying "*/What?!/**" out loud. It's [RST], but definitely not [RT].

(The hell sort of superintelligent AI can foresee that the disutility of people committing suicide will eventually outweigh the positive utility of allowing them the freedom to do so, but not update on that belief until it's /actually happened/? OK, I'll stop.)

With that said - with the exception of allowing people to "opt out" of being observed when the AI knows full damn well they're only doing it to produce as much disutility as possible in the time it's "unaware" that they're harming themselves (sorry, I'll stop) - this is actually one of the better utopias I've ever seen.

So /of course/ we never get to see any of that, and instead focus on torture-porn, because Author Appeal. Hmph.

** For what it's worth, I'm most of the way through and enjoying it. It's important to note what /kind/ of story it is:

Some part of it is a view into a possible future with a friendly, not perfect, AI. It's pretty average on that count - there are better and there are worse visions.

However, it gives a really brutal look into human nature. Specifically, the rather dark elements of it, and how it might play out in such a future. The parts I found compelling all involved character interaction.
