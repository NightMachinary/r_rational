** /I aten't dead. T/he next chapter should be up in a week (not in four months). This follows on from the events of [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/03/26/chapter-fourteen-convergence/][Chapter Fourteen]]. We get to learn some interesting things about [[https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1465][Acausal trade]] and the importance of keeping the faith.

**** Well, so did I for a little while; I had a degree to finish! I'm curious - what did you think of this as a way of resolving Chapter 14's cliffhanger?

***** I'd say it was very heavily implied, so not much of a cliffhanger really.

** Loved it,and I'm excited for more! Has anyone read the short web comic Alice Grove? This has a lot of shared elements with that, but it's ultimately different and more fleshed out.

Here's a link to the the first page of Alice Grove (220 pages). The site doesn't have great navigation for its mobile version. [[http://www.alicegrove.com/page/220]]

*** That looks very interesting - the list of 'inspirations' for that webcomic are almost identical to the ones I would have written; Baxter, Reynolds, Banks etc. What elements did you see as being common between them?

**** I should say that I meant your story is more fleshed out, and that is not a criticism of Alice Grove.

Mild Spoilers: The lost ancient human tech including Nano Machines and AI. Their roles here quite are different though. Also, the situation isn't so dire.

Do you have some book recommendations by those authors?

I suppose that depends on your definition of 'ancient'. It was only as long ago as the Napoleonic wars are from our time!

For Stephen Baxter I would start with Proxima - its a standalone near-future novel and less insanely expansive than the Xeelee books. As for Iain Banks - the Player of Games out of the Culture books is the shortest, most self-contained and possibly the best. With Alastair Reynolds the Revelation Space series is still his best - just start at the beginning with Revelation Space.
