Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Apologies for not updating last week; Thanksgiving took up a decent chunk of my time in preparation, and there wasn't much to update on besides.  This week is no better, and this is just a ping to ensure I don't let this project get too far off my radar.

At least this week I had an excuse that I'm actually excited about: I finally [[https://pcpartpicker.com/user/ketura/saved/DQ9FTW][pulled the trigger on a  new PC rig]].  I've been trying to upgrade for two years now or so, but it just wasn't in the cards until now.

Mostly-completed build taking up most of my desk: [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/386040258829221889/20171201_002510.jpg][image]]

But you can't really see how massive this shit is, so here's an xbox controller for scale: [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/386040643732111362/JPEG_20171201_002639.jpg][image]]

So I'm likely to continue tinkering with this over the weekend and then drooling over frame rates and the like, but I'm /also/ curious to see what Visual Studio makes of 16 threads, so who knows, maybe I'll stumble my way to productivity once more.

** Some of you have run or played campaigns in DnD, right? I'll be playing my first ever game soon, and I'm looking for advice on how to ensure a first time DM has an excellent time first-time-DMing. Experienced DMs -- are there any things you wish your players did more or less of, especially when you first started DMing? Anything you wish they kept in mind? Common pitfalls? Once we really get rolling I'll make or commission some drawings or 3D prints of our characters, which I reckon will go over well, but I want more day-to-day tips (more details [[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7eommp][here]], as well as some answers from posters on [[/r/DnD]]).

*** Tips for players:

- Don't ask too many questions about irrelevant things, unless you think the DM has an answer prepared. My least favorite part of a session is when I get put on the spot and asked what a minor, one-off character's name is. (I have a long list printed out that I pull from at random for this, but it's still annoying and usually doesn't add much to the session.)
- Don't thumb your nose at the offered quests. Having to scrap a bunch of work because people have hidden goals that aren't aligned with what I've prepared is a bummer, and ends up with a mostly improvised session, which newer DMs usually aren't good at.
- Describe what you're attempting to do, rather than the results of your actions, especially in combat. It's not for you to say that you cut someone's head off, you say that you /try/ to do that and then the DM narrates the action. It does help if you add that flavor yourself though, because that relieves some of the mental load on the DM (especially since it can be hard to remember what everyone's attack/weapon is).
- Make sure at least one person is keeping track of loot, and at least one person is keeping track of names and quest notes. Offloading this onto the DM makes more work, and the DM already has a lot of work to do. (The DM knows the names, and the quest details, but having to ask the DM for a refresher every fifteen minutes is bad.) Make sure that at least one person is keeping the game moving forward, rather than stalled out on digressions, especially if you have a timid DM.
- It's your responsibility to make a character that can be part of the game. One of the common things that I've seen people do wrong is make their character a weird, anti-social loner, and then play them like a weird, antisocial loner, and then when that gums up the works, complain that they were "just playing their character". That's why you don't bring characters like that to the table in the first place.

*** Pick a tone for the adventure and set expectations before you start. Something like: 'this arc is fast-paced swashbuckling', 'we're running an intrigue and mystery game', or 'this is an old-school puzzle-dungeon'.

This gives players a sense of what to expect. And it gives them queues on how they should respond to the world around them.

Give players clues about where they can dictate details of the world.

Before my current campaign, I asked my players to tell me about their home cities, and about the backstory-adventure where they met another member of the party.

During the game, I'll say things like, "that attack hits. Dragon's at 0 hit points. It's defeated. What happens?" And then I'll let the player fill in the epic details of how their character lands the final blow.

But, my biggest piece of DM advice is that you're playing to lose. Plan your loss so that characters seem huge and competent and heroic. Everything exists to serve that goal.

Is the Big Bad an evil wizard? Then he's not just evil. He's smugly, sneeringly evil. Have him gloat about his victory halfway through the session. Let him escape halfway through the arc. Let him grandstand in front of his army in the final battle.

Set things up right and, when the story reaches his climax, the characters will be narrating some truly epic death-scenes as they heroically crush their hated foe.

What (if any) opinions do you have on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_and_married_names#English-speaking_world][changing]] of names upon marriage?\\
- Neither spouse changes his last name\\
- One spouse assumes the other's last name...\\
- - ...and abandons his original last name\\
- - ...and replaces his original middle name with his original last name\\
- Hyphenation:\\
- - One spouse's name goes first for both participants\\
- - Each spouse puts his name first and the other's name second\\
- - Each spouse puts his name second and the other's name first\\
- - What about the next generation?\\
- Both spouses amalgamate their last names

I'm inclined to think that the simplest option is the best option, since changing one's name incurs a risk of mistakes (e. g., on credit reports) and makes filling out forms a hassle ("Have you ever worked under a name different from your current name? If so, list all other names."). I was quite surprised when, some months ago, I [[https://i.imgur.com/4tBgZk8.png][saw]] that the wife of Prophet Yudkowsky (pbuh) had assumed his last name.

(I really should get around to reading the first four books of [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/41322][the /Runelords/ series]] for a second time, and maybe even finally reading the second four books for the first time. On the other hand, I /still/ haven't bothered to finish cleaning up the hideous formatting of my [[http://www.baen.com/baenebooks][DRM-free]] copies of the last three books of [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40821][the /Belisarius/ series]], which have been sitting on my hard drive for /literally/ a year!

You've got to remember... that was twenty years ago! It's very much an Original Sin type series. There've been tons of derivative works since, and the context in which it arose is no longer accessible. So it seems generic now, but it wasn't back then.

[[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Seinfeld_Is_Unfunny][This is a trope.]] With that said, however, when I call AGoT merely "generic", I'm thinking of books that are as old as, or older than, AGoT: /Redwall/, /Ivanhoe/, and /The Vicomte de Bragelonne/ stand out most prominently. I don't think I've read much medieval fantasy newer than AGoT. (/Vicomte/ includes some pretty major character death, you know!)

***** Well yes, it is a trope, but that doesn't make it untrue. But it's odd to make the comparison to Redwall, since Redwall specifically has all the heroic tropes that AGoT eschews. The setting is, so far as I can see, meant to be medieval fantasy specifically to play up the lack up the usual heroic tropes.

After all, the heroes always win in Redwall even if they suffer along the way. (Martin is my favourite, though I'm partial to the badgers in Salamandastron too). Everybody has tremendous virtue, it's really a different atmosphere entirely.

I will admit to unfamiliarity with /Vicomte/. Would you recommend it?

The Runelords is a pretty interesting example of a high fantasy series with a whole bunch of "what-if" in its magic system, but I'd almost call that an entirely separate genre. In fact I much preferred it over AGoT just for the lower level of grittiness.

From my recollection, that's somewhat backwards. The magic of endowments in /The Runelords/ exists precisely to justify classic fantasy tropes. A hero (or villain) really is as strong as ten or a thousand men. It's as though the author said, "I want to use these fantasy and heroic tropes, now how do I construct the magic system to justify them?"

#+end_quote

My partner and I decided to keep our surnames (we'd both published under them, and also liked them esthetically, and also didn't like the implicit subsumation/loss of individuality and asymmetry of keeping only one surname), and we found hyphenation clunky, but we still wanted some sort of symbolic name-y union, so we adopted each other's surnames as our middle names.

We haven't decided on the children-naming course of action yet, in part since that's far enough away, but we might either give each (of two anticipated) children one of our surnames, or give them both a blended surname (there are some combinations that look and sound pretty neat and natural imo). IDK how inconvenient this would be though.

Names exist for convenience in distinguishing people in conversation and written text. Surnames exist to help identify familial units (with more or less success).

#+end_quote

What if we wish to retain some given level of individuality, but still form a family? Or are OK with some loss of individuality, but not total loss of individuality? We're certainly happy and willing to lose /some/ individuality (in our choice of dinner, pursuit of hobbies, career relocation options, etc.), but didn't see the benefits of a single surname to be worth the costs (I can easily imagine additional examples where this could be the case: maybe a person can only eat when their partner eats, or sit when their partner sits, or poop when their partner poops. All of these involve some subjugation of one partner to another, but at very little benefit, unless it's the couple's kink or something).

#+begin_quote
  If asymmetry bothers you, pick a new name (you mentioned that blending was reasonable).
#+end_quote

We obviously considered this, but liked our current surnames, and thought it too much trouble to change completely to a different surname. Swapping middle names satisfied our desire for symbolic/nominal unity while minimizing other costs.

#+begin_quote
  If you want to keep publishing under your original names, keep doing so.
#+end_quote

Yes, as we've been doing.

#+begin_quote
  Surnames exist to help identify familial units (with more or less success).
#+end_quote

That's one of their functions, sure. I think their more important function -- in my life/social context -- is to distinguish individuals at a greater resolution than just the given name (e.g. at the community level). Surnames can also indicate occupation, geographic location, your mother's/father's given name, etc. but I'm not changing my surname to any of those, either. I can see the benefit of having a single family surname in the case of e.g. picking up children from daycare, or visiting in the hospital, and so on, but those seem easy enough to work around, especially in the era of record digitization. Where else would it be helpful to implicitly identify family units where you can't just say "yes, Bob Smith and John Doe are married with children, they constitute a nuclear family"? There /might/ also be some slight psychological effect on the child if they have a different surname than they parents, but I imagine no more than, say, their having a different given name (it being fairly common for a male lineage to all share the same given name).

While there are a lot of good reasons for the bride to keep her own name, at least there's a societal framework for maiden-vs.-married names. The groom has all the same reasons to keep his, plus the lack of societal framework.

I don't think there's any real need to faff about with name changes, except for the trickiness surrounding name inheritance, or if one spouse doesn't like their name.

I didn't say that marriage was /irrational/. I said that it was /meaningless/. (More specifically, I meant that I considered marriage to be devoid of social meaning---/i. e./, to no longer imply a strong and lasting social bond.) For example, if getting married would result in a reduction of the taxes owed by the participants, then that reduction is one rational reason in favor of marriage. Other such reasons for marriage obviously exist (e. g., immigration shenanigans).

An amalgamation seems better.

  I definitely prefer The Runelords (discussed here and here).

Oh good lord. Please, just no.

** Weekly update on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIWf3Nqudgh18j4RK8bm4zOTSKUFl6l9Igvdg1adzGE/edit][The Tesseract Engine]], my ongoing game engine project.

--------------

Finally!

After weeks of writing theory, wondering about how I should shape my data structures, which engine I should use, after hours of tracking down mysterious bugs (seriously, fuck Ogre3d) I finally have my first visible boilerplate project. It's very small, it can only display pre-determined cubes (and very inefficiently), but it's there. I posted a screenshot on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIWf3Nqudgh18j4RK8bm4zOTSKUFl6l9Igvdg1adzGE/edit][the project's Google Doc page]].

Of course, it feels very gratifying and very relieving to finally have something concrete-ish, but it's very minor in the grand scheme of things. Next stop: being able to interact with things.

--------------

My final choice of engine for the moment is SFML + Ogre3D.

SFML is /the/ beginner level graphic library. It is easily the easiest library to use in the /world/; both in terms of "easy to install", "easy to make a first program on", and "easy to make advanced programs on". It's probably one of the most recommended graphics library out there, especially in France.

Ogre3D is... not beginner level. It's a very old 3D graphics library, with an immense codebase and a labyrinthine documentation. It's specialized in 3D graphics, but it has a lot of add-ons for additional functionalities.

I considered many 3D libraries, and chose Ogre3d on the grounds that it's very old yet still updated, very well-maintained, with a large and active community. I'm... starting to regret that choice. More on that later.

SFML is specialized in 2D graphics, but it also provides all the necessary utilities for opening a window and reading its events in a portable applications. I mostly use it because I've familiar with its event system, and I don't really like Ogre's event utilities.

I'll stick to these tools until the project is developed enough that I have an idea what I need (but small enough that refactoring isn't too much of a pain in the ass).

Let's talk about "immediate mode" interfaces, and "retained mode" interfaces.*

A retained mode API asks you what you'd like to display at the beginning of the program. You say "Alright, I'd like to display a window here, and a button in the window, and text next to the button", etc. You usually don't know how the API stores this data, or what operations it performs on it, just that at the end of the day it does display the button. The API is usually also responsible for updating its internal data and reacting to events; if you want something to happen when a button is pressed, you have to tell the API "by the way, remember to do X when the button is pressed" when building your window.

By contrast, an immediate mode API asks you what you want to display every single frame of the program. You say "I want to display a window and a button and text; oh and since I'm detecting that the mouse cursor is on the button, the button should be of this color".

I've been thinking about these concepts for a while, but I only discovered their name this week, in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1qyvQsjK5Y][a video dating from 200]]. I'm trying to find documentation on the subject (and find the time to read it, too), because these concepts are extremely relevant to what I'm trying to do.

I'll probably talk more about this later, but I love immediate mode and I hate retained mode. Immediate mode gives you a control over the application and... I'm not sure how to put it, a responsibility over which operations are performed, that makes theorizing about your application's states and debugging much easier.

Which is why I'm pretty annoyed with Ogre3d right now, which is a full retained-mode API.

A huge thanks to [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]] for reminding me to post these updates. Every encouragement helps! Also, I've done my first weekly reunion on the project with my French friend.
