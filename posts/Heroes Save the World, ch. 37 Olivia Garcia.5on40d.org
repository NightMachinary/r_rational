Hopefully I can get you to say that a few more times before this story ends.* >:]

** Binged this whole thing today! Great stuff.

Midway through I started keeping a list of names, locations, and powers, split into Good, Undecided and Bad moral stances and roughly ranked from most to least powerful. Please comment with better power names or rankings!

*Good*

Simon Martin, Canada: Necrocognition

Austin Smith, USA: Pyrokinesis

???, Thailand: Healing

???, India: Imping

Noam Sitz, Israel: Mindsharing

Aadhya Verma, India: Pocketing

Zahra Gorbani, Iran: Duplication

Hannah Johnson, USA: Prestidigitation

*Undecided*

Ananya Sharma, India: Electrogenesis

Meifeng Wu, China: Crucicognition

???, ???: Protection (Asian-looking force field girl)

???, Nigeria: Shapeshifting

Vasily Popov, Russia: Dreamsight

Grace Hamad, Tanzania: Retrophony

Olivia Garcia, USA: Lifesight

*Bad*

Yuka Sato, Japan: Compulsion

Michael Williams, USA: Skinwalking

--------------

+So far we have 16/100. 25% are from the USA, 12% are from India--so it's almost certainly not based on population.+

+Zero from China or Western Europe. Bizarre. Knowing China, I wouldn't be surprised if they have a Yangban situation going on already...+

Yep, should've known China would industrialize it right quick. Now that's what I call opsec.

*** Ahhhhhhh, this makes me so happy. Thanks for your comments. And as it turns out, a China chapter should be getting posted in about half an hour, unless I messed up the schedule.

It's interesting that you put Not-Imp in the Good category but Ananya in Undecided, given that the primary thing that we know about her (unless you're analyzing the little details, which it sounds like you might be, which is fantastic) is that she's working with Ananya.

I'd also be interested to hear how you're defining "good" and "bad" since there are a number of value systems in play. I suspect a brand of utilitarianism, but feel free to prove me wrong.

> Grace Hamad, Tanzania: Retrophony

Grace is not a phony! Especially not a retro one! >:P

Something about "pocket space" or "hammerspace" might be appropriate for Aadhya's power.

I'll go ahead and rank Hannah as a Striker 0. >:P

Thanks again for your comments. I'm not yet at the point where I can metabolize words, but i nearly live off of feedback even so.

**** Can't wait to see what's going on over there! Will update my list with Meifeng as soon as I read it :)

So I didn't have a particularly rigorous system for determining morality--mainly I just weighed "what they're doing" and "how they're doing it." Which is why the Nigerian shapeshifter is Undecided--he's squelching corruption, but doing it with murder.

Ananya is similar. She's currently being used to generate clean energy, but she's /actively trying/ to figure out how to make herself a WMD. That's not so good. I very much hope she makes it onto the Good list at some point.

Hah retrophony is one of the sillier ones :P I welcome other suggestions!

I used "pocketing" because of the dual reference to pickpocketing and pocket dimensions. Trying to keep these all one word for consistency.

Thanks for your thanks! One of the things I love most about this community is the ability to interact with the authors. I'll happily give on Patreon as soon as I'm in a position to do so. Keep it up.

She's going to hold the world hostage until you put her on it. >:P

Thank-you.

  Keep it up.

You can rest assured that I will. My audience might be small right now, but it's bigger than I really expected it to be.

(the reaction to HSTW in general has been much better than I ever would have guessed, honestly. this started out as a sort of "Well, I need to start writing /something/ and I keep overthinking things and stopping projects because I'm overwhelmed by the amount of planning that I'm doing for them, so let's just go with /this/ thing and just see how far I get before it fails miserably. It remains to be seen, of course, whether I /can/ keep this up, but you folks, at least, have faith in me, and that's enough to keep my own confidence boosted.)

The annoying thing is that I had already started to figure out personalities for a number of the Chinese kids before realizing that, given these factors and those factors, the government was just going to kill them before they had a chance to appear on-screen. It's probably going to be fun (and time-consuming) to list all the things that I /thought/ were going to happen until one tiny detail derailed everything and sent events down a drastically different path.

That's the price one pays for writing a story with so many characters, I suppose. >:]
