Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Hi all! I'm running a D&D campaign for some friends that I've been in some stage of planning for nearly a decade now. It's so amazing to get my world out into the, well, world, and I want to make sure my players are as immersed as possible! Thought I'd come to the smart folks of [[/r/rational]] for advice, because a hive mind is better than a singleton.

Doc, Throgg, Imsh: if you see this, read no further.

The campaign takes place ~200 years after a world-shattering cataclysm that broke the planet's megacontinent into five pieces and drained magic from the world. The Elves, who had ruled the other races for millennia, walled themselves inside the scraps of forest left to them, and the other races have been building a new society in the centuries since. At the time of the campaign, the world's magic-producing systems are just coming back online, and some individuals are demonstrating divine or arcane ability, including the party's cleric who has so far had to hide his magic from prying eyes.

The party is going to have to deal with a lot of uncontrolled magical outbursts, as the carefully-constructed ley network built by the elves is no longer maintained and will begin discharging sporadically, turning regular caves and ruins into dangerous dungeons. The other side effect of this is that all the magic items used by the elven empire, many of which are still buried, hidden, or mislaid around the world, are beginning to function again--stronger and stronger as magic builds up in the world's circulatory system, but also ancient and unkept. In the first session the party obtained a mysterious crystal that they just now (session 8) discovered is an ancient elven map. They do not yet know that it is a map of the local ley network, and will guide them to concentrations of ley energy where they can find dungeons & monsters & loot. I intend to have several groups competing with the party to find the ley nodes and shut them down/steal the loot from within, including one funded by the magic-obsessed King Ellis and one made up of the employees of a black-market trading operation who just want to make a buck.

Based on this premise, any suggestions for malfunctioning magic items, strange transformations of significant places, or half-formed ancient horrors trying to drag themselves out of the place-between-places are welcome. I also expect the party to eventually try and break into the elves' walled country, so I'd also appreciate ideas about the living conditions of a race that had previously relied on magic for absolutely everything. (Hint: they're not so lovely & noble-looking anymore.)

*** Interesting concept. Some quick ideas, a few of them pilfered from old campaigns:

- There was once a city that made extensive use of extradimensional spaces and corridors in order to make everything sit closer to everything else, as well as to put a buffer of space around it. After the End of Magic, the city lay in ruins, but it was too close to important waterways/resources to lay empty for long, so it was rebuilt. Now, as the magic is coming back, the old extradimensional anchors are becoming active once more, creating expanded spaces where there were none before and smearing the city out over the fourth spatial dimension.
- A huge, terrifying, and immortal creature was once placed in chains by the elves, who perpetually harvested it for its blood, bones, skin, and meat. When the End of Magic came, the creature finally, unceremoniously died, and the town that had thrived off its products was abandoned. Now, the magic is back, and the creature lives once more, with only two of the eight chains that held it in place still functional. If it gets loose, there's no one that can stop it.
- One of the elven nobility had constructed a floating isle, used as an elaborate palace that hosted a continuous, Bacchanalian party. When the End of Magic came, it went crashing to the ground, where it was throughly looted for everything of value (and the magic items were left behind). Now that the magic is back, the isle has risen once more, unsteered and unsteady, drifting its way toward a major population center, and if it fails when a half mile overhead, thousands will die.
- In order to create a mine for some rare and precious metal, someone created a powerful magic item that would repel water out to a mile away, a spherical globe where no water could pass unless it was inside a person. The item was used to anchor a mine that would otherwise have been under one of the continent's thicker rivers, which flowed around the sphere of influence once the magic item was in place. After the End of Magic, the water came rushing back in, drowning the mine and everyone who worked there. Now, the item is working once more, uncovering the mine. Unfortunately, it's also diverted the course of the river, and if that's still the case when the rainy season comes, it's liable to cause severe flooding in a nearby city.

**** Awesome ideas, thanks. I have an elven manor planned where a clay jar sits high on a kitchen shelf, next to a note reading "Young Master Barbican is not to eat marzipan fairies until he has finished his dinner." Ropey may also make an appearance as a Rope of Climbing that gets smarter and smarter as his life force trickles back to him.

*** Also, there is the magic that still works exactly as the immortal designers intended, because when you live forever, sometimes you just want to build a lasting solution.

The High Path. This was the main long range transportation system between cities. A series of indestructible parallel obelisks, with the destination written on them, and when you walk down the path so marked, you find yourself on a forested path. Walk the path, and 2d6 hours later, you arrive at your destination, hundreds of miles away. (leave the path, never be seen again. That is how it always worked) Of course, the city which just became your next door neighbour is no longer part of a world spanning empire, but is currently held by the Naga. Fairly /civilized/ Naga, but that just means that they wont murder everyone out of hand when they march their army through. Just the army and the current rulers.

The local government would like you to try and bribe, charm or dazzle the snake ladies out of this plan.

The Exarch Golems of Justice. The city of Exarch was /the/ center for inter-racial, inter planar, and intercontinental trade. This worked in large part because of the Code of Exarch, and the Awakened Golems that enforced it. It is still a city of trade, but over the centuries, the Code of Exarch has been very creatively translated, amended, and selectively enforced. The golems are back, and they are enforcing the original Code of Exarch with great vigor. All the slavers messily died on the first day, and the golems are yeeting people over the city wall and into the river at a brisk pace, which is merciful.. for those who can swim.

The city council would really, really like you to find an accurate, unedited, well translated version of the code of Exarch. Today, if possible, but definitely before tax season. The penalties for incorrectly assessing or cheating on taxes are the stuff of legend.

The Bonds Of Consensual Body Swapping were crafted by an Arch mage with a transgender daughter. They also saw a lot of recreational use, since they recharge 3 times a day. When they started working again, there were an entire pilgrimage of people who wished to swap out of the body they were born in, and a bureacracy sprang up to match people, and take care of the paperwork, and ensure nobody uses this to escape their crimes ect, ect.

Only, now someone has stolen them from the temple. This, is obviously really, really bad, because consensual in this context accepts "Someone is holding a crossbow to my head". Find them. Try to find out who they have been used on.

*** Some ideas for magic items:

- The Ring of Invisibility. Made as a test of an invisibility spell; on saying the command word, this ring turns invisible. (Note, the person wearing the ring remains visible - only the ring turns invisible).

- The weather predictor: Measures the air currents, humidity, and other such factors, and then gives an extremely accurate weather prediction describing the weather that will be observed at a particular Elven city over the next three days. It would be more helpful if you /which/ Elven city or where it had been.

- The Universal Remote - A long stick covered in a variety of rings and buttons. In theory, by pointing it at another artifact and twiddling the right rings/pressing the right buttons, that artifact can be started/stopped/rewound/reset/adjusted etc. However, all the writing has worn off the buttons and rings, there is no manual, and you can't seem to figure out how to get it to display the Help page. Can on occasion be made to display some text in an obscure and ancient dialect which presumably says something about the artifact it's pointed at.

- Ring of Seawater. One of a pair of teleportation gates, fortunately turned off when discovered. The function is simple - anything that enters one gate exits the other, and vice versa. Unfortunately, in this case, the 'other' is at the bottom of the ocean; activating the gate causes high-pressure streams of seawater to explode from the device in both directions, doing significant damage to anything in the vicinity until it is turned off again. If the other gate can somehow be retrieved, this could be a lot more useful (but that's a lot of ocean to search).

- Temporal Skipper - anything shot by this rifle instantly vanishes, only to reappear in the exact same spot two rounds later, having skipped forwards through time. The rifle takes five rounds to recharge. Can be used to bypass most locked doors, as long as you're quick about going through it.

*** Sounds like a really cool campaign! I suppose a number of artifacts may be based off being factories for things that normally can't be produced like that. Then they malfunction... and stuff gets weird. A few examples:

- A hollowed out cuboid with runes imprinted artistically along the inside. When enough matter is shoved inside, and the cuboid sealed, the runes activate. The output is an extremely loyal pseudo-golem animated by magic into the rough shape of the input materials. Malformed examples are in constant pain, but are none-the-less loyal to the first person they sense. They follow orders like a well-trained guard dog might, and treat their owners like a friendly dog. Depending on the state of disrepair, a number of functions of the factory or the product may be affected, such as language recognition or loyalty.

- A small pen with several buttons on it, with pictograms depicting little stick figures performing actions on each one. When a button is pressed, the pen will grow legs and ink a runic pattern on the nearest inorganic surface. If the completed rune is worn as jewelry or subdermally, it will impart the skill depicted in the pictogram to its wearer. This could be as specific as cooking a certain meal, or as broad as swordfighting. However, damaged, ill-made, or weathered runes do not simply stop working, but instead just damage the skill they impart. A 'running' rune could make you have the muscle memory to make you twist your right ankle whenever it activates. The pen has only limited ink, and the ink is of a special make (and finding more could be a nice reward).

- A small dog-like creature made of ceramic meant to act as a personal fabricator. In the absence of a cloud of designs to choose from, each only has a few designs programmed in. They have the temperament of a subdued house-cat, but will follow those they imprint on until death (as no-one knows the phrase the elves used to tell them to stop). When instructed by whoever they have imprinted on, and if they have the appropriate materials and blueprints, they will fashion a desired creation, be it a statuette, a tool, or ammunition (subject to previous clauses, of course). They are excellent at following instructions to the letter, and will stop working if told, but otherwise hold no issue with dismantling a sleeping body piece by piece to make a pair of dice.

**** Thanks, cool ideas! Can you elaborate on the FabriCat, specifically "dismantling a sleeping body"? I imagine it would need roughly the material you're trying to craft with, right?

***** The sleeping body thing was essentially saying that, when trying to find the desired materials, the FabriCat doesn't care about sources. So, if you say "FabriCat, could you make me a sword?", it will check its blueprints. If there is a blueprint for a sword, it will make it from the closest/easiest to acquire materials. If the closest suitable material source is a sleeping body, then it will happily start dismantling the sleeper's rib cage to begin construction. If there is no blueprint or available materials, it will give some sort of adorable 'no, I can't do that right now :(' reaction. Of course, it's up to the owner to find out what blueprints their specific FabriCat had downloaded.

  Mori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic, until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes *strong revulsion*. However, as the robot's appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels.

From what I've read it's our evolutionary mechanism to protect our ancestors from getting close to sick people and corpses.

It also means we feel strong revulsion to things that are almost human but not quite, i.e different human species.. Therefore it's safe to assume humans, elves, dwarves and the like are unlikely to coexist peacefully.

*** It really depends on how much of human fashions actually depend on people being actively irrational. The reason that women's clothing doesn't have pockets is that pockets tend to alter the lines of the clothing, which in turn makes them less attractive, and it might be that a rational actor, faced with a choice between looking pretty and having pockets, will just settle on a purse, especially if one is socially acceptable.

You can model fashion as a large number of agents engaged in minmaxing. In that context, what's the stupidest fashion that currently exists? How are we defining "stupid"? Things whose primary function is social/aesthetic rather than based on utility?

***** Improved fitness would contribute to less incentive to missize clothing but it won't on its own hit the core of the issue IMO.

​

In my experience the people who's purchasing decisions are impacted most by the size label are relatively fit (or anorexic), juts not the super-stimulus-magazine-model level of skinny that media conditions us to think is the optimal body shape. Someone who's a size 12 probably isn't fishing for the odd garment here or there that's a size 12 but is labeled a size 10, somone who's between a size 4 and a size 6 and was legitimately a size 4 in high school might spend a lot of effort finding clothing that should be a size 6 but is labeled size 4 to maintain that self image as "I wear a size 4" (and in extreme cases conclude that since the "size 4" clothes are a little big, maybe they should be looking for a size 2). That minority is small but buys enough clothing and has enough brand loyalty based on the oddball size chart that marketing teams have made an effort to target them specifically from time to time.

​

In a more rational world I'd expect that whole ball of crazy to fall appart in multiple directions. And the benefits of standardized accurate measurements (easier online ordering, easier gift buying, etc.) to be far more reaching.
