** Prediction: The Tyrant is going to put on the crown and sacrifice himself. Tyrant arranged all of this, with the Bard's help, to give himself a deathbed redemption arc. This was his plan all along: to do as much evil as possible, and then end it all with betraying Below by getting redeemed. After all, he was on borrowed time the whole way, and he gets to dodge being sent to one of the Hells.

** Huh. So Cat aged them both by 11 years (12?), or aged everyone in "this broken realm?" Because that would probably come close to killing Pilgrim too, so I'm guessing it's just Saint, but then why would Cat be touched by it too? Maybe it's a required sacrifice for such a powerful prayer.

Still, very cool solution. Also interesting implications about what she is, now, if she's mortal but still somewhat resistant to aging.

*** I'm not sure there's that much evidence to support her being somewhat resistant to aging. In the first chapter she's noted to be close to 16, i mean as close to any age as an infant put into an orphanage can be said to be with any certainty, and i don't think we get any explicit mentions of her birthday/s but time has passed. I'd say that the very least she's in her late teens and oldest is maybe mid twenties and from there another eleven years puts her in her thirties generously. And while her thirties isn't the most youthful she could be it's by no means completely out of the question for her to be well in fighting shape if nothing else.

*** Cat's protection against it is just rather different, whether she will naturally age at all while the high priestess of night is in doubt, but a miracle like this would likely hit a villain just as hard, though it might invoke a direct clash between the sisters and the GB so maybe not. Her aging here is likely more of a price than a sign of her actually aging naturally otherwise.

*** Isn't that basically what everyone with any power tries to do? Disliking someone because they try to use their power to make the world a better place by preventing the rise of a massive threat seems a bit silly. Why would it make sense for her to respect the "right" of villains to forge a terrible new threat that could end up causing harm on a massive scale.

This perspective seems particularly hypocritical given that Catherine has been trying to do the exact same thing on a vastly greater scale in her self-assigned role as Savior of Callow. What "right" does she have to commit horrific crimes in the pursuit of her vision for Callow?

** Having seen Saint in her last stand i could believe that she was potentially a threat or at least the closest thing they had to threatening the Dead King. Also loved using time as a weapon with a cost even if she was still mortal eleven years was a price that Cat could pay much more easily than Pilgrim or Saint, and at the same time almost worthless against the Dead King or most of her other potential problems like White Knight.

​

But at the same time it's hard to say if that last time play was a realm thing or if everything got shifted forward the latter leaves kind of huge problems with Vivienne and Hakram in charge of Callow for probably too long, but even the former potentially has a lot of backlash it's uncertain that Pilgrim would be able to survive it. Also who the heck is going to wear the crown? My money is Pilgrim cause that's easily the way that screws over Cat the most.
