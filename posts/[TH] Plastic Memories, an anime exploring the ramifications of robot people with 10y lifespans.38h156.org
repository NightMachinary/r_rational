** Can't say i agree, from the few episodes i watched(3) it was mostly a springboard to explore random lovcom situations with occasionally not really explored mentions to all kinds of things that could be important and interesting but are displayed in an extremely shallow fashion just to a. create forced emotional connection b. seem deeper then it actually is.

Also plenty of sloppy writing in general

*** Same here, had to give it up at episode 3. The main conflict in the story didn't seem to be related to any large question, just "a teenager has a crush on an android."

*** similarly it always bothered me that Haloverse AIs were so short lived. when halo 4 came around i was fully expecting either a deus ex machina or mourning for Cortana. yet before that nobody explored in-universe fully the implications of creating such short lived copies of human consciousness.

**** There's fanfic that basically downloads Cortana into a human body, with or without her links to the network.

** On a semi-related note, I recommend [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/3167/Eve_no_Jikan][Time of Eve]]. It's not a work I would post on its own because it doesn't /really/ fit the themes of the subreddit, but I think it would be right up [[/r/rational]]'s alley regardless.

*** I don't remember any particular asspulls other then the fact that the premise is not very likely, but you can't really hold -that- against the series rationality now can you? And i don't really see anything which happens there that contradicts the definition of rational fiction on the right..

** You can tell that the writers are using the premise as a springboard to explore the human condition, not just as window dressing.

My only real complaint so far (after 8 episodes) is that the writers included a line of dialogue early-on which declares that part of the manufacturing process is to give the androids "artificial souls." This is especially frustrating given that in-universe, despite the fact that they *literally have souls*, there's /still/ a large fraction of the population (can't tell if it's a majority or not) that doesn't consider them people. My advice: just ignore that line; I'm pretty confident they just went back and threw it in after the fact because they lost some of their nerve.

*** Why would you complain about that? Is it unheard of for people to consider others different from them to be less then human? even when said people are actually human?

*** My guess is that the line comes from the translation from Japanese: where the word translated as "soul" doesn't mean quite the same thing as "soul" in English. For example there's /kokoro/ which is sort of like heart in the figurative sense, or /seishin/ which is more like mind. Note that I haven't seen the anime as it is not available here, so this is all guesswork.

**** It could also be using /tamashii/ ("soul") in a figurative sense, meaning the spark of life that separates human intelligence from animals, rather than a literal metaphysical soul.

***** That's a distinction without a difference. There is in fact no such thing as the spark of life; it's just an arbitrary line that some people want to draw between us and all other living things.

****** I meant that, again, in a figurative sense. The "spark of life" is a metaphorical way of describing a self-aware, "sentient" intelligence.
