** Yessss.

Buffy vamps always were unbelievably stupid, which was always one of the things I least liked about the series.

I love me a competent pragmatic immoral protagonist.

Edit: A competent pragmatic immoral protagonist that does SCIENCE! On people. Mostly on innocent people.

** That's an impressive number of posts considering it's only been up a week.

Edit: This is very good quality. I like it. It is interesting to read a character that legitimately does not care about morality whatsoever. Like, normally people at least angst about doing terrible things afterwards but this guy just doesn't give a crap.

In short, check out my [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/TimeLoopedPowerGamer/profile][AO3]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etimeloopedpowergamer][FFN]] profiles for details. (Warning: AO3 contains just basically smut. My work there is no exception.)

****** /blushes deeply/

I was rather hesitant to say anything about it, but I decided that you should know what I thought of them if only because I wanted you to.......write more.../peeks through fingers/..please?

I didn't realize that you wrote smut at first, but I decided to read it anyway because I like reading porn.......and how did you ever manage to actually write /good/ sex scenes? So many are written badly and you are the best erotica writer I have ever read so far....and I've read quite a good number of them.

For the ones where the sex scenes are actually well-done? Well, my standards are simply if it's good enough for me to still remember it a few days later, which is only two of them.

First up is [[http://www.amazon.com/Good-Intentions-Elliott-Kay-ebook/dp/B0054E8QYE][Good Intentions]] by Elliot Kay. The sex scenes were fairly well-written and actually spent some time focused on the women's pleasure instead of being like other stories where it's all about the male enjoying a sex-doll of a partner. I also liked it because of how the sex was used as part of the plot instead of being gratuitous (at least not too much). I liked the story, but it's not too rational.

Next up is [[http://www.talesofmu.com/about][Tales of MU]] which I'm only 50 chapters into, but I really like how strongly the author is focusing on the multiple sexual relationships between different monster species with wildly different cultural expectations about sex. As well as highlighting the spectrum of unhealthy relationships to positive ones. The only thing I'm uncertain about is how well she's depicting BDSM and similar actions. It's different from what I expected, but I realize that my expectations were colored by popular media and trashy romance novels, so I could be just wrong about how being sexually submissive and dominant works.

They both involve sex as part of the plot and as a positive relationship experience like how [[/u/TimeLoopPowerGamer]] does for his stories.

Also, I was surprised to receive a comment from you within half an hour of me posting a comment on a thread where no one else had commented anything for about two weeks. Are you following me online?

Because if so, I'm actually flattered. I didn't think I was interesting enough to be watched by anyone. Well that and the fact that I kinda look up to you for being able to write something as awesome as SI.

Not quite; but my feedreader is subscribed to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/.rss]] with a one-hour refresh schedule, which, taking a quick look at [[https://www.reddit.com/user/xamueljones/submitted/]] , would seem to cover nearly all of your Reddit activity even without specifically following you. (Hm, /can/ I subscribe to individual account RSS feeds on Reddit? ... Well, whaddaya know, it looks like I can. That should let me add a few feeds of interest...) :)

******* Glad you liked. Got 30k more just for my unfinished works on AO3. Editing them all this weekend. Will publish more soon, that's a promise.

Wish I could publish like people on SB but I can't keep up that schedule right now--/publishing/ even 1k every two or three days would be grueling for me

I still write that much all the time, mind. More really. My folders are just full of unedited stuff. I just don't publish it because reasons. But my still unpublished HP smut with Tonks as a post-gendered, sex-positive, magical transhumanist bodyguard-slash-first for Harry will be my shining moment of fanfic smut. Just you wait and see...sometime in 2016, most likely. Sigh.

Anyway to recap, have a follow from me on AO3 and fanfiction for your upcoming chapters. ;)

  Tonks as a post-gendered, sex-positive, magical transhumanist bodyguard
#+end_quote

You need to do this for NaNoWriMo. /DDDDDooooo it!/

So many writers just use Tonks as a perfect disiusger, or even as someone who can become the woman of your dreams without even addressing the potential psychological issues that might have (does he love me for me, or just who I can become?) or even take advantage of the more esoteric uses of her ability (hello eternal youth and quick route to super-strength). The closest was someone commenting that her clumsiness could be due to her body-shape and mass changing so often that her brain just can't learn the proper muscle memory quickly enough before her body changes again.

******* I think what you're looking for might be best termed "rational romance"--long form stories about people and relationships, in a rational plot situation where "just because" and "revenge on the enemy skank" isn't the driving force, but with a firm promise of "they will" in the...err....end. Yeah.

******** Actually it would probably also be awesome to just have them have a healthy relationship already early on/from the beginning. You know, intelligent stories where love and/or sex is neither the main focus of the story nor something kept in the background.

Or maybe I myself don't know what I want due to the lack of finding such things often enough to compare them to each other.

*** Regarding protagonist's amorality: in Buffy Universe becoming a vampire means that the original person “dies” and a “soulless” demon inhabits their body afterwards. Being “soulless” in turn means that a vampire doesn't care much about morality and generally lacks compassion and empathy.

There was a lot of drama strewn around this with two major characters. I'm guessing later on Jack will either recover his soul or discover that it's gradually “recovering” with time.

** Little help here, what's all of [BTVS SI] stand for?

I've watched all of Buffy, way back when, and just tried reading this. It seems interesting, think I'm going to keep going, but I'm confused. Either I'm forgetting a ton of Buffy (which is very possible) or all this starling / mother / father stuff is not part of Buffy cannon?

Thanks.

*** It's not Buffy canon. It's Jack being a touch obsessed with Family, and also a bit... other than sane.

starling is just... Dru being Dru while describing a character that came from outside of her world.

Mother is Drusilla, because she's a woman, and she created him.

father is the human SI that he was made out of.
