** Scorch squads, oh fuck. Makes sense in a horrifying way though, interesting way of spinning the 'why doesn't magic impact economy' question.

I had to put my laptop aside and kinda just process while the consequences of this cascaded. I'm still awed. Great job. I was losing interest in the story (I don't follow the discussions, just the story only quest) a bit between chapters 45-55, but sign me up for /this/ ride!

***** I strongly suggest getting involved in the discussions; they're great fun, even if you don't actively vote, just reading and talking is fantastic.
