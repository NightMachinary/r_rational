Rational Banjo-Kazooie: Chapter 2

​

_______________________________________________________________________

​

Banjo sighed with relief as he broke through the underbrush and saw the mountain looming before him. He'd gone exploring Fungi Forest but never anywhere near this deep; nowhere he'd ventured in the wilds compared to the days he'd just been through.

​

He felt nervous about Tooty locked up in that tower alone but Bottles had assured him the witch's plans were firmly delayed. "She stiffed the contractors on her latest lair renovations. It was easy to get a guy on the inside to make sure what we needed to break down, broke down hard".

​

Banjo felt a rage start coursing when Bottles let on they'd intentionally let Gruntilda think it was time to capture Tooty. The mole had fixed him with a steady look from behind his thick-rimmed glasses. "You know how these things go".

​

Banjo did. And that's why he was out here, three days in the opposite direction of the tower holding his sister, looking for some "shaman" to "teach him magic". But he knew how these things went. Reshouldering his backpack, Banjo started on the last leg of his journey.

​

________________________________________________________________

​

The mountaintop was serene compared to the lands it overlooked. Lush grass, stout trees, the churn of a waterfall casting its hypnotic backing over the soundscape... in the distance it looked like the jungle Bottles mentioned peeking through the canyon wall. As far as he'd dared roam bear country as a teen the lands behind Razor Ridge were firmly off limits to any warm-blooded creature...

​

After he'd made it big on the racing circuit he'd taken a blimp down to Autumn Heights in the South Seas for the Tricentenniel Horntop Hop; that glimpse of the legendary Donkey Kong Island in the distance sparked frissons of the unusually serious warnings his older friends and relatives had given him against staying away from such places.

​

Banjo shook his head. He was looking for a village, and it was probably not deep in the foliage. He spotted a trail up the hillside and began trudging his way, hoping it wouldn't be far.

​

__________________________________________________________________________

​

The village was exactly as it had been described. In fact Banjo had been hoping for something more primal but even the totem in the center - JubJub? - was simply hewn, its rough gem eyes set uneven, without craft.

​

The villagers began to stir from their huts as chatter noticed this stranger watching from the hill. Purple, bulbous-nosed with bright red feathers stuck at a jaunty angle from their headbands... as they began wildly pointing and yelling among themselves a masked figure stepped out from the largest, farthest hut against the canyon wall.

​

Given a reason to draw his attention the hut's shape resolved to a skull in Banjo's perception, crude but stylized once you got the idea. The shape of the mask enclosing the man's head standing on its stoop helped contextualize it well enough.

​

"Ah! Eekum-Bokum!" called the masked figure. He rattled his totem-stick overhead and the villagers began chanting, stomping their feet rhythmically as to make the entire mountain quake. Banjo felt the earth shift under his feet and steadied himself, his heart spiking.

​

"Ah, hello!" Banjo called out in return. "Bottles the Mole sent me, to find the shaman Mumbo Jumbo?"

​

The figure smiled mischievously from beneath his mask slit. "Ah, yes! And it seems you have succeeded! Congratulations!" He rattled his totem harder and the mountain began trembling anew.

​

Feeling uncertain but unthreatened, Banjo started forward. Seeing the stranger unafraid to join them the tribe put up a cheer and began dashing this way and that like a mound of disturbed insects, gathering armfuls of food and firewood and piling it in the center of the village underneath their idol.

​

Mumbo had walked down to greet him, slapping him on the shoulder. "Bear! Friend. Come, join us for jubilee. Jublin Jubilee!" He threw up his arms and everyone rang out in reply. Banjo smiled. "Guh-huh!"

​

________________________________________________________________________

​

He'd seen some heaping bonfires staying with his cousin Brash - his competitive spirit meant he always tried to throw the biggest ragers, topping last month's all summer long. But those wildest teenage nights looked like a damp huddle-near next to the fervor with which the Jublins threw themselves into this celebration. As Mumbo explained, "Autumn harvest, spring renewal, winter remembrance. Not enough parties!".

​

As the flames leapt higher in sheets and piles they began tossing entire bales of strange-smelling leaf into the center. The acrid smoke made Banjo's nostrils burn but it was well matched to the simple wines and fermentations he kept getting offered in wide bowls; before long he was dancing and clapping to their music with an intensity that delighted the younger tribespeople and brought a gleam to the elders' eyes.

​

Every villager wanted some time with this novel figure stepped out of stories from who-could-tell. Banjo found himself being pulled this way and that, into huts where they'd wave tablet sketches in his face and point excitedly at different details; he didn't remotely know the language but tried to appreciate what they wanted to show him and responded with broad, simple gratitudes.

​

Looking back into the blear of the early hours Banjo could never tell when unconsciousness finally stole over him.

Here's Chapter 3 until that renders out. This is the money shot, the John Locke crying out about his aborigine destiny from his wheelchair. It's a glimpse of how far I'm willing to take this reconstructed universe if you'll join me

*** Chapter 3

​

He came to on a broad reed floor, a hut flickering in a ring of torches. Banjo rubbed his paws against his eyes blearily as he sat up, trying to deny the pounding headache and swirling displacement as he oriented.

​

Mumbo was sitting on a throne - more of a deep chair, woven - looking down on him keenly, immense blue eyes almost glowing in the dancing shadow. He waved his totem-stick lazily over the armrest conjuring the briefest sparks from the cap. Banjo squinted - well he'd have been squinting anyway - and sure enough it was recognizably a skull.

​

"Your first look is my Mumbo magic stick?" Mumbo asked curiously. Banjo dipped his head.

​

"Ah... sorry. Just didn't get a chance to see it earlier."

​

Mumbo nodded. "Often don't get a chance to see everything we want. Gotta keep your neck turning!"

​

Banjo grinned. "Seems like that'd be kind of tough with the mask".

​

Mumbo laughed, his jittering wand erupting a veritable shower of pink; throwing the hut's decor into sharp relief. If Banjo had wanted primal here it was - if only the flash hadn't sent a shockwave across his nerves. What he remembered of those walls in the moment before his eyes screwed would long stick with him in that timeless drift before sleep, until later adventures wrought worse torments upon his twilight ponders.

​

"I suppose this is your hut. Also skull themed?"

​

"Yes! Well, no. Shaman hut. But Mumbo shaman, so my hut".

​

Banjo angled himself to kneel, pulling the soft cushion that had laid beneath him head to spare his knees. Mumbo watched how methodically he shifted with faint amusement. "Perhaps Bear do it up too hard last night?"

​

Banjo laughed. "I don't know that I've ever done it up harder. You Jublins know how to do".

​

Mumbo smiled, its warmth dulled by the mask enveloping his face. "Yes. But also important for first lesson in Mumbo magic"

​

Banjo nodded. "Good. I was hoping we could get right to it. I don't know what Bottles told y-"

​

"Thought you wanted to get right to it".

​

Banjo chuckled. "Allright. When do we start, then?"

​

Mumbo cocked his head, wide eye impossibly expanding...

​

"No way. With this hangover?"

​

"Like I say. Important for lesson. This also help with both". Mumbo waved his totemstick in a wide, lazy circle; instantly the torches changed to a dark bright blue. Within moments Banjo lost sense of his distance to the torches, or to the walls or Mumbo; or their relation to each other.

​

"I've never... met that many clans who burnt plants to feel out of their mind"

​

Mumbo's mask didn't move; the purple of his body receding under the hue's cast.

​

"...so what's the lesson?"

​

Mumbo raised his stick. "Mumbo magic give power to transform. Thanks to JuJu, protector of Jublins. Shamans provide for JuJu, JuJu provide Mumbo magic."

​

Banjo nodded, his head swimming in several senses but following

​

"Very dangerous. Many seasons shamans only transform animals. Mumbo's teacher say, is that enough? Teacher cast out from JuJu!" At this both Mumbo's eyes widened. "He learn many kind of magic. Return to teach Mumbo better Mumbo magic. Also other things." The mask tilted down. "Is Bear ready for Mumbo magic?"

​

Banjo paused, not needing to consider but weighing the impression of taking the step seriously. "Yes."

​

"Oobidiba, oobidiba, oobidiba..."

​

​

​

​

Banjo was everywhere at once. He was back in the cabin with Ma and Pa as he took a hairpin pass to first place in the Willow Woods Invitational Cup. His friends were splashing, calling for him to dive and join them in the crystalline tranquility of Cotton Top Cove; surfacing he found himself deep in those horrible pipes with that... whale

​

Every memory and daydream and potentiality roiled around him and through him. Every fight he'd gotten into, every fork in the forest path he played out in endless permutation until he lost the thread of his true decisions. All he could hold onto, hold himself together with was that this was him, he felt like himself; recognance, on an intuitive level.

​

A vein of attention like a thread caught suddenly in the light; every wilderness adventure and day spent exploring consumed his train of thought. He tried to keep grasp the rest of it, the everything-else that was himself but the concepts decayed as he fumbled for all at once.

​

He crested strange vistas: goliath monuments, islands in the clouds, prehistoric landscapes with dinosaurs out of picture books. He wrestled with a living torch in the deepest recesses of a vast machine. More wonder and impossibility than he could take in all at once and he found himself whiting out in the corners of his...

​

Like a puzzle-toy shifting its faces to reveal new colours he unfolded a twin to every moment, a doubling of self that overwhelmed his sense of self. FEAR and GREEN and... banana?

​

The dissonance gave him anchor but he'd long lost any pattern in the timeless deluge; looking from ape to bear and bear to ape, their every experience and subliminal thought perfectly balanced against the other he couldn't conceive there was ever a him that had been either. The notion of individuation disappated and the being of every Gruntling and Gnawty and God-head..............

​

The pole of the ape and bear but that collapses into singgularity, deepest elements inverted. The crocodile, fierce, bulbous and manic as the witch grows fell and deep - their forests bleeding ghastly and whimsical into each other and everywherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

​

"OOMENAKA!"

​

​

​

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

​

​

​

He looked down at himself, spreading his arms.

​

"Whoooaah" said Banjo the Squirrel.
