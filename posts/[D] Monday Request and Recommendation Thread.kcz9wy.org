Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** These threads have given me so many fun recommendations during this slow lockdown year, I figure it's time to throw some recc's back.

Shadow of Angmar, a Harry Potter - Lord of the Rings crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]]

Rather than returning from King's Cross to the final battle with Voldemort, Harry is summoned across the worlds by the Witch-King of Angmar during the fall of Fornost, a little over a thousand years before the War of the Ring. The Witch-King thought he was summoning Morgoth. He is... displeased.

After being freed following the fall of Angmar, Harry travels across Middle-Earth, trying to understand this strange world he's wound up in, adjust to using his magic without a wand, and above all, find somebody who can help him find his way home.

​

/The Beast of Beacon/ , a RWBY fanfiction.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13504249/1/The-Beast-of-Beacon]]

It is set in an alternate timeline in which Adam Taurus decided to follow Blake after her departure from the White Fang and join Beacon Academy himself. Throughout the story he attempts to fit into an unfamiliar environment in hopes of reconciling with his former partner.

I think the character of Adam , the abusive undertones of his relationship with Blake, and the portrayal of Faunus and racism are better presented here than in the show. And don't worry, this is not an Adam/Blake story.

*** I want to second the Shadow of Angmar; Harry makes pretty good choices, works with limited information, experiments with the environment he's in, and so on.

On top of that, the world building works well with what Tolkien had and the quality is good. It really feels epic, in that slow, wondrous way that the original LOTR had.

** This is gonna be a very niche request, but is there a xianxia where the protagonist actually acts as if he's in a world where offending/fighting the wrong person means death?

Meaning they avoid confrontation, try their hardest to fly under everyone's radar, obsessively take precautions, only take fights when they are almost certain that nothing can go wrong, run from wars and mainly build their power through safe methods and by outlasting reckless cultivators.

So far the closest I've gotten are protagonists that nominally admit how stupid drawing attention is, and then end up being the center of attention anyways. So, are there any stories where the MC is actually averse to risk?

*** A Mortals Journey to Immortality is about a guy with average cultivation talent, trying to lay low and stay off the radar. Although he takes some risks as he gets a higher cultivation level, he avoids pointless conflict and picks his battles.

My Senior Brother is Too Steady is about a guy who is extremely paranoid and wise to the xianxia tropes. Whenever he acts, he hides his true capabilities and identity, uses remote controlled disposable clones and makes backup plans for his backup plans. If he didn't get dragged into matters due to pure chance, he would be perfectly content sitting in his mountain cave for countless millennia cultivating.

My Senior Brother is Too Steady is supposed to be premised on this, but I found it uninteresting for other reasons. The protagonist of Lord of the Mysteries does a moderately decent job at this, doing things like maintaining multiple identities and doing divinations every time he takes a serious action.

**** I strongly de-recommend Warlock of the Magus World. It talks about "particles" and "radiation" and "energy" but the magic system isn't hard or scientific at all; it's just science as attire. The protagonist is intolerable and even though he is competent, the AI chip in his head (which he got by pure never-explained coincidence) makes the majority of his power once he hits a decent level of cultivation. The first arc is good and the Purgatory World arc is also good, but overall I wouldn't recommend it. The only strength it has is its scheming; the good arcs are the ones where the scheming is the most frequent and important.

*** I just started reading A Will Eternal by Er Gen, and it seems to be what you're asking for; The MC's goal is to live forever, and he is avoiding fights and practicing cultivation. I don't know if this will keep up, but worth a try.

Update: I dropped it. The MC will eventually take absurd risks for people who are essentially hostile acquaintances. The MC also progresses absurdly better than others, with pretty much no explanation given; I have already read (partially) RG, ISSTH, POT by Er Gen, and they were all much better plotwise. AWE is not bad in humor though.

I wouldn't call Attack on Titan rational, but mostly for other reasons, mainly:\\
- the 3DMG is cool and all, but there's no fucking way it's the most practical or feasible way to fight Titans, especially for a society that seems otherwise stuck somewhere around the Renaissance, technology wise;\\
- also, while the Titan shifters are certainly a huge threat, it's hard to believe that giant, slow, lumbering idiot Titans, stupider than most animals, could be that much trouble for humans with weapons and horses, even if they're hard to kill;\\
- lots of informed ability, very little shown in the way of it. No, you will not convince me that Erwin casualty-rates-of-90% Smith is a "good commander" just by having multiple characters saying so;\\
- way too many rules about how Titans work (especially in the last arc of the manga) that seem contrived and are suspiciously plot convenient, being revealed just at the right time.

It's still a really good manga, but it's not perfect writing and works more at a level of political/philosophical themes than as a fully believable fictional world with a unique magic phenomenon.

Is there any satisfying /regression/ fantasy? Could it be done?

/Pact/ could be classified as a regression fantasy and what I read of it I found distinctly unsatisfying. The protagonist keeps (unrealistically) surviving, while losing parts of himself and failing to achieve his goals.

**** I just finished it. I really appreciate how the story subverts the "adventure kid" trope a bit by giving the protagonist actual interpersonal and behavioral consequences.

Hilda's self-reliance and unchecked confidence leads to to her becoming increasingly arrogant and reckless, and incurs actual costs on her relationships. She becomes dismissive of authority, which negatively affects her relationship with her mother, despite very lenient and hands-off parenting. I was a bit disappointed that she didn't actually fail more starkly as a result of her flaws and that way incur some character growth(her mom getting hurt in the last episode, for example), but it is a kid's show after all, so it's fine.

I look forward to the next season.

Yes, the game is buggy as hell. Yes, there are legitimate complaints about game systems and questlines. But it's absolutely gorgeous (even on my decrepit gaming laptop (GTX970M/intel i7 4720HQ)), has engaging characters, has phenomenal music, and touches and (and to a limited extent, explores) transhumanist concepts of interest to the [[/r/rational]] community (though I was a little confused by their indirect anti-immortality stance, even though so much of the game is about fighting death.)

I had a solid 30 hrs of fun getting through the main story and a number of the sidequests, and expect at least another 5-10 even before any DLC/updates come out. Well worth it for my money, and once they start issuing discounts the deal will get even better.

The things that make that recommendation controversial (at least that I was aware of) were more, uh, ethical/moral. Mostly that CDPR crunched the hell out of their employees, and also that it fucked up anything gender-related in the fetishistic directions in both their marketing and their actual in-game implementations/representation. Neither of which ought to be encouraged with wallet-voting.

Fair warning that I've not personally extensively researched either of those claims myself, but what I saw seemed pretty convincing, especially on the crunch front.

As for the sex/gender stuff, I essentially ignored all the marketing and went in blind (and not specifically looking for it.) I wouldn't say there are no problems to be found with their representation, but I would say that I personally did not find any problems: the treatment of sex and gender in cyberpunk seemed relatively in line with what I'd expect from a cyberpunk dystopia with omnipresent body modification; it didn't take me out of the world, at least. In fact, the deliberate hypersexualization of literally everything played firectly into the game's lore pretty well.

Well, from a purely utilitarian perspective, that is /exactly/ the kind of thing you consider. By buying the product you encourage the practice, because you help make it pay off. If you universalise your behaviour, "everyone refuses to buy games produced with crunch" would be a surefire way to end crunch forever. It only exists because many either don't care, or can't resist the temptation of the pleasure the game gives to them for the sake of a greater collective utility.

That kind of ignores that hardware and software has advanced over time. I don't think you can say, at least, that on high end hardware and the highest graphical settings, that it isn't among the top games out there for graphical quality. From what I've seen, it is indeed the best for graphics, though I haven't seen every game out there.

The other elements individually don't stand out, but as a whole package the sheer amount of stuff and quality of it as a whole does put it as the best RPG for me.

The thing it does very well that other games don't is that it is set up to be very immersive. The ray traced lighting helps A LOT with the feel of the environment, the character animations are all very high quality. But there's also another angle - the cyberpunk aesthetic aligns incredibly well with typical "videogamey" elements like UI overlays, crosshairs, scanning things for info, even upgrading items (mods/cyberware). Things like calling your vehicle, fast travel points, even down to enemies mostly becoming aware of you at the same time if one detects you (or a camera does), all the elements make sense diegetically. So a combination of very well done environments, lighting, and characters as well as thematically well integrated gameplay elements does a great job of pulling you in to engage with the story - arguably the best part of the game.

** I check out the trending stories of RoyalRoad pretty frequently to find new stories to read. From the past few weeks these are the one's I've found to be decent or enjoyable:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37951/re-monarch][RE: Monarch]] - A time-loop story in the vein of re:zero/MoL. It's not very far in so far, but it's decently written with a character who has to struggle through his problems. An aspect I liked about the story is that the main character is reflective on how he approached life and learning. MC also isn't the smartest/strongest character in the series, with the author stating that "a theme of this story is that power comes slowly and often at great cost" . Definitely seems like it will go more towards the tragedy side of a time-loop with a moving save-point he has no control over. I'm really enjoying it so far and would recommend it.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36735/the-perfect-run][The Perfect Run]] - Another time-loop story, almost completely the opposite of the first. By the same author as "Never Die Twice" and "Vainqueur the Dragon", and definitely not rational. It's a bit quirky/zany in the beginning, but I found it easier to stomach once you realize the character has gone insane from the time-loop, and has regards for consequences of his actions. It's a more fun story, with an interesting world and powers, definitely not for everyone. The author is 3/3 for completing his last books, so you can have some faith it will be finished.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37934/sexy-space-babes][Sexy Space Babes]] - This is erotica. With such a ridiculous name, yet still good reviews, I decided to actually read it. I'm not sure of its literary merit, but I thought it worth mentioning as it has gender-stereotypes reversed for aliens, and starts with a male protagonist that thinks of this as a "good thing". It starts to slowly slide off into sexual harassment, concern about sexual assault, and a shift in attitude to how the main-character approaches sex (kinda). I guess if you're going to read erotica at least it has some social commentary in it, light as it is.

Superpowers come from magical ability, with magic newly exposed to the wider world. Magical power varies widely across mages and every mage gets one initial and unique ability (so that's pretty Worm-y) but can learn more.

As for wars, the great war against the genocidal China-equivalent got won about a decade ago by magically expunging their whole culture from reality, leaving it a failed state.

In the Britain-equivalent, poverty is high, crime is high, social stratification is high and they are out of colonies.

*** I enjoyed it a lot. The start is a bit irrational in the build choice, although everything else the character does is quite rational. He wears armor, plans his approach, gathers information etc.

​

It's really good, the setup for his build was a bit too forced, he's in a dangerous place without any information and chooses to raise a stat he doesn't know anything about that will provide him with as far as he knows no benefits but he still does it. A rational person would either add to it gradually or at least try to get some information on it first but other than that it's very good progression fantasy.

​

I like the author, all he needs to do is not write harem stuff like he did in his other stories and most people will enjoy them, who knew.. I want to recommend Wake of the Ravager to my irl friends, but with that cover and that start it just can't be done.

Frequently, but not always, geography is also messed up, either earth is jumbled with aliens worlds or humans are moved to another dimension. In this case, the plot is that all humans are given a choice of tutorial difficult, transported to a small test dimension, and must survive before returning to a changed world.

If you've ever read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]], this is basically exactly the kind of version of chess you'd train on if you were a general preparing to fight that sort of temporal war. It's a pretty baffling game because even if you're decent at chess it makes you feel completely inadequate - I doubt any human could fully master the entirety of its state space (the AI doesn't appear very good at it either). Small note, though, the "5D" in the title is effectively a bit misleading - the game is "only" four dimensional, as you have the two standard dimensions of the chessboard, time, and parallel timelines. Still. Really fun stuff!

*** I follow quite a few webcomics on a regular basis. Here are the ones I love most due to their high quality story and artwork:

--------------

*[[http://www.lackadaisy.com/][Lackadaisy]]*

A beautifully detailed period piece, this webcomic follows a wide cast of characters connected to the 'Lackadaisy' speakeasy as they deal with tumultuous times in prohibition era St. Louis: rival gangs, malingering revenue agents, and past secrets that refuse to stay buried.

The art quality is professional level. All of the characters are portrayed as anthropomorphic cats, but they act just like humans, with amazing detail in expressions, clothing, and scene setting. Like most webcomics, the art style changes a bit over time, but in my opinion the quality starts out high and grows to become truly phenomenal.

Example pages:

- [[https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=4][Early on]]
- [[https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=151][More recent]]

The webcomic is relatively slow to update (understatement), but it has been reliably and steadily growing since 2006.

--------------

*[[https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/][Outsider]]*

This story is a space opera set in the 22nd century, after humanity, having achieved spaceflight, finally makes contact with an alien civilization for the first time. Sadly, first contact proves to be an ill omen: the aliens turned out to be refugees fleeing a pan-galactic war of annihilation waged between rival civilizations. Armed with intel from this encounter, the leaders of humanity realize that they must inevitably choose a side or risk being wiped out by either of the galactic super powers. The story follows a crewman on humanity's scouting expedition sent to investigate each side.

The quality of the art is consistently high. The character style is a bit more anime-esque compared to the others I'd recommend, but the artist does a excellent job of meshing the drawn parts of each scene with the 3D rendered spacecraft interiors.

Example pages:

- [[https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider003.html][Early on]]
- [[https://well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider058.html][More recent]]

Like Lackadaisy, Outsider has often been slow to update, but it has been chugging along reliably since 2001.

--------------

*[[http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/][String Theory]]*

Sting Theory follows the life of an unethical scientist in a dystopian alternate universe USA where science has created abilities that seem supernatural. The aftermath of a catastrophic lab failure lands the main character in prison, his life seemingly in ruins, but powerful people lurk behind the scenes, angling to use him for their own ends.

Out of all my recommendations, this webcomic has the most dramatic evolution of style over the course of its story. It starts out grayscale and cartoony, but eventually develops to wonderfully detailed color palettes, scene setting and character design.

Example pages:

- [[http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/pagethree/][Early on]]
- [[http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/page-twenty-seven/][Middle development]]
- [[http://www.stringtheorycomic.com/comic/chp6-page-05/][More recent]]

I can't comment on the update schedule of this one since I haven't been following it as long, but it began in 2009 and has quite a few chapters already posted.

--------------

*[[https://unsoundedupdates.tumblr.com/][Unsounded]]*

(/This one has been recommended by quite a few people on this sub./)

This story follows two unlikely allies in their fraught journey to places they never should have ventured. Along the way the artist explores the depths of the unique fantasy setting: nations at war, conflicting theologies, and science on an uneasy leash to politics.

The artist began her professional career long before starting Unsounded, and it shows. Out of all my recommendations, this one has the highest consistent quality throughout, and the artist loves to play with the variety of her medium. She has a flare for breaking through the borders of the page at climactic moments.

Some example pages:

- [[http://www.unsoundedcomic.com/comic/ch02/ch02_17.html][1]]
- [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch03/ch03_04.html][2]]
- [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch03/ch03_29.html][3]]
- [[http://www.unsoundedcomic.com/comic/ch05/ch05_18.html][4]]

Unsounded also has the most professional update schedule out of all the webcomics I've ever seen. During posting cycles, the artist always uploads several pages per week until a chapter is fully uploaded (which typically means months at a time of steady, fast updates). Then, when the chapter is completely up, she takes a month-long hiatus to build up her page buffer again.

What starts out good, and stays good is: There's no status quo. It literally starts off with one of the main characters breaking a monopoly on interstellar travel, and all the ripples and changes that come out of that.

Every faction has goals and intelligent characters that do things even when the protagonists aren't visible. It's also complete!

Not really mainstream or entirely rational, but I recently watched this movie and was surprised at the fairly rational approach to munchining a portal to parallel realities where there's some time dilation when traveling between them. For example,it turns out that 1 hour in the parallel reality equates to 1 minute in ours (I don't remember the exact ratio) so they head into the alt-reality with their laptops to finish an app they'd been working on before an impossible deadline. They even try to munching the lottery.

Although it suffers from telling not showing a lot of the time, it has a cast of competent characters who all pursue their own ends fairly reasonably, and while some of them make choices driven by emotion, none of them ever really hold the idiot ball that I can recall.

You could argue he learned those skills in between the two movies, so that's not necessarily a problem. Infinity War and Endgame though are kinda inexcusable if you want to be rational, also because it's unclear how is Thanos not already fundamentally invincible when he has the Space Stone.

******* No, that's not the thing. Dr. Stone isn't realistic, but the reason isn't that the scientific principles themselves are ever wrong - there's an actual consultant for that stuff. The unrealistic part is how much labour they can pack in very little time, often without concern for other side tasks that would still have to be performed, and how good the stuff they build with very crude means ends up being. It fails (or rather, it purposefully ignores) economics, not science: there is a reason why hunter-gatherer or barely agricultural society don't have complex industrial machinery nor any drive to build them, and it's not just that they lack the basic principles, it's that they don't have the food surplus to even spare the time to make that stuff. Basically, most of the people in the village would starve to death (especially in winter) because they spent time helping Senku build his contraptions instead of gathering food.

That said, the manga's objective is obviously to be a fun adventure romp with a lot of informative bits about physics, chemistry and engineering, and an earnest love for science and its more human side. I would be plenty willing to forgive its faults just based on it being the rare representation of the scientific mindset as something not opposed to humanity and empathy, but complementary to it. There's a lot of great moments focused around how science can help people realise themselves or overcome their limits, and Senku, while being a bit of a loner, is also plenty appreciative of the worth of other people and knows how to be a team leader - even with his ridiculous skills, he's not just the lone genius carrying the whole narrative, there's a lot of contributions from everyone else too.

**** If we're talking comedy manga, can't avoid mentioning /Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to/, a clever and arguably pretty rational romcom about two very smart and very dorky teenagers in love who try to one-up each other with mind games to pull a confession out of each other. It's very funny, very character-driven, and often uses its setup to make some quite poignant and down-to-earth observations on how romantic relationships work, while often lampooning the worst tropes of the romantic comedy genre in the process. The only reservation I have is that lately it has had a bit of a penchant for going into more straight-faced serious arcs that are frankly the worst part of the series for me. Not awful, but a lot less believable and clever than the rest.

Also, seconded both your recommendation, and recently I've started reading /Yuusha ga Shinda (The Hero is Dead)/, which is very Konosuba-like. A sleazy, cowardly, good for nothing farmer kills the destined Hero who's supposed to defeat evil etc. by mistake, and is forced by a necromancer to take his place as a soul inserted in his (now rotting) body. Cue shenanigans as he tries to live up to a reputation he can't possibly match and/or shamelessly make use of it for his personal advantage, occasionally happens to defeat worse evils than he, and generally be a force for Chaotic Neutralness at best.

*** /Evolution Man, or How I Ate My Father/ by Roy Lewis is a 1960 novel about a family of cavemen during the Pleistocene. They're led by a genius and extremely self-aware (as in, breaking-the-fourth-wall, actually-knows-the-names-of-geological-eras self aware) man who has a great knack for revolutionary inventions that will define the future of humanity. They invent, among the other things, fire, cooking, and marriage. It's a really funny novel that I'd say has also some elements of rationality - not in the sense of it being realistic (as I said above, comedy trumps all realism in it), but in the sense of representing in a humorous and condensed way the kind of mechanisms that could indeed have driven our early ancestors when laying the foundations for our culture. That said, it's still based on a 1960 understanding of anthropology and paleontology (such as the very notion of prehistoric men living in caves...), so expect it to be a bit dated in terms of its science.

**** Just started reading this, and I'm enjoying it so far. I ran into a bit of an unexpected snag though, when I tried finding a map to refresh my memory of the series. Apparently getting a decent-resolution copy of the official Westeros/Essos map (that you can read the city lables on) requires buying the official atlas for $40. I don't think I spent that much on the first five books combined!

That paywall seems a little... unreasonable?

Edit: I found a fan-made map that seems to be pretty accurate, compared to the official one. It's not as pretty, but it's a whole lot more readable. [[https://atlasoficeandfireblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/asoiaf-known-world-new-mountains.png]]

It's an AU. 98% of the facts presented in canon are preserved, except for a few crucial details. And there's a lot of filled in details when the story goes places that are only barely mentioned in canon. The biggest difference is that it's a time loop so the actual story progression happens over and over again, sometimes fairly close to canon and sometimes dramatically different.

If you can't stand time loop stories, this one probably isn't for you. It might be worth sticking it out till like chapter 15, the loop structure doesn't change much, but Joffrey as a character does a lot. And most of the loops after that are much longer than a month or two. Some are like 20 years.

- Above all, a good translation. Ideally the writing would flow similarly to a novel originally written in English.\\
- A rational setting isn't required, but the protagonist shouldn't make too many Idiot Ball decisions. I'm okay with a story that doesn't hold up when looking at the background details like the world's economy, as long as the foreground makes sense.\\
- Tropes are fine, since I don't have a lot of xianxia experience. I'd be perfectly happy with a relatively generic story that's executed well.\\

*** Most of these are on Royalroad btw.

Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends is good, has some interesting main characters. The power system is very consistent and deep, and the author does this great thing of having interludes from the most powerful people in the world. It's just overall good (compared to other litrpg/xianxia). The main characters sometimes make questionable decisions, but most of the time the decisions are because of power interactions (power requires sacrifice, and whatnot). Overall I'd say most characters beyond a certain power level are competent, and that even if the protagonists seem OP, the author finds a way to give everyone powerful OP abilities.

Defiance of the Fall and He Who Fights With Monsters are good popcorn fics. Not too rational, has pulpy protagonists who always get a lot of power and popularity while quipping witty one liners (especially the second one). They are fun guilty pleasure reads.

I've heard good things about Forge of Destiny and The Path Unending, which both started as quests on SV and SB and then migrated to RR with nice edited versions. Same for Ave Xia Rem Y, which wasn't a quest but also migrated.

The Dao Of Magic starts off pretty meh, but it has some really interesting ideas and some interesting implementations of said ideas. Starts with a top level cultivator trying to ascend to the next realm, but getting smited down by angry upper realm cultivators into a much lower realm with almost no qi. I'd recommend it just to check out. I was interested enough to read up to the latest chapter. It's on hiatus now though.

There's Street Cultivation, which gets recommended here sometimes. It's on Kindle Unlimited I think.

#+begin_quote
  a guy surrounded by thirsty women he never fucks
#+end_quote

is /definitely/ what it will mean 99% of the time. Recently, a much funnier incarnation of the trope is found in the manga /The 100 Girlfriends who Really Really Really Really Love You/, which is a comedy about some dude who is literally forced by fate to have 100 girlfriends - not just love interests, literal girlfriends. So it's a true polyamorous relationship (that gets increasingly more ridiculous with each new addition; I believe he's somewhere around 10 or 11 at this point), and funnily enough, far from being your typical dense or perverted self-insert, the protagonist is instead this super considerate, super loving guy who treats all the girls with incredible affection and understanding and would likely give his life for any of them at a moment's notice without a second thought. I'd call the series wholesome overall if not for the fact that the ages of some of the characters would make their romantic association more than a bit questionable in real life (I think overall the whole thing is SO ridiculously absurdist and unrealistic, having also a habit of repeatedly shattering the fourth wall into non-existence, it's easy to overlook it as just part of the craziness, but YMMV). It's definitely a very unique, and for once, very /literal/, take on the harem trope.

Anime/light novels-inspired harems admittedly tend to take the "guy surrounded by thirsty women he never fucks" route. However, more recently different, much more explicit, types of "harem" and "reverse harem" fantasy/science fiction books -- think E. William Brown's "Daniel Black" books -- have become popular.

An Amazon Kindle search on "reverse harem" finds over 10,000 matches. Spot-checking suggests that roughly half of them have SF/F elements. A quick check of the ISFDB robot's internal database finds over 4,700 books with the word "harem" in the title, including over 2,500 "reverse harem" titles. And that's just the stuff that /hasn't/ been added to the main ISFDB database (yet). See [[/r/haremfantasynovels]] for more details.

The author actually tries to work out a halfway sensible far-future setting that still has human conflict. He comes a lot closer than most recent books to the sacred triple of "futuristic /and/ realistic /and/ relatable."

It's a lot less suffused with violence and sex than the author's other books; it's also a lot more upbeat in tone.

Interplanetary stowaways, cybernetic upgrades, legendary derelict navies floating in the interstellar dark, AIs contemplating the right of humankind to continued existence - there's a lot of space opera fun here.

The MC definitely has more power than ideal for maximum tension. The interest is "how will she handle this?", not "can she survive this?"

I think it's a fun romp, especially if you crave books that take their far-future settings halfway seriously.

***** I generally agree with you but overall I found /Perilous Waif/ frustrating.

On the one hand, the world building is close to brilliant. It's a great example of "hard far future sci-fi" because while there is some handwaving and clarketech going on, it feels more science-based and down to earth compared to something like the star trek setting. Critically, it takes the technology it introduces seriously and considers its effects on the wider world. Also, it handled the big AI question well (what are humans for in the future?) and manages to create a world where human(ish) main characters aren't obsolete.

Additionally, there are some fantastic story threads in there. There's the whole "Level 6 AI" plotline simmering in the background but there are also plenty of identity, free will, and consciousness/transhumanism questions floating about. Then there are all the space-opera elements which leave the setting open with basically limitless potential.

On the other hand, when the author's tastes (and proclivity for writing erotica?) shine through things get a little... weird. I mean, I'm not opposed to sex in my fictions, but this story hits all the cringe-inducing tropes (eg all women are lesbians, actual furries, etc) and some that are not cringe-inducing but simply ick. Like, I get that the protagonist "ages faster" so she's "older than she looks" but come'on. There are a /lot/ of things that raise red flags for me and some serious "men writing women" issues.

This is why I find /Perilous Waif/ so frustrating. It has a fantastic setting, perfectly serviceable fun characters, an engaging story, and countless story threads that could all individually be pulled out and spooled into a whole books, /but/, all this good has an uncomfortable pallor cast over it from the author's proclivities which make me feel like checking the local sex-offender listings.
