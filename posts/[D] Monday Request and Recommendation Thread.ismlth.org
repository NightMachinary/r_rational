Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

*** Really enjoying this so far. By far and away the best Xianxia I've read, though I'm only on chapter 26. So nice to have a protagonist who's only mildly selfish and not an irredeemable monster, (looking at you Meng Hao and Feng Yuan).

*** I'd say Forty Milleniums of Cultivation does it better than any other. I remember it being recced here a couple years ago and I'm surprised to never see it in recommendation threads.

Anything I'd say would be inferior to the quality of that recommendation, so I'd check that out to see what it's all about. And as someone who's been keeping up with daily updates, FMoC is incredible.

There truly is no other xianxia like it, it is cultivation taken to its rational endpoint, with modern or even futuristic advanced civilizations, multiple in-depth beliefs of what it means to be a cultivator, absolutely phenomenal characters and the best xianxia villains, and more.

***** Yeah, I felt somewhat let down when I started reading it.

It's... not really so much rational in terms of character actions - though the only actually irrational things I can recall are a few quick gags that have no real impact beyond the scene they're in. But the entire system of cultivation, and the worldbuilding, all makes a lot of sense in explaining how the world is the way it is. In some ways, the impact of that won't be as great if you haven't read any other xianxia before.

It's similar to Forge of Destiny -- not really rational, but mostly because the protagonist is just a kid. He wants to learn medicine and calls his rival a butthead; he's not really trying to minmax his cultivation.

Spoilers for the last few chapters: Due to [spoilers], the MC is now on his own. We'll see if this results in him making smart plays to rapidly increase his power, or not.

*** I always think of [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Reverend-Insanity/][Reverend Insanity]]. Not only is the prose, creativity, and world building in the very top tier of xianxia, but deus ex machina events that continuously save the MC and guarantee him "fortuitous encounters" are significantly less prevalent that in almost any other story in the genre. It's worth noting that the MC is a total sociopath, but I still consider it the best-written and most fun xianxia I've read to date. It's been recommended a couple of other times in this sub, but it still doesn't get the attention I think it deserves.

Thanks for the rec as well!

**** I'll have to anti-recommend Savage Divinity, unfortunately. Had a good start but lost itself along the way.

Forge of Destiny is really solid. Not necessarily "rational", per se, but generally most of the characters are reasonable, smart, and proactive. Stakes are relatively low and personal for the first book, but that mostly adds to its charm. If anyone ever wanted to see a "magic school" xianxia, this does it very well.

Heart of Cultivation has a promising start so far, with some interesting transhumanist themes, but the pacing so far has been a touch slow and it isn't long enough yet to tell if that potential will be lived up to. Tentative recommend so far.

** Hello, everyone! Some reviews, notes, and recommendations:

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies][Dark Skies]]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dark-skies
   :END:

- PROs:

  - Detailed description of pseuxo-Regency era culture, of stratified society, of problems that people of various classes have to face and deal with, etc.
  - Mostly well-designed and well-described incremental improvements of the protagonist, both in terms of magical power and intelligence / knowledge.
  - ActLikeYouBelong is pretty much a theme of its own in this story.

- General notes:

  - An interesting, somewhat experimental premise that combines regular elemental fantasy setting of actively meddling gods with something like /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Princess][A Little Princess]]/ (e.g. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie][Break the Cutie,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CinderellaCircumstances][Cinderella Circumstances,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment][Denied Food as Punishment,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOrphanageLady][Evil Orphanage Lady,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician][Impoverished Patrician,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterclassFriendship][Interclass Friendship,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook][Older Than They Look,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessInRags][Princess in Rags,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches][Rags to Riches,]] etc).
  - It's a slow-paced story, but features magical theory developments and magical experimentation every once in a while.
  - Exploitation genres are Angst, Hurt/Comfort.

CONs: Not particularly rational. Too many characters behave incongruently when they have to fall in line with the approaching plot development or have to quickly fall into orbiting the protagonist girl despite their otherwise strong personalities. • Recurring soap opera-type dramas, drama balls.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-menocht-loop
   :END:
The initial chapters thematically feel like a sequel to MoL. After the first layer of the loop, however, the quality of the worldbuilding starts dropping, as does prot's level of intelligence / quality of reactions to new environments and problems. This continues to the end of 'book one', at which point the plot arcs seem to abandon the prot-in-loop genre altogether, transporting him into the "real" world. That said, there are still some interesting ideas explored even in those later chapters, e.g. what would a setting look like in which a significant portion of non-muggles had Sharingan-similar predictive capabilities.

- Some other positive qualities of the story:

  - the author seems to have spent quite some time refining an accurate represantation of the setting they've decided to design
  - non-muggles inside loops display high tier intelligence thoughts and behaviour
  - good fight scenes
  - relatively original magical system --- no particular element of it is original by itself, but their combination is somewhat unique

- Misc: the story has some similarities to [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/185188-i-shall-seal-the-heavens][/I Shall Seal The Heavens/]] --- it feels like some specific ideas and plot arcs were taken from /ISStH/, and refined into their own standalone story.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dungeon-crawler-carl
   :END:

- PROs:

  - one of the few stories I've seen so far that features meta-gaming elements (in this case, gaining benefits from 'monetisation' of audience ratings, advertisers, etc). The upside to this is that the story can be used (by the author and reader both) as a literary discussion / analysis on the nature of the genre as a whole and that plot railroading handwaves can be made to look more natural. The downside is that the writer relies on such handwaves too much, with the eventual result being suffering story quality.
  - One heavily featured idea that I don't remember having seen much elsewhere is 3D manufacturing of full-fledged humans, with fake memories, on industrial scales (Blade Runner style).
  - The portrayal of the cat character is rather detailed, partially likely due to the author having such a pet himself.

- CONs:

  - The story's rather rough at the starting chapters (especially prose, and the style of System messages), but picks up in quality once it gains its footing.
  - The gamification system is not impartial, and the game itself has owners who aren't impartial either. This can be subjectively unpleasant, depending on the reader's preferences.
  - In some aspects, the audience ratings feel like just some numbers going up.

- General notes: Mostly a fun read. Prot and his team usually try to munchkin their way through, but the author often finds some excuse or another to explain /why/ they end up making supbar (or sometimes outright stupid) decisions to liven-up the plot and prevent it from becoming a full-out corporate-style grind.

- PROs: • Interesting perspective on what supernatual and extra-dimensional shenanigans could look like from the PoV of the local spirit that's messing with mortals, etc. • Some interesting experimentation inside the setting's magical system, creation of pretty artefacts and magical machinery.

- CONs: • Prot is OPed and gets an inordinate amount of beneficial coincidences, etc (even if those are explained away as indirect effects of his nature). • I think it has some recycled tropes and plot devices taken from /Release That Witch/ and a few others (e.g. attacking floating islands, the designated antag revealed to have had no choice but to have chosen the lesser evil, 'Blight', etc). • The harem women don't have particularly interesting personalities. • Has some smut scenes, but most of those are underwhelming and feel like they're just there as the pro forma requirement for the chosen genre.

   :CUSTOM_ID: infinite-realm
   :END:

- How to read: I recommend altogether skipping the 'past' chapters as distractions and focus on either just present-Ryun, or present timelines of both characters.

- PROs:

  - A few interesting scenes and ideas (slave's artefact, her escape, her owner's actions and rationale);
  - Interesting setting design element: a gamified setting that has existed for long enough to produce hidden conspiracies and forces at play, as well as powerful players that have their pet projects discreetly operating somewhere out there (e.g. the lich's auto-farming underground army).
  - Interesting character designs for other top-tier powergamers (e.g. interlude chapters).

- CONs:

  - False promise in the premise / title --- aside from the tell-don't-show, there is nothing in the story itself that would showcase an infinite realm. Both prots take root almost immediately after entering the new realm. Similarly, the story starts with telling how there are infinite iterations of Earth, but later on shawcases people from only 7 of them.
  - Prot's actions and behaviour don't match his background story from the intro chapters. Rather, those intro chapters are more just a backstory / training-montage analogue that's there to ease suspension of disbelief and explain away prot's overpowered abilities.
  - Ryun often makes excuses to explain his actions that are there for plot railroading --- if the plot has to advance from point A to point B, he will start moving in that direction, and the narrative / inner monologue will try to explain his choices in terms of some moral stance or another, even if those choices don't make much sense or contradict his earlier tell-don't-show moral values. He also has very little agency --- things just keep happening near him, and he keeps reacting to them in a manner of such narrative-enforced, inconsistent personality.
  - Both protags are rather template-cut and unoriginal, each in his own way.
  - In the setting, 1-sentence “epiphanies” can give a cultivator a power boost for which they'd otherwise have to work years or decades. Naturally, the protag is somehow a genius at pulling such epiphanies out of nowhere.
  - Ryun's morality / 'life philosophy', and even to some extent the story's global narrative are too simplistic and naïve. (e.g. things like “I don't lie, ever”, “I judge people by their actions. Even if I know a group of people is planning to betray me / coup against me, I'll do nothing up till the last moment because all the planning in the world isn't a definite action of betrayal by itself.” “I don't hold secrets about myself, and freely divulge information about myself, even potentially sensitive information, even to people I barely know.“, etc)
  - Many times prot makes a stupid decision, gets an out-of-jail free card by having a system-related epiphany at the last moment, and doesn't learn anything from his mistakes, keeping insisting that it's his “nindo” to behave that way.
  - Ryun has double standards: him v.s. others, others v.s. attractive females. Regarding the latter, he ends up helping and favouring one female character after another, even though he keeps talking about how people have to earn their own power and how nepotism is bad, etc.
  - The fights aren't particularly interesting, the setting is mostly a generic version of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ELEMENTALPOWERS][Elemental Powers]]
  - The global plotline seems to be headed towards the cliche of getting manipulated or helped by one god to end up killing all the gods.

So readers who have finished /Puns/ may consider giving this one a try • depending on reader preferences, the story may have some pretty creature and area designs.

- CONs:

  - False promise in the synopsis / title: the dungeon is not a thief, it's a robber, burglar, murderer, etc.
  - Prot has almost no agency (e.g. in its own words: 'I'd spent much of my time recently reacting to one situation after another') • makes rash and stupid decisions • has inconsistent personality, 'morality' • has ridiculous plot armor • unnecessarily aggroes at gods for something they weren't even responsible for at the time (earth elementals) and takes this to the extreme, immediately deciding to outright kill them.
  - Random things keep happening to push the plot, • the second half of the story is much worse in quality.
  - Too many cases of wishful thinking, contrived coincidence, extremely unlikely events happening, prot winning / surviving by the skin of their teeth, etc. • the setting not only has prophecies, but they are also used to handwave away poor and unlikely plot developments, to the extent of many characters acting extremely OoC just because they're aware they're inside an active prophecy and being affected by it.
  - Almost all 'enemies' make a chain of unlikely / stupid decisions for the prot to be able to 'win'.
  - The prose tries for being beautiful / exquisite, but ends up being excessively purple instead.
  - Despite the story's website status, it's not completed. Apparently it's just book 1 that's finished, and even that one ends very abruptly, seemingly at a random chapter.

- CONs:

  - Anti-recommendation for this one. There are two main characters: a dad and his daughter. For both of them their back-stories are being used to explain away why they end up quickly getting so powerful when compared to the native population. Both also make one stupid mistake / decision after another --- dad's PoV chapters are downright aggravating to read. The daughter decides to stick her head into serious trouble even when there really isn't any need to take such great risks. I've dropped this story around chapter ~40 (so these notes are only for that portion), but by that point it wasn't showing any signs of improvements and was only getting worse.
  - In general, it's a feel-good fiction (ego-boosting, HFY, etc) with too much wishful thinking. The handwave excuse for prot's OP magical abilities is his Earth-based knowledge regarding laws of nature, but most of the time he doesn't even demonstrate any deep understanding of such knowledge. Aside from maybe the lightening-related scene, those physics-related trivia are used more like a set of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NMoLJuDJEms7Ku9XS/guessing-the-teacher-s-password][teacher's passwords]] rather than anything actually meaningful or insightful.
  - The dad is a nonsensical pacifist. He keeps prattling about not wanting to harm or kill anyone one moment, the next moment suddenly jumps to being ready to annihilate an entire country-wide area of sophonts. In more general terms, 'cares' about human and furry lives but doesn't care whatsoever about similarly intelligent 'dark' creatures. Also doesn't try to verify in any possible way what the humans and furries are telling him about those dark creatures, believing their side of the story immediately and immediately becoming ready to exterminate those dark creatures in large numbers.

  - The dad also spreads dangerous knowledge even after being criticised for it and warned about it by several people, and after agreeing with them that what he was doing was stupid and that he should stop doing it.
  - The setting in general is also too much of a walled garden to not be uninteresting --- Stats, quests, etc can be given out by city administrators, etc. • The gods actively meddle and micromanage, especially when it comes to the main characters. The dad gets yanked into celestial court proceedings a few times after each creation of a new spell. • Any magic that is deemed dangerous gets banned and restricted on the Game System level • Game System itself is controlled by those actively meddling gods. • And those ancient gods show the intelligence of average mortals / beuracrats at best.

**** Cinnamon Bun has been a disappointment after a promising first ~50 chapters, not really doing anything interesting with the theme. The story has just seemed to clear a particularly dull stretch so hopefully the next section does something interesting.

--------------

Ar'Kendrithyst must have as many anti-recommends as recommends at this point, seems like a very divisive web novel thus far. I will say that some of your particular complaints have been well dealt with, particularly the father's inconsistent and sometimes dangerous pacificism. I feel like the author wrote himself into a corner with that one, seeing it as an interesting solution to the early problems that then made no sense once the story developed, but he's managed to write himself out of the hole mostly. And things like the flaws of the gods do have great relevance to the overall plot.

Nonetheless, stories that take hundreds of thousands of words to solve initial issues are never going to be good recommendations for a lot of people.

**** Ar'Kendrithyst hit the nail on the head. I tried it and ended up dropping it after a few chapters, largely because of how terrible the characters were.

Solomon's Crucible is weird in that it could have been good, but the author tries to make the MC some morally upright paragon of virtue who looks down on people who were forced into servitude. Luckily his family isn't forced to make the choice others were; his sister holds out long enough for him to come rescue her. The people he helps are good (especially his family and friends), while the people against him are bad.

What's weird about Solomon's Crucible is that it's by the same author who's writing Heart of Cultivation, which is really good, and in a lot of ways almost the exact opposite.

**** I'm going to throw a rec out there for Ar'Kendrithyst to counter your derec.

I will concede that the MC isn't anywhere near rational nor are his actions even always intelligent which is obviously a deal breaker for many in the rational community. To me however that feels balanced out by the world itself being rational.

There is no low-hanging fruit to exploit that aren't already exploited. Basic knowledge is shared and people that want to be adventurers are educated instead of everyone in the world deciding to keep basic things secret for pretty much no reason. The leaders in the world participate in real-politik and act rationally to the best of their ability, which of course includes the gods themselves.

The big contrast to me is Delve, where the MC is largley rational (aside from him deciding on a build without doing any research first), but the world is very much not and low hanging fruit are everywhere for people to exploit but rarely are with the most obvious example being basically everything that makes the MC OP being stuff that should have really been figured out a very long time ago.

I think it's important to distinguish between the concept of nothing -- which the denizens of delve surely have -- and the concept of zero -- which they really don't have a need for. I get your point about banking, but I think it's important to remember that (1) They're using ancient relics that they don't really care too much about understanding and (2) Any knowledge about math and numbers the bank has is unlikely to be distributed to the wider world.

Stavo shouldn't have a 5 story tower, multistory buildings shouldn't be a thing. What would fit architecture wise with their math knowledge would be stick and mud huts similar to the ones most europeans lived in 2500 to 1500 years ago depending on the area.

If you skip the other episodes but want the context watch episodes 10-14 before. Its streaming free with ads on Crunchyroll, but make sure you pick the right (first) season.

**** HTADADB has a really strong early game, just for how shitty the world feels. I thought the protagonist was funny and absurdly amoral. His periodic inner dialog expounding on how he wasn't misogynistic felt like an exceedingly specific denial, and was kind of offputting. Maybe that was the point? I'm not sure. In any case, I'd recommend it to anyone in the mood for semi-gritty absurdity and entertainment.

My enjoyment of the series peaked hit a zenith at the end of the Nekromel arc (Book 5), the Reqbar was a decent return to form, and then my continued understanding of the plot became extremely melty from Gorgoth onwards.

***** TL;DR: I liked the first book enough that I was kept strung along across all of them, and now looking back I feel only pain.

I liked the protagonist to begin with, but I found my distaste for him and the other main characters growing as the books went on, peaking by the last one, which I was mostly reading out of a perverse feeling of disgust.

I guess there's only so much 'lol ironic misanthropic self-loathing!' you can read before you get sick of it. Worse when it gets stale from overuse and repetition.

Add on the writer wanting to add a twist every five chapters, and I retreated to a position of not caring about any of the apparent goings-on, or whether a given character would live or die, because I knew I could expect every currently apparent relationship or live-dead status to be reversed/subverted as being a plot within a plot with a 50% probability within the next 50 chapters (sometimes repeatedly, for the same character), leading to me just not giving a shit about any of these people- at least partly because in the face of this, the main character just kept going, same as ever, without even giving a nod to the higher-level fact that his worldview of what was going on, who was on his side, who was alive or dead, etc. Was shifting at a ludicrous rate.

I think it's a case of quantitative difference making a qualitative one, maybe combined with serial fiction drama addiction syndrome: if you're releasing once/twice a week, it pays (literally, in patreon bucks) to have every chapter be as individually interesting as possible. So there's an incentive to have as many reveals and cliffhangers as possible.

But I was reading these all at once, as faits accomplis. So what might have come across as exciting and a bit hectic when you're reading one/two chapters a week came across as a stupid rollercoaster of mood/'basic apparent facts about the world' whiplash that was never addressed, because it wasn't the sort of thing that would seem to need addressing when you're following the story being released serially.

And there's something else about Moodylit's writing that aggravates me, that I noticed in the first book of the good student as well (the only other thing of his that I've read) that's hard to put into words: it's like, in his mind/rules for writing, the protagonist is never allowed to have dignity, no matter what.

This isn't directly what I have a problem with. The issue comes up when, in the course of the story, the protagonist happens to end up doing something good or heroic, or shows some strength or backbone, or thinks in a way that goes outside of their 2D predefined character. It's like whenever this happens by accident, moody quickly cringes back, as if anticipating being struck down for this sin, he makes sure to put that protagonist back in his place, with vengeance. Like he's conspicuously desperate to not write wish fulfillment, to the point that he smears his protagonist's face in the dirt in a conspicuous way that doesn't feel genuine.

In HTADADB, this is done mostly by pulling the rug out from under the MC and the reader ever 5 chapters, without letting the MC think about the situation on a meta level of 'hey, it seems like every few days all of my knowledge about the world gets turned on its head, either I should figure out a way to live that deals with this or I should just tune out instead of just acting like a brain-dead snark-automaton who behaves no differently than on page one of book one'.

And for all of this complaining, I read all of these fucking books. What's wrong with me?

*** I've been planning to make a larger post about this in next week's thread, but if you're at all interested in an RPG, [[https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/][The Last Sovereign]] handles this about as well as I've ever seen an RPG do it. Now, it needs to be warned that it's an unapologetically adult game, and a harem at that, but it you can look past that it's one of the most rational RPGs I've played.

The premise is that a perverted and incompetent, but frighteningly powerful overlord has invaded the continent and is slowly conquering his way through it. You play as a middle aged widower who has been escorting a succession of arrogant "chosen ones". After yet another failure, it turns out that he has been infected by the same power as the "Incubus King" that has been plaguing the land. After some deliberation, he resolves to use this power to stand against the invader.

Where the kingdom building comes in is that he takes a very rational look at gaining power. Knowing from experience that raw power requires economic and logistic support to accomplish anything, he begins building up an economic base starting with private investment, but soon resulting in taking control of a wartorn kingdom. This leads to a very well done mix of investment, economic and social development, and military preparedness, with a ton of interesting "guns vs butter" decisions that change how future events play out.

The game does an absolutely wonderful job balancing traditional RPG mechanics with kingdom development. Frequently the game's events swap between traditional "dungeon" segments, freeform investment/building rounds, and special events that can be anywhere from full fledged wars to tense religious summits whose resolution depends on what decisions you've made so far.

I know that some people can't look past the lewd nature of the game, but for those who can I'd seriously consider it one of the most rational RPGs I've ever come across.

Very strongly recommended.

It depends. The overall plot is very much not all-ages, and to an extent is a parody of other harem RPGs. That said, the most sexually explicit moments are entirely skippable, and iirc there isn't much in the way of explicit images.

I liked it, Isekai'd orphan in a feudal world where everything is out to get you.

Life Reset : pretty standard novel of guy turned into goblin and now must build up the race to take his revenge etc.\\

Brockton's Celestial Forge has base building, but it's literal base building. It's a worm tinker fic, where the tinker gets new powers every n-thousand words. It's generally really good, probably one of the best tinker fics in the fandom.

Wake of the Ravager on Royalroad has base building, but it comes up much later in the series once Calvin takes care of the most pressing crises and gains enough power to have a solid base.

Savage Divinity has base building, but also much later, and not sure if it's worth it to read that far to get to the base building.

The Dao of Magic has base building (it's on royalroad). It doesn't start off that good but steadily keeps getting better. Gets to a solid point and then the latest arc slows everything down in a bad way.

*** [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35994830][Kings of Paradise]] -

blurb: On one side, a disfigured boy must survive and get revenge in a harsh land with nothing but his genius. On the other, a rich, handsome prince in a tropical paradise has everything, but must find what he actually wants from life.

If you couldn't tell from the blurb, the two POV characters are basically opposite reflections, a theme that is present throughout the story and is very well done. Probably the best indie book I've ever read, and the sequels are also magnificent. My only quibble is its very start, which plunges the reader right into the intensely brutal action right away, and which is not very representative of the overall tone of the book.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][The Traitor Baru Cormorant]] -

blurb: A genius young woman whose people and culture was swallowed and subsumed becomes a cog of the machine of empire, charged with doing the same to another people and culture.

Very well paced and written well, does an amazing job at depicting its major themes of imperialism, assimilation, exploitation.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron][Masters and Mages trilogy]] -

blurb: A first year university student in an alternate version of byzantium gets caught up inadvertently in a conspiracy.

I love this story in large part for the first half of the first book which is an intensely introspective narrative of a young man coming to terms with his place in another world, a quintessential bildungsroman. The narrative eventually changes to become more plot driven rather than character driven, but doesn't really decline in quality.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40519-the-prince-of-nothing][Prince of Nothing trilogy]] -

blurb: A man who is the result of a millenia-long breeding program ventures back into civilization just as a holy war is being launched.

Gorgeous prose and deep, intense metaphysics. Pretty dark though, bordering on grimdark.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen][Malazan Book of the Fallen series]] -

blurb: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

3 million words and with hundreds of characters and plot threads to keep track of, this is the epitome of epic fantasy. Worth it if you can get past the first 1-2 books, which start out by throwing the reader immediately into the deep end of the pool, no handholding. My favourites are books 3, 5, 6, 10.

(note: this is not a fluffy wish-fulfillment story.)

If anyone has any other "reincarnated back into the real world" stories to recommend, please do. (ERASED is another good example of this genre.) Would accept historical or modern reincarnations.

*** Something interesting about delve is that I've found that its pacing works a lot better as a finished work than as a weekly serial. There's one contingent of people who complain about the story not going fast enough/the main character not gaining power fast enough (uncharitably described as 'the numbers don't go up fast enough'), but I think a lot of that is that the chapters release at a snail-like once-per-week pace. In terms of action per word, I think it isn't really that slow.

Another interesting point in the discussion of pros and cons of serialized writing: that style of writing which best engages an audience when the chapters are coming out every n days isn't that which works best as a complete, collected work.

This suggests that a work must either be suffer in popularity while being written, or suffer in quality in the long run as a finished product. Maybe there's a way to write so that re-writing/editing once the story is done is comparatively easy, but probably not.

Then again, it depends on the reading habits of those who read serial fiction. How many just read each chapter as it comes? How many leave off and come back after, say, 5 chapters have accumulated? How many binge-read a story up until the latest chapter, then forget about it for a few years, then find it again and read it all?

I wonder how you would try and figure that out. I'm sure google/big web data could. Maybe they have...

**** This is something that I have been thinking about for a few weeks now. I'm going on a bit of a tangent unrelated to your last paragraph, so sorry for the rambling but I kinda want to write this somewhere before losing it, at least it's on topic.

The difference between writing a book or a short story and writing a serial or for a magazine seems to be rarely acknowledged, even in fanfiction where the difference between authors who post 14k words chapters every few months and authors who post 3-4k words every week is so common and pronounced.

One could argue that writing is writing, and that as long as your work reaches completion that is all that matters. But as a writer the feedback and reviews that you get from a book, a monthly 14k word online chapter or a weekly 4k one is vastly different from each other, e.g. readers of a serialized work are biased towards short term goals and instant gratification because their response is an immediate one due to them not being able to look at the work as a whole until it is complete.^{^{1}} Meanwhile books tend to get a lot more leeway when it comes to slow build ups, slower pace, and a focus on the world itself rather than the plot/characters not only because of the expectations (easier to immerse yourself in a complete work, specially one that has been 'vouched for' instead of just being merely posted online by someone you know nothing about)^{^{2}} but because they simply can afford to 'bore' some of their readers since they can either skim/skip ahead or know that the action or development is readily available in the next chapter. Also, because of the sunk-cost fallacy reader retention isn't as much of a problem as it is with serials or fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  Another interesting point in the discussion of pros and cons of serialized writing: that style of writing which best engages an audience when the chapters are coming out every n days isn't that which works best as a complete, collected work.
#+end_quote

You're absolutely right about this, although it's not only about engaging the audience necessarily but also retaining it: keeping your readers invested, having them tune in next week, buying the next issue, etc.^{^{3}}

The golden path for writing a serialized work, the one that seeks to satisfy the most people (at, sometimes, the expense of the story's message, creativity, or the writer's wishes) is one where progress is being constantly made, one where you're not allowed to stagnate for too long, and one where regress is nearly forbidden and at best should be left only for the very end of the story. This doesn't mean that the protagonist has to win every fight and never lose, victories and defeats are only tools in your writing toolkit, no, what it means is that the story must always be rising, always moving forwards to a destination. The protagonist winning a fight, overcoming a fear, leveling up/gaining a skill/learning a trick, the relationship between characters growing, the antagonist becoming powerful or gaining allies, the world changing or reacting to changes being made, etc. The important thing is that the chapter ends in a positive note and if possible wanting more, win and lose, good and evil, protagonist and antagonist, those are conditionals, what matters most is escalation.

So, in contrast to all that, in a serialized work, it's important that you don't reset the progress that has been made, you can certainly play with the idea but you must always bring 'more' than what you had before. Your reader knows that the protagonist will go back to using their powers, your reader knows that these two characters who just had a falling out will get back together/resolve their differences, etc. what the reader wants to know is what all of that is leading to, they want the positive that comes from this negative (that they know isn't a real negative). The problem with negatives and with resets of progress is that they make the reader think you just wasted their time, and that's an easy way of losing them, hell even just the feeling that you went back to zero or that you have to start over is enough to sour them or keep them away for good.

This isn't as much of a problem for a book, nor is it if you don't care about maximizing your number of readers or are more focused on writing the story you want to write*. People who read books or binge long or complete works tend to have a higher tolerance towards negatives, glacial pace, minutiae, excessive world building and even character deaths. They notice the themes, metaphors, symbolism, parallels, and consistency much better than they would in a work that they have to read week to week, so they can handle something like the death of a main character because they can appreciate the aspect of the book that it is trying to reinforce (injustice, a cruel world, sacrifice, patriotism, etc).

I'm running out of steam on this idea, but I'll end it with this sorta obligatory disclaimer: none of this is absolute, merely the stuff that I have either noticed or knowledge from other writers I have shamelessly integrated. What I want to point out is that the way in which you distribute your work can influence the reader as much as the work itself does, and that what works for one approach usually isn't the best for another, so the best thing a writer can do is find the format the better suits their needs. Even so, all of this is a guideline at best, just like most writing advice is, because the more skilled and the more experienced you are as a writer the more you can get away with things that others wouldn't be able to.

 

1 - Also because of how fanfics and serials are structured (or the culture surrounding them?) feedback and reviews seem to dry out as soon as the work is completed or considered done. There will be reviews and some discussion, but it doesn't compare to what books get or even to what the work itself was getting during its run. I guess that could be considered the trade-off of having a 'live audience' willing to help you steer your work and improve while you're writing it.

2 - Not my intention to come off as a book supremacist here, but I think it's important to acknowledge the cred that comes with having a physical release and living from your writing as a professional. Not to dis little xXBilly_98Xx and his fanfic hosted in wattpad but ya know, he aint writing no Lord of the Rings and it's a bit unfair to expect that of him.

3 - I know this is a bit of cherry picking on my part and might even be slightly contradictory to the argument that follows, but keeping the reader engaged and keeping the reader reading aren't mutually exclusive. You can have chapters that are not engaging yet keep the ball rolling, what matters there is the context (the genre, whether you're building up to something, etc) and even technical writing skill (a beautiful prose makes reading even paragraphs full of nothing a pleasure to read). Of course, if you don't care about retaining readers and only care about engaging the audience then none of that matters, so long as what you write is interesting enough (or is a novel concept) you should be covered.

***** You're welcome!

Close to your request, but I expect you've already read: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake Of The Ravager]] (LitRPG, trashy adolescent power fantasy but very well-executed, main character lucks into overpowered abilities but proactively exploits them) and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Mother Of Learning]] (wizard school time loop, slow build to being a better and more competent person, lots of planning).

Much further from your request, only fanfics I've ever intentionally re-read: I Just Love Killin' (as you saw), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter And The Natural 20]] (funny and well-written genre cross, lightest thing I've read where different characters use different epistemologies), and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/loaf-worm-post-epilogue-humor-complete.467128/threadmarks][Loaf]] (the best and dumbest Worm fanfic).

Every good rec list needs something really far out there: Ever watch competitive Starcraft: Brood War? It's a game where two players try to execute complex, contradictory plans in an environment actively hostile to any sense of organization. Day9's [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgmCLtUkEutKY8IlwyVCUFoRtgQe3LCf1][Let's Learn Starcraft]] series is a good in depth intro to the game. The game's [[http://satirist.org/ai/starcraft/blog/][AI scene]] is also an interesting (and active) take on it. (The sequel is also a good game, but it's much more about reacting and predicting, compared to the original's disorganization and positioning.)

****** Yes. I've read the first 3, MOL only one I finished, Wake I got board off, for Hp, got board with the same plot points as other fan fictions.

I can try Loaf.

As for games, I have my hands full with every TCG out there. That's my cup of tea. Can't multitask fast enough to be good at RTS's, so turn based strategy is for me.

**** Is it good?

I loved the story until the arc where Hachiman abandoned his ambitious plan to turn Orario around and decided to just go with the, "flow."

I felt like the story devolved into a basic harem comedy one that leaned too hard on the joke the Hachiman was extremely perceptive about everything except the fact that a bunch of women had feelings for him.

***** I've read another of the same author's story, and a similar event ends up happening. Hachiman tries to over-optimize in a specific direction and emotionally hurt his harem, and gets a reality check once the girls confess to him. It felt same-y and not in a good way.

***** I think op!Hachiman said at one point that he knew they had feelings for him, but he didn't want to accept it. It makes sense for his character because a) he goes to great lengths to find rationalisations for doing what he was already doing (to great comedic effect) and b) he doesn't want to form close bonds to people, because he doesn't want hurt them when he reaches lvl 100 of the dungeon and leaves.

I wouldn't say it's a basic harem comedy, given that I like this one, and I don't typically like harems. Note as well, that hachiman most certainly doesn't want a harem.

** I'd like to recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35792/master-of-the-monster-system][Master of the Monster System]] it's an isekai from the point of view a monster. The author updates several times a day and it has a very good quality overall.

** Does anyone know of a Percy Jackson rational fanfiction? I'm thinking of writing on, but don't want it to be too similar.
