*** In addition, there is traditional literature that I would at least describe as /rational/ if not rationalistic. I.e., depicting smart people dealing with complicated situations intelligently and plots that aren't driven by stupidity or recklessness.

- *The Martian* by Andy Weir. Also damn good movie but the book is even better.
- *Anathem* by Neal Stephenson. His most underrated book IMHO.
- *Blindsight* by Peter Watts. First alien contact novel written by a guy who has a PhD in biology. Highly intellectual hard SciFi that is genuinely creepy.\\
- *Echopraxia* by Peter Watts. Followup to Blindsight and intellectually one of the most terrifying things I've ever read. [[http://www.rifters.com/real/blurbs.htm][Here]] are a bunch of blurbs to give you an idea. I'll quote my favourite:

#+begin_quote
  As for science fiction, well, traditionalists in the field now face some hard choices: either lobotomize themselves to dumb down enough to continue to approach SF without seeing the implications of what Watts is doing; or get serious about the science part of science fiction; or throw up their hands in helpless despair and go away and try some other genre instead. Horror, maybe --- because Echopraxia also manages to be more truly frightening than much self-styled horror fiction. ... I snarfed down this book as soon as it downloaded, and am writing this review at 6am after waking early to finish it. Recommended doesn't even begin to.

****** lots of little things.

for instance, I was at first sort of buying the idea that the aliens were non-conscious and transmitting to them based on pattern matching, up to the point that they reacted offended to the idea that the crew thought they were a chinese room.

First, that concept is unlikely to be included in random ship transmissions. it's also a specific cultural reference not just an abstract concept. the meaning behind "chinese room" can't be inferred from pattern matching the words themselves, it's like Star Trek's "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" - you have to grasp the underlying metaphor.

I'm also just skeptical of the idea of Philosophical Zombies in general. the idea that they are capable of fully simulating conscious behavior but aren't actually conscious is shaky to me.

******* The "hard" p-zed formulation bothers me, too. It's indistinguishable from an actual human and that sort of thing bores me a bit.

The /soft/ p-zed formulation is what Watts is talking about. Whatever data structures are being used, they've been trained on decades of human broadcasts, augmented by the Fireflies taking a "picture" of the planet, and are the result of many, many cycles of reproduction and survival. Markov Chain doesn't begin to cover it.

I've seen some /deeply/ clever chatbots before. Imagine if they reproduced and got "fit."

********* Well, "sentient" is a fairly particular word.

The model of intelligence Watts is supposing is still sentient, still intelligent, but it lacked self-awareness. It isn't narrating to itself "I am in a bad mood. I like going into new solar systems but the buildout part is a grind. I want a salad, and more lanthanides." It's reactive, but not entirely passive. It reflects, but doesn't /self/-reflect. It doesn't get bored.

Watts is proposing that the "self," the narrator who tries to explain why its arm just moved, uses up a lot of CPU/glucose/resources and has done so as kind of an evolutionary quirk. It might be a disadvantage, and gives us the vampires (who are a little ways towards ridding themselves of "I" and these alien invaders, who might never have had it to begin with.

********** yeah I follow. obviously the thoughts "I blah blah blah" correspond to neurons firing in a human mind, and you could have a mind that behaved the same outwardly without those thoughts occurring. This is distinct from hard pzombies, as you say. I'm not 100% sure this is the entirety of consciousness, though; it seems a bit bigger and squishier than that. I don't have to think about the fact that I am seeing, I just see, and that is part of my conscious experience. Do these non-conscious minds have memory or imagination? do they call up these memories and reflect on them, even if they don't refer to the "self" in a deliberate way? Do they plan things by imagining possible outcomes?

At some point the horror the linguist shows starts to seem a little false -- it's not that these are not minds capable of communication, even if they aren't self-narrating. Does it matter if you can communicate and understand their intent?

I like the ideas he's exploring, but I think at moments he falls into the trap of treating consciousness broadly, after having defined it narrowly.

*** I hope no one minds if I give my opinion on these, since completed doesn't always means good and I'd hate for someone to start one of these (mostly) massive works without being fully informed.

- HPMOR, Metropolitan Man, A Bluer Shade of White, Three Worlds Collide, The Last Christmas, The Waves Arisen: these works are pretty good, no real glaring flaws, funny coincidence that only two people wrote all of these.

- Ra and Fine Structure: the writer has a very long-winded, very confusing writing style and he's not very good at pacing or writing endings. It says enough about the quality of his ideas that I recommend you give it a try regardless. Just don't stick around if you are /very/ confused and don't like it, because it stays that way.

- Time Braid: This story has the main character tortured into mindrape into another person's servitude in a very edgy way. If that seems like the kind of thing you can give a chance, feel free to read it, but it made me stop reading.

- Luminosity: I think this is a rationalist story, but it misses all the fun parts of rational writing. It's just very very dry, even if it's excellently written.

- Worm: absolutely worth reading, but there are at least two long segments of the story that will make you want to stop reading (E and TS arcs). Don't stop, force yourself to skim if you have to, it's very much worth it to finish it.

If you don't mind if they are complete or not, just check the [[/r/rational]] backlog, there are a lot of original stories being posted. I'd recommend Worth The Candle (definitely rational) and Mother of Learning (kind of rational) out of them.

**** I've started and stopped reading worm so many times. I think it's the pacing - it just feels too episodic, like a penny serial. Each arc has a big baddie and she gets into a sticky situation where she should absolutely die given any shred of realism, but somehow makes it out through being scrappy. while the (*SPOILERS!!*) alternate timeline selection working in her favor early on sort of accounts for some of this, it's not always present and is still hard to swallow a lot of the time.

And yeah, after /that time/ with /that guy/ (everyone who read surely understands) nothing in the story is scary anymore because it's clear author will kill his characters when he wants to, and not earlier, no matter what the circumstances dictate.

And since circumstances don't matter, you quickly learn to not be scared of them. Half the body missing? Oh surely she'll heal somehow. Unless the author specifically wants to be a dick and kill her. Anyway, nothing I can change.

On the other hand, I had much less problems with pacing. TS? Whatever. It felt out of pace, but whatever.

**** Yeah, last time I thought the story was about to finish the author managed to find some plot devices for the MC to spend another whole book finding before the story could end.

**** Three arcs, first was 26 chapters, second was 28, third stands at 24. Chapter every three weeks usually, sometimes 4, so let's call it 3.5. Six months = 26 weeks, approximately 7 chapters, which brings arc 3 to 31.

Might be slightly less or more, but seems a good estimate.

** I'd like to point out that there's also a ton of short fiction out there, including [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][two and a half years]] of weekly challenges, with most of the winners being quite good (though I will admit to some bias there).
