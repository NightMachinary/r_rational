**** I think that raises the question of what it means to know it.

To sacrifice the secret of a buried treasure's location, how precisely does one have to know it? Can you just name a town, or a landmark, a distance in feet, or does it have to be coordinates, and if so to how many decimal places?

Likewise for a book - does just knowing that a book, or a certain chapter of it, contains secrets count? Or do you have to have read the book? Or do you have to have understood the book well enough to be tested on it, and if so, what's the required passing grade?

....

Outside of that question, it does not appear that secrets require active knowledge. Herr√∫n's temple was destroyed, and the damage to her was not solely because of the knowledge of the people there, but also the records---many of which were presumably unread, at least not by anyone living. She also mentions pregnancies not yet known to anyone as a kind of secret.

....

Even outside of /that/ question...

#+begin_quote
  It has to be something that is actually a secret, and that benefits the person, either by staying a secret or by being revealed. [...] The person making the sacrifice will no longer remember it

Just /a/ secret, not /your/ secret. So theoretically I could sacrifice someone else's secret that would benefit me by being revealed (say, a wax-sealed paper from HJPEV containing the secret of Patronus 2.0 [[https://pay.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2cg3qa/on_the_disposition_of_a_characters_effects/][^{WHERE IS THIS LETTER NOW, BY THE WAY}]].)

  The bunker would be useful, but the information probably won't.
#+end_quote

Given the question as phrased, I expected the information to be absolutely useless.

He asked:

#+begin_quote
  "What is the set of words in a language that everyone at this table understands that contains all the truths that we most need to know and that you will award us for the cost of only a single question, sorted by importance from most important to least important?"
#+end_quote

I imagined receiving a result like "the, be, to, of, and..." (or a similar list, depending on how one is calculating importance). He asks for the set of /words/, not sentences or paragraphs or whatever, which is bad enough, and then he asks it to be /sorted/.

He asks the /words/ to be in a language understood, but not the /truths/. ("I decided to use this set of common English words as a cipher for [[http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Tamarian_language][Tamarian]].")

He asks for his result to contain all the truths, but not /only/ the truths, (though including untruths as well as truths would probably fall afoul of a 'not deceptive' answer).

Given Thor's tendency to go literal-genie when he doesn't like the question, Jake was /incredibly lucky/ to get something back that "contains the opening paragraph of the discussion about the nature of the gods".

***** Interesting point. You're right, Loki could have done that. Maybe he didn't think of it...?

EDIT: I always had a problem with Tamarian. Leaving aside the fact that any culture needs a way to say "pass the salt", there is the question of base truth. In order for the language to be comprehensible by a Tamarian, they need to know the underlying references. How do you convey the underlying references in a language that consists entirely of references to those references?

And yes, I saw how Darmok taught Picard. I'm dubious about being feasible for everything in the language.

It seems like having Sir Poley and EY as advisors (not to mention some /actual/ military strategists) would come in very handy.

(Incidentally from the same conversation, "If you have a way to recover the secret then it isn't a sacrifice. That would probably actually hurt her instead of helping" suggests that sacrificing recoverable secrets could be one avenue for sabotaging the ritual.)

**** Rereading the last few chapters, I've found a few relevant seeming quotes

#+begin_quote
  she's the friggin' Goddess of Secrets and Knowledge. She's always been one of the primary allies that any god needs---or needs to neutralize---when things get serious.

  Once she's reified, she'll be inherently grateful to her creators, and highly motivated to help her worshippers."

  "Well, simply put, no. Starting a ritual like this requires abilities that undead simply don't have. So, no, he can't do his own copy of this ritual on his own ground and resurrect her before you finish yours, which is what I figure you really wanted to know.
#+end_quote

There is a motive for Afi and the death gods to get Herrun on their side, because she's insanely useful. Or to neutralise her. They clearly think they'll benefit from her being resurrected or they would have intervened. She's inherently grateful to her creators, and is implied to have her personality shaped by them. This may also extend to alignment. So, Afi seems to be probably sacrificing secrets to her from his army of undead, to shape her to be evil. Black seems a likely color for evil, so that part makes sense.

Either Afi has his own ritual or is using their's. Loki says no undead could start the ritual or on undead land, but Afi must have some living minions, so it's still possible that he started another elsewhere. But that would imply some strange connection between their flame colors, so it's admittedly less likely. So, that leaves him using their ritual. Could the dragua run though their camp freely? They're not exactly friendly. And no one has mentioned hearing invisible dragua say prayers or the flames growing higher, again counting against it.

And there's the ash mystery, which I have literally no idea about.

Jake really needs to take care of his PTSD. It's getting a bit repetitive. This seems like it might be foreshadowing of it making a real difference later, or just an adherence to realism. I am unsure

** I'm looking forward to the next chapter, though this one was a bit less fun. It was certainly well written and excellently, done, but most of it was centred on them not being able to do resurrections and the obvious truth that Afi had done something bad, not much new or actiony and it didn't contain much new information. On the challenge, reading the book...

Although there's no psionics... The skill autohypnosis (from psionics stuff) would be very useful. You can memorize 800/6 non magical words per second, no limit on font size. You could use it to find useful info.

I suppose he'll probably use polymorph any object to duplicate it, though I'd argue that true creation would better since the only stated limit is crafting skill, max 20.

It might be possible to bypass the antimagic. "Immunity to Magic (Ex)

A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. " Scholar's touch doesn't allow spell resistance. Depends on what magical immunity he granted them.

If you can remove the book from the library or block the antimagic emanation with a copper sheet (check exactly where it comes from) or use invoke magic you can then use scholar's touch.

*** Sure, no problem.

- Invisibility means no one can see you...
- Unless they have True Seeing, which can see through Invisibility...
- Unless you have Mind Blank which, in a world that works by revoltingly strict RAW, prevents True Seeing from seeing through your Invisibility.

The relevant text from [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/mindBlank.htm][Mind Blank]] is:

"This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. "

This is intended to cover things like Scrying and Detect Evil, but that's not what it says. What it says is 'divination spells'. True Seeing is in the Divination school, so Mind Blank prevents it from working on you.

As to the Ice Assassin: Afi cast IA on himself at some point -- could have been centuries ago, doesn't matter. That gave him a duplicate of himself (well, himself as he was at the time he cast it). The duplicate must obey his every command, so today he ordered it to put Invisibility and Mind Blank on itself and then go into Gr«´fhamr and try to talk to Jake and the others.
