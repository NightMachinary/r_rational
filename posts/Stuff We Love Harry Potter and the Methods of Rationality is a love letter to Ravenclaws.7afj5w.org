** This article is poorly written click bait, penned by someone who read the first third of HPMOR and no more. If anything, this article is interesting because it shows that our community has grown enough to be a target for click bait (even though we are not the primary target here).

*** Haha yeah I was not super-impressed by the content either. But that might be because we know a huge amount more about the topic than the intended audience. It's fine for the genre of "Hey, check out this thing that exists!"

**** For sure! I hope new people find HPMOR and get something out of it because of the article.
