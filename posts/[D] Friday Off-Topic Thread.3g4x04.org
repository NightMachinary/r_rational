Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I've recently been thinking about getting sued by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. I've had this idea for a steampunk/biopunk Tarzan book for a long time, but here's the catch; while a large number of the Tarzan books are in the public domain due to their age, making the character a public domain character (per the Sherlock Holmes ruling last year), ERB pursues people in another way. They claim /trademark/ on the character of Tarzan, not copyright. Since trademark lasts forever, they're not at risk of losing it unless someone challenges them.

So if I tried to write a Tarzan book, even one that was only loosely based on that character, I would almost certainly get sued by them as soon as I tried to sell it (especially since trademark requires that you defend your trademark in order to keep it).

But I kind of want to poke that bear anyway, because I think using trademark law to effectively keep a public domain character out of the public domain is total bullshit. The problem is that no one has ever called ERB on it; the cases get settled out of court, with either the literature suppressed or a "license" agreement reached, which is really nothing more than extortion. It's a very winnable case (hypothetically) that no one has been stubborn enough to weather.

So I've been thinking about how much work it would be to write this book so that I could get into a protracted legal battle with a large corporation. It sounds fun, if unwise.

**** Sneaking around the trademark isn't hard. I just think it's unjust that I'd have to do that, and I think it would result in a weaker story.

Fanfiction (for me) isn't about creating /more/ of the work, it's about /making a commentary on the work/. The very first draft of "The Metropolitan Man" was actually a genericized version of the flying brick superhero and the genius mad scientist, both scrambled enough that they'd be able to slip past copyright claims. But it lost the cultural connections, the dramatic irony, and a good deal of the voice. [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]] writes about a more specific form of this in his [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/other-universes]["Explaining Other Universes"]] article.

The Tarzan books are largely about a rejection of civilization. They're about the wonder and beauty of nature, along with the confidence and self-sufficiency of the ideal man. So the point of writing a book about Tarzan, for me, would be to turn that on its head. Civilization is /awesome/ and nature kind of /sucks/. But without that underpinning of what Tarzan is, you lose some of that message, or you have to spend some time building it up. You weaken the commentary.

I don't know. It always sort of bugs me in movies or television shows when they have to use the legally-distinct-from-but-you-can-totally-tell-what-we-mean thing with a wink and a nod to the audience.

** *Sex Change Pill*

Was reading some of the culture books, when the idea of a pill that allows you to change your sex got me thinking. (Sidenote: I really disliked how the fact that Culture species can change sex at will; that kind of ability would destroy any notion of gender roles, but the culture still seems to keep them).

Imagine a small, tasteless pill that can change your sex over 48 hours. It induces a harmless, but debilitating fever to do so, but once done, the transformation is perfect. Your organs and your dna all change, and you experience no dysphoria. It's relatively cheap, your sexual orientation stays the same and there's no side effects of changing sex frequently.

What do you guys think the effect this will have on society?

Personally, I think the female sex will be vastly reduced, almost to the point of extinction. The male body has several physical advantages over the female, and many females would seek the pill purely because (they think) they will get more respect as a man than a woman.

Within a few generations, humanity will become sequentially hermaphroditic. Everyone is born a male and dies a male, but some will change into a woman for procreation and certain social functions. I have absolutely no clue how gender roles will change because of this. Thoughts?

*** Fringe benefits: intersexed people can now opt out of that condition, transgendered people can presumably get their dysphoria cured.

Presuming sexual orientation stays constant through the transformation, I don't think that you'd see a substantial reduction in the female population. If people still cared about love, romance, etc. then women would have to stay women in order to be able to have boyfriends (something like 90% of the population is strictly heterosexual).

That's even if I accept the premise that there are substantial advantages to being a man, which I don't. It's my preferred gender in terms of utility, but the world isn't inconvenient to women in terms of physical strength; I can think of maybe two times in the last two few years that my wife required my superior strength in order to accomplish some task. The question of status is arguable; I think it's more likely that the erosion of benefits for men would come to its completion, rather than a mass migration of women becoming men.

Gender is performative and not strictly aligned with notions of biological sex.

The Culture says that everyone should ideally bear one child and sire one child, but you can conform to one gender through both. The Culture also has people who take on bodies that diverge hugely from standard. These bodies don't necessarily have any morphological traits that would allow you to assign a gender even if you insisted that a particular biological sex mandates that you have a particular gender.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That would take a long time. Most people put huge stock in their gender identities, strongly connect gender to biological sex, and view both as immutable. That would be enough to fix most of the current generation once free sex change pills were introduced. But it's more extreme than that. People put a lot of importance on the sex and associated gender of their children, and that starts even before birth.

If you introduced these pills and mandated that children must have free access to them, then you'd see a huge change. (Little girls know it's bullshit that little boys get away with acting out more and doing fewer chores, and they haven't had as much time to become attached to their assigned gender, much less their reproductive organs.) But for the most part, parents wouldn't allow their kids to use them. And then, by the time the kid is old enough to enjoy legal protections, their gender identity will probably be fixed in place and they'll probably firmly attach their gender to their biology.

Realistically, if you can change someone's sex whole hog, you can probably make it so they don't have periods and can alter their breast size at will. Certainly with another couple generations of research. That takes care of the most annoying parts of being female in terms of biology.

*** You need to synchronize state between each node. This is an interesting problem, and the design you choose affects so much about the experience.

The most obvious way is to have one consciousness running and controlling many physical nodes at once. This brings up many issues very quickly. Do you distribute the consciousness across the physical nodes? If not, you guarantee that the nodes can't operate independently; if one of them gets in a car that enters a tunnel, you lose control of it. If so, you find yourself splitting often, and you have to implement some way of merging back together later.

An efficient and relatively fault-tolerant way to go is to fork your consciousness into each node. Then, periodically, you assimilate the new memories and personality changes from each node in an elected master (in the distributed computing sense, not a political sense), produce a new version of your personality and memories, and distribute that to each node. But how long does that take? And can your nodes continue functioning (accruing new memories and personality changes) during this process?

You could have a dedicated master and a series of clones. The clones go out, do specific tasks, then return to the master and submit their new memories to it. Then they reset to the master's current state and accept new orders. This workflow and organizational change means you don't care about personality changes from the clones, which in turn means you /can't/ care about personality changes -- you always want to use the master to go on dates or watch /Grave of the Fireflies/.

You could have a series of independent nodes from the same base sharing memories. Since they are independent, they can have diverging personalities based on which memories they lived locally and the order in which they acquire each others' memories. This is the mechanism used by Pandora in CeruleanSlane's Atonement.

Your bandwidth is on the order of gigabytes per second (DDR2 is rated > 8GB/s) with latencies on the order of a dozen nanoseconds. Bandwidth between nodes is on the order of a few megabytes per second if they're in the same room and has standard latencies on the order of milliseconds.

Nodes are mobile. That's a large part of their utility. You can be pretty damn certain that one processor on a given node can communicate with another processor. You can be pretty damn certain that you'll have a node out of contact with the others for an hour a week. This, by the way, is why you can't just install Amoeba on each node and pretend you're still operating on a single node -- not only will you have a physical body dropping limp whenever it's out of network connectivity, you'll also have processes running on all the other node expecting that that dropped node will perform operations and report back results in a timely manner, and they will be disappointed.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No.

BitTorrent shares large pieces of static data. That's what it's intended for. That's what it's okayish at. Specifically, it's for sharing data between untrusted clients in a way that limits the amount of bandwidth dedicated to clients that are not donating bandwidth in turn. Here, you trust each client and know what code is running on them, and you want a protocol for low-latency communication with small amounts of data per message. If you used BitTorrent anyway, you /also/ need another protocol to share new torrent files between nodes many times per second.

Once you're doing that, you may as well send the files thoughts themselves rather than torrent files to distribute the thought data.

BitTorrent is the worst protocol you could choose to share thoughts between nodes.

This also /strongly/ conflicts with your idea of treating processing power in other nodes as if it were processing power on the local node. First of all, it's a huge collection of layers of indirection, and that means it's outrageously slow. Then there's the problem that bittorrent itself is absurdly slow compared to the direct node-to-node synchronization you get in systems like Amoeba.

You clearly haven't thought about how people would actually use multiple bodies, and you have no experience or coursework on distributed systems. Please think more and either study or gain more experience before suggesting how to create distributed systems.

The biggest problem with my post was that it was three times as long before chromium shat itself and I had to reboot my entire system. One artifact of this was that my explanations were half-assed because I didn't have the patience to write the whole thing back out, let alone the ability.

My analogy between neurons in different nodes was a hyperbolic statement. I didn't mean there were /no/ differences, and it was fallacious my me to exaggerate. What I wanted to illustrate was that there wasn't a filter between nodes. That the system was more like a big brain than a bunch of brains connected together. Information would travel in small packages, rather than large ones. The latter is how I imagined your system, so correct me if I misread some specifics.

I was making analogy with amoeba, not saying my system was "amoeba on brains". Assuming hive-brains are pretty similar to humans brains, then one brain is sufficient to control one body, two brains enough to control two. Think about how elephant brains are bigger than humans, but we seem more intelligent (obviously, to work, there needs to be left over processing ability that isn't needed to keep the body from falling apart).

If one node falls out of range, then it's not going to go limp. At least, it won't if the designer wasn't dumb enough to make outsourcing low level calculations a possibility. The network would for high-level abstract thoughts like "should I take over the world", not low-level stuff like "should this muscle twitch? should l up my heart rate?".

Furthermore, you might be forgetting that nodes don't take random walks. The network should have a practical understanding of what it's range is, and what the latencies are, in the same way your brain has a practical understanding of how strong your arm muscles are. If a node's about to take a long walk off the short pier, it can just tell the other nodes such, and they'll stop sending most instructions and messages. I'm imagining something like "hey guys, I'm about to go to the other end of town".

But I'll point to my excessive usage of weasel word qualifiers like "I think" to demonstrate that not only that I didn't think I put enough thought into it, but also didn't have enough confidence in what I had to say to think the statement was well-formed without being qualified by "I think". Also, the last clause of my post clearly says I that I was just posting what I thought a hive-mind would look like. Not formal, not rigorous, just a straight braindump of my vision of a hive-mind.

And I really think you're taking my post too seriously. It was 789 characters long. If I had been making a well-informed post, it would have been longer. If I had been making an actual attempt at specifying a distributed system, it would have been longer.

*** ((Warning. Wall of text!))

Well, in the Girl Genius universe, sparks seem to have some sort of mental advantage. Perhaps this mental difference allows them to interface with the aether at a deeper level than normal humans can.

How does this help your goals?

Let us assume that the aether is the fundamental underlying structure of the universe. Further, living or sentient beings can interface with the aether.

The power and depth of the mental aetheric channel is based on the intelligence and physical characteristics of the mind. A brilliant person might not be a spark, and have only a modest aetheric mental channel. An unintelligent spark might have a powerful, deep aetheric mental channel.

But how does the aetheric mental channel work? Every being influences reality around them to be as they expect it. Mosquitos can miraculously find you three seconds after you step outside because their teeny brains influence reality only slightly, but that's enough to minutely adjust air currents to bring them to prey.

So reality is, in actuality, defined by living beings. Some things are so firmly believed in by everyone and everything that it will not change. The Earth isn't going to poof, because everything on Earth with an aetheric channel expects it to continue existing.

That mosquito might not get a meal because the human they were attracted to put on a mosquito repellent which they believe works with a greater channel to the aether than the mosquito's simple mind can overcome. If the repellent was out of date, or untrusted for whatever reason, the human may not believe it will work with sufficient will to overcome the hunger instinct of the mosquito.

Sparks are capable of aetheric manipulation at a scale that few other intelligences can match. Things work because they THINK they will work. Newtonian physics is all they need to define the world sufficiently to be able to interface with the mundane world. This does not stop them from using the aether in ways that completely defy what we know of as Newtonian physics.

Because humans are visual creatures, appearance is very importance for maintaining and reinforcing reality. A big zeppelin floats because, well, zeppelins are big and float. Steam is a good power source because, well, it's visibly potent.

When multiple sparks work together, they can enter gestalt.

When multiple sparks work at odds, they can sense and intuitively interpret the work of other sparks to some degree. An intelligent spark can likely understand exactly what a less intelligent spark has done with the aether. Their mind allows a fuller comprehension. A less intelligent spark may have no clue what a highly intelligent spark has done with the aether to create a device.

Getting multiple, brilliant sparks into a single gestalt for a collaborative project can lead to amazingly absurd things, as they feed off one another's ideas.

In essence, Newtonian physics exist and are the default, but are not the rule if you have a significant channel to the aether. You could also allow for adrenaline spikes to enhance the aetheric connection. This would explain miracles like mothers flipping over steam carriages to rescue trapped children, and wild animals continuing to fight long after they should have died.

*** In this community the idea will be pretty trite, but "the whole world's a Sim" is an easy way to explain a purely newtonian world.

Bonus advantage is it gives a source for physics breaking: X follows certain rules because that's what X does, and getting these rules to interact in usual ways is how you get deathrays and giant orbs of glowing blue energy and why invisibility fields work on you and your clothes but not the ground.

Set the story on a planet going at very close to the speed of light through luminiferous aether - enough that the speed of light is subtly but measurably different in different directions. Interactions with this extremely strange substance can then fuel whatever you want, and energy pulled from the relative velocity of the planet and the aether in much the same way that Europa is deorbited in /Accelerando/.

*** Mercedes Lackey wrote a lot of female or female-identifying fantasy.

Robert Jordan also wrote a lot of very important secondary female characters in the Wheel of time series. In fact, there were more important female secondary characters than male ones.

The sci-fi and adventure audience does tend to be male-centric. I'm sure there are more female readers of both genres now than there were decades ago, but successful writers tend to write for larger audiences. Market dynamics would tend to be something agents and editors are looking for, I'm sure.

And there we see the unstable equilibrium.

Let's say we have utter equality among the readers for a particular genre. Then a marketing exec gets the idea of segmenting the market. They're not going to change the content; they're just going to market differently to men than to women. And lo and behold, this 1950s ad exec who isn't the least bit sexist puts just a little bit more effort and money into the ads for men. Then the analytics show that the ads targeted toward men get a better response, so the next ad campaign emphasizes the bias more.

The publishers notice this because the marketing companies are contractually obligated to share their data. They inform the editors and agents, who encourage or require authors to pander more to the male demographic. Because women aren't buying sci fi as much.

A decade later, the marketing focuses nearly exclusively on men, and editors and agents don't have to talk quite as much about limiting the representation of women because the genre's traditions have become sexist, and the people writing for the genre are the people who have been buying it, which is mostly the people it's marketed toward. But there are still people who haven't taken the hint, so the agents and editors still have to filter out some stuff. Or they'll go out on a limb and brand something "women's fantasy" and make a new, tiny, neglected market -- because there's no reason to risk the cash cow by selling something off-formula to the existing male demographic.

But identifying for certain whether it's a problem with agents and editors requires some knowledge from the industry, and I don't have that.

LEGO is pretty much a case study in destructive segmented marketing, if you're interested in the topic.

***** I do not see you mentioning that reader demographics are simply a delayed reaction to societal norms.

A relatively short few decades ago, women couldn't vote, and could barely gain access to higher education. They were also extremely unlikely to engage in many strenuous sports, though there were a few socially acceptable sports for women like tennis and various equestrian sports. Even more recently, for decades after they were allowed to vote, most women were housewives, or worked in just a few professional jobs like nursing and teaching.

Real adventurism in women on a significant scale is recent, within the last few decades. In the US, women started to agitate strongly for, and eventually get, more and more social standings and freedoms in the late 1950's and 1960's. It was a long, hard fight to get where women are today in the US, and they still don't have real parity in some measurements.

If you look at fiction from the early 20th century, there are very few strong women characters. This matches the gender roles of the day.

Today, there are more strong women characters in literature. Perhaps less than what would be representative, but there are more.

Writers write what they know, and readers tend to like to read what they are comfortable with. If one tried to sell Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar books in the 1920's, they would flop. Society was simply not ready for gay male and female protagonists in high fantasy.

I would be willing to bet that there has been research done on this beyond what I'm spouting here, comparing societal norms to fiction popularity.

As for the idea of just letting the issue 'solve itself?' For all we know the problem *might* go away without anyone doing anything. That doesn't mean you can't get behind it and push, if you like.

I've specifically addressed your issue with regards to my own work in a different thread. Please don't take my refusal to engage here, with specifics, to mean that you shouldn't take action, or that I'm trying to discourage you from considering the problem.

I do agree that there is a protagonist and major secondary character gender disparity in writing in general, even if compared to societal norms. It also seems very likely that this is partly due to entrenched thought and established practices in the world of agents and editors. If that is the case, then self-published books may be a large part of the answer as more high quality writers begin to self-publish.

Please do feel free to continue discussing it, it's a discussion worth having. I just don't have the credentials to discuss it at anything deeper than a surface level, and I know it.

******* Farmerbob1 has discussed the anwser to your question better than I will be able to, but I'd like to offer three books for your consideration, because I'm honestly curious as to your take on them: /Friday/, /The Cat who Walks Through Walls/, and /To Sail Beyond the Sunset/ all, if memory serves, have a plurality or majority female cast with strong female leads, or a strong female co-lead in one case. These are all favorites of mine, and might be of interest to you.

I don't but I cherry picked them as most meating [[/u/tries_to_explain]] 's argument regarding gender bias in published work.

I'm curious but did you read to Sail beyond the sunset before or after finishing the rest of the History as myth arc? I don't think it is approachable except to studied fans of that mythos. Unless you have read at a minimum: Stranger, Rebellion in, Moon is Harsh, Time Enough, Number of the beast, and Cat*, (I'd recommend googling the recommended order for history as myth, but that might be a good enough order) it isn't approachable. . . that said for an optimistic and early view of a post singularity culture, and I mean really post singularity, not just Time enough for love post scarcity, it's worth looking at, if not worth the high price of admission if you aren't a fan of RAH.

My personal favorite, which I haven't examined the WHY of enough, is *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* despite it's many flaws, probably followed by *Starship Troopers* (please ignore the movie I swear someone made that movie to destroy the title's messages), which only shows my own militant matriculation and development.

What are your favorites by RAH and others, in case I haven't read the latter?

Edit: * some may argue you should take the 3 hours required to read Glory Road before reading Cat, so you actually know Empress Star /shrug/ you don't have to but it is probably one of the best of the: after the hero triumphs reality sets in novels, and its neat to get some scope on the other big players.

I have the same RAH favorites, like a lot of people. /The Roads Must Roll/ was excellent too. My favorites by other authors include /The Trouble With Aliens/, Christopher Anvil, and /On Messenger Mountain/, Gordon R Dickson. This one's a bit more out there, but /Ranks of Bronze/: due to space trade law, you can only fight for trade contacts on primitive worlds with equivalent technology.
