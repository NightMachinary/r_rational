** There's something insanely self-defeating about posting these on reddit. But at the same time, it's the greatest anti-reddit argument I've seen. Inspired me to delete my account (and subsequently create many short-lived alts to suit me during holidays). Thanks OP!

*** But this only makes sense if you think, like Altair, reddit is a bad site to be spending time on.

I perceive reddit to be one of the better sites for socializing online, and to further enhance the quality of my time, I put the people I talk to through a very basic test. Do they have similar interests, encourage genuine discussion of interesting topics, or introduce new viewpoints/modes of thought?

This test helps ensure that the time I spend on reddit is likely to be beneficial rather than addicting or a waste.

So far the test works to pass [[/r/rational]] (I have found the great Ted Chiang and learned to handle certain personal situations in a more mature manner) and fail [[/r/ScienceFiction]] (it's all about science fiction stories and not enough about the more interesting principles behind the science in the stories).

Sorry to have rambled for a bit, but my main question is, why did this story convince you to quit reddit?

P.S. For interesting discussion, is there any meaning to AltairX10's name?

**** For me, reddit is something that primarily serves to distract me from being actually productive. As a procrastination tool, yeah, it's a bad site to be spending time on. It's also an addiction, which is, yknow, usually detrimental to freedom and life in general.

Socializing? I love talking with you guys, but I'll likely never meet any of you and it will have no bearing on my real life, which is already full of enough socialization tbh.

This story made me confront those things by making me actually think about it. Turns out that's all I needed.

*** For a very long time, I believed that reddit was a waste of time and I didn't login to my account for 7 years (reddit was a fun community completely at the beginning before they even had subreddits).

Since then, I've discovered this subreddit and I actually get some value out of it. I get to read new stories and authors (like Ted Chiang but also Eaglejarl and Alexander Wales) and I find that sometimes discussion here is quite interesting (although I'm more of a lurker, same as in Less Wrong).

I need fun in my life and for me fun is reading interesting discussions and good fiction. I also work from home so having some place with a community around is beneficial for me I think.

**** I'm glad you like this sub! I'm happy that we've got our own little community here. Back when I redditrequested it, I'd never dreamed it would ever hit 1000 subscribers!
