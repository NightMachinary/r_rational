** I don't know how the Guide managed to climb up to 4th -oh shit no- [[http://topwebfiction.com/][3rd]] on top web fiction so quickly, but I'm loving it. Keep up the good work people. The guide definitely deserves it (though I should admit that I haven't read all of the fiction on top ten - only like four).

** You'd think I'd be getting tired of the "Haha, these heroes have no chance, we will win soon!" quotes by Dread Emperor Something Something, the He-Died-Immediately-After-He-Said-That, but I'm not. All these quotes are so fun.

Also, I'm not sure what the nature of the ambush they set at the end? They're going to burn the 15th somehow?

*** They drew them past the walls, into scattered street fighting where massed formations are impossible and everything is too spread out for the Woe to find a fulcrum point, then let loose the super soldiers.

**** Something I noticed that was odd - hadn't thief been tasked with stealing the banners to hamstring the Immortals? Did I miss something, or is the raising of the banners an unresolved question?

** I don't believe that there'll be a more appropriate time for [[https://youtu.be/PdhmODA8M64][this]]. In fact, I see Catherine fighting on frozen ground right after dealing with Summer.

**** If you're creative, lots of Sabaton is relevant.

When the Fifteenth face Winter, they'll be on [[https://youtu.be/7Jg76Iyy8bM][Killing Ground]] but Catherine will bring them [[https://youtu.be/rt2g5hoUzHI][Poltava.]]

Mind you, the cavalry did come in handy against Summer, a shame they didn't have [[https://youtu.be/75zmIj_4LFQ][wings...]]ah well, the Fifteenth have gone [[https://youtu.be/XE4BxPwu4zI][to Hell and back]] in Liesse, I'm sure they'll be fine.

None of that applies to William, of course. He was an [[https://youtu.be/SW2bqSbbo1g][absolute lunatic.]]
