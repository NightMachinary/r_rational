Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Is it just me, or is the summary of Worth the Candle kind of... I don't know, unappealing, likely to give the wrong impression. Take a look:

#+begin_quote
  From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that momentarily grabbed his interest. Over the course of eight years, he shared these worlds with his friends through twice-weekly sessions of tabletop gaming. Now at the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgam of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.
#+end_quote

Emphasizing the story's main conceit is not the way to go on royalroad, in my opinion. These are mostly younger guys who know what they like and who read dozens of hours of that every week. Readers there are starved for new things to read, and they will try any new story if it: 1)pattern matches to something they already like, 2) is updated regularly, 3) has a huge backlog, and 4) is already popular.

WtC already matches 1, 2 and 3(the last only until it catches up, anyway) and should do great there. The best way to capitalize on that imo would be to emphasize the familiar --in order of importance: Strong MC | young male first person POV | LitRPG | Isekai/portal | Epic fantasy-- and to reduce any potential "friction" by burying the lede a bit on the esoteric stuff. Let them discover the Juniper/Aerb connection gradually, as he does.

Any thoughts?

*** Depends on what you're looking to optimize. If you're trying to optimize for "# of people who will try the work", then you want the most tailored-to-demographic description that you can get. If you want to optimize for "# of people who will give favorable rating/reviews", then I think you should wear your heart on your sleeve, because that way you'll scare off all the people who would be mad about a perceived bait-and-switch, plus all the people who would simply go into the work with hopes and then find that it's not their thing.

My position is basically that I don't want people who don't like the story to read the story. From a monetary standpoint, they're unlikely to become patrons. From a metrics standpoint, they're likely to leave bad metrics. From a word-of-mouth standpoint, they're likely to put out bad word-of-mouth. From a citizen-of-the-world standpoint, I would rather people have as few barrriers to optimizing their enjoyment of works as possible.

With that said, I didn't even think of tailoring the description to RoyalRoad, so maybe some better copy could be written, with the above in mind.

**** I hadn't considered that. I see what you mean with possibly attracting people who would not like your story. I have seen the occasional negative comment on the story threads.

That said, I don't think it would be a bait and switch to emphasize any of these points I mentioned because they are all true. If you're really worried about managing expectations, maybe put a note below the (new and improved) summary saying that your story has an emphasis on character interactions. Or the occasional chapter note in the sections that have a lull in the pace/action.

I'm actually re-reading the story right now and I think you've already done a decent job managing expectations, like with this paragraph at the beginning of chapter 3:

#+begin_quote
  Look, you probably want to hear more about the sexy motorcycle mechanic or the punk gangs or the giant zombie creatures, but before we go too much further, I need to tell you about my D&D group. I know, I know, but so much of Aerb is a reflection of my scribblings while DMing, so there is a point to this. I'll try my best to keep it to what's important.
#+end_quote

I really think your stuff won't stand out as much as you seem to worry. WtC might put a large focus on characterization, and the real world sections might break the expected flow of action, but many of the top rated stories on rr have that. Take Wandering Inn as an example, which is 10th best rated, and first or second highest patreon on rr(>$8k). The story is so slow and deliberate and introspective in the beginning and in between the action scenes that it makes WtC feel like a summer blockbuster! A good number of the top rated stories have a slower pace and an emphasis on characterization.

The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.

Minor spoilers, but only for the first three or four chapters, and it's mostly background information. Might still try to work in the "character sheet stapled to my soul" bit at some point, but I hate blurbs, so whatever.

****** I think it's only a slight improvement, to be honest. I don't think it's much different to the one that scared me away when I saw the first chapter here on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], despite the fact that I read pretty much everything that's posted here. It reminded me too much of several awful stories I dnf'ed. You'd be surprised at how many litrpgs start with a DnD group incarnating in another world as their characters, and unsurprised at how much they all suck.

It was only 2 months later when the thread got 100 upvotes (the first chapter thread besides MoL to do so, iirc) that I gave it another shot.

Anyway, I'm aware that everyone on the discord seems to disagree, which combined with my pathological dislike of giving negative feedback makes me... unsure of my position. Maybe I'm wrong, what do I know of blurbs.

****** I'm not familiar with the audience of Royalroad, but to me, this summary is missing the point of WtC. The only part worth keeping is "this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth", because it hints at some character analysis and deeper meaning.

Because, really, when I think WtC, I don't think "muchkining level-up mechanics" or "teenager in a fantasy land", or "yeah, but /this/ loli character has a perfectly valid reason for being underage and naked, I swear!". I think about Amaryllis and Joon's relationship, where Amaryllis is more of a munchkin and Joon treats it all like a story; or the way the world is laid out, how it emphasizes multiculturalism and takes ideas that Joon would have had over the course of an afternoon and develops a whole society around them with its own customs and social expectations.

I don't know how you'd make that into a blurb, though. Maybe something like that:

#+begin_quote
  In Juniper's D&D games, these little societies were so simple. This one was warmongering, and this one farmed rocks for a living. But in the world of Aerb, they're functional cultures, with customs, traditions and many nuances.

  Struggling after the death of his best friend, Juniper is plunged in a fantasy world, a world that struggles to meet the challenges of both modern life and world-ending threats. To survive, Juniper must deal with societal prejudice, black ops forces, murderous creatures and, most terrifying of all, his own internal demons.
#+end_quote

(except better written)

Otherwise, maybe you could do the same thing r!Animorphs did, and find a particularly striking quote in early chapters that really illustrates what's special about /this/ isekai universe?

******* I wouldn't mention DnD at all, really. I know it's a crucial part of WtC, but I truly think it's... prejudicial, for lack of a better word. Fantasy stories which feature roleplaying are uniformly bad, in my experience, WtC is pretty much the only exceptions.

The second paragraph is better. I wouldn't list things like in the last sentence, though. It's kind of lazy.

That said, I don't know what I'd do differently. I suggested this in the discord, but it was met with a collective groan:

#+begin_quote
  In the blink of an eye seventeen year old Juniper Smith finds himself in another world, on the verge of being thrown out of a plane into a desolate land teeming with monsters. A Trial by Adversity, they call it, punishment for who knows what crime. Now he needs to survive by wits alone long enough to discover what's going on, and why the world is so incredibly familiar. . .
#+end_quote

This whole thing made Neil Gaiman's advice to authors come to mind:

#+begin_quote
  Remember: when people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.

******** Recursive writing advice:

- "Trial by adversity" already gives too much detail, and it's not central to the plot.

- "who knows what crime" is the wrong sentence structure. I often see that structure used by amateur writers here (PGtE used to have it /a lot/); "who knows what" introduces a question ("what crime is he punished for?"), except the rest of the sentence doesn't lead into that question; instead the question is a digression, adding extra detail to the "trial by adversity" part.

- The blurb only gives the premise of the first chapters, but it doesn't really illustrate what's special about the story. Like, "character is thrown from a place into a horde of zombies" is a good way to raise the stakes from the start (which is especially important in an isekai story), but it's not really a hook. People looking for isekai are used to "everybody wants to kill the MC" stories.

Honestly, on second read, I think the blurb above is fine. It doesn't quite have the clickbait effect of saying "The character is thrown from a plane and about to be eaten alive", but I think that's okay, because WtC isn't a clickbait story.

Describe the first volume and let people see the quality for themselves, and they will get invested in the story. Just like every trilogy or series has ever done. I don't see in what world that's a bait and switch or clickbait.

And I'm speaking from experience, too. Trying to "accurately" describe the story to friends and colleagues was not the way to go, while saying that "it's a portal fantasy that puts a heavy emphasis on characterization and worldbuilding" and elaborating a bit did get some to read it.

****** I don't know if the spoilers are bad for a new reader or not, but you could possibly avoid them by referencing, so it becomes payoff when the details come out in the chapters. Mention that Joon was a dungeon master, something terrible happened to his gaming group in bumblefuck kansas (IMO the name of the town is a detail that will make people laugh rather than complain about spoilers, assuming it isn't censored), and his worldbuilding took a turn for the darker in the wake of that tragedy. Now he wishes he hadn't because he got inserted into a fantasy based on his worlds. The fact that it's complicated and cerebral is I think the main filter criteria for your audience, not the fact that it's D&D derived. The people you don't want reading the story are people who expect generic fantasy tropes, don't want to juggle too many details, or maybe just aren't into gaming at all. The people you want to attract are more into subversion, originality, nerd talk, etc.

#+begin_quote
  The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.
#+end_quote

I'm not so sure I like this line because it sounds like it is saying he was the kind of person who would cause Aerb, Fel Seed, the Hells, etc. to exist deliberately. However, his big crime back on earth was being a bad friend, some of the time. He feels guilt about this, some of it earned, but he wasn't the kind of person who would willingly torture billions of people, and at the beginning of the story didn't even like the idea of people winking permanently out of existence because their soul got used to power a motorcycle. His dark fantasies were constructed under the assumption that they were, and would remain, fictional. They were an escape from reality, a cry for help perhaps, but not a plan or wish to be fulfilled.

Not saying you should use it, but the following would probably fit right in at RR:

#+begin_quote
  When disaster struck our little gaming group of hyperintelligent teenagers in Bumblefuck Kansas, my style as dungeon master took a turn for the darker and edgier. I really wish it hadn't, because I have now been inserted into a life or death struggle in a fantastical world where life is cheap, death is unthinkably bad, and I still can't figure out all the mechanics of this character sheet stapled to my soul. And even though I have no idea why or how this world came into existence using so many of the things I once made up, I now feel a responsibility to its billions of inhabitants, to fix it somehow. It's a good thing I can level up. Should I put some points in intelligence? Because one thing I'm starting to realize about my worldbuilding is that it's super complicated... Is this a harem I'm seeing? No way, I can't have a harem! WTF is up with this crazy DM?

  Juniper Smith finds himself reincarnated in the world of Aerb with the power to level-up and realizes that he is the creator of the world. Aerb is a place that he had intricately constructed over a decade of tabletop gaming sessions, filled with dozens of fantastical magic systems and hundreds of fantasy races. The only problem is that he was too much of a teenage chunibyo when he made it! Can he survive the edgy grimdark universe that he filled to the brim with the hardest challenges that he could possibly imagine? And is it fair to fall in love with the perfect women in his harem, if he's the protagonist and they can't stop themselves from falling in love with him?

Whereas here the places that sell coffee, they don't have disposable cups, and I've not seen people carrying them around (whereas in Australia on public transport or walking around town it's a very common sight to see people with disposable coffee cups).

*** Yeah from what little I heard from people while in London, Paris is kinda unusual when it comes to the culture of eating out.

Waiters have a salary instead of living off tips, so they tend to be stony instead of cheerful.

Usually you have to come knowing what you want to order instead of choosing from a menu.

They really hate it if you talk in anything other than French, but they'll be merciful if you at least make the attempt with a few words of hello and food terms.

You have to be quiet when eating out since the noise level is usually much lower in cafes/restaurants, and anyone who is too loud may be asked to leave.

It's expected that if you are eating at a cafe alone, you are most likely spending a few hours people-watching.

I'm sure there was a lot more to it than just what I learned in some conversations with people traveling through Europe.

That's true in my homeland as well, though the more upmarket the place in Australia the better the service generally speaking (because you have 14 year olds who don't give a shit at somewhere like Nandos VS people who have been serving for decades and will be fired if they fuck up the least bit at a $100 a person fine dining place).

I've eaten out a few times here, and I've honestly found the service to be good to excellent. My french is passable (despite how CouteauBlue made it look in his response to my last comment ;), but I've found that sometimes they'll switch to English out of courtesty (which bugs me because I want to practise my French, but the stereotype is that they refuse to speak English, so...). But then again maybe that comes back to:

I had a run in with an American tourist at the airport who tried to make me order cigarettes for her at a newsagency because she saw me inquiring about a SIM card in French. She spoke to me like the salesperson wasn't there. I felt so awkward. Especially because her friend had been in front of me in the line and had repeatedly asked the salesperson about tax refund forms in English.... the poor woman works at the newsagent in the airport, she is not a tax form person.

** The GMTK game jam is scheduled for August 2nd to 4th: [[https://youtu.be/vWSmZgL50vE]]

The /r/r discord ran an entry in 2017 (to unfortunate results; an unclear submission page meant we uploaded but didn't submit), and this year some of us are doing it again. We're aiming to use Unity and are spending the next couple months brushing up our skills in preparation.

One of the major roles we're missing is artists, so if there's any of you willing to mark their calendar and draw pretty pictures with us that weekend, we'd be happy to have you.

Anyone else interested in other aspects of game design is also welcome to join; there's a #gmtk_jam channel on the discord (link in the sidebar here). If you just want to learn with us without entering the jam itself that's fine too, we'll be doing a handful of test runs over the summer to make sure we've got the kinks worked out and it should be a good chance to learn the basics of game development if you're interested.

Signup sheet and more details are linked in the pinned messages of that discord channel. See you there!

I've had several ideas bouncing around and have been consistently writing chapters for each of them the past few months, but have reached a point where I spend more time catching up to what I've written and editing/trying to find room for excerpts I made at work than I do writing. I don't think that its writers block, mainly because I usually combat that by working on different stories when I can't seem to give one more meat. It's just become impractical for me to work on several at once.

​

Any answer is appreciated. I've considered rolling dice and dedicating all my spare time to my favorite story, but neither of those appeal to me as they seem like they'd take all the fun out of writing. Thanks in advance.

*** I just pick whatever looks like I can sustain the push toward completion for, with just a little bit of focus on what people would actually want to read. I have, at the moment, about twenty things in draft stages, some with a few chapters, some only missing their ending, everything from novels to novellas to short stories. "can sustain the push" is some combination of enthusiasm and percent currently done.

Since I've instituted this way of thinking, I've pushed out a number of stories that were sitting near the finish line, and gotten significant chunks of work done on other things.

(In my case this is complicated by /also/ running a web serial that I try my best to devote all possible writing time to. But if I didn't have that, the answer would be the above, and I do dip my toes in other stuff.)

**** Okay, I wasn't ready for you, the legend, to specifically reply.

Is there any way you determined the "sustain the push" factor with what you're writing? I'm up to about 3 to 5 serious stories, each of which I enjoy expanding upon. I plug away at them but dialogue feels strange to me every time I look at it again from a different perspective, and I find myself adding details and more which I know can be a slippery slope. Any tips?

Also, your web serial is awesome btw. I wanted to ask if you wrote at all during you're hiatus from it the last couple months.

***** My trick is to leave myself a lot of notes. Every time I think I might be moving over to a different project, or sometimes even if I don't, I leave myself little TODOs on the project, and at the bottom of every doc is a brief description of the plot and the major players. Here's one example:

#+begin_quote
  Case unwinds itself, leads to larger conspiracy, ties into wizarding election, mires the main characters in mortal danger

  Charles: affable and bumbling force for the status quo, ignorant of politics, growing toward having to make a moral choice for once in his life

  Madeline: stuck between two worlds, bitter in the way that competent people sometimes are when surrounded by incompetence, serious and dedicated, growing toward rebellion against system
#+end_quote

All that helps to give some purpose to whatever I'm going to do when I revisit the project, so that I don't have to reread and re-edit the whole honking thing every time I resume work on something that's been laying in the drafts folder for ages. A lot of what I do is calculated toward helping my future self. (Because I use Google Docs for writing, I try to leave myself annotations too, usually things like "try to pay this off later" or "name comes from Afrikaans for shadow" or something like that. This is also pretty helpful.)

"Sustain the push" partly depends on how interesting I think I'll find the work without any jolts of inspiration, and how likely I think I am to run into roadblocks (whether those include scenes I don't know how to write or plot resolutions I don't immediate answers to). I think working without inspiration or motivation is one of the greatest skills a writer can have, and something that should be cultivated as much as possible, which helps get through the inevitable creative dry spells. My usual way of thinking in those dark times is just "put one word in front of the other".

As for the haitus, I usually don't actually stop writing, and it's rare that I'll skip a day, I just sometimes go a long time without publishing. If you're interested, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][I maintain a word count spreadsheet here]] which tracks output. /Worth the Candle/ has gotten pretty hard to write, given there are a million words of continuity to track, a mammoth, sprawling world, dozens of powers and magic with all their interactions, and a pretty full cast, which accounts for some of the slowdown as compared with the first month or two of 4K words a day.

****** Your notes look similar to mine:

  The princess consults with her advisors.

  The princess shouts back offer: a trade, one to one. Captain shouts back this time, comparing masses. Queen argues about mouths to feed, and thinking about the future of humanity. Captain decides to draw straws, accountant realizes the danger.

  Resolve Michael plot-- he's going to Japan (get some closure)\\
  Krusty talks to Shoryu/reprimands him/strategizes\\
  Akihabara Round Table (with Minori's help) plan what to do next.

That was about 2500 words worth of plot. How many words did those notes cover? And do you feel like you're a faster pacer than normal, or a slower one? This makes me wonder if writers with faster pacing have fewer words of story per words of notes, or if they also write more condensed notes so the ratio stays similar...

******** Your notes appear to be denser than mine. My notes covered about 700 words of the story that resulted.

I... think I'm pretty fast paced? I tend to cut most of what I write out in the end. Otherwise I end up saying the same thing three different ways, three times in a row.

I should add that sometimes my notes for a 3000 word story are only one sentence long--usually because I ended up writing the whole thing without taking notes and without planning. Similarly, my notes for longer stories would cover more ground if I ever actually wrote long stories.

*** My strategy is to only write short stories that I know I can finish in a few days. Then I review and edit the story a week later.

I write (almost) only stories that are shorter than twenty pages. If I have an idea for a story that would be two-hundred pages, I try to write the most important scene only.

It's a lazy way of writing that keeps me at hobbyist level, but I find it sufficient and sustainable. I have notes for a few longer stories. Maybe I'll write those in their entirety in the future.

** I have long desired to write a fictional work of my own. I write poetry and thought-pieces, have began many stories of fantasy, sci-fi, etc., and I still plug away. I am determined to produce a work of quality, one day.

​

However, I do often find myself torn between sitting down and painstakingly writing and thinking of ideas, VS. reading and re-reading my favorite web-serials, Issac Asimov short stories, poetry of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Mary Oliver.

Are there any creative writers out there who may share with me their own experience in getting started/writing consistently, and how/whether they balance reading others' works, vs. creating their own works?

*** I've (unfortunately) had to drop reading to historic lows. There's a pile of books on my bedside table, a bunch of bookmarked stories, and very little time to read them. And if I /did/ read them, I would worry about creative pollution, picking up another author's voice for a few days or worse, getting bitten by the bug to write something similar (or dissimilar, because reading stuff from other people often gives me a glimpse of inspiration into a story that they're not actually telling). Same goes for tabletop gaming: I no longer DM, instead opting to play about once every two weeks, also at historic lows. Creativity is for writing, and writing alone (well, also telling my son stories, but that's halfway to writing).

To answer the other question about writing consistently:

- Have a time dedicated to writing, ideally the same time every day when there's nothing else you should be doing.
- Have a space/setup dedicated to writing, somewhere with minimal distractions, or failing that, at least a space/setup that gets you in the mood for writing, or which your brain will associate with writing. Some people have a writing-only netbook, but that seems expensive and overkill to me.
- Cut out distractions as much as you can. I used to use a browser extension that would block websites at a certain time, but have since moved on from that. I also tend to turn off my laptop's wifi, which cuts down on the impulse to go surf the web. If your cell phone is a distraction, put it in a mason jar, which won't cut you off, but will make you stop to think before you reflexively open up an app out of habit.
- Track metrics, if that works for you. Word count, words per day, writing speed, days in a row you've met your word count goal, etc. The risk there is that you'll see a dip in the metrics and get discouraged, or that you'll break a streak and give up, but this is sort of a matter of how much you know yourself and what works for you as far as these things go. I've lately been using a writerbot that I set up for "sprints" of 30-45 minutes of pure writing time, with level ups and experience points and other gamification. Time will tell how much that helps productivity in the long term, but it's a thing to try.

*** I occasionally write short stories (not very good ones though), and I spend most of my reading/writing time on the reading end of things. Mostly my writing is after I see an interesting idea in one of the works I read, and want to explore it in a different manner, leading to me making a short story about that concept. This method doesn't result in me writing much, but I always enjoy my writing when I do do it. If you are looking for advice about writing a greater amount than that, I do not have firsthand experience, but if I were in that situation I would probably write out a list of all the interesting ideas from the last few works I read, to bring them to mind and make reworking them a more available idea. If I really wanted to get a short story made, I might then force myself to write about one of the ideas, to make sure I do not end up thinking “none of these seem particularly striking to write a story about”. YMMV, of course, and good luck with your writing.

*** I've found myself in the bad habit of writing excerpts while at work and plugging them into the story I'm writing awkwardly. Consistency was a problem at first, but once I started to make several paragraphs a day it started to get easier. Like, a lot easier. Humans are creatures of habits, and its up to you to cultivate those habits.

​

On that note, I've got a friend who every time he smokes tries to write as much as he can before his cigarette runs out, but he's an extreme example. Try to work it in where you can. Have fun with it. Start small and build up to where you want to be.

** Rant incoming.

I screwed up my computer like 3 weeks ago. Desktop went from a slideshow of pretty landscapes to flat black with white text in the bottom right telling me that my copy of Windows isn't genuine, other things being screwy, etcetera, ran multiple scans of defender and the malware removal thing and nothing got found but the system was still screwy, so I copied all of my crap over to a 2TB external hard drive, completely emptied my computer of all my files.

I then spent the next few weeks going through all of my email addresses and deleting and/or consolidating all the internet accounts linked to each of them, changing all my passwords for the internet accounts that I kept and then updating each of their emails to my "main" email before deleting the email address that I used to create the account, like, I had three Hulu accounts with three different email addresses, my internet activity over the last few years has been a mess, whatever. I'm down to four email addresses and three of them are only getting mail from like one or two places each, so that's probably good.

I spent the last 12 hours doing the (semi)final stage: a factory reset on my computer, and then updating windows. I'm pretty sure that at least the last 8 hours, if not longer, were running Windows Update. (I still have to reinstall my programs and I haven't moved my files over from the hard drive yet, gonna do that tomorrow and take advantage of the situation to make sure things are organized and not have a bunch of folders full of random crap that get created every time the desktop gets too full.)

And now here I am, importing bookmarks, signing in to websites, adding browser extensions, and I add the Reddit Enhancement Suite and come here to look at what's been going on in the Friday thread... All my little "+40"s and "+9"s and "-5"s and "-15"s and whatever beside people's names? That's all gone. I hadn't even thought about that. What a nice little irritating annoyance to cap it all off with. I mean, I recognize most people's names, but still. It's a reminder that lots of little things are probably going to end up being lost and I'm not even going to remember what they were to miss them.

End rant.

I took a few days off and now I'm going through and working on the rebuilding effort again, and it turns out that all the playlists I ever made on iTunes no longer exist, and the only playlist I would sync to my iPod is my workout playlist so they're just straight up gone. And I used to sort Windows Explorer by Date Created or Date Modified or Date Accessed depending on use case, and that's all been reset as well, so now files from years ago are all mixed in with newer files instead of newest at the top and oldest at the bottom, which is going to force me to do even more reorganizing.

So it really wasn't about being able to see who I've upvoted/downvoted, that was just the first thing I noticed was gone.

EDIT:

And I totally and completely forgot to make any sort of note of all the VSTs/plugins I had for FL Studio, so I'm going to have to try to find all of those by memory. Great.

And as much as I hated the final two seasons(the final 4 seasons?), I can see how with proper set-up and execution by Martin the resolution could have been fine as-is, maybe even great. The fine foil-people over at [[/r/asoiaf]] are doing a good job of sussing out the wheat from the chaff, it's fascinating to watch.

As an aside, you'd think the tv show clusterfuck would sour the fans and be ultimately bad for Martin, but I for one haven't been as excited about the books in 8 years(ADWD was mediocre, imo), which is crazy considering I started reading it when I was 13(almost 20 years ago!).
