** I enjoyed that a lot. I've lately been thinking that there's a relative dearth of fiction written as nonfiction. [[http://www.tor.com/stories/2011/08/wikihistory][Wikihistory]] definitely comes to mind, as it's in a similar vein.

(To be clear, when I say fiction written as nonfiction I don't just mean with a framing device around a narrative, which a ton of books have - I mean nonfiction as a presentation style, like a reference work that goes along with a subject matter that doesn't exist. /House of Leaves/ or /The Zombie Survival Guide/.)

** This was pretty interesting. It makes me ponder if anyone has written a serious fanfic or novel which considers the failure state of the 1984 world. We sort of imagine that after the end of 1984 that the state "won" and might have continues steady-state, but I think that there are plenty of counter-examples in history. That level of tyranny might not be long term sustainable.

*** I think it would be really interesting to see a stable dystopia encounter an outside context problem. Now that I think about it, this is pretty much the plot of /Singularity Sky/ by Charles Stross.

**** I loved Singularity Sky.

I'd be specifically interested in such a take on 1984, if only because it is such a famous novel. While I think it would be very difficult to do a rationalist version of the actual novel, a sequel or continuation or "20 years later" might be really interesting. Call it "2084" and see how things turned out.

** How's that quote go? "Imposition of control equals escalation of chaos." (Alternately, "systems under pressure do weird things.")
