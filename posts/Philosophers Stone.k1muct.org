So the philosophers stone shows up in stuff like Harry Potter and Fullmetal Alchemist. My question is if there are any works that explore how the underlying principals that let you transmute matter would be worth far more than any gold you could make?


** Fairly obligatory mention of Methods of Rationality, where the Philosopher's Stone still shows up and has a satisfying explanation that is way more than just "making gold"; but also I imagine everyone has read it.

** I don't know how rational it might be, but 'Wake of The Ravager' on RoyalRoad (by Macronomicon) is a LitRPG with a reasonable backstory and likeable characters. A bit cheesy, and not without its flaws re: sexism, but with a teenage boy protag, it's not unreasonable. Anime tropes lampshaded often.

One of the powers the MC has is 'dupdomancy' which (after some leveling and many chapters) lets him copy various abstract properties from materials, such as the 'hardness' of titanium. He can then apply that to other materials. Without too many spoilers, he figures out how to basically make any material he wants given enough power and time. With some genre savvy help, he begins to upend the order of his medieval world.

*** I got really turned away from WoTR when He used the fact that he had taken over a town to risk the lives of his friends in a prank. From after they escaped the monster-filled hellhole everything just got really weird and edgy.

It's still pretty weird and edgy, although Calvin has started to grow up some now that he's got actual responsibilities.

** Perhaps a good thing to look up would be genuine alchemical texts, from when people thought this WAS a real thing? I think the reason for the gold was that they believed matter existed in a sort of ladder of nobility. So gold was the ultimate form of it. But the point was that the philosopher's stone would "raise" the nobility of the matter, so it would turn lead into gold or make you immortal, as in, it would turn anything into a more perfect form.
