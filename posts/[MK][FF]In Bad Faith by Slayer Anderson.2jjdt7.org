** I read this a while back. My primary criticisms:

- Too much of a Mary Sue MC with relatively little justification
- Plot advances fairly slowly (word count almost as long as Harry Potter and the PS, but very little has happened of any note or importance). Doesn't really feel like it gets anywhere.

Things I liked:

- Reasonably interesting/nuanced portrayal of Wizarding and Pureblood Wizarding World.
- Writing was mechanically OK.

Overall, not a great fic but certainly there are far worse out there. Given the glacially slow update rate since the initial flurry of posting on ff.net and spacebattles, and the lack of story progress so far, I feel it's gonna take a /very/ long time in realtime before it gets really going.

** Have read through ~Ch 5 of the rewrite. I agree with the other commenters who have said that the plot advances slowly, and that the author seems interested in portraying pureblood society over plot. But I'm actually enjoying these elements--it's nice to see some (at least superficially) well-thought-out worldbuilding, and we all know roughly how the plot is going to go anyway. I'm sure I'll be annoyed when I get to the end of the story and not much has happened, but for now I'm enjoying it. Thanks for the link, rilianus!

*** I enjoy it and I wish there were more. I disagree over the question of Mary Sueness; there certainly isn't any more than is in Methods of Rationality.

** My first thought was that it would be a Rational!Hellsing fic, but this is pretty cool too.

*** I would read a fic about a rational Anderson trying to figure out how the hell Alucard was beaten the first time.

The Nazis already seem like they might be rational, though we never got to see their planning phase that led up to their ultimate plan, so we can't know for sure.

Obviously Alucard doesn't need to be rational, hes the OP final boss already.

** So there've been several negative reviews of this so far. Definitely agree it progresses very slowly- despite 70k words so far, the protagonist hasn't reached Hogwarts. And the other big concern is that the main character is a Mary Sue. Personally, I enjoy the fairly detailed account of magical high society, so the former could just be a taste issue. As for being Marry Sue, when one takes into account that the character was a diligent grad student in another life, combined with a child's facility for languages and the sort of political-oriented education provided to a Malfoy... It's possible, but maybe a minor stretch. Personally I didn't think it broke suspension of disbelief.

So yeah, mainly just slow- does anyone know how regularly this gets updated?

** The main problem I have with this fic is the Mary sue main character. For some reason she seems to amazingly talented in everything. From runework to fencing to social combat to learning old English etc. Its just too much.

I know this is suppose to be justified because the main character is a SI which means that she has the body of a child and the mind of an adult. But unless the character as an adult had the drive and raw talent to master several languages and become an expert in 5 different fields then that doesn't hold water.

There was this scene where the SI was shopping for books and ran into hermoine and her parents. The SI proceeds to lecture them about the wizarding world and how they should act etc. That scene was so ridiculous, it madee want to roll my eyes.

Sorry for making this so long but I think this could have a lot of potential. If the main character was toned down a lot and picked up the pace s bit it could be pretty good.

*** I just finished reading the fic and the scene you're talking about (SI lecturing Hermione) wasn't in there. Maybe you're misremembering, or thinking of another fic?

**** I think that was in the original version. I know the author started a rewrite to address some of the issues. The rewrite was a bit better in terms of making the main character less of a Mary sue.
