/People of Ygg, House Elmheart, has betrayed you!/

/The nobles do not live to serve and protect./

/You are no more than pawns in their quest for power, wealth and more power!/

/You trust the Elmheart family with your lives./

/They profiteer off your pain by controlling the product from their Selligin Farms./

/Do not let their discounted rates for citizens fool you./

/Do not let any acts of goodwill fool you!/

/The Elmheart keep you weak and powerless by ensuring The Academy is only open to those who fill their pockets!/

/But we the people have overlooked these injustices out of fear./

/Be scared no more!/

/People of Ygg, Alexander Elmheart, is guilty!/

/The courts and city council now have in their hands evidence of his crimes./

/We have accused the mercenary guilds./

/We have accused the circus./

/We have accused the Aether Singers./

/We forgot to look within our walls!/

/It was Alexander Elmheart stealing our children off the safety of our streets and out of the warmth of their beds./

/Selligin Farms need labour. Our children are that labour./

/The Elmheart Apothecaries need test subjects. Our children are their test subjects./

/Evidence of the kidnapping, transport and sale of the children shall soon be public record./

/People of Ygg, do not leave this matters in the hands of the council/

/It is full of cowards and the crooked./

/They can be bought out, but we can not!/

/We demand justice!/

/Alexander Elmheart's crimes cannot be ignored!/

/House Elmheart's corruption must be brought into the light!/

The flyer titled 'A Letter To The People' went on and on about Alexander's crimes and his paedophilic activities. Kat scrutinised the language. The accusers were careful with the words they used. All claims against Alexander were well defined, while those against the House came across as conjecture. Perjury though not a crime could very well ruin a man's reputation.

Kat didn't know what to think. She had met Alexander only a handful of times. The man was charming and likeable but never failed to make her uncomfortable, and she could never figure out why. The young woman didn't want to believe the twins were involved. She cared about Sia. It was unlikely either of them was a part of the scandal. The Academy liked keeping their students too busy for any extracurricular activities.

Kaitlyn was not one to procrastinate, but she was struggling to focus. The reality was she was on the verge of giving up on the Second Trial. The bruises from Killian's boot had only worsened. The digits of her left hand refused to bend as she willed them to. Kat sent another pulse of Life Aether through the limb, and the pain lessened, but her fingers were still slow to react to her instructions.

Several hours had passed since Kat gave up on waiting for Jaque. She hoped the wizard had not become a target for the city guard. The letter was no reason to set their sights on a dark-skinned man, but with a war on the horizon, their bigotry had only become more apparent. What Kaitlyn was most curious about was why he had stored his effects in her knapsack. She stole a glance at the valuable pile. The young woman wanted to dig through the Aethercores and the gold-rimmed tome, but she kept telling herself it wasn't the right thing to do.

"You shouldn't risk it," her fellow student said. Leanne's copper hair hung messily around her chubby face. "With that dud of an arm, you're not going to survive long in one of the more violent Verses. A Mage with no spells is no Mage at all."

"What should I do then? I have nowhere to go, nothing to do. I can't very well spend a year on the streets." Kat protested. The pair had privacy in the practice room. The thick walls were built to survive the most destructive spells. The soundproofing was unintentional but valuable nonetheless. "I could sell all of this, and if I'm careful, I'll survive the year on my own, but that will be hell. I'll go crazy preparing for the next Trial."

"You do realise your scholarship is going to run out when the season's trials end. If you wait for a year, you'll have pay for access to the Tear like everyone else."

"I forgot about that." The blacksmith's daughter confessed. Kaitlyn expected a pang of disappointment, but she felt nothing. "Then, I have no option. I must go through the Tear and hope to find a decent familiar before one of the less friendly Primordials comes for me, or I'll die trying."

"You don't need a familiar. As a graduate of The Academy with an Attunement, you'll still have the right to practise magic."

"What good is that if I can't progress as a Mage or share the burden of spellcasting with my Familiar? I'll be a target for people like Alexander Elmheart, waiting to be stolen in the middle of the night and spend my days living as a chained Aetherbank for a dark Mage."

"That could have happened long ago, and it can happen tomorrow, or even after you've found a Familiar." Leanne slumped down next to her fellow commoner. Beads of sweat covered her pale skin. The casting practice was draining and had left her bare arms covered in scratches. For practise's sake, Kat forced her right hand's three good fingers through the now awkward rune shapes and channelled a gentle regeneration spell to heal her friend. It only encouraged the body to recover faster and didn't have the potential to go out of control and cause mutation.

"But with a Familiar, I'd have the opportunity to protect myself."

Kat liked the heavy set girl. She was not a scholarship student, and due to her mother's flourishing tailoring business, she ranked just above a commoner.

"Nothing I say is going to change your mind."

"No, but thank you for sharing the room with me. How the hell can you afford one?"

"The registrar, Elm Witch Allyssa is a client of my mother's. Mother offered to bump her commission up in the queue if she'd accommodate my needs during the Trial."

Leanne took a deep breath and returned to her practice. She stood amongst the metal spikes lying on the ground. They resembled the pegs used to secure fences. She breathed deeply and brought her hands together. When she pulled them apart, lines of bright blue trailed behind her fingertips. She moved them to form a perfect symbol in the air, and then her fingers started their dance. The woman's dexterity filled Kat with envy. Leanne skipped the incantation and traced the spell circle and runes within seconds. When complete, she latched onto it with her left hand and waved them over the spikes on the ground. Of the ten, only six reacted. They jumped off the ground and hovered in front of her hand. They moved as one following her hand and matching its speed.

With her off-hand, Leanne modified the spell circle, and all but one of the spikes fell to the ground. It shot forward into the ground, and she now guided it with her finger. The Manipulation Mage traced a rune shape with her finger, and the spike copied her, scratching the character into the floor. Leanne added a couple more symbols to it and then collapsed panting and clutching her head.

"Are you okay?" Kat asked, rushing to her side. She was about to give the woman another Accelerated Regeneration, but Leanne batted her hand away.

"I'm fine, just not used to the focus the spell demands. Manipulation demands a balance of all three Aether Tools. My Control and Sense are great but Assimilation not so much. Focusing on absorbing Aether and channelling a spell at the same time is still too much for me." the seamstress's daughter explained.

"So modify the spell, have it work in bursts to pierce and slash your targets, and then return to you, or rest to be picked up again. You can pursue the channelled variants when you have a Familiar. It could focus on Assimilation in your stead."

"Not everyone is you, Kat. I can't casually decide to tweak a spell to fit my needs. It would take me days." Leanne laughed. "Why don't you focus on your healing spells, fix that shoulder of yours?"

"Not everyone is as confident and comfortable with their spells as you, Leanne," Kat replied, her new friend found the rhetoric amusing. "The spell isn't potent enough to fix something of this magnitude, and I'm not brave enough to try something more expensive. I could ask the Healer's Guild to throw me a bone, but I'd rather not owe them anything. However, if it is a matter of spell modding, I can help you with that, but you need to do something for me after."

Leanne fell silent when the spell crafting began. The only struggle Kat faced was figuring out the laws of the runic language when Manipulation Aether was involved. Once that was out of the way, it was only a matter of figuring out the sequence of placing syntax between the key instructional words.

"You make it look so easy," Leanne commented when Kat offered her three designs to test for efficiency.

"Once you've memorised the base runes and their pairings, it's not that hard," Kat stated while leafing through her fellow graduate's tome.

"For you, that might be the case, not for the rest of us. I know all the primary runes and their companion symbols, but when stringing them together to make a spell, I can't make heads or tails of them."

Leanne didn't get a reply. Kaitlyn was focused on the familiar spell circle in front of her. It featured in many a tale. Paladins were known to carry shields with enchanted Aethercores at their heart. Blinding Flash was perhaps the most famous of all Creation Spells. Shapers and Manipulators had designed variants as well but needed a source of light or Aether to manipulate for their purposes.

"Have you read about the Mages across the Octan's Lands?" Kaitlyn asked but did not wait for a response. "They're a nomadic breed that does not like carrying texts. Instead, they tattoo their knowledge onto their bodies. When a Mage dies, his life's work is divided between his apprentices. They carry on their master's legacy, building on the knowledge and collecting students of their own."

"Of course I have. Everyone has. They're barbarians and fools. They only focus on one aspect of their Attunement. Sure they can cast powerful spells at lightning speed through their tattoos, but they're limited. It might work in the wild plains where they're constantly warding off dread beasts but what good is it here?"

"What if, they didn't tattoo entire spells, but a variety of spell shapes and runes, and built custom scripts on the fly?" Kaitlyn asked, her eyes wide with excitement. Leanne opened her mouth to respond, but Kat silenced her with a finger to the lips. "I know what you're going to say. There are too many shapes, too many symbols. What if they tattooed only the most common ones, it still would save a lot of time."

"Where are you going with this Kat? We've got just about twelve hours left till the trials start, there is no time to go get tattoos."

"Maybe we don't need tattoos, just very intricate scars."

"Have you gone insane? You want us to mutilate our bodies?" Leanne protested. "Tattoos are painful enough. Do you have any idea what you are proposing?"

"Yes, I do. It will be good for both of us. You can practise your accuracy and precision, and I can improve the mastery of my regeneration scripts."

"But Kaitlyn, it's going to hurt."

"I know, but if the last few days have taught me anything, it's that I can handle a lot of pain," she reassured Leanne. "Besides, without the full use of either hand, this is my only way forward. I don't want to settle for some small fry. For Yggdrasil's sake, I want a Primordial!"

"They're right, you know. You're different."

"I am?"

"Yes," Leanne answered, preparing to start the terrifying exercise. "Drinking a chalice worth of the World Tree's Sap did something to you."

Leanne retrieved a small knife from within her blouse. It was old but sharp and well maintained. The girls both stripped into their underwear before embarking on their twisted endeavour. Stain removal was expensive, buying new clothes even more so.

"You need to bite down on something," Leanne said before they started.

The almost-Mage gagged herself with her knapsack's leather strap before the Manipulator started carving her flesh. Quick, shallow cuts would have been less painful, but Leanne went slow, mumbling Kat's words, accuracy is key, on loop.

Where shaking hands would have made a mess, the Arcanically controlled dagger remained steady. The symbols were more accurate than Kaitlyn could have ever drawn by hand. The circles even more so, Leanne's spell reflected her mental image perfectly. Though Kat's Aether Sense was still unmatched, she realised her Control still needed a lot of work.

Leanne cut a circle and a square into the forearm first. She started near the elbow and reached halfway to her wrist with the two. The cuts were deep but not deep enough to damage the muscles underneath. As soon as the shapes were complete, Kat cast the regeneration spell with her shaky right hand. The process took longer as she couldn't make the hand signs and had to trace the tubes one by one with her index finger. It stemmed the bleeding and closed the wounds but left ugly white skin in its wake.

"That's brilliant." Leanne gasped. "I'm not as mad as you, but by Drasil's Roots, that is amazing! Why hasn't anyone done this before?"

"I'm sure others have, only they're smart enough to keep it to themselves. As are we," Kaitlyn stated, staring daggers at her classmate.

"Don't give me that look. We need to hold onto every advantage we can afford over the blue bloods." Leanne forced a laugh. Kat knew the seamstress's daughter was friends with some of the noble girls. The young woman wrote it off as a jibe, referring to her speech before the first Trial. "Only, I don't deal with pain as well as you. So I'll get it tattooed on my person instead."

"Find someone you can trust. Someone that won't leak your secret."

"You trust me?"

"I don't have a choice. Just make sure I don't pass out."

The equilateral triangle proved to be a much more comfortable shape than the previous two, while the rhombus which followed was the hardest of the four. After another Accelerated Regeneration, Kat moved onto the runes. Leanne had spent some time studying the human body and suggested she carve them on her palm along the metacarpal bones. Kat agreed but excluded the one that connected to her thumb. The progress was slower since they had to avoid the veins on the back of her hand, it only resulted in more blood loss and pain, but Kat pushed on. She got nauseous and then she got faint, but as promised, Leanne kept her awake.

They paused to heal after every four symbols and managed to fit a total of sixteen on the back of Kat's left hand. Even after the Accelerated Regeneration, the pain lingered. The young woman wanted to scratch at her new scars, but she resisted the urge. Leanne thought they would be stopping with the sixteen, but they did not. Kat had her do another sixteen followed. Four on the back of each finger.

"I reckon your pain tolerance would put most Akhara graduates and Warlocks to shame."

"At least we know I'd last a while under torture." Kat joked, but neither of them laughed. Even though there was no blood in her mouth, its metallic taste lingered on her tongue.

"You need to get some rest," Leanne whispered, pulling the skinnier girl in for a hug. Sweat coated the Manipulation Attuned Mage's body. Kat realised her new friend had likely overdrawn from her Aether Well, but powered on anyway.

"I don't have time for rest, and neither do you. We still have five symbols left, and I need you to do them."

"What? I can't! I've barely kept my dinner down through all the body mutilation. I don't think I can put up with another minute of it!"

"You have to. All of this is useless without the syntax and the keys. I need you to carve them into my fingertips. I'd do it myself, but they're too sensitive," Kat explained. "Please Leanne, all of this would have been meaningless without the last few symbols."

"I need a Familiar. I need a Familiar. I need a Familiar." Kaitlin repeated through clenched teeth when Leanne started on her thumb. The woman's Aether Control was beyond impressive. She channelled energy into the blade, and it glowed blue.

"These are most likely to fade, but I doubt you'd want that," Leanne explained before adjusting the gag in Kat's mouth. "I'm sorry, but this is going to hurt a whole lot more."

The seamstress's daughter passed out from exhaustion not long after they were done. Kat felt mentally and physically drained, but she still needed to learn to use her new tools, so she kept herself awake with another one of her new spells. The young woman was aware rest would be ideal before heading into the Tear, but she reminded herself that Mages were known to take refuge in the realms on the other side of the dimensional gates as well. Not all of them were dangerous and hostile.

Kat reached for her staff, but all of a sudden found herself rifling through Jacque's effects. The pain had wiped all semblance of morality out of her mind, and she had little trouble setting aside her inhibitions. She analysed all the unattuned Cores of ranks one and two. A couple of them were charged entirely. What excited Kat the most was the thick leather volume stuffed into the bottom of her knapsack. The almost Mage warily unlocked the gold-rimmed tome and froze at the inscription on the first page. It was then she understood why everything felt out of place. Kat realised Jaque had not placed the articles in her bag for the ease of carrying. He knew if a person of his skin colour were found with one of House Elmheart's treasured tomes, they'd be brought in for questioning. She was the foreigner's mule. Jaque Arbre wasn't who he claimed to be.

/To my dearest son, Alexander Elmheart,/

/May your endeavours carry our House into its Golden Age./

It felt like she was betraying Sia, but Kaitlyn wasn't willing to let go of the advantage that had appeared before her. She flipped through the tome's pages, and it was like manna from the heavens. It was as if the Old Gods and New were reaching out to her. The Elmheart manual did not detail spells of any Attunement but the art of burning spells into Aethercores, and the process of transferring a spell from one Core to another. What increased its value was the notes inscribed into the margins. Alexander Elmheart had modified it's binding so he could add pages of his own.

Jaque had unknowingly granted Kat the tools necessary for success, and she wasn't above using them. The young woman started by ripping the inscribed page out of the tome. She summoned Aether to her hand and activated the enhanced cauterising spell. She was still figuring out how to use her collection of scars to create spell circles. It was even faster than drawing the runes with her fingertips. The woman's palm glowed white, the skin itched, but she had little trouble ignoring it. Though the spell did not produce a flame, prolonged exposure darkened the cover's silver surface, and the gold lining lost its lustre. By the time she was done with it, the tome was unrecognizable. She hoped to keep it out of Vince and Sia's reach, it was likely they'd recognise their brother's handwriting.

Kat's body wanted her to pass out, but she focused on the inert Aethercore sitting atop her new staff and got to work. She still had eight hours on hand. The young woman was no longer aiming for an ordinary familiar. No. She intended to hunt down a primordial of whatever realm she ended up in and demand a fragment of their being take up residence in her Aether Well. Kaitlyn Smythe had her eyes set on power. For her father's sake and for her own, she was damned well going to get it.
