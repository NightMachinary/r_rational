** Man Larat might turn out to be the only character with a relatively good ending the way things are looking to turn out. At the same time tho as Pilgrim said dawn approaches and he does have the ability to revive a single person once a day. Granted it might actually be a "day" as in sun up sun down, but even then it's kind of unclear that it might still be on the table. There is something kind of really gaming the story at that point to the extent it might not work.

** There's part of me that's hoping that it's Kairos who gets the crown, and then, /somehow/, Irritant/Traitorous's his way out of death (and losing most/all of the power with it).

Unlikely, but he's made a life out of surviving fate.

Or, Cat, and then somehow she comes back /anyway/, and it's either 2 of 3 out of 3 "resurrections" - although I count three life-transitions already: mugging the angels, becoming ~Fae, becoming mortal again.

Or, the pattern is weirder than that: She got dead, then alive again; she got immortal, and then mortal again. Although, she can't do the dead/alive again... maybe god to named, and we're something like full circle?

I'm with the comment on the chapter tho, it'll be Laurence. The only other person with enough oomph in this particular story (except Masego, who's narrativium is now spent) outside of the band of five is Amadeus, but he's not got enough in it - he wasn't even a side quest in all of this, just bonus loot, basically.

It's got to be of the band of five, and I think in that it definitely comes down to Laurence or Tariq.

If it's Tariq, they smother him with that pillow.

*** My moneys on Tariq, Laurence is too caught up in her own shit to accept that Tariq surviving provides a better chance for Calernia afterwards, while Tariq thinks Laurence is the best weapon they have against the Nessy.

Can't say I've ever heard of a language that uses two words and syllables to say "No". Except maybe Cantonese where it sort of translates to "It isn't." But Cantonese doesn't count because it sucks.

*** At least as I was taught, Mandarin doesn't explicitly have yes or no.

It's instead closer to something like:

Q: "Do you have X in stock?" A: "We have [it]" or "We do not have [it]"

Q: "Are you able to sing?" A: "I am" or "I am not"

**** It's very common in Mandarin to use 没有 (literally (sort of): no have; conceptually: we don't have any) for questions like this. Much more common, in my experience, than the single-syllable 不 (no).
