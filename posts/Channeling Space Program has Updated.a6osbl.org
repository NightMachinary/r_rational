** So this is an incredible story on fimfiction about ponies in a space race to reach the moon. While some people here might be allergic to the word 'ponies' in their fanfiction, I would still highly recommend this story for how informative it is on how one goes about building rockets from scratch and incorporate magic into the process.

**** Yes. One of the types has telekinesis replacing hands. The second has highly dexterous wings that can substitute for thands. The third has malleable depressions in the "hooves" that are soft and can basically shapeshift slightly to take the place of hands. (But that one definitely struggles the most with high dexterity activities. Mostly the telekinesis ones do most of that work.)

***** So basically they all have different types of hands.

****** A little anthropocentric, no? :) But agreed that it might be more interesting if "no hands" remained a hard problem.

******* How could a society develop without some form of dexterity? Like you can't make fine tools that way. The different “hands” are just an excuse for why they are already a technologically advanced society in cannon.

******** Just off the top of my head:

1. The society creates technology using biomass, extruding it like a 3D printer. Think Earth insects.
2. The society is in a symbiotic relationship with another entity with a manual dexterity analogue.
3. The society has learned to work around limitations on manual dexterity, creating precision tools and proxies much as humans have learned to work around limited working memory. i.e., they used to be bad at it, but now are not in specialized contexts because of bootstrapping
4. The society exists in an alien medium, like a sun or a waveform. Technology might be based on encoding or creating localized effects.
5. The most boring would be something like telekinesis, which seems like it would have few interesting second-order effects.

******** This exact problem is why, even in MLP Canon, unicorns were king of the hill for quite a while. Until their xenophobia almost destroyed their planet.

Estee's [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/101769/triptych][Triptych]] Is the best rational take on this verse I've ever read, and I spent a few weeks trying to find them.

Mostly nailing down the magic system, and expanding on the kind of culture that falls out of everyone /knowing absolutely/ the thing they are best at.
