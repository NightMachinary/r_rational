Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** In playing /[[https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition][Star Wars: TIE Fighter]]/ a few days ago ([[https://youtu.be/e1GegZSOblA?t=21m18s][video]]), I was reminded of one of /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Vehicles][GURPS]]/'s most awesome optional rules: [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Dogfighting%20Combat.html][abstract dogfighting]]! In wondering whether these rules could be applied to /Star Wars/ vehicles, I ran across [[http://www.theforce.net/swtc/units.html#lucasarts][this /Star Wars/ Technical Commentaries page]] that shows how /TIE Fighter/ represents snubfighters as moving at only around 100 m/s (360 km/h, 224 mi/h). It's funny to imagine [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/TIE/ad_starfighter][the top-of-the-line TIE Advanced]] moving at a speed of only 540 km/h when high-tier propeller-driven planes in /[[https://warthunder.com/en/game/about][War Thunder]]/ regularly exceed /700/ km/h ([[https://youtu.be/BZ9AD9v6ZA4?t=4m35s][example]])--to say nothing of the /jet/-propelled aircraft that are playable in the same game!

On the other hand, of course, a starfighter also is far more maneuverable at such speeds than any fixed-wing aircraft could be, with [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Inertial_compensator][inertial compensators]] and no resistance except [[http://allthetropes.wikia.com/wiki/Space_Friction][Space Friction]]. Based on personal experiments, I estimate that all the /TIE Fighter/ spacecraft have a maximum pitch rate of around 72 deg/s. (On the TIE Fighter, TIE Advanced, and Missile Boat, I can get 36 deg/s with the mouse controls, and I assume that I could manage twice this rate with a joystick, based on how quickly the mouse controls automatically recenter and decelerate the pitching.) This implies maximum G-forces (in /GURPS/ terms, aMR--aerial Maneuver Rating) of 72 deg/s × π rad/180 deg × 100 m/s ÷ 9.81 (m/s^{2})/G = 13 G for a TIE fighter, or 19 G for a TIE Advanced. (Modern fighter aircraft, in contrast, have [[https://defenseissues.wordpress.com/2014/01/11/comparing-modern-western-fighters][turn rates around 30 deg/s]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor#Specifications_.28F-22A.29][aMRs around 9 G]].)

Of course, there are several other items whose determination would be necessary for conducting an abstract dogfight in /GURPS/ with /TIE Fighter/'s vehicles--most obviously, aAccel (Aerial Acceleration), shield generators, armor, and weapons, to say nothing of the other components that go into a starfighter (sensors, cockpit, power plant...). There might also have to be some house rules adjusting the G-forces, since a pilot (HT [Health] 10, plus a G-suit and a G-seat to reduce the effects of high acceleration) risks blacking out when pulling maneuvers above 8 G without resorting to ultra-tech items (e.g., inertial compensators).

Someone in [[/r/ParadoxPlaza][r/ParadoxPlaza]] came up with [[http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/4q68gu][an awesome idea]]: Play an /infinite/ megacampaign of grand-strategy games by assuming that, after 1936 or 1950 (whenever your preferred /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/Victoria2][Victoria 2]]/ mod ends), the world falls into chaos (due to war or plague) and reverts to the level of 769 or 867 (whenever your preferred /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings][Crusader Kings 2]]/ mod begins)!

My recollection of events surrounding /Background Pony/ is that it was /tied/ with /Time Braid/ after my first reading of it, and that it sank to second-favorite fanfiction story after my second (and most recent) reading--but, of course, memories can be incorrect.

The modder with whom he's arguing explicitly compares his problems directly to the totally-historical situations of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867][Austria-Hungary]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion][France]]!

I mean, being annoyed at history is fine! A few months ago, I myself rage-quitted a campaign as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinid_dynasty][Fez]] because my country--in possession of all of North Africa, but still a pathetic weakling compared to Western Europe--was about to be stomped flat by the aggression of Spain and its ally the Netherlands. (Thinking back on it, I probably should have just capitulated, moved my capital to Tunis, and continued the game. [shrugs]) However, complaining about historical accuracy to modders who have made historical accuracy their /goal/ seems rather hilariously pointless.

  1. Society ought to discourage economically inefficient activities.

  2. If some good /a/ can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing and available good /b/ that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to use /a/ and not /b/.

  3. Consumers of new art would be equally satisfied by existing art.

  4. By 2 and 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new art.

  ∴ By 1 and 4: Society ought to discourage new art.

**** I know several people on this forum have pointed out similarities between publicly traded companies and Unfriendly AIs optimising for a quantity called "shareholder value", and though the metaphor has holes in it it's not a bad place to start. (For-profit companies are not in any way /required/ to maximise profits. They're strongly incentivized to, but other incentives exist.)

Something like that chain of logic is why, say, Coca-Cola doesn't write poetry (except for adverts, which doesn't count). Though they don't care at all whether other people write poetry, as long as it's not done on company time. Even from the perspective of an unfriendly AI, I would amend point 1 to "I should not perform economically inefficient activities" and change the conclusion accordingly.

*** I think the essay's point on new art being a drain on the economy is wrong. When it comes down to it, actual monetary resources are the only things expended on movies - the human effort and material effort is low. The effect is to make a few people rich, and facilitate economic flow for the rest of us. The point being that the trade in entertainment resources is an important part of the economy, and with the presence of digital media the only way to /effectively/ trade entertainment is by making something new.

His point about copyright somehow reinforcing the entertainment industry is, to put it lightly, completely fucking retarded. I don't know how someone could draw this conclusion (an irrational hate-boner for copyright or something) but it is most definitely wrong. Remember what I said in the last paragraph, about how the presence of digital storage and the internet made trading old works obsolete? Copyright deals exclusively in the rights of (now digital) distribution - that is, who is the one making money off of that Netflix deal. It's one of the /very/ few pillars making traditional media distribution possible. Taking it away would strengthen the ability of content creators, not stop the tide of art and artistry.

If you want to get a glimpse at where entertainment is headed, look at YouTube or DeviantArt - on DA, artists will take commissions (normal) to create a drawing that anyone can download and mess around with (not normal). The artist has made the money and the reputation, and the commissioner has the right to use the picture for commercial works. But if you want to gaze at the picture, hoping to find inspiration? Well go right ahead - it's not in a museum, it's on DeviantArt! In fact, there's nothing stopping you from downloading it and printing off your own poster, so long as you don't sell it. On YouTube, the majority of money made off of a video is made within the first month. After that, it's up to you to make a new video so that you can continue your profits. To a normal viewer, it's free - so long as you are willing to watch a fifteen second advertisement, the only limit on your time watching YouTube is your time. A producer might cut a sponsorship deal with something like Crunchyroll or Audible, but that goes on behind the scenes. Most advertisement is unobtrusive, so as to not scare off the audience. In both the case of YouTube and DeviantArt, the content and the distribution is basically free, but the creator is paid and the audience is satisfied.

There are still a few kinks to work out, but that's the direction I think /all/ entertainment is going.

*** As usual, the "Parable of the Skills Gap" post has reminded me how terrible I am at understanding extended metaphor. Somewhere buried in the comments somebody explains what real situation each parable is meant to evoke (which I definitely did not understand on my own) and even so, I still feel like I'm missing something. I get the feeling that Ozy had a fundamental /point/ to zer post, and I have no idea what it was. This is a feeling I experience very frequently with extended allegories where the exact correspondences are not made explicitly clear.

** I'm 30% functional so recovering fast. Hopefully faster because I got a thesis to finish and a PhD to start preparing for. Luckily I read that Japan's PhD programs start in April so got some time to get ready, currently learning Kanji and Hiragana and planning to study more math for the exam.

--------------

Also preparing a paper on automatic ontology generation for chatbots. I've been working on making a chatbot using AIML and modified a bit of the code so that it can learn unknown words but I'm trying to tackle the problem of context understanding and knowledge base creation in artificial intelligent systems and rule based systems aren't enough to satisfy those requirements.

I think ontologies may be an alternative to those problems by enabling the system to generate a knowledge base from which to adapt its responses. Maybe a mix of neural networks and ontologies can do it.

--------------

Also upon a recommendation on this sub I started Re:Zero because it was said to be one of the best shows on this season. I enjoyed the themes of time loops in a fantasy world and I'm ashamed to say it took me a bit of time to notice why it felt so familiar, its exactly the same concept tackled in Mother of Learning.

Have to say though that I'm missing Zorian or even Kazuma so much and I want to scream at the screen a lot. The protagonist is so dense that it hurts!

First of all he gets teleported to a magical world and while its new to see a protagonist that doesn't freak out about it, his nonchalant attitude about the whole ordeal breaks the suspension of disbelief. I mean I'm sure anyone that was [[#s][Re:Zero]] would be a little surprised at the very least.

Then he has to [[#s][Re:Zero]] should be a clue.

Then the fact he doesn't seem to try to explore or learn anything about the time loop or the world itself. I liked that about KonoSuba, Kazuma made an attempt to understand the world he lived in and acquire some magic, in this case the protagonist is outmatched by almost everyone and he doesn't seem to try to find out what brought him to the world, whether he may run out of resets and whether he can gain some magic to defend himself so at least he can avoid being killed so much.

Also I don't understand his motivations. He gets teleported to a fantasy world with magic and all he cares about is romancing the princess? I mean, the fact he wanted to save her from dying is understandable and probably the right thing to do but I still found it strange that he pursued that goal with so much zeal given that they barely knew each other and he didn't understand the full extent of what he had to do.

He also rejects the [[#s][Re:Zero]].

Worse yet, in the end the [[#s][Re:Zero]] but it was due to some fluke as the thief girl found him in time. If she hadn't the protagonist would have been stuck on reset mode yet again.

Also the fact the protagonist's goal seems to be to romance the girl but he doesn't seem to realize trying to romance the potentially future ruler of the country will get him lots of enemies, he will require to be able to defend himself and people will be suspicious about this stranger that came out of nowhere wanting to get close to her. For someone that prides himself in his lack of ambition he chose a rather dangerous goal.

Outside of that I've enjoyed the discussions on Reddit and trying to figure what's killing him so often.

The anime is entertaining and I only wish it had a more interesting protagonist, also can't feel interested in the half elf princess, she reminds me a lot of Asuna from SAO and seems a bit bland despite having my favorite VA.

The red haired knight, I think he's named Reinhart is exactly how I picture Zach from Mother of Learning would be, all friendly and full of flashy moves. Him and the maids have been my favorite characters so far.

The story overall feels like Mother of Learning with weaker characters. I can't exactly criticize the plot as it seems to be well crafted overall, the problem is that the protagonist lacks the resources and the interest to delve deeper into it and focuses only on the half elf girl. Plus, it was nice how he got called out on his attitude at the end and I'd be happy if he doesn't end up with the main love interest after all the mess he has caused.

If you are not caught up yet, the most recent episode will be suffering of a very different kind than just being killed over and over. The people who have read the Japanese web novel are saying that the current arc will break down most of Subaru's personality and force him to Grow The Fuck Up. 25 episodes is not short for an anime season, but the author has written a story several times longer than all of Harry Potter, so we are still 'early on'. I like the series, but I do look forward to seeing what happens when Subaru levels up.

****** Yeah, I would definitely say mixed. I think that it's really weird that it's only /sometimes/ a deconstruction of anime tropes, while other times playing them completely straight. It makes the anime tropes that it's playing straight stand out way more than they should and creates a tonal inconsistency that I find really grating.

Subaru only sort of works as a character and I feel like he's inconsistent or off-kilter somehow, beyond just what they're trying to do with the deconstruction. Yes, I do want to shake him like a baby, but I think what bothers me is that I don't feel like he's a hundred percent /real/. I'm having trouble articulating it, but everytime I see the comments on [[/r/anime]] justifying some aspect of the character, it feels like they're talking about someone I wasn't actually watching. I'm fine with having a protagonist with all sorts of fault, so long as they're eventually punished for them, but it's the characterization at the heart of the show that doesn't quite sit right with me. (Most of the other characters are quite flat at this point, though the Rem stuff made me hopeful that there will be more depth in the future.)

So yeah, it's strange and uneven, but I'm willing to stick with it.

******* I'm missing the right vocabulary for this.

Usually, in a deconstruction, you replace the cliché protagonist with an actual human being and watch how all the setting's assumptions catch fire.

But Subaru is not an actual human being. He's your bog-standard Hollywood-zombie anime protagonist. He just happens to be /in the wrong genre/ for his brand of cliché.

So he gets messed up, and that's really unusual and interesting to watch. It just isn't how a /real human being/ would get messed up. It's a robot going "ERROR ERROR I HAVE NOT BEEN PROGRAMMED FOR DESPAIR", with increasingly frantic attempts to stick to what he was /born/ to be.

  Different ways to plot meteorological data?
#+end_quote

I've been sitting on this for a while, but yes! As part of my Honours thesis I spent a month or so working out how to show fairly subtle local seasonality with custom meteorological figures.

[[https://imgur.com/a/f7rNk]]

The first (F4.1) is a pretty standard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climograph][climograph]], though I show both max and min temperature as well as dewpoint (at which relative humidity would be 100%, a measure of moisture content which is very high in this area).

The second (F4.2) shows wind direction, which is important in local Indigenous seasons. The monsoon south-east winds are clear! (further explanation in caption)

Finally, F4.4 shows every day of observation for each of the eight variables, since the station opened ~15 years ago. Tricky to read, but very very useful when I didn't yet know what I was looking at... and to show examiners that it's a complex topic!

** Years long lurker here posting for the first time, hello everyone! With all the awesomely intelligent and creative people here I wanted to ask some quick questions:

I've been recently wanting to recreate my online ID's and was wondering how everyone else runs theirs. I currently run 3 groups of emails and account: personal, professional, and fun(gaming/reddit/reading). With overlap between personal and professional I've decided to merge the two as best I can. The current debate I'm having is weather or not to merge my fun account into it. So I was wondering how everyone here felt/thought. Do you keep your online personalities separate from each other? From your personal identity?

Also: I'm a avid note taker/theorizer/research compiler kind of person and I've realized that OneNote is becoming/is a mess once you reach a point. Does anyone have any suggestions on all the different software out there for personal databases? I'm currently honed in on ConnectedText but was wondering if anyone here had any hands on experience with other systems?

*** I have a personal/fun/everyday identity that I use for everything (this one), which is mostly kept separate from my actual identity. It's not terribly much work to connect the two, especially since I've been using this handle since before Google, but I think it helps put up a barrier between working life and personal life (since obviously I don't want to introduce myself to coworkers or clients using my online handle).

I keep some other identities lying around, but they're usually paper-thin and just for posting things that I don't want directly connected to this online persona. I always keep them collapsible and follow the rules for ethical sockpuppetry though.

They need to be able to be merged back into my regular online identity with, at most, only mild embarrassment and no actual scandal or damage to me. I think of them as little inflatable extensions of my online identity that can be collapsed back in to the center mass, rather than blown.

** How do you make modern gunpowder from scratch?

Black powder is comparatively easy for me to understand; find a surface source of sulfur, make a nitrary using manure and urine for saltpeter, burn wood to get charcoal, then mix them 10:75:15. Each step there is complicated with steps I don't exactly know, but at a high level I have little trouble with it.

But how would you go about making modern smokeless powders (or even something like cordite) from base materials if you didn't have access to modern supply chains?

Edit: Alright, someone correct me if I'm wrong. To make cordite you need nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose, and petroleum jelly.

Nitrocellulose is made by dipping cotton into nitric acid. To make nitric acid, you run air through an electric current to create hot nitric oxide. This combines with atmospheric oxygen to create nitrogen dioxide. You dissolve that in water to create the nitric acid. So all we really need for base materials are water, cotton, and a powerful electric arc (the last one not really being a problem for my purposes).

Nitroglycerin is made from white fuming nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and glycerol. You make WFNA by purifying nitric acid (somehow) and leaving a specific amount of water (again, somehow). Sulfuric acid can be made by burning sulfur with saltpeter in the presence of water. Glycerol can be made by gathering animal tallow and adding lye; it's part of the process for making soaps. Mix that all together in the right way to get nitroglycerin.

Petroleum jelly ... that's a comparatively harder thing to get, it seems, but I don't know what function it serves in cordite and whether it can be replaced with a material that doesn't require comparatively modern and infrastructure heavy natural gas. Chemistry is a weak point for me.

If any chemists are reading this, I'd like to know whether I can somehow get by without sulfur, natural gas, or any petroleum products, or any exotic metals (and I'm hoping that the answer is no, because I'd like for sulfur mines to be a plot point).

Quite possibly gunpowder as well, but I'm less sure about that one.

**** Basically, it's like D&D but instead of each player controlling a character, all the players jointly control a single character. This is usually done via voting. The character interacts with the rest of the world as written by the author, but character sheet generation and certain key decisions are up to the players. It's usually expected that the author use some kind of RPG system as a base to provide a framework for character generation and actions.

I wrote Shinji Quest in an attempt to do daily writing and hit 50,000 words. It's not actually great writing, but I don't think I'd have been able to write so much without the quest framework to motivate me.

**** As far as I'm aware, some operate according to an established structure of stats and skills (like a slimmed-down version of D&D) and give only some liberty to the DM/GM/QM; others roll with only the vaguest stats and penalties and give tons of liberty to the DM/GM/QM (e.g., Roll to Dodge); and still others have no die rolls at all and let the DM/GM/QM use his unfettered judgment. Formats vary /very/ widely.

It's incredibly enjoyable, and I adore being strong and becoming stronger as a powerlifter, but the injuries are starting to become a problem, and for now I'm not willing to get on drugs, which would help a lot with injuries and recovery.

On the other side, if I drop to a bodybuilding routine I would stop being competitive, and I do enjoy meets a lot, both for the competition and for the people.

Guess I'll continue until I'm either willing to get on drugs or I get injured enough that I can't compete regardless.

** The way Reddit is circlejerking over how terrible the 2016 Olympics are going to be is one of the reasons I don't even visit the front page anymore. I'd be willing to bet that the Olympics are going to be a grand success and Reddit is going to collectively say that they didn't see that coming and that they shouldn't be that quick to judge and a few days later the cycle will continue with something else.

Speaking of the Olympics, I have no particular fondness for it, and as with all sports that have turned into multi billion dollar churning juggernauts I feel that they're just a huge waste of time and resources. Note I don't have a problem with any sport being played, just the way in which it is monetized and how the players are glorified.

***** I think it's worth distinguishing between individual pieces of intellectual property and categories/genres of them.

Individual works can lose value when they get replaced by something better, get more competition (of roughly equal quality), or else saturate their markets. They also lose value whenever their entire genre does as well.

Genres/categories don't lose value nearly as quickly or as much. For example, I can't see "transportation" or "communication" becoming less valuable in total, despite trains and post offices losing business. Things like "propaganda" and "Morality tales (for one specific set of morals)" /can/ lose value over the entire genre.

Technologies only lose value when it is replaced by something better. Literature can lose value when the culture shifts away from it as well.

*** I agree with you, but I'm not at all an economist. My reasoning is basically:

There are a limited number of sentient beings the planet can support (even if you go fully transhuman and convert the people to ems and the planet to computronium). Assuming that we want the term "value" to have any meaning, then there's a limit on the amount of value that a single person can place on ... well, everything they value. If you push a mind to the limit, you can get a single person to value saturation, where it's no longer possible to create more value for them. If this is the case for all minds, then no additional value can be created, and the economy as a whole is no longer growing.

I don't know how long that would take, but that's a scenario where (I believe) you reach the end of economic growth with a single planet's budget.
