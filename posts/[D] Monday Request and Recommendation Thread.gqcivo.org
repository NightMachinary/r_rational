Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

The first two arcs are completed - there's been an introductory arc, then a sect ranking contest arc.

The current arc involves the MC going on a mission in the mortal world for the first time, and it's just about reaching its climax.

** I recently found a 4-panel webcomic called 1/0, a brilliant little piece of metafiction. In short, it's an exploration of religion, philosophy and science through the lens of self-aware characters in a universe lacking a fourth wall.

It's 1000 strips long, and I read it over a couple of days. Well worth the read.

Pinging [[/u/BoxSparrow][u/BoxSparrow]], who asked for stories that explore meta concepts, rather than writing a separate reply.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/][Nowhere Land]] is a "horror" jumpchain where a junior member of an anti memetic threat organization finds himself at the mercy of an alien system that shunts him from world to world, it's unguessable goals further obscured by it's clearly broken state.

While the protagonist travels through worlds of preexisting works (first pokemon then madoka magica) the story is for the most part about the mysteries that the author is setting up about what exactly is happening to the protagonist. While it's too early to know for sure whether there are satisfying answers to those mysteries, I really like what has been set up.

If you enjoy strong mysteries, the protagonist/POV character having his mental state screwed with, and a dollop of lovecraftian horror, check this out! Just be aware that the first jump is a bit slower, to set up the characters, still very good, but once the second jump hits things pick up.

Also, your signature on SB has the following:

That part of my signature is in reference to the broader Jumpchain community. A while back (a couple years, by now), I made a few jump-docs, which are what you use to pick what powers you get and so on. Those are just the stories/universes I made them for. I've stopped making them at this point, but I leave that info there in case someone has a question for me.

******** That is...a mistake, actually! Jumpchain docs all use a d8 for legacy reasons, but it should be one d8 used to simulate a coin flip for the first seven options vs the last seven options, and the other d8 used to pick the exact domain, with a roll of 8 on that die being free choice. That must have slipped my mind. It's a couple years too late to edit the post, but when I'm off work I can make a new pdf to that effect.

********* I'm really loving Nowhere Land, but the Johnny Bravo Mirror doesn't seem particularly memetic. I mean, it's mind-affecting, but not all mind-affecting things are memetic, and it's specifically holding the handle, not seeing the mirror or hearing about it that triggers the effect. The effect's "delivery method" seems to have little to do with information transfer, perception, or understanding.

********** I could have elaborated on that a little more, looking back. The effect is haptic, that is to say, it's based on the sensory feeling of hand-on-handle, and the information conveyed through that avenue about what exactly was in your hand. (For example, running your hand across a plank of wood while blindfolded would tell you that you're touching wood, whether it had been sanded down or not, and possibly the direction of the grain as well.) If you had nerve damage and couldn't feel the handle at all, you would be fine. Hopefully that parses better.

(edit: there's an argument to be made about why it /stops/ working when you let go of the handle, since you'd still remember, and to that in turn I'd say that knowledge of the handle's feel is only dangerous in tandem with the actual sensation of holding the handle, which raises the question of why they didn't go to their Sensory Hazards department for help, the answer to which is that there isn't one, because most sensory hazards are already memetic or cognitohazardous anyway, and so any such hazards fall on those departments.)

** Royal Road's trending fictions has some pretty good ones this week:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission][Mud's Mission]]: Super good LitRPG with a non-human protagonist, who's characterized as a partially-bounded optimizer. Probably deserves a top level post.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper][Cosmic Interloper]]: A little bit like a crossover between Altered Carbon and a Sanderson novel; for the older fantasy aficionados here, it's kind of like an updated version of [[http://www.watt-evans.com/thecyborgandthesorcerers.shtml][The Cyborg and the Sorcerors]]. The basic premise is that an augmented human gets isekai'd into a magical world, and shenanigans ensue.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31129/fantasy-world-epsilon-30-10][Fantasy World Epsilon 30-10]]: The main character is very similar to Jason Asano from He Who Fights With Monsters, except instead of getting isekai'd on accident he's doing it on purpose. It's mostly about a semi-modern society as represented by a single MC gently storming through a classic medieval fantasy environment. Does contain a couple of explicit parts.

And something that's fun and totally not rational (though it hits a lot of the tropes and themes people here seem to like):

- [[https://www.crunchyroll.com/my-next-life-as-a-villainess-all-routes-lead-to-doom][My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!]]: the title is very descriptive. It's like if Kaleidoscope was set in a light dating game. The main character uses her knowledge of the game's plot to try and save herself from inevitable doom, like your average rational isekaier - without ever reassessing the current state of things, namely that she's already changed the lives of every character to the point where they're unlikely to want to, you know, kill her. She's also incredibly dense and kinda dumb, but in a lovable golden retriever way.

​

But I've been loving Villainess, it's really fun in a turn off my brain while I eat dinner show. Although the joke is starting to get old, which seems to be a plus for the anime with only 12 episodes and a negative for the novel.

​

The format is quite good and has potential, but the author decided to make it a harem, with an oblivious MC, when it would have been more interesting and fun without that trope. Somebody could become really popular by making several good short 80k word stories following a similar format, without competing with all these 1kk word epics we see in webfiction.

**** Sure, I can post them afterwards. I'll post a few here, since you asked:

Smelling a thunderstorm. This is true. The build-up of energy in the formation of a thunderstorm causes the production of nitric oxide. This in turn, breaks down Oxygen (O2) into singular Oxygen (O) atoms. The O atoms combine with O2 molecules to become Ozone (O3). Some of the Ozone is pushed down to Earth level by downdrafts.

Multiple bee stings causing an allergy. False. Bee allergies are largely genetic. If you get stung multiple times, you'd build a resistance rather than develop an allergy (beekeepers will usually get stung on purpose in order to develop this). It is possible to develop an allergy to something, though the science behind it is unknown (theories are either down to increased hygiene causing immune system issues or nutritional deficiencies).

Chopping the back of someone's neck to knock them out. Ineffective. You knock someone out either by choking them out (accomplished in martial arts by hitting or grappling the front of their neck, or striking inbetween their shoulderblades) or by scrambling their brain (by punching their head hard). Even then, knock outs tend to only last seconds, up to a couple of minutes. Longer, and you've done some possibly permanent damage.

***** Multiple stings can kind of cause an allergy by exacerbating a previously unnoticed allergy. Allergic responses get worse with repeated immune system activation through a process called sensitization. If you ask people with severe allergies they will often tell you that the first time wasn't too bad but they got worse. 1st time hives and rashes, 2nd added difficulty swallowing, 3rd hard to breath for example.

I don't recall Hunter x Hunters usage of bee allergies though.

****** That makes sense. It stated that all people can develop allergies after being stung multiple times (which is untrue).

Though funnily enough, allergies are often treated by exposure to very small amounts of the allergen over time, so the same tolerance building can work in people with allergies, it's just exposure over a certain amount causes the opposite effect.

*** I've been actively picking out the best bits of MHA writing on AO3 for over a year, and I have to say that MHA does not lend itself well to any sort of rational deconstruction, even when people make it more realistic and complicated in clever ways.

I think this is mostly because the premise that “everyone has superpowers” is incompatible with a setting where “society strongly resembles modernity”. Also because powers that are strong enough to be truly threatening and interesting are too dangerous for the integrity of the setting when used in a clever way.

Shigaraki and Kurogiri alone are a combo that could do untold damage to infrastructure. Guys like Overhaul just...do exist. Think about the absurd terrorism potential of Yaoyorozu's ability for like, one second. This is barely taking into account the incredibly dangerous Quirk combos that definitely do statistically exist amongst the population. But even if dangerous, immoral, motivated people could wreak havoc with their quirks, they won't, because the implications of their abilities mean that either society would not exist in its canon form or that there needs to be a special in-universe justification. And eventually those justifications would start stacking up into something that is clearly ludicrous and would deprive a ratfic of its spooky rational power.

You can get a bit more mileage if you lower your standards for shipping, cleverness, originality, or excessive self-pleasuring via overwrought superpower harems or grimdark genre-shift revenge edgelords.

There's very little originality and the character/reader fics have somehow managed to get a serious foothold, eating into the surrounding discussion of fanworks.

Hero Class Civil Warfare is up there, but it's more of a heist movie than a rational narrative. Midoriya is assigned the role of Kingpin in a hero class joint exercise and puts everyone through an ordeal that makes canon feel like a giant missed opportunity.

You could try One Yen Hero, but it's not super long just yet. Midoriya has a power from Mistborn that forces him to manage resources. Sidesteps canon somewhat by sticking him in class 1-B.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7722541/chapters/17600416][Spire]] is a story that originally started as a subversion of time travel fanfiction, where I wanted to put the focus on the characters that didn't have future knowledge, so the reader would simply see changes rippling out and not know who was causing them. It's in a somewhat similar vein to /Team 7's Ascension/ or /Shinobi: Team 7/ in terms of its approach to canon, and the general 'feel' of the world, although it's less violent and dark.

You need a hook here. "Sasuke is confused" is not one; definitely not, if you mention it in the middle of other changes.

**** Thanks for the detailed breakdown!

I think some of the summary issues are due to the limitations of fanfiction.net (where I use the same summary), which incentivises using phrasing that is familiar to the fandom-specific community there. That said, the summary for this story is something I've struggled with a fair bit in the past.

I'm trying to hit three key notes - firstly, I want to indicate that a focus of the story will be the characterisation and development of the four members of Team Seven, who have somewhat different personalities to canon. Secondly, there's an overarching plot that doesn't necessarily match the canon plot directly, rather than this being a slice-of-life ramble. And thirdly, the story spends a lot of time on combat/combat-preparation aspects of ninja life.

With regards to the hook, I think some (definitely not all) people find the first line intriguing enough to get them to start reading. However, this clearly didn't do that for you. Do you have any suggestions for a stronger hook?

I'm happy to hear that the first scene had a strong hook - I've rewritten that chapter a few times and I struggled a lot with making the opening engaging.

It's really a story about a melding of both horrifyingly outside-context X-risk and horrifyingly incomprehensible human evil - two things that don't go together in real life.

The reason 3125 is worse than real life viruses or real life evil antihuman ideologies is because it combines the relentless, undying inhuman aspect of viruses and other threats with the active evil and malice and desire to inflict suffering as an end goal, valuable in itself, of Fasicsm. So really it is a bit of both.
