** The narrator is completely omniscient and hardly ever bothers to keep secrets, so the plot just blazes forward at top speed. I can't imagine it working outside of what-if fanfiction, but it's refreshingly straightforward.

*** Having now read a few chapters, I can't recommend this. It's too much of a fix-fic / wish-fulfillment for my tastes. Challenges are sparse, and are usually dispatched in the same paragraph they show up (that writing style again).

**** Step 1. Build a printing press.

Step 2. Kill everyone who is jealous of your printing press.

Step 3. Congratulations! You have now saved the world and ushered in utopia!

** Point of divergence: Tyrion's trial; Tyrion goes up against the Mountain himself.

Continues with Tyrion being particularly clever for the remaining nineteen chapters, plus other characters showing commendable intelligence.

*** How comprehensible is it for someone who is pretty unfamiliar with ASOIAF?

**** Fairly so. The good bits involve Tyrion doing clever things that don't necessarily depend on inside knowledge of the series.
