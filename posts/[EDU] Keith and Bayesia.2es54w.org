** I thought this was a good piece on the difference between Bayesian and frequentist statistics. Thinking about it as looking at row sums vs looking at column sums was a comparison I'd not heard before, and I think it really helped my comprehension.

** That... was atrocious. It only makes sense if you've /already/ learned at least the basics of both Bayesian /and/ frequentist statistics.

Well, I suppose on StackExchange that might be expected, but as educational literature...

*** Ohh, come on. The only prerequisite you really need is the definition of confidence intervals, and you could learn that in any basic Statistics course.
