Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I have a hypothetical situation, I do not know if it's "munchkin" per see, but it's close enough I think :\\
In two weeks, you will obtain actionable omnipotence (no omniscience, no real time-travel, but complete control of causality)\\
In one week, everyone (from the old multi-billionaire to your nice grandma) will know for certain that you will obtain actionable omnipotence.

How do you survive one week with a "isekai-normal" body (no injury, better than average physical capability, less than average view of one-self, wealthy family)?

*** Would survival really be an issue? How much of the world would really be trying to kill you in this scenario? And you don't really need to worry about captivity since they won't be able to hold you for long.

Anyway, there are still probably parts of the world that it would take a week or more to find you in, maybe remote mountainous parts of Afghanistan?

Alternately, what form will their knowledge that arrives in one week take? Do people learn your name? Your appearance? Just a vague notion that is confusing unless they already know you or interact with you after being alerted? These all demand slightly different responses.

*** Get a false identity, then get a boat with no electronics of any kind on and no identifying marks, then travel straight out into the pacific somewhere far enough north that bundling up and covering your face isn't suspicious while randomizing your course, then find and iceberg and burry into it far enough to maximize your chances of surviving if they decide to carpet-nuke the entire reachable northern pacific.

Note that you can survive for two weeks with zero food easily, only small amounts of water you can carry under your clothes, etc. And stuff like sleeping in your own waste or staying completely immobile trapped under rubble/snow take more than 2 weeks to kill you, and with the stakes and the face you can restore yourself to perfect health instantly once you get the powers makes being near death by starving, dehydration, and a dozen other things at once doesn't matter. So collapse that iceberg tunnel behind you, make it so narrow it'll be impossible to reverse back out, etc. if it helps you hide or prevent a larger scale collapse if the iceberg shifts at all.

*** What exactly does everyone know in one week?

Like, say a complete stranger suddenly learns in one week, that you will obtain actionable omnipotence in another week. What exactly does he learn? Does he know your face? Your name? Your location? Does he know that killing you would prevent this?

If people only learn that someone will gain omnipotence, but do not magically gain any additional knowledge on who that someone is, then surviving is super easy since you don't really need to do anything. Just don't stupidly shout that you will become god in two weeks or something similar.

Every additional piece of information they gain will make things harder. A first name isn't too bad unless you have a very unique name. A face can be changed. A full name would be annoying. A location? Now you are in deep shit, since they could just nuke your location immediately, so you better be in some really fast transportation in exactly one week to get out of the blast radius ASAP.

Otherwise, if the information gained is very limited, the main problem would be people you are close to. Friends, relatives, etc. People who could realistically identify you from few clues. But if you are in an "isekai-normal" body, presumably you are the standard school dropout NEET with no friends anyway... so really the only problem is your parents, and whether they would trust you with actionable omnipotence. But, seeing as your parents love you enough to put up with your NEET dropout-ness, I would guess they would love you enough to not kill you to stop you from gaining actionable omnipotence.

** You're completely invulnerable to any attack or anything at all that you're not aware of. So all forms of surprise attacks don't work on you -- whether it's a sniper's bullet or a sudden knife attack, you'll be completely unharmed.

Poisons, mental attacks, magic spells etc won't work either if you aren't aware you are being targeted at that exact moment. You are also immune to their effects if you don't know or at least have a good idea of what they are.

This ability is active at all times and there's no upper limit to what it can shield you from. You could even survive a nuclear explosion if you were asleep when it went off.

Basically you can't get hurt by anything you don't know about. If you get hit by someone with super strength (and you're aware you're getting hit), you'll receive the full damage only if you're aware that they possess super strength. If not, you'll only receive around the amount of damage you'd expect from someone of their physique and level of skill.

The obvious downside to this ability is it's basically useless when you know when you're being targeted and how.

How would you use this power effectively as a villain/hero in a typical superhero world? How would you use it if you suddenly got it in real life?

*** Hmm. Suppose I blindfold myself, and get a friend to flip a coin: if heads, hands me a bowl of food. If tails, hands me a bowl of poisoned food.

I eat the bowl of possibly poisoned food, well aware that there is a 50% chance of this food being poisoned. But since the chance is only 50% instead of 100%, technically, would I be considered aware that I am being targeted by poison at that moment?

Taking things further, what if I am put to sleep, then when I wake up, I am told that I have been put inside a virtual simulation or a lucid dream? Then, even if I am attacked by any means, would I be immune to the attack since I believe the attack is fake and so am not aware of being targeted by any real attack? (For that matter, do I actually need to be put to sleep? It is possible our world is a simulation anyway, what if I just believe in that?)

Essentially, the key to exploiting this power seems to be to get a trusted ally to deceive you.

​

Edit: So to be a hero, just team up with another hero (or get a sidekick). Then in combat, wear a helmet that blocks all light and sound, except for a communicator to let your ally command your body to move in whatever specific manner they believe is best. Just make sure the ally never ever lets you know whether you are currently in danger.

And the ability works using what you believe to be true as a reference. For instance, it you were from a remote island and had never heard of guns and how they operate before you'd be completely invulnerable to gunshots until the moment you learn that you're supposed to be killed (or at least injured) whenever you get shot.

******* I think the mechanics of immunity still haven't been examined carefully enough. What does immunity to harm mean here? Like what does immunity to a toxin mean? In the normal course of things, a toxin will collect somewhere in the body (bloodstream, liver, cerebrospinal fluids, etc.) and have some biochemical effect (binding to a chemical receptor site to disrupt ordinary function, affecting concentrations to accelerate/alter/prevent other necessary reactions in process, reacting with cells/tissues in a directly destructive way, lots of others and actually complex interactions of several of these). What exactly, does the immunity do? Does it prevent things from happening exactly at the point they would become "harmful"? In that case some agency has to be deciding how harmful is defined and munchkining is a process of hacking that agency's decision making in detail. Do all the ordinarily physically harmful things happen, but causality is somehow interrupted to keep your status completely divorced from physical reality? Then it becomes necessary to start hacking these divergences.

*** How does the ability interact with altered states of consciousness? For instance, really heavy self-hypnosis? Hypnotize yourself to be unable to perceive threats.

In real life, a lot of accidents happen before you can react, so for example you would have less to be worried about with car accidents blindsiding, but an accident you can see coming is still a hazard.

For superheroing... develop a counter intuitive fighting style that puts opponents and threats in your blind spot and lets you hit in the direction of your blind spot. Wear a mask and gear that limits your senses. Then don't claim to be invulnerable, pretend to be a street-level hand-to-hand hero that just seems unusually good in fights with a weird fighting style and stubbornly wears an awareness restricting costume. With any luck, your weird fighting style may make opponents think you actually have Daredevilesque sensory awareness and not realize it is an extremely contextual invulnerability.

What about allied super heroes with mind altering powers? Have BrainReprogrammer (who was having a really hard time finding a suitably heroic application for his powers) make you automatically become unaware of a list of threatening things. It would require a trusted ally to direct you but it would be a tough form of invulnerability. Keep your invulnerability secret so that Villain don't know how it works and don't try to work around it.

*** Yeah, modifying your own beliefs seems to be the way to go. If you have access to the ability to modify your memories, excising your knowledge of how your ability works and instead inserting a belief that your power consists of being completely invulnerable to all forms of harm seems like it'd work.

I think this state of affairs would be roughly equivalent to the immunity you state would be conferred by a complete lack of knowledge of the harmful function and purposes of guns. In this case it would instead be a complete lack of knowledge of the harmful functions or consequences of anything that exists.

** Watched [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3118452/][Circle]] last night on the basis of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jv88dx/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gci3r1r/][the Monday Recommendation]] and am curious as to what people here would do in such a scenario to 1) maximize their own chances of survival, 2) maximize the satisfaction of their own values, and 3) maximize humanities chances of survival, given foreknowledge of plausible interpretations of the final scene, i.e. a 98% culling of humanity. What strategies would you use to sway the crowd to your desires? Assuming similar but not identical crowd composition as that seen in the movie.

I think I would personally, 1) try to identify the appropriate series of nested majorities / pluralities to which I belong, and try to form voting coalitions along those blocks, progressively whittling down the crowd while not annoying enough minority blocks before capturing the majority (I think the latter is where most misstepped in the movie -- they appealed to majority inclinations, like homophobia or racism, but lacked unity among that majority and so were able to be picked off by the minority plurality), 2) accept my "death" with equanimity and grace -- either the eccentric alien billionaires are "evil", in which case you're screwed regardless, or they're "good", in which case self-sacrifice might be rewarded (they've already demonstrated arbitrary command of knock-out tech, maybe that and not death is what's happening, so I should sit down and roll backwards to make sure I don't concuss myself falling), and 3) try to persuade my fellow contestants of this premise, and probably prioritize medical doctors? over, say, survivalists, since they'd have the most immediately relevant skills and could pick up e.g. engineering know-how in the coming apocalypse.

** I was thinking about dropping Pact/Pale Practitioners into a Fantasy setting and it occurred to me that they might end up as Lord/Ladies/Kings/Queens in a Feudal system.

How would you optimize a Pact/Pale style of Oath that a ruler takes to ensure they are a good ruler? These Oaths can be broken, but it instantly and permanently takes away the Practitioner's powers and leaves them vulnerable. Even just pushing the line against the letter vs. spirit of the law might be bad karma: draining the practitioner's power and giving them bad luck. As a ruler of a country, this could be disastrous, with the Practitioner-Ruler's bad karma adversely effecting the entire country as a Fisher-King effect. This might discourage people within the country from gainsaying their Ruler or present a vulnerability that enemies might try to exploit by gainsaying or forswearing the Practitioner-Ruler or finding loopholes catch clauses to ensnare the Ruler

Thus the Oaths need to have carefully constructed conditions, escape clauses, and penalty clauses to avoid dragging the country down if the Practitioner-Ruler does break or bend them while still enforcing the ideals of a good ruler in a useful way.

Ideas for Oaths?

** You are a Tolkienesque Elf (as expanded upon by Lintamande: list of abilities [[https://lintamande.tumblr.com/post/104138086138/canonical-supernatural-abilities-of-tolkiens][here]], Some Glowfic that is a bit more readable as a story than standard Glowfic [[https://www.glowfic.com/boards/18][here]] with further interpolations)

To summarize your abilities:

- You can mind read thoughts of people they aren't trying to keep private. Among humans unaware of Elves, most leave most of their thoughts unconcealed.
- You can telepathically communicate on the order of hundred of meters, on the order of kilometers for those you are intimately familiar with.
- You have supernatural control of your body.
- Your hearing is supernaturally keen. With enough practice and the right lore, you can learn to hear abstract/immaterial things.
- Your eyesight is supernaturally keen (able to make out hair color and count individual people from tens of miles). With concentration you can see (with lower acuity) near infared and ultraviolet.
- With technical skill, artistic effort, and willpower, songs can perform magical functions. Common ones include minor healing, minor illusions, minor and subtle local manipulation of weather, and subtle mental effects (morale, motivation). Rare/difficult effects include major illusions, tearing down or constructing buildings, major manipulation of local weather, minor manipulation of regional weather, and major healing. Basic common songs might require years to decades (depending on artistic skill) to compose right and require skill and a few minutes to adjust to a given situation. Rare/difficult songs might require immense artistic skill and decades to compose and require hours to adjust to a situation or complete artistic mastery and minutes to adjust. Recording don't work well as the cannot be easily dynamically adjusted.
- If you are very in touch with nature you might develop the ability to talk with animals and plants. This ability can be also be learned on a per animal from others that have it. This ability gradually increases the ability to communicate and articulate themselves on animals it is used on. This can also be bootstrapped into sapient/sentient talking animals with generations of selective breeding and a existing intelligent species.
- Items you craft that you put artistic effort and technical skill into can perform their functions supernaturally well: a camouflage cloak that actively adjusts its camouflage, bread that is tasty and filling, a clasp that holds tightly until you need it to come undone and then it comes undone easily, a rope that practically tie and unties itself with a touch, etc.
- Iterating on improving your technical skill and lore with making and using these items over decades or centuries can push their function up to the outright supernatural: the cloak can grant outright invisibility if you are still, the bread is as filling and nutritious as a full meal with a single granola bar sized portion, the rope can move on its own
- Among the established crafts: Ring Lore can make rings of invisibility, rings of luck, rings that glow, rings that grant enhanced telepathic communication (10 to 100 times longer range). However rings on the power level of the 3 or the 9 might take decades to centuries of research, immense willpower/focus, thousands of hours to actually cast the enchantments, and might permanently spend a portion of your strength/willpower leaving your weakened after.

Weaknesses:

- Long term exposure to ugly environments as the same mental effects on you as a severe case of seasonal effective disorder in humans. Imprisonment in an ugly environment for a few years might outright kill you. Generally, nature is beautiful and most human cities are a bit too ugly. New Jersey might outright kill you over a few decades. Aesthetics can vary or be learned, giving you a bit of leeway if yo can learn to appreciate an otherwise too ugly environment.
- You can die of grief/lack of motivation.
- Although control over your body means in the short term (over several months, up to a year) you can get by with less food than humans, over the long term you might need 1.5x to 3x the calories, protein, and nutrients (depending on how heavily our exert yourself).
- Giving your word can have a direct supernatural effect, giving you bad luck, lack of motivation, and weakened supernatural abilities if you break it. Swearing an Oath to God can literally compel you and severely weaken your motivation and abilities if you try to break it (and if God finds the Oath offensive, cause fate to work against you even if you do try to fulfill).

Some scenarios to Optimize for:

- You have just established yourself in Beleriand. Morgoth's Orcs have been pushed back, and his Balrogs are dangerous but limited in numbers. You have several centuries before he breeds more powerful monsters. Morgoth is basically a demigod, especially in his fortress.
- Sauron has just been defeated by Isildur, but your abilities are destined to gradually fade with each passing century. Your existence itself will gradually fade with the passing millennia.
- You have been released in Canada, 1534. Almost all the other Elves are in Valinor, a separate pocket dimension. You have reason to believe your abilities will gradually fade over the passing centuries.
- You are a modern human and spontaneously gain the above abilities and weaknesses.

*** Are you sure the mind reading and telepathy doesn't also require significant training and skill? I'd also suspect that a lot of these are powers humans can in theory learn if they only lived long enough in the setting, and found in elves only because elves can practice these skills for many centuries, rather than being linked to biological hardware. A few of these, like the superhuman artistic skill and control of your body, would be weird if someone that lived long enough /didn't/ develop.

You can pick up concepts and programming languages easily, your mathematical maturity is generally high but nowhere near Terence Tao levels (your probability theory is great, though) and you speak several languages. You don't have a college degree nor particularly want to get one. Social skills are mediocre, but you have a few solid friends, and acquaintances all around the world. You don't keep in contact with your family. You spend around $700/month.

Your goals are to become stronger, gain power, understand the world, and optimize it. What do you do?

*** Understanding the world is an interesting phrase. You're not going to achieve a top-level understanding of any scientific discipline without a decade of academic study, so a lot of interpretations of that phrase are ruled out. You're not going to do mad-science super-villainy without knowing enough high-energy physics to build your death laser, you know what I mean? You're basically limited to the power that comes from money, the power that comes from social connections, and the power that comes from prior success at changing the world.

So my three-phase plan for you to gain ultimate power looks something like:

- Find a set of low-cost-of-intervention political spheres. This probably means relatively populated sub-entities in under-populated political entities (so the one town in a rural county, or the one metro area in Idaho/some party of Wales, or whatever). Decide on a theory of political engagement and activism. Raise money and run experiments in those spheres. (Be sure you're always working with, not against, the people already on the ground.)

- Find a circle of friends who strongly take ethical positions you agree with and want to continue agreeing with. Surround yourself socially with these people. Use this as a way to inoculate yourself against the sociopathologies of the rich and powerful, whose ranks you hope to soon be joining.

- Leverage your successes in phase 1 to run more experiments, building on the previous ones. Keep doing this to bootstrap your way into a position of influence with the political party whose work you're supporting. Remember that you are always working with, never against, institutions; if you disagree with them, that's fine, just avoid engaging with them in the dimension of your disagreement and find ways to work with them that validate your worth in the other dimensions.

You're not going to get immediately super wealthy doing this, but your political action organization pays you a decent salary to start out with (don't get greedy here! even just taking a few grand per year for expenses vastly increases your personal runway) and if you prove yourself successful you're looking at the usual run of speech fees, book deals, and consulting gigs.

** You are an average normal person in the real world. *How would you go about becoming a masked vigilante low-level superhero?*

*Some rules:*

1.you need to become a true masked hero, like the ones in comic books. You must achieve the objectives of superheorism via traditionally superheroic efforts, not trough using your options otherwise, even if it would be more rational or ethical.

1. Your goal is to become a classic superhero: someone who utilizes gadgets and his own athleticism to defeat criminals in combat, and hopefully bring them to justice. Gadgets, gizmos and martial arts are allowed, guns are not allowed, and explosives must be used non-lethally against humans.

2. You have a weak 'NO KILLING" rule: you should only kill a criminal if there is no other option, and if abstaining from killing them would immediately cause the death of at least 1 innocent person.

3. You must maintain a secret identity. You are allowed to disclose your identity to max 3 people: one of your loved ones, one government official/cop, and one assistant.

4. You must consciously conform to stereotypical superhero tropes if possible. You are only allowed to break the tropes if it would put some innocent person in direct danger, if it would be 100% suicidal, or if it would be physically impossible to perform the trope in real life.

5. You must have a gimmick or a theme. Witty one-liners are optional but encouraged.

6. You must perform in a way, that if your adventures were later televised, they would make an entertaining show. Being rational is allowed, being boringly practical means failure.

For the sake of the argument, Average Person here is a healthy but not overly fit Middle Class person, 30 years old, with pretty non-descriptive/forgettable face, $11,700 in savings , small suburban house with a tiny windowless garage, and no people dependent on you. No spouse or kids, no house-mates. Assume your martial arts skills start as that of someone who took some casual Jiujitsu lessons in college, your technical skills are of someone who can fix simple things around the house and car.

You are also as strongly motivated to become a vigilante (within stated rules) as possible for a mentally functional person.

You live in an average sized American city with average crime rate. No super-villain exist, but there is about a dozen of hardened criminals who would not hesitate to take a life, and about 500 casual thugs who could dish out violence, but are not bad enough to be on FBI lists. Atop of that, lets say 2000 people who break the law, but are not career criminals. The Police are neither particularly straight or crooked, /might/ look the other way when they catch you superheroing, but only if you keep it clean and nice (more friendly neighborhood Superheroman, less Frank Castle).
