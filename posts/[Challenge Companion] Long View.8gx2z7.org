*tl;dr: this is the companion thread to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8gx1th/biweekly_challenge_long_view/][the biweekly challenge]], post ideas, comments, or recommendations here.*

I think the long view in fiction faces a few fundamental narrative problems, the most significant of which is that the long view by its nature is usually not about immediate points of tension. If you're doing what you can to make a big impact ten generations in the future, either that impact is probably visible to the current generation, or there's little immediate visible consequence (or assurance that you've actually done it). That's not to say that depicting the long view is a lost cause, just that it faces some hurdles in terms of how a story is structured and what conflicts work well within it.

Do you have any recommendations? Any notable works where the impact of a character's actions will be felt most keenly long after he's lived his life?

*** Part of the reason this can work so well is the fact that he wrote so goddamn many books. It would be hard to match that sort of progression with a smaller series...

That does present a way to get around the tension issues raised above. By having the benefits and actions of a person be felt over lots of books, you can have a series of smaller plots that, whilst demonstrating Seldon's [[#s][tag]] impact, don't necessarily focus on it, instead presenting other plots and arcs.
