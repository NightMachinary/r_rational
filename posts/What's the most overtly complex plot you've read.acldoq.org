I am currently deliberating on the feasibility of a project. It's probable that it's not my original brainchild which is why I need to establish my bases. I, therefore, need examples of a plot which seems absurdly complex to the point of "No ways this can work in real life".

1. But if the plot itself is divvied up into a lot of smaller chunks, each idea is executable independently. The only reason for its infeasibility lies in the "Everything needs to work out exactly this time around".
2. But if the plot is analyzed, no two events are co-dependent in a major way; i.e. one could come back and retry accomplishing the said part of the plan before moving on to the next.

I'm looking for rational analytical examples where a lot of population manipulation takes place.


** It's difficult but possible. Look up the Xanatos Gambit on tvtropes. You set up events such that both the success and failure of a group benefit you.

Ex: Make robots that steal from museums, but they look like the protagonists. So if they succeed, you have a bunch of stolen goods, and leak the identity to the press. If they fail, you've just framed the protagonists with theft (remember to include self destructs).

Have later plots depend only on the protagonists being known thieves.

** I think the main plot of /Fullmetal Alchemist/ (the manga and the /Brotherhood/ anime) could qualify. It's an extremely complex conspiracy carried out over centuries of history, but I'd consider it plausible compared to your average conspiracy theory as it has [[#s][spoilers]] at its core, and involves very few people in the know at each time. While not all aspects of how the story itself unfolds are believable [[#s][spoilers]] the conspiracy itself, in that world, I could see working.

** I think /Fine Structure/ takes the top spot for me, followed by /Ra,/ both by Sam512. I'd explain why /Fine Structure/ in particular is so convoluted, but I'd have to understand the plot for that. There's a lot of interconnected plot lines, exotic high-energy combat, hyperdimensional shenanigans, world resets and such. It also has, as you put it, "population manipulation" going on so you might want to have a look.

*** I usually like intertwined plots and have no problems following them, but /Fine Structure/ has been giving me headaches. It's enjoyable but almost frustrating at the beginning, when it feels like you're reading multiple unrelated novels.

*** I liked the density of overlapping plots in the /Terra Ignota/ series, but most of the plots were background.

*** IIRC there's a chronological re-cut of fine structure, which I expect makes it more comprehensible, though I've not read that version.

Fine structure and Ra were the two things I thought of when it came to complex plots, along with Primer.

** If you want realistic population manipulation, look at propaganda in real life. It seems that the best way to go about manipulating lots of people is to bombard them with lots of little things, there's a lot of research into this if you want to look it up. Study things like Hitler's rise to power, it's probably the best case scenario for something like that happening IRL (he got pretty lucky).

Speaking of that time period, something that meets the criteria of (1) is military maneuvers. The whole thing is complicated and interdependent, but each part is fairly simple and if it fails the plans are left open enough that other parts can be changed. But at that point it starts to not seem like one plan, because it really isn't. What you're asking for isn't really an overcomplicated plot, it's breaking a problem into pieces and solving them; the realistic way to go about it.

I don't see how you can really hit (2), since success in working towards your goal in one way will probably change how you work towards it in other ways.

I'm not entirely sure I know what you're asking for. Do you want plans that seem complicated when you put the pieces together, but could still be pulled off? Because you could do that by looking at a historical event in hindsight, and ignoring how people were changing their plans as they go.

** The most complex plot I've come across is in /The Golden Age/ trilogy by John C Wright. After the story is up and running there are long stretches of plot twists or reversals of fortune almost once a page. I started reading /really carefully/ to check for plot holes, because the shear accomplishment of writing like this without plot holes was astonishing.

*** An individual gently steering the opinions of the entire populace to fit their needs.

Just the scale of what acceptable things initially and finally and how the said task is accomplished is overtly long drawn and complicated. Not a one-off or even a 10-off plan.
