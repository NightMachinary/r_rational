** The first steps, of course, are Suze's "not torturing people" recovery. Step two is apologies. I'm not sure which step "make it so they don't go to hell every night" is.

***** [[/u/moralrelativity]] just raised a good question. Does Jake get to keep his items/ enhancements when he goes home?

*** "Hell every night" is specifically for people she feels have wronged her. How is that a problem? It seems to be voluntary on her part.

**** It's not a problem if she's OK with changing alignment. But if Suze does want to stay Neutral Good then she needs to see this as a problem and then fix it.

** Is anyone else really curious how the world will fare when he gets back to earth with POPE enhancements and any magical items he munchkins for personal use.

***** I think that would be a short book. If he made it home with just the Rule of Size, Jake would be infinitely wealthy instantly -- buy a chunk of gold, Enlarge it, sell it back for a ridiculous amount. He could Shrink space payloads so that one launch could put up 4096x as much volume / mass of stuff. He could smuggle things undetectably -- just Shrink them and turn them into a piece of cloth.

That's just the first three things that pop to mind. Could be a fun series to write, actually.

*** If I recall correctly Jake does not get POPE enhancements because he doesn't have stats. But he does get the intelligence boost he wished for.

**** He doesn't get experience so the FLEA isn't any use to him, but he uses the POPE even though it can't boost his Int any further, just his other stats.
