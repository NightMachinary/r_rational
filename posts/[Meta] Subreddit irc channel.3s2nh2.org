Hey there, so in regards to the failure of the slack chat-room to take off. Figured I'd set up an irc channel (#reddit-rational) over on freenode. If you don't know how to use an irc client, there's a web client over at [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-rational]] that will take you right to the channel.


** Was there a dedicated [[/r/rational]] slack, or are you talking about the general Less Wrong slack? The LW slack seems to be going fine, though [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_Slack][it's a bit hard]] to get to.

*** No, to my knowledge there was a dedicated [[/r/rational][r/rational]] slack.

** In fact, this link saves you the typing in of the channel name! And OP should have made that the link of this post.

*** You are correct, had forgotten about that feature. Editing my post for convenience then.

*** I added that to the sidebar, in place of the link to the (dead) Slack channel. I don't personally use IRC, but hopefully there's a place where people can talk in real time if they want to.
