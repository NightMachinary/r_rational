Let's say the power is something fairly generic, and not too powerful. Say, "can sense the emotional states of all people in a 1000m radius of themselves, and has an attendant sub-power to allow them to keep track of all those people and emotions, regardless of how many there are."

Oh, and an attendant question: if we can get that person under our thumb, what would we have them do?


** You don't.

You help them become and stay a productive and functional member of society. If there is one empowered person, they are not likely unique going forward. As long as they are not a wolrdbreaker, the most important thing is to set the precedent of how such folk are treated. If they are a potential wolrdbreaker we want them stable and happy for our own good.

Rational altruism all the way.

** Easy become friends with them. Then ask for favors. See if I could have him somehow transfer or awaken any powers in me.

As for how to exploit a person with that ability fuck if I know. To be honest a person that could sense emotional states would never be manipulated by anyone with less than perfect emotional control. Best idea is just to be that persons friend.

Assuming I could get him to do what I said there's not really much I could do with empathy (which is the power you are proposing). The person with the power could probably rise really high in politics and with practice could be unnaturally charismatic. I could help him rise to power which would benefit me quite a bit. Assuming of course I wanted to push him in the political power direction, which I would avoid at all costs, politicians that cannot effectively read minds are scary enough as is.

I'd probably just tell him to become a motivational speaker or something. I'd have a friend that gives great advice and could get women in bed easier than James Bond. I could tag along and get all the hot women I want with minimal effort. And in the end that's all that really matters right?

Yep, that's the fundamental problem.

Note, though, that the person in question approached the community themselves, asking for help with their powers. The idea is that, disguised as advice, the community can try to manipulate them, whether by consistently giving the same kind of advice or by presenting extra-convincing arguments.

Okay, fine.

Statistically speaking, for the context and audience? Find a skilled liar amongst the ranks. Get them to claim to be female and interested in the supe', not just their powers.

/Ooooh no, sexist!/ Not so. Get your fucking finger away from that downvote button. Yeah, I see you.

Look. Doesn't matter the target's gender, or the manipulator's real one. Most people posting online are lonely (and often narcissistic). Lonely (narcissistic) men want to talk to nice, intelligent, interested women online (about themselves). Same thing for lonely (narcissistic) women, oddly enough.

That's basically what the long-established /Ashley Madison/Pinterest/ continuum tells us, anyway.

Once contact is made and lures are set, /IndieGoGo/ funds together to hire an attractive actress on a simple pretense, give the actress the chat logs to study, lure the supe' out, drug them, and drag them back to my...I mean, /a hypothetical person's/ secret bio-hacking lab just off the California coast in a converted oil tanker, to discover what makes them tick.

Also, assume they're lying about the scope and nature of their powers. Prepare for the worst (short of a one-person insta-Apocalypse). Full flying brick, teleportation, mental control, the whole deal. Avoid compulsions and (simple) memetic hazards. Have OpenCV apps on monitors interpreting and reprocessing raw data, TTS instead of your voice, and a Dwarf Fortress-style pool of lava under them connected to a lever close at hand when they wake up. SCP's /Foundation/ should have nothing on your setup.

It would help if you could scare the supe' a little right after drugging them in public, just to see what they try to do, but I'd lean towards going full /Prisoner/ on them first. GPS tracking collar, lonely location, lots of cameras, etc.

Harsh? Maybe. But consider.

This is potentially the chance to figure out how to give the entire human race an ability as important as speech (more, maybe), /regardless/ of the actual stated power, as well as rewrite the laws of physics (most likely). Letting such a person wander around where they could, any day and at random, get hit by a bus or run for congress, and thus waste their potential to change humanity forever, is not an acceptable risk.

** Most suggestions for that sort of question-and-answer on this forum rely not just on having the stated superpower but also in being an incredibly driven person willing to extensively research and learn new skills for the sake of manipulating their superpower. Although these sorts of details can easily be hand-waved away in fiction I expect in practice a person will not be able to successfully carry out most of these plans. In addition, if the plan involves the superhero covertly getting a lot of influence and power, and this community will inevitably break up into factions on the best end to use this power.

I suggest to rat the guy out. To the police or domestic intelligence, through a secure channel, if they're too dangerous, to the media if they're not. If they're the kind of person who posts here they should be more than willing to be subjected to scientific research (assuming they're assured it's safe for them), which can have a broad benefit to humankind. A potential problem is if we can't find the real-world identity of this person or can't convince anybody else their powers are real (though if we can't convince anybody else the guy's superpowers are real, we have to start wondering why we're so convinced ourselves).

***** See, this is all a meta-meta-plot designed for when I come out as someone with superpowers, so I know the potential ways people on the boards I'd ask for advice would react.

All goes according to keikaku.

****** It's pretty funny, because that's actually what I thought you were going to say next. I'm upvoting the OP just for that.

******* In all seriousness, I've considered making an "in-charachter" account where I roleplay as someone that that has supernatural powers and is asking for advice, and then write out stories of what they do with them. Like a series of quest threads, but a bit more immersive. Unfortunately, I don't think I'd care to spend that much time on it :(

I'd probably have to introduce some arbitrary limitations to explain why I'd keep the character contained to an arbitrarily small geographic location as well. Maybe something where the end result of the quest is finding some sort of power-granting item, and sending it in for analysis?

******** Sort of like Marble Hornets and those other ARG blogs? Those have a very nice style, but unfortunately they're all about Slenderman, or worse, an extended Slenderman canon.

********* The idea would be to only respond to posts treating it like it's in-character and providing "evidence" (read: bad photoshops) that is accepted by people who choose to join the roleplay. For example, back in the planetside 2 subreddit we had a alt called "NS Corra Dald" that roleplayed as a Nanite Systems customer relations spokesperson, and exclusively replied in-character. Everyone knew it was clearly a joke (including, obviously, the person who ran the alt), but people still replied as if the alt represented a real person because it was amusing.

  Track them down and kill them, assuming that's possible. You don't fuck with /transhumanists/, guy. You don't really know how their powers work; they could turn out to be some kind of horror from beyond that's going to kill everything in a few years. /The Precautionary Principle/ has the right approach to this one.
