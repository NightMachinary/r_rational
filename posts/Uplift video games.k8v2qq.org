Are there games that build on this concept of improving the world or a community through technology and social policy? Specifically I'm hoping for examples that come from individual action, rpgs where you roleplay as a Lord or inventor etc. As opposed to maybe 4x like civilisation where society as a whole advances but its very impersonal


** Factorio. The premise sounds stupid but I played it nonstop for a week the first time I tried it.

*** When I first started playing it, I only slept about 8 hours over a span of three days. I had seen some reviews call it "cracktorio" and I was skeptical, but it's pretty accurate. Transforming a barren landscape full of hostile alien creatures into an increasingly-sophisticated industrial supply chain to drive expansion and research can become surprisingly addictive.

*** Factorio. Ugh.

I spend all day programming, I don't need to do it afterwards as well! But its so addictive. Crush the native wildlife, consume the resources in all ways, industrialize, develop, and send rockets to space.

*** FYI: If you're maxed out on Factorio, or find the factories to be overwhelming, I can totally recommend Mindustry; instead of having one huge map, the game's split up into multiple smaller maps so you get to "reset" your factory often.

The game also has blueprints unlocked from the very beginning, which is nice.

** To be honest, I don't see how that would be doable to a satisfying degree.

To make characters life-like enough for an RPG, you need to hardcode their story arcs.

It's then impossible to make those story arcs dynamically respond to societal changes caused by the player.

These might nevertheless be close enough to what you want, but all of them are far more strategy than RPG:

** My Time at Portia. I mean, it's not a very good game in /other/ ways, and I'm not sure I can in good faith /recommend/ it, but it DOES very much scratch and explore the exact issues requested in the OP, and it's a very relaxing/meditative experience to completely turn your brain of.

** In /Tyranny/ you roleplay as the main lieutenant of a Sauron-like evil overlord. You get to slowly control more and more the diplomatic and military fortunes of the campaign that is conquering the last free corner of the world for his dominion, and depending on your choices, things can take different turns. It's not exactly what you're describing (the whole game likely takes place over a space of mere weeks), but it's an example of something similar (also just generally a really good game).

** My Time At Portia is the closest I can think of. You start small, with bus stops and street lights, but eventually build windmills and windbreaks to support a new town being constructed, and a crane to install in a new harbor they build. There's no action on the social policy side, though.

** Have you heard of Idle Games? You don't (generally) play as an individual making individual efforts, and they're not particularly story focused, but due to their low-development cost and mechanical purity they can have really wild scopes which lets them really dig deep on a concept, taking things to their logical conclusion pretty hard. There are at least a few set in civilisations which you manage on various scales.

Kittens is really excellent, you lead your tribe of cats to the stars (and... beyond), I /do/ find myself losing weeks to it at a time... alternatively I recently played a few hours of Evolve, it's decent, more active, has you directing some smaller scale actions sorta thing. Probably best to put "Idle Game" in the search criteria for both of these titles...

There's a subreddit called Incremental Games that's got a whole bunch more of them.

*** The excellent and Bostrom-inspired [[https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/][Paperclip Maximizer]] is an example of this.

And it turns out I've had a game saved since the last time I played months ago. I know what I'm doing for the rest of the afternoon!

**** I'll second Paperclip Maximizer, a good intro to idle games. Not too long like some of the others, with decent progression balancing well enough to introduce things just when a previous dynamic get's old.

The concept is disturbing in it's implications, but it's a good cautionary tail. Ensure anything you create shares all your value objectives, otherwise it will maximize to given parameters.

***** It may be healthy to use [[https://github.com/cameroncondry/cbc-kitten-scientists]]. The UI is terrible, but it basically does auto-clicking so that you don't have to return to the game every 5 minutes. By default it does /way/ too much, so I disabled everything and then added things back slowly.

Not having to refine catnip all the time is much nicer.

****** I don't refine catnip unless I need a quick boost in wood. I'm not crazy! If it takes a little longer to get there and I waste some efficiency... eh. I'm mostly letting it run on its own in a tab and visiting occasionally for some conversions/upgrades to get to certain objectives (right now I'm aiming at a Steamworks).

** I remember Dark Cloud 2 feeling like this, albeit with a bit more time traveling. You are an inventor, and 1/2 the game has you sort of develop villages in the past to help establish things in the future, and you can apply your inventions more directly to your personal ridebot as well for the other half, the combat portions.

** Some games like Crusader Kings can be played that way, but thats not really the point, and there are hard limits.

The recently released Per Aspera has you playing as an AI with the goal of terraforming Mars.

There are probably plenty more if you stretch the concept. Deus Ex has your character effect the world in the story, but its not really reflected in game.

If you are looking for something like the alternate history story trope of the self-insert and the following civilization uplift attempts, but as a video game, then no

Let me know if you find some
