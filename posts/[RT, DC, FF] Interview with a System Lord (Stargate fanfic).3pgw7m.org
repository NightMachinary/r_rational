** This is absolutely brilliant ! It makes so much more sense than an independently evolved symbioite being compatible with human biology. This is going to be my personally preferred canon for the series. The mindless symbiote feeling pain in the home waters is puzzling at first, but makes sense as Baal"s after-the-fact interpretation of the symbiote memory.

*** I've updated that sentence slightly. I was intending it to mean that the symbiote has only animal intelligence without a host rather than being completely mindless.

ETA: Also, yes, I've absolutely accepted this as my new headcanon. :-)

**** Also, regarding the very last line, why would Baal being able to possess his interrogator so easily ? Surely the Trust would take precautions, despite being portrayed as criminally negligent in canon.

Any chance of expanding this into a full (fanfic) episode ?

***** It's canon that Ba'al infiltrates the trust. They currently have three suspiciously easily captured Ba'al clones on board. It's probably a trap. :-)

My track record of long-form fan fiction is not good. Multi-chapter things tend to get abandoned unfortunately.

** I'm reminded of [[/u/DocFuture]] 's personality drift concern, and the first thing I thought of when I read the description of the anticipated Brain in a Vat experiment while reading The Terminal Man

*** The always remembered 7.9999 million years of primordial rage, fear, and hate probably has something to do with the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil][Always Chaotic Evil]] nature of the Go'auld in this scenario, yes.

** How is saying "a Go'auld doesn't control the mind of its host" consistent with the Tok'ra, who /actually/ don't control their host?

*** My working assumption is that the Tok'Ra are all crazy and/or lying and/or engaged in an extreme degree of compartmentalization to deliberately offset the worst effects of the symbiosis. I agree it's a bit of a flaw in the theory.

**** IIRC the Tok'Ra inherited their Always Good natures from the Tok'Ra queen, because of the genetic memory thing, so you only need one Goa'uld to figure out a way to reduce the mental problems and then reproduce.

***** Yep, but this actually reinforces the plausibility of all three versions of the theory - all you need is one Goa'uld to go crazy / decide to lie / compartmentalize and all their descendants are likely to follow suit.
