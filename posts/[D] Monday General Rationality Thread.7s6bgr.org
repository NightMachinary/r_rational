Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

tl;dr: The hypothetical rogue AI's job of turning our world into a dystopia (at best) is already slowly being completed by corporations (governments, etc) because that's just what the evolutionary selection criteria dictate them to do in their biomes (e.g. unhealthy competition in financial markets, quarterly profit reports, etc).

[[/r/rational/]] and other related communities, as well as the more mainstream infosphere is full of hypothetical discussions about how AIs should be restricted /when/ they finally become a finished thing. However, not much practical discussion is happening on restricting those agents that not only are similar to such rogue AIs but also already exist and already are influencing the structure of the world-wide political, economical, legal, ecological, etc systems.

Is it because corporations --- and corporate unions, governments, etc --- have no sense of novelty as phenomena, so what they do gets overlooked as part of the “Normal”, the status quo? Or maybe it's because it's easy to imagine how you'd be fighting some imaginary monsters that don't exist yet in real world, but when it comes to real gargantuan entities like these mentioned, people just realize just how helpless they are and don't even contemplate trying to change something?

And mostly, even when people /do/ try to change something (through protests, activism, etc) it either has no results or the results are just not enough in the constant tug of war (e.g. privacy rights, internet rights, ecological regulations, etc). And even then the energy is being directed against specific things that are happening /right now/, instead of against the underlying system (of values economical, political, etc) that is the cause of all these symptoms. People often talk about problems of a two-party political system, or modern capitalism, etc, but what actual, concrete things have been happening towards adding working muzzles for the relevant agents operating in these fields, or towards changing the very basic nature of these systems?

*** I feel like your statement, that many [[/r/rational]] type people are not interested in the dangers of capitalism, is false. For just one example, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][the most popular post]] from Slate Star Codex, an [[/r/rational]] related blog, is about the dangers of capitalism.

That aside, while it's true that AI and current-world-structure (corporations, etc.) have many similarities, they function quite differently in important ways.

The type of AI that [[/r/rational]] type people are interested in are not rogue AIs that turn the world into a dystopia; they're rogue AIs that exterminate the human race in a matter of days from when they're created. While dystopia is bad, extermination is (probably) worse.

And, like you said, it's /very hard/ to destroy capitalism, but it's relatively easy to make a stand against AI risk because there's hardly anyone working on it. I'd guess something like a couple hundred people worldwide are working on AI risk while hundreds of thousands of people worldwide a working on capitalism.

*** I wouldn't say the threat of corporations is overlooked - I mean, the means for addressing the ongoing threat seems to be a key feature of most political ideologies. On the liberal side, you have people saying we can get the government to regulate corporations and make them work for society. "Let's put the AI in a box and use it strictly for our benefit."

On the conservative side, you have people saying that the government is corrupt, inefficient, and unable to effectively regulate corporations. They argue we should relax or even suspend corporate regulations and let competition in the market along with intelligent and well-informed consumers/workers direct the course of corporations. "Don't box the AI, just allow everyone to produce their own competing AI and then let the fittest survive and dominate."

The problem is, corporations already run the mainstream media and corporations fund the media with advertisement. Media outlets that suggest solutions which are bad for corporate profits/shareholder gains will be less likely to get funding than media outlets which do the opposite. "The AI already controls your main sources of information and is allowing you to debate two different options to deal with its increasingly global domination..."

Of course, both sides have something right. Liberals are correct that the side-effects of corporate profit-maximization are a major threat while conservatives are right that corporations tend to take over any government agencies meant to regulate them. Unfortunately, this makes corporations both very dangerous and very hard to control. We're already living in a dystopia of sorts, a world where corporate profits are maximized at the expense of human health and global climate security. "The AI is already maximizing paperclips while leading you to debate about what's causing the change in climate."

The only proven approach I'm aware of for dealing with this is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism][anarcho-syndicalism]]. Basically, workers start forming unions and vote on the services they want their unions to provide (healthcare, disability, education, etc.), and vote to start forming alliances with other unions. The unions use strikes to get employers to pay their workers fairly and thereby enable the unions to provide the benefits the workers have opted for. As the alliances grow larger, the unions provide larger-scale services (disaster assistance, welfare, lobbying, etc.) and gradually a national or even transnational federation of unions is formed which begins providing even more services (security, national infrastructure maintenance and development, etc.). Capitalism and the state gradually become irrelevant as the unions take greater and greater control, using strikes as needed to enforce compliance. When businesses collapse as a result of the strikes, the union turns them into worker-owned cooperatives, transforming capitalism into socialism. With organized voting blocs, the state is gradually taken over and withered into nothing, turning a corrupt republic into an anarchist opt-in direct democracy.

In practice, this was tried in Spain and got to the point of having a large federation of unions providing essential services in Catalonia when a fascist coup in 1936 turned into a civil war and forced their slow transition to happen immediately. An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936][anarchist revolution]] in Catalonia followed and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo][CNT]]-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federaci%C3%B3n_Anarquista_Ib%C3%A9rica][FAI]] formed the backbone of an anarchist democracy. George Orwell [[http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/][wrote a book about it]] after he traveled to Spain to join the revolution and even survived getting shot in the neck by a fascist sniper. He wrote:

#+begin_quote
  "I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life---snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.---had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master."

  "There was much in this that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for...so far as one could judge the people were contented and hopeful. There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gypsies. Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine."

The system still seems vulnerable to the tribalism and discrimination that are running rampant in modern democracy, but it at least has a way to establish economic incentivizes that don't directly reward exploitation or openly encourage poverty.

***** Efficiency has value. Great Britain tried focusing on the working class in between the end of WW2 and the Thatcher era. It worked well at first but eventually lead to massive stagflation and economic upheaval. The government could not effectively adjust to changes in the global economy like the lack of demand for British coal.

There is an ideal middle ground between anachro capitalism for pure money making efficiency and total state capitalism for pure humanitarian concern for the poor. Where exactly that is is very difficult to say, especially since it shifts as technology changes.

******* I told you already, having no concern for efficiency and just trying to get people jobs and welfare has been tried and failed. The Soviet Union and every other communist nation was founded on the concept. Much of the world excluding the US were doing government funded inefficient industries so the working class had advantages.

It failed.

You presumably consider the Nordic countries a good example of the ideal nation states. I do too. They do not have minimum wages. They do rely heavily on market forces, not government forces, to determine wages and prices. They have strong unions that set minimum wages for each industry, which works because if an industry is growing weaker, then for it to keep any jobs it'll need to lower pay, which a government federal minimum wage would unflexibly disallow.

I think a 0% corporate tax should be the goal that is worked towards, because corporate taxes are inefficient. They deincentize investment into the economy and incentivize corporations wasting money looking for loopholes.

I also believe in high taxes for the upper income brackets and taxes for investment gains. Taxing rich individuals is better than taxing corporations.

Then those taxes can be in turn invested into an effective social safety net, and that social safety will ideally be efficient at having poor not-die.

No. I reject wholly the premise here: of an "ideal nation state." No such thing. A nation state carries with it millennia of toxic bullshit and constitutes hierarchy. The ideal is obviously to destroy all forms of hierarchy, and also death. State, corporate, everything. The state capitalism of the soviets and the child sex slave emporiums of the anarchocapitalists are extremes of concentrated hierarchy.

If you want to talk about ideals, my ideal is something like, "[[http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm][the Culture]], but with a willingness to live forever and more enthusiasm for megastructures."

I'm not convinced, so I decided to do some [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2005;&marker_axis/_x_which=murder/_per/_100000/_people&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][data analysis]]. Your hypothesis would predict a line going from the lower left up towards the top right, but there does not appear to be any strong correlation. As an example, in 2005 India had slightly fewer murders per 100,000 people than the US, yet had 36 times higher rates of malnutrition in children under five years old. Violence rate could certainly be a contributing factor in famine, but it's clearly not the main factor.

For comparison, per capita income and famine appear to have a [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2002;&marker_axis/_x_domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][strong negative correlation]]. Oddly enough, agriculture as a percentage of GDP also appears to be [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2007;&marker_axis/_x_which=agriculture/_percent/_of/_gdp&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][positively correlated]] with famine, while industry as a percentage of GDP appears to be [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2007;&marker_axis/_x_which=industry/_percent/_of/_gdp&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][negatively correlated]]. Odd that the countries seemingly making the food are in famine while the countries making the iPhones are not. Also, more time spent in school appears to [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2007;&marker_axis/_x_which=mean/_years/_in/_school/_men/_25/_to/_34/_years&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][inversely correlate]] with child malnutrition.

From looking at the data, [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2008;&marker_axis/_x_which=corruption/_perception/_index/_cpi&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:1.1&zoomedMax:9.4&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;&size_which=income/_per/_person/_gdppercapita/_ppp/_inflation/_adjusted&domainMin:null&domainMax:null;&color_which=children/_per/_woman/_total/_fertility&use=indicator&scaleType=linear;;;&chart-type=bubbles][this graph]] seems to explain things best. Higher up means more child malnutrition, further right means less perceived corruption, larger dots means more income per capita, and color represents fertility rate (babies per woman). Most countries with GDP/capita < $6K have child malnutrition rates > 10%. Most countries with a Corruption Perception Index < 3 (lower is worse) have child malnutrition rates > 10%. The countries with both CPI < 3 and GDP/capita < $6K almost universally have child malnutrition rates > 10%, excepting only the Kyrgz Republic, Honduras, and Bolivia. No country with GDP/capita > $13K has a child malnutrition rate > 10%. No country with a CPI > 5 has a child malnutrition rate > 10%. Lower fertility rate also tends to correlate with lower child malnutrition rate.

So, if you want to mostly fix famine, the solution would likely be to eliminate government corruption as much as possible, provide affordable access to birth control, and promote economic development in every country up to at least a minimum GDP/capita of $6K and preferably $13K (adjusting for inflation, of course).

You may now carry on with your discussion.

Yes, that is me exactly. The children were essentially slaves, and there was a monarch in power in Belgium, albeit a constitutional one. Belgium exercise control in the Congo through military power, not through any sort of democratic process.

Mainland Belgium itself at the time was fairly capitalist and, while I don't know that much about 19th century Belgium, from what I know it's internal policy was pretty good for their time period and technology. Their foreign policy was however downright evil.

A capitalist country does not need to have a downright evil foreign policy. One example would be how Denmark(one of the best modern countries in the world IMO other countries should aim to be) does not currently have a foreign policy that exploits other nations. You might say that's just because they're small and don't have the power to, and that's fair. A better example is what the US did to Japan after WW2. Japan was an exploitable enemy nation the US had immense power over. The US did not turn Japan into a country of slaves to make cheap goods for America, although short term they were making cheap goods for America, they turned Japan into a capitalist democratic nation that over the following decades rose to become one of the most powerful countries in the world. Denmark's is what I want the US to be, but Japan is what I want most of Africa to be.

It depends on what your definition of exploitation is. I'm fine with someone taking the surplus value of another's labour if both people's standards of living are rising, especially one we can tax the "exploiter" and redistribute the wealth back to the "exploitee". And extreme exploitation is being reduced. Before, there were literal slaves in the US. Now there aren't. Before, a fifth of the planet was colonized by the UK and had their resources unfairly extracted. Now, very little of the planet is colonized by the British and former colonies standards of living have been rising for decades.

Coal subsidies are really nasty, but Denmark doesn't have them, and Denmark is what I want. The US is not the best example of capitalism there is.
#+end_quote

First, I insist that you stop projecting isolationism onto my arguments. "Socialism in one country" was one of Stalin's madnesses and I disavow it yet again.

US (and British) imperialism created and have sustained KSA for its whole existence, funding its promulgation of wahhabism both directly and indirectly. The US (again in partnership with the UK) overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran to install their pet dictator, causing the Islamic revolution.

But the solution is not isolation, and I have not suggested it is. Globalism and the international project surely share, if nothing else, a recognition that we are not American or Saudi or anything else but human.

  Forgot to reply to a couple points. The alienation of late stage capitalism isn't causing a backlash, Brexit and Trump and Duterte are just a couple missteps in an otherwise improving world. Trump says a lot of really nasty things and done a few bad things, but hasn't actually done much that'll shake up the country long term. Brexit and Duterte are pretty small in the grand scheme of things.

Generally the world is getting better on reducing extreme poverty, increasing literacy, that stuff. If you want me to bring some official stats in I will.

Generally, slowly true. But millions die waiting.

  International rallying has been the socialist's cry, but it hasn't actually worked very well. Working from your perspective that the USSR did so badly from USA intervention, if the USA goes through a similar revolution, what's to stop China from intervening in the USA and establishing themselves as an hyper power?

  Are you saying this as if it makes the situation not-capitalism somehow? Not sure where you're going with this.
#+end_quote

To be clear, my definition of capitalism is the ability of people to freely choose what skills they want to develop, who they want to work for, what they want to buy, and what they want to sell. The less freedom people have to do what they want, the less capitalist. Sometimes that's good, e.g it's a good thing people aren't free to sell heroin. I don't want pure anarcho-capitalism. Sometimes it's bad, for example rent controls limit people's ability to sell housing how they want, leading to people not developing housing as much as they should because it's not profitable.

Colonialism is a very bad thing, 1. Because it's actively immoral and hurting people, and 2. It's not granting them freedom to work where they want, they're being forced into labour. When labour is forced, it's not capitalism.

  The social order at home was funded by exploitation abroad, as ever. Even after the Belgian government took their mad king's abattoir, they left the administration intact and the exploitation going for another half century, just somewhat less bloodily.
#+end_quote

It didn't have to be funded by foreign exploitation. Belgium was doing pretty well prior to their gaining colonies. Drawing the line so we don't do terrible things to others can be tricky, but I don't think it's as tricky as trying to create a socialist utopia that actually functions. Denmark's doing pretty well. Japan is a major country that doesn't even have a military force for foreign intervention.

Yes, they benefit, but my point is a capitalist state that doesn't actively exploit others can exist. If Africa and Asia begun to raise their standards of living and were non-exploited, Denmark wouldn't collapse, especially since it'd probably mean Africa and Asia would have even higher production capacity to trade.

Again, the words "your ideal state" imply that you haven't read a damn thing I've written. So let me use the bluntest possible phrasing. FUCK ALL STATES. Past, present, and hypothetical. Moving on, let's just suppose that the UK goes full put-the-queen-in-a-council-flat labour and achieves relatively-not-barbarism. What can they change? They'll still need resources and goods manufactured around the world, mined in the deathtraps and assembled in the sweatshops of capitalism. They can't expropriate the assets of their parasitic billionaire class, who would simply flee to another bourgeoisie democracy. They can't start a war against the entire global capitalist hegemony.

The problem with this definition is that it quickly runs into problems when there are limited resources and multiple people want the same stuff. If there's one 100 units of gold but 101 people want an unit of gold, there's not much you can do about it. As for people being free to do what they want to do, there's only a few things in the US that are wrongfully illegal IMO.

A lot of homeless people are homeless because they have disabilities or conditions that make them very hard to house. The housing market is broken because of some bad regulations in some areas. Not that we should just get rid of all government intervention and believe the market will fix itself. The government does have a role to play, but it has to be careful. I'll be honest, I'm not sure what the most effective way for the government to intervene is, I'd have to read up on it, I just know price controls aren't it. Building low income housing sounds good, since it's fine for the government to undertake charity. Charity is only bad when you're unreasonably expecting corporations to be doing it when they're job is to make money, not charity. Better for them to maximize money then the government taking a portion of that money for charity than to try to get the government to tell/order corporations to give to charity.

#+begin_quote
  Under capitalism, if you don't work, you starve to death. There is no force greater for compelling labor. That just sounds like reality. If people don't work but get as many resources as they want, we'll run out of resources rapidly. We are not in a post-scarcity society. But I am fine with giving limited resources. I like the idea of universal basic incomes and other welfare programs are fine to. Anyways you missed part of the point that it's not able being forced to work, it's being forced to work without choosing who to work for. If you only can work for McDonald's, they'll pay you $1 even if you're earning them $8 because you have no other options. If you have a choice between McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc. you can negotiate for an higher salary, and having balanced negotiating power is extremely important. Denmark et al have strong unions, a big part of why they're so successful. In the US the government is essentially the negotiating power of the lower classes, enforcing minimum wage, maximum hours, etc., but they're inflexible unlike unions. So the US government might set the minimum wage to $9 and McDonald's would never higher you since they'd be losing money, even if you'd want to take the job for $6 or $7.

  What gives a character of passivity to the general exploitation of the worker to extract surplus value? I said this before. If both parties benefit, even if one party is benefiting more and is being "exploitative", it's a net good. If everyone's getting richer, I don't care so much if the 1% are getting super-richer. But taxes to redistribute that wealth are still good and still exist, mitigating the issue further.

I think we need two different words then, because we're both using capitalism for two different things. How about instead of my version of capitalism, which is about freedom of various things, I'll say "liberalism". It has connotations which also include freedom of press and democracy, but those are both pretty essential to what I was referring to as capitalism so I think it works.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Gold is good at holding value. It doesn't corrode easily, so it doesn't naturally depreciate like how copper fairly easily rusts. It's pretty rare, it's relatively unlikely a massive new mine or a trade agreement with Chile will change it's value much. It's been traditionally something that holds value and that momentum helps it along. It is useful for conducting electricity in certain scenarios where other metals aren't as useful. It being shiny makes it good for jewelry, that is a value. I think investment in it is fairly silly, there're better investments, but it's not a massive amount of irrationality with no explanation.

But my scarcity argument wasn't actually very good. I haven't debated capitalism in depth very much. It's basis was good but I didn't expand on it much.

Giving everyone an equal amount of gold is fine in a simple economy. I think hunter-gatherers could live in that start of equal distributive economy because they only had a few goods. But when it's a massive economy, it's much more complex.

You have 100 people. You have 10 units of gold. You have 20 units of sapphires. 20 units of diamonds. 100 units of copper. 200 units of food.

How do you distribute it when different people like things different amounts? Some people going, "I like copper just as much as gold, they do practically the same thing." Other's going, "No gold is way better. I'd prefer 1 unit of gold over 200 units of copper". Everyone needs 1 unit of food but after that it's luxury.

Weighted preference seems like a fair model. The guy who loves gold gets more gold than everyone else, but fewer other resources. The guy who thinks gold and copper are equal gets extra copper. Liberalism is a super-intelligence at distributing these resources in weighted preferences.

Problems do result when the mild preferences of the rich take preference over strong preferences of the poor. Like if the gold guy was poor but the equal metals guy was rich, equal metals guy would still end up with more gold. But that's the trade off we pay for a super intelligence that we need to distribute resources in an economy as complex as the one we live. And it's fine to limit that intelligence to make sure that everyone gets their 1 unit of food even if it's not as efficient. You just need to decide if you stop limiting there, go farther so everyone gets one unit of copper too, go even further, go not as far, whatever.

When we reach post-scarcity, your model is fine. Everyone gets as much as they want, it's infinity of every unit. Until then, we need a distributive model of some sort, and I don't think the government is capable of distributing effectively in the modern economy as nice as that would be.

No, I mean hard to house. Not hard to employ as in they're missing an arm, hard to house as in they're hard drug users or mentally unstable and will literally destroy any home given. If they're missing an arm, I think it's a good idea to give welfare so they're not on the street. Mental disability that won't make them actual damage the home can be given similar help. Not all people who could fairly easily receive homes do, but that's a problem with the US, not liberalism. Denmark is doing much better in that regard.

Drug users and others who would destroy homes should still be helped too, but if we can house 2 people missing an arm for the cost of one drug user, we prioritize people missing an arm. If we determine if the order of cost effectiveness is: housing people missing an arm, giving total universal health care, housing drug users, then there may not be resources left over for drug users in the current scenario we live in.

You rant about the filthy elite who steal money from the poor, I rant about the filthy NIMBYs who don't allow effective regulation of markets at the expense of the poor.

Working conditions in McDonald's are not good. It is delusional to think they wouldn't be immensely worse if there were fewer companies providing minimum wage jobs.

McDonald's can still hire other employees. There are diminishing returns. First employee earns them $50, next earns them $40, next earns $30, keep going until it's no longer profitable. And your solution to McDonald's, which can provide jobs people do want and can sell products do want, not being able to meet minimum wage is to just shut it down? That just sounds like an intrinsically bad idea. Sometimes minimum wage can be good, forcing McDonald's not to take too much advantage of workers and e.g only hire them for $5 instead of $7 that they just as well could. Other times if forces them to pay $9 they can't afford and not hire someone for $7 who wants the job. It's a tricky balance to manage that takes professional economists.

I am giving a lot of credit to that. I'm not sure we can prove whether the iPhone could invented as well under a less liberal economy. But that's not all I'm giving credit to it for. Going back to the talk about distributing resources, even if one rich guy ends of with 2 golds where as in a perfect economy distributed by a strong AI he'd only get 1, it'd still be better than trying getting the government to distribute all resources equally. That's the crux of why I think liberalism is good and socialism would not work: the government is not able effectively take into account weighted preferences and changing preferences to efficiently distribute resources, unlike the super intelligence that is liberalism. A question I want an answer to: until we reach post-scarcity, do you agree at least some industries should be governed by liberalism? For example the video game industry. If the government managed it, they'd have a hard time allocating their resources to different genres and styles that rise and fall in popularity, and would have a very hard time justifying using the taxes of someone who doesn't care at all for video games to pay for the wide variety of genres from first person shooters to visual novels to grand strategy. I just skimmed the link about The Culture so sorry if it's explained there.

Alright, let's talk about liberalism. And since we're changing words, allow me to swap "socialism" for "anarchy." I consider them inseparable and mean both when I say one. You have a persistent wrong notion that socialism implies a (strong) state. It has been demonstrated that a state is not the path to (socialism/anarchy). Anarchy opposes all hierarchy, and a state is a pretty massive expression of hierarchy.

  Gold is good at holding value. It doesn't corrode easily, so it doesn't naturally depreciate like how copper fairly easily rusts. It's pretty rare, it's relatively unlikely a massive new mine or a trade agreement with Chile will change it's value much. It's been traditionally something that holds value and that momentum helps it along.
#+end_quote

Value is a spook, a made-up thing that we all agree to pretend is real. Gold holds value because people want it because gold holds value because people want it because... It's a closed loop, with minor outflows for electronic or catalytic or whatever use. Part of what anarchy aims to do is collapse pointless loops like that. But I didn't mention the space rock part for nothing. There are individual rocks out there with more precious metals than we've mined in all of history.

#+begin_quote
  Weighted preference seems like a fair model. The guy who loves gold gets more gold than everyone else, but fewer other resources. The guy who thinks gold and copper are equal gets extra copper. Liberalism is a super-intelligence at distributing these resources in weighted preferences.
#+end_quote

Sure, weighted preferences seems like a fair model to distribute luxuries. But there're two problems here, and either is fatal alone.

First, capitalism in practice fails to resemble in any way this ideal system of yours. The actual outcome of your hypothetical is that of your hundred people, one person's big toe owns almost all the gold, sapphires, diamonds, copper, and food. The problem with creating superintelligences, as has been stated around here too many times to count, is that you have to be really really sure their optimization criteria match your own, or they'll eat your planet to make paperclips. Liberalism is paperclipping the planet to make shareholder value this quarter.

Second, liberals haven't just unleashed their rogue superintelligence on luxuries, but on necessities. In doing so, it treats human people as resources, fundamentally demeaning and endangering them.

#+begin_quote
  Isn't this a learning conversation? Let me know what you think is wrongfully illegal. I'm guessing marijuana usage is something we both agree on, but I'm not sure what else is blatantly wrong. Maybe illegal immigration being illegal, open borders would be nice, but that'll have to be worked towards, it'd be chaos if they were completely opened immeadiately.
#+end_quote

So, first, fuck the law and all cops are bastards. But for the moment, assuming a transitory period of socdems with laws and shit before we establish complete anarchy, here's a (non-exhaustive, emphatically not ordered) list of things which are wrongfully illegal in the US:

-Use and possession of any drug

-Distribution of any drug with the possible exception of opiates

-Infringing on a copyright

-Infringing on a patent

-Jaywalking

-Marrying multiple adults at once

-Punching nazis

-Occupying empty buildings

-Public nudity

-Taking things from dumpsters

-Owning various specific types of firearms

-Living here while having been born on the wrong patch of dirt without winning a literal lottery

-Giving away food and supplies to unhoused people

-Protesting in unapproved areas

-Ever voting after having been convicted of a felony (in many states)

-Reverse engineering DRM software or hardware

-Exporting space rocket technology

-Storming the bastilles to free the modern-day slaves captured under the aforementioned laws.

  No, I mean hard to house. Not hard to employ as in they're missing an arm, hard to house as in they're hard drug users or mentally unstable and will literally destroy any home given. If they're missing an arm, I think it's a good idea to give welfare so they're not on the street. Mental disability that won't make them actual damage the home can be given similar help. Not all people who could fairly easily receive homes do, but that's a problem with the US, not liberalism. Denmark is doing much better in that regard.
#+end_quote

Basically, I don't believe you about literal destruction. Maybe they'll destroy the property value or, heaven forbid, make it dirty, but I kinda doubt they'll tear their own roofs down on themselves. Unhoused people don't destroy the stuff they have, they protect it. The narrative that the poorest among us bring their own suffering is leftover Calvinist trash-memes.

#+begin_quote
  They will. NIMBYism is a big problem. You rant about the filthy elite who steal money from the poor, I rant about the filthy NIMBYs who don't allow effective regulation of markets at the expense of the poor. I think it's easier and more effective to try to fix NIMBYism than to try to nationalize every unused home and try to hand them out. Maybe nationalizing houses is good policy in some areas, I think it's rare one policy fits all, but it'd probably be a policy best taken at the by specific municipalities and shouldn't be generalized to too many different municipalities.
#+end_quote

I'll have you know I rant about filthy NIMBYs too. The problem here isn't just NIMBYs, though, it's that liberalism actively makes it in homeowners' best interests personally to be NIMBYs. It rewards them by increasing their "property value" score, and that makes them feel good, and that interaction is one tiny fractal piece of the rogue superintelligence. Not only that, it also punishes them by reducing their score for not being sufficiently NIMBY.

#+begin_quote
  I think we agree on this. I'm fine for people getting free food. Food stamps do exist. It can probably be expanded or made more effective. And that'll be a good thing, going back a few points, if people don't have to work to not-starve, that'll give them more negotiating power and I think workers having more negotiating power is generally a good thing.
#+end_quote

Good. Now, are you ready to generalize the lesson? If people have everything they need, they will approach a somewhat equitable negotiating position, and having done so, will have no need to sell their hours and become employees, but can instead work together on what they wish.

#+begin_quote
  Working conditions in McDonald's are not good. It is delusional to think they wouldn't be immensely worse if there were fewer companies providing minimum wage jobs. There are a lot of people who wants minimum wage jobs so it gives companies a lot of negotiating power, so conditions are bad, but conditions would only be worse if there were fewer businesses offering minimum wage jobs.
#+end_quote

Nobody wants a minimum wage job. Currently, many people need minimum wage jobs to survive. The fact that several allied billionaires instead of just one run fast food makes no material difference.

#+begin_quote
  I agree. Unions are good. Denmark has great unions.
#+end_quote

Unions are good, but the rogue superintelligence hates them because they can harm its shareholder value this quarter. It thus incentivizes the human actors who (are/serve) it to fight them.

#+begin_quote
  McDonald's can still hire other employees. There are diminishing returns. First employee earns them $50, next earns them $40, next earns $30, keep going until it's no longer profitable. And your solution to McDonald's, which can provide jobs people do want and can sell products do want, not being able to meet minimum wage is to just shut it down? That just sounds like an intrinsically bad idea. Sometimes minimum wage can be good, forcing McDonald's not to take too much advantage of workers and e.g only hire them for $5 instead of $7 that they just as well could. Other times if forces them to pay $9 they can't afford and not hire someone for $7 who wants the job. It's a tricky balance to manage that takes professional economists.
#+end_quote

You can't earn something for someone else, silly. "Earn" means your own achievement.

#+begin_quote
  I am giving a lot of credit to that. I'm not sure we can prove whether the iPhone could invented as well under a less liberal economy. But that's not all I'm giving credit to it for. Going back to the talk about distributing resources, even if one rich guy ends of with 2 golds where as in a perfect economy distributed by a strong AI he'd only get 1, it'd still be better than trying getting the government to distribute all resources equally. That's the crux of why I think liberalism is good and socialism would not work: the government is not able effectively take into account weighted preferences and changing preferences to efficiently distribute resources, unlike the super intelligence that is liberalism.
#+end_quote

What's happening isn't the rich guy ending up with 2 gold, it's the rich guy ending up with /all/ the gold and making the government a tool to keep it that way.

#+begin_quote
  A question I want an answer to: until we reach post-scarcity, do you agree at least some industries should be governed by liberalism? For example the video game industry. If the government managed it, they'd have a hard time allocating their resources to different genres and styles that rise and fall in popularity, and would have a very hard time justifying using the taxes of someone who doesn't care at all for video games to pay for the wide variety of genres from first person shooters to visual novels to grand strategy. I just skimmed the link about The Culture so sorry if it's explained there.
#+end_quote

I don't see any compelling reason to govern video games as an industry. If the tools are open, and the people have time to use them, they'll build plenty of neat games. Please, please do read that link about the Culture, it's just an essay, you've probably read more of my words than its total length at this point.

Sure. I just have an exceedingly hard time picturing how you're going to reach anarchy. You say that you want workers around the world to unite like communists always wanted, but I do not see any practical way of that happening. It's even more unlikely than a single country reforming/revolutioning to anarchy. If you could draw me a clearer path of how we go from here to your world in a best-case reform scenario(that you could envision actually happening, like more than approximately 1 in 10^{14(about} the odds of winning a major lottery twice in a row). The odds of course are approximate, but no stuff like having all American citizens just decide to become anarchists and let the state disintegrate on its own) and worst-case revolution scenario(that does work), that'd be great.

#+end_quote

Good list. A lot of those things shouldn't be illegal, I agree, although some of them should be. If I don't respond to it, I agree it shouldn't be legal, and reform would be good, but also think any sort of violent reform would be a terrible idea.

Copyrights and patents exist for a reason. They ensure businesses can earn money for their works, motivating them to create works. Copyright law does go on for too long, but copyrights should exist for longer than a year and less than what it is now. I think patents are actually good as they are, twenty years isn't too bad. It's terrible that a company can charge $1000 for a medicine that takes $2 to manufacture, but better than never inventing that medicine at all. I'm not even sure a Denmark-esque model where companies aren't allowed to do that would be good, since right now non-US countries essentially have their healthcare subsidized by the fact that it's the US paying the costs for research, not them.

Punching Nazis should be illegal. I'm not even sure what you define as a Nazi- does someone who advocate for totalitarian Mussolini-esque rule but not racism count? Does someone who wants to bring back black slavery but hates Hitler and nazism count? Why not just make being a Nazi illegal, have them sentenced to some sort of punishment, and let formal courts deal with them? We don't solve any other behaviour we don't like by letting others punch people, why is Nazism an exception? If you punch someone, do you have to go to court and prove they're a Nazi to not get arrested for assault?

#+begin_quote
  Owning various specific types of firearms
#+end_quote

We need to draw a line somewhere. I think we can agree owning a 50mm working artillery piece should be illegal, given how easy it would be to cause mass devastation with it and it'd have no purpose besides causing mass devastation. We can agree owning an hunting rifle, whether for use at a gun range or for actually hunting, should be legal. Where do you draw the line in between there on what weapons should be legal and which should be illegal? Gun control has always been one of the issues I've been most conflicted on, so I'm really not sure where to draw the line.

#+begin_quote
  -Reverse engineering DRM software or hardware
#+end_quote

This is basically the same issue as the copyright/patent issue I think.

#+end_quote

  -Storming the bastilles to free the modern-day slaves captured under the aforementioned laws.
#+end_quote

This should definitely be illegal. If we make storming prisons for just the laws you mentioned legal, might as well make those laws no longer exist. If we make storming prisons in general legal, then nothing to stop the family of a terrorist from storming the prison to free the terrorist.

This is just something we have to overcome, not by getting rid of liberalism, but by being better people. It was in white people's best interest to keep slavery. It was stopped because people were moral. Granted it was only stopped when it was no longer as much of a money maker as it used to be, but we can still make progress against NIMBYism.

I think we agree on this. I support an universal basic income that can give people everything they need, or at least as high as we can make it without running out of money.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

We'll put in an universal basic income or otherwise expand welfare so people don't need to work.

But you seem to be missing the economics point I'm making about supply and demand. If there is 1 job and 100 people want it, the employer can pay dirt. If there's 1 job and 2 people want it, then the employer's going to have to pay more or the potential employees will walk away knowing they're valuable.

If they're 5 different employers, and one of them pays $1/hour and the others pay $2/hour, if there isn't surplus employees, no one will go to the $1/hour employer, and if there is surplus, the $1/hour employer will still only be able to hire the least capable. So the employer would be motivated to raise to $2/hour. Unless the job would only earn the employer $1.50 an hour, in which case the job would just disappear, and that's not good. Maybe the 5 different employers conspire together to only pay $1/hour. That's illegal and they'd go to jail.

But my point is, competition is good. The reason Comcast is so bad is that they don't have much competition.

The search term you want is ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulation). The problem with it is that basically any really interesting technology can be a weapon.

And Niven's Kzinti Lesson: "a reaction drive's efficiency as a weapon is in direct proportion to its efficiency as a drive." (from the excellent short story [[https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781451639001/9781451639001___4.htm]["The Warriors"]]) ITAR is an export ban on many of the technologies necessary to build a positive future.

Individual people that have patents essentially count as a business for the purpose of this discussion. I don't see a meaningful way, when discussing patents in the manner we are, how Disney the company holding a patent and Walt Disney the person holding a patent are different. And if Disney isn't allowed to hold a copyright, they won't make as much money to make movies like Frozen, so they won't make as many movies like Frozen. That's bad. If Disney makes some amazing movie, some random person shouldn't be able to make a cheap Frozen toy and make money off of Disney's work and investment. The copyright shouldn't last forever, but at least ten years would be good. How do you want medical research to proceed without patents? Does the government take up research? Do the people vote on which drugs they'll try to advance, do we elect someone who's head of research, does Congress vote on which drugs receive funding?

  Nope. Don't agree. I don't approve of any weapon-based gun control, only person-based gun control.

Not letting civilians have access to artillery or large caliber automatic weapons seems like an obvious choice to me. I don't suppose you have sources or examples of your policy working?

Even in states that have legalized marijuana, they have not implemented retroactive immunity, immediate release, and reparations for previous marijuana-related crimes. I specified this one because this trend would/will likely extend to the hopeful repealing of the rest of these bad laws.

The are just so many problems with legalized prison breaks. There are good laws. Murderers should stay in prison for at least some time, I hope you can agree.

  If I've got a neoliberal saying that requiring work to live is a problem to be solved rather than The Market Working, I'll call it good. My only quibble is that it's not actually money we need to worry about running out of, but stuff like food and houses. Money is just a token. When the market "loses" or "gains" x million or billion dollars, nothing is actually destroyed or created. All the actual stuff is right where it was before.

People are not going to organize under anarchy and make AAA games. Lots of people have lots of free time even today. None of them join together to craft an AAA game. The video game industry is probably among the easiest for people to join together and make something AAA level too, under any other industry AAA equivalents would have an even harder time getting made. And even if you're willing to give up AAA products, lots of people aren't.

#+end_quote

This is a major problem with liberalism, failing to distinguish between actual people and the paperclip maximizers we call companies. A person with a patent wants it to be actualized. A company with a patent wants to increase shareholder value this quarter, and only cares about making the thing described in the patent if doing so serves that ultimate goal.

Disney didn't make Frozen. A bunch of people made Frozen. Their names are listed at the end. They did it organized hierarchically as a corporation because that's how liberalism works. But have you ever heard of an artist who got into art for the big paychecks?

The fundamental function of copyright and patent is to ensure artists and inventors are fed and supplied, materially free to make more art and inventions. But that function can/must be subsumed into the general function of ensuring all people are fed and supplied, materially free to do what they want to.

Not in an American prison, no. Not even murderers deserve that. But the thing is that murderers make up a vanishingly small minority of the prison population.

This is what you want to focus on? Liberalism kills people every day, and you want to focus on AAA games? I've been being flip about them because they're so utterly secondary.

But let's talk about what I hope is the underlying question here: how are large projects generally to be accomplished without hierarchy?

Let's consider something more impactful. Take NASA and SpaceX. NASA is a bunch of engineers and physicists, with political appointee bosses and congressionally defined goals. SpaceX is a bunch of engineers with a rich workaholic boss and his one goal.

Now SpaceX is actually a fascinating case to consider when talking about organization under liberalism. As much of a proponent and beneficiary of capital as Musk is, he's very carefully keeping SpaceX privately held. This is because he knows The Market doesn't actually care about his goal, and would demand SpaceX deliver profits above all.

But that's an aside. More to the point, what do you think all those engineers and scientists would do if you told them they don't have to work for a living anymore? Would they stop engineering and experimenting? Of course not. Would they scatter to the four winds? Why should they?

No hierarchy doesn't mean no organization.

*********************** I was thinking a bit more on this and decided I really needed to see your best-case, worst-case scenarios to understand your position but I didn't provide you one. We are talking past each other a bit.

Best case scenario: I've separated this into a couple different areas to be a bit more organized.

Branch 1, international economic reform: Reforms to increase immigration. Reforms to increase free trade. More countries sharing a single currency. Movements to create European Union style unions in more continents. Those unions joining together into a single global government with no trade barriers or immigration barriers.

Branch 2, renewable power: Continue to build solar panels in areas where they're effective. Build fission nuclear reactors where solar panels are not effective. Massive investment(like hundreds of billions of dollars) into nuclear fusion research.

Branch 3, Nuclear bombs: Dismantle lots of nuclear bombs. Keep enough for MAD, like each major power can keep 10 big bombs, but that's it. No need to have any risk of ending all human life.

Other stuff: Switch to proportional voting like what Germany has. Reform drug laws and housing laws. Set up an universal basic income. Set corporate tax to 0% over a period of 15 years to make sure it has the predicted effects, raise income tax on high brackets, capital gains tax, and estate taxes to compensate.

This is all accomplished by the general population smartening up and realizing those are good ideas. Not particularly likely, but not unimaginable and this is a best case scenario. They then consistently elect Hillary Clinton style politicians and rely on professional advisors within the current system.

Those are all the big things I think.

Worse case scenario is that the general population goes even further away from those ideas but not catastrophically so, and rapidly increasing technology gives us a post-scarcity utopia anyways.

************************ Alright, so I see five basic categories of future to consider:

1: Global thermonuclear war wipes out humans or reduces us to the ancestral condition: no farming or writing. Bad future, 0/10

2: Fascists take and consolidate power, liberals help them as usual out of fear that socialists will take their +toothbrushes+ factories just like liberals did last time fascists took and consolidated power. Bad future, 1/10

3: Liberals don't cooperate with fascists for once, and gradually more socialist policies (policies which increase the freedom of choice for everyone) are enacted over the protests of business owners. Variations on liberalism form the right wing of politics, and variations on social-democracy the left, and even though automation kills unions, people are educated and materially secure enough not to vote against their class interests. Over the same period of time, megastructures to democratize access to space (Lofstrom loops, rotovators, and eventually orbital rings) are built and we can all escape the well and its hierarchies. Good but implausibly gentle and smooth future, 10/10

4: Revolution. Like future #2, but the fascists don't win completely. They're eventually overthrown and replaced with a succession of various shitty governments, from emperors to state-capitalists to liberals, and billions die even faster than they do now. Maybe eventually, sane societies come out the other side and take another shot at future #3. Only temporarily bad future, 2/10

5: Strong AI or other black swan, weird future, ?/10

The alienation of late stage capitalism isn't causing a backlash, Brexit and Trump and Duterte are just a couple missteps in an otherwise improving world. Trump says a lot of really nasty things and done a few bad things, but hasn't actually done much that'll shake up the country long term. Brexit and Duterte are pretty small in the grand scheme of things. Generally the world is getting better on reducing extreme poverty, increasing literacy, that stuff. If you want me to bring some official stats in I will.

International rallying has been the socialist's cry, but it hasn't actually worked very well.

Regarding the inaccuracies when comparing meta-entities like corporations with AIs, I'd like to clarify that what I was saying wasn't that corporations should be classified as a subtype of an artificial intelligence. I was saying that corporations are doing what an emerging AI is partially so feared for: reshaping the world according to their primary goals with little regard for the individuals enhabiting it --- even if they do it much slowly than an AI would (or because of it, since the slower pacing of the changes creates a boiling frog effect regarding the possible resistense against them).

And since they are having the same effect on the world, they should be treated with similar caution. And when talking about restrictions for them they should be regarded as entities that have no moral \ ethical judgement of thier own, as an AI would. This in contrast, for instance, to expecting them to “stand up for human rights on their own” (e.g. common expectation towards Google, Netflix, Amazon, etc), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility][have a sense of social responsibility on their own,]] etc.

And people generally have more complicated motivations than stock prices, so that /potential/ for morality makes it less risky than a paperclip maximizer AI.

And it doesn't even have to be morality - there are other ways people can make decisions that get in the way of corporate paperclipping - embezzling funds, leaking privileged information to the press, just being lazy...

** I've been thinking about the organization of fanfiction recently. I don't have any big takeaways here, but I think it's fairly interesting.

I feel like fanfiction can roughly be broken down into two categories: plot and romance. Plot fanfics are fanfics that, while they might have romances, the focus of the story is on things happening. Almost all non-fanfiction literature is the equivalent of this category. Romance fanfics are fanfics that are only based on romance and there might not be plot at all. While not technically romance, one shots based on cute character interactions, etc. are also in this category. Trashy romance novels are the non-fanfiction version of this category.

Also, it's fairly obvious that some types of fiction are much better for /plot/ fanfiction than others. I propose that this can be determined by what I call the "self-insert test." If you were to insert yourself as one of the main characters in the fiction, how much can you influence what happens while still playing your part? In something like Harry Potter or Naruto, there's a ton. In something like Sherlock Holmes or The Martian, there's hardly anything.

I'd also like to propose that how rational a work of fiction is correlated with the self-insert test.

*** Like, you /could/ break fanfiction into the categories of "romance" and "not romance", but I don't think it's a particularly useful distinction, because either "not-romance" completely excludes a lot of plot-heavy stuff because it has the barest trace of romance, or you get into the paradox-of-the-heap thing where you have to define "how much romance is romance." And as [[/u/jeray2000]] said, you get into the weird situation where some erotica fits into that not-romance category because you can have porn without any semblance of actual romance.

Really, the "tagging" approach to genres is probably the best: almost every work fits into multiple, non-exclusive genres, but to different degrees. Harry potter is heavily fantasy, lightly romance, moderately adventure, and moderately high-school. Twilight is heavily romance, lightly adventure, moderately fantasy, and lightly high-school.

Also, while your hypothesis in your third paragraph is somewhat correct (some fandoms naturally lead towards romance fics, some naturally lead towards action-y fics), you're misinterpreting the causes. If find the greatest predictor of whether a fandom is romance-dominated is the proportion of young girls in that fandom, while the greatest predictor of whether a fandom is action-dominated is the proportion of older men (older still only being "in their twenties") in the fandom. Worm and MLP:FiM predominantly have older males as their fandoms, and as a result are inundated with action-heavy fics. Harry Potter and Naruto are more mixed, and reflect that by having plenty of both romance and actiony fics. One Direction, being almost exclusively female, has overwhelmingly romance fics.

The "self-insert test", as you call it, doesn't directly predict that prevalence of actiony fics. Rather, it's part of an equation that predicts how many total fics there are in a fandom. Namely, (potential audience for fandom)/(proportion of potential audience that writes fanfiction)/(percent of potential audience a work of this quality is likely to get the attention of)/(average works per fanfic-writer)/(percent suitability for writing the kinds of fanfics the potential fanfiction-writing audience ) = total # of fics. So for works written towards males, who typically want power fantasies, a high score on the "self-insert test" means that those males are more likely to write fanfiction for that work instead of another work, which in turn results in more action-y fanfics. Meanwhile, even if your work is better suited for action fics than romance fics, if your potential audience is primarily of the kind that wants to write romance fics, you're still going to overwhelmingly get romance fics, because the people who want to write action-y fics will move to a fandom where more people want to /read/ action-y fics.

I think in general fiction can usually be split into these categories. Where a story is based on either exploration of a world through actions and reactions (Plot focused), or it's based on the interactions between characters with the plot around the characters mostly being used as a means to explore those relationships.

The best stories (IMO) manage to form a middle ground between the two, where the characters appear to have real agency within their world and the actions that they do take reveal more nuances about the characters themselves and their relationships to others.

Maximize power, so that when you have a better idea of what the future will look like, you're poised to respond to it.

More specifically, maximize money (which is directly fungible with power), and minimize financial liabilities.

I know that doesn't sound particularly actionable-- after all, I'd wager that most of us are already doing our best to be as financially independent as possible, to get good jobs, to make good investments, and so on and so forth, but it's the only real catch-all advice there is for preparing for an uncertain future, and even it has its problems (as it doesn't cover how much of your current happiness you should sacrifice to ensure the greatest probability of future happiness.)

I could talk about how I make my own predictions, but as my methods are pretty untested, and unlikely to be generalizable, it's probably best that I don't.
