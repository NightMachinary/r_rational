** I wonder if the Efreet, once they have Volo Ingenium, will themselves contractually inherit the ability to make their own Wishes.

#+begin_quote
  “Consider quickly, our patience is not infinite. In the meantime, a word of warning, consideration for consideration- something truly wicked is coming, from over the eastern sea. You'd best be prepared, lest your best laid plans become a study in scarlet.”
#+end_quote

The Efreet are aware that the Concept has acquired Holmes. The Wish engine is out of service. And now Sauron has entered the game, bringing his own handforged memetic hazard to boot.

Sean, if you're out there, Haley needs your help, now more than ever. The Concept is about to make its move.

Unless it just did?

Do you take requests for which pop culture stories get fed to the smoothie maker? If so, I appreciate you doing The Dark Tower before LOTR or Game of Thrones, but maybe some Princess Bride action :) ?

*** You know I've never actually read The Princess Bride? Given the nature of this whole story that seems like a gross oversight, I think I'll put that on the read list.

** Oh man now I can't stop picturing Sean in the future being the old wizard running the magic shop-- always in the background, but also obscenely powerful so that the main characters can't just loot the place.

At first I was a little leery about fanfiction being a considered a valid part of each story-verse since that opens up all sorts of different interpretations about how characters will behave in this story, but then I realized that this is basically what's been happening the whole time. Dunno why, but it feels weird to me to have a back door in to other stories through non-canon material. Does this mean that Sean can convince, say Hermione, to write a fanfiction about Star Wars so Sean can learn Force powers? They have Star Wars in Harry Potter, right?

*** Getting someone to write a Worm fanfic where some rando gets Alexandria's vial and then promptly flies off into the sunset, never to be seen again, would also be pretty easy.

*** Yes, but force powers take a lot more training. Why not Bioshock? It has its own multiverse, and powers are easy to the point of vending machine access. And it /definitely/ has star wars.

***** Hm. Fair enough. I had thought that ADAM was not inherently dangerous, but reading more on the wiki, it's definitely not a good long-term route to power if you care about your body and mind. It is reversible, but takes the powers with it. Not a good choice.

** Does the One Ring canonically exert mental influence over anyone who knows it's there? I thought it only hypnotized those who put it on. I'm not a LOTR buff, but it seems to me like the Council of Elrond would have gone a lot differently if everyone at the table was jonesing for it.

**** Again, I don't know much about LOTR, but that reads to me more like Boromir knows how powerful it is and wants to use it for himself, rather than it having any kind of supernatural influence on him. If it were exerting this kind of pull on everyone there--the kind of pull that can make someone with /40+ in all stats/ fail her WIS save without even seeing it--the Council would have turned into a bloodbath.

***** I think it exerts greater pull on those who it can use to accomplish its goals. The more powerful the target, the greater the pull.

Added to this, Haley is a /dragon./ As she notes in the chapter, Pathfinder's ideas of draconic behavior necessarily take a back seat to Tolkien when it comes to the narrative structure and origins of modern dragon lore.

**** It was a homebrew RPG I played back in college where your character could "pull" in stories almost exactly like the kid and Superman. What you're doing and how 6/7 worked were very different, but it's really (positively) reminding me of all that.

Also I wrote a thing inspired by Chapter 29, and put it in that thread :D
