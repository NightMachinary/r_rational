Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** After the US Presidential election I resolved to escape the bubble I was in and try to see the viewpoint of the other side without bias, only to find several popular opinions expressed among them horrifying either for their blatant prejudice or willful ignorance. The only thing more horrifying was the responses to such statements from their peers ranged from support to apathy with very little dissent. So now I'm tempted to retreat back into my bubble even though I know that would be irrational and unproductive.

*** The problem with escaping the bubble is that 99% of the time you just end up looking in on a different bubble, where they talk about your original bubble like it's a fucking hellscape populated by demons. I think the best you can do is try to look at those other bubbles and ignore them when they talk about /other/ bubbles - you only pay attention to internal bubble views, not external bubble views. But a whole lot of bubbles are entirely outward-facing, so sometimes that's all there is to understand.

My personal solution is to cast myself as the skeptic and devil's advocate in whatever bubble I find myself in, which helps to eliminate some of the bad effects of the bubble, but is also exhausting and so not actually that great a solution.

*** I think you've made the common mistake we all make of attributing the opinions of the few to the opinions of the many.

For example, and with regard to our recent election, a lot of people from the democratic hugbox are claiming that, with Trump's victory, we've some legitimized a bunch of -isms, and some are even going so insanely far as to phrase as it as though a huge chunk of the country have peeled off face masks, put on their Grand Wizard costume, and spontaneously gathered in the town square with pitchfork, torch, and "burn the niggers, jews, and fags" signs, like some sort of twisted hate-musical number.

Obviously, this hasn't happened. Hell, many people are rioting and protesting in states that voted very far left, which makes it hard for those individuals to claim to be on the moral high ground.

But, if you stop and actually think, you'll realize that most people aren't "burn that thar nigger fag, pa". They don't wake up and say "God damnit, I hate people whose skin color is different from mine". Instead, they have a way of life they've grown used to, and tend to be wary of anything that represents a change to it.

This is normal. This is evolutionarily beneficial, since in the ancestral environment a change to one's way of life could very well represent death for the individual or the tribe.

This is why you get so many anecdotes from non-WASPs who hear something like "Those damn negros burned down some stores in [City]. They just aren't like you, (black) Mike. No offense, man." The known quantity, black Mike, is safe and familiar. The unknown quantity, the black Mike over in (city) who is part of a protest/riot, is an unknown quantity, and is quickly demonized for being different, other, and apparently dangerous.

The solution to this should seem obvious, but to many people it isn't. The way to fix Jethro's wariness and dismissal or black Mike in (city) is education, not name calling, dismissal, and demonization.

Yet, that's what we get. The country has become so partisan that, rather then reach out to people who wanted to vote for (candidate you don't support), we instead demonized and insulted them.

So, you may go online, and see some idiot has posted "Now that Trump is president, we can purge the gays!".

That person is both wrong, and an asshole. Firstly, we elected Trump President, not God Emperor for Life. Secondly, I woud wager that not that many people voted for Trump on a platform of -isms and -phobias. I would wager that many people voted for him DESPITE an apparent platform of -isms and -phobias, because the other option was Clinton, a politican who exemplifies the current status quo. A status quo that most were strongly dissatisfied with.

A Trump presidency is a stick in the eye of the current established powers. It's something new. A terrifying new, with a madman at the reigns, but it's definitely shaken up the existing power structure.

What we need now isn't demonization and partisanship. What we need now is to come together as a nation, and keep Trump the fuck in check with the checks and balances that our government is set up to have. We've stuck the stick into the powers-that-be's eye. Now we need to keep the body upright as we fix the brain and excise the cancers.

**** Just as it's too early to say that Trump is going to execute all the gays (or whatever), it's also too early to say that Trump has shaken up the existing power structure. I said months before the election that Trump would select cronies and standard-issue Republicans, and that they would probably be the ones running things. I stand by that prediction, especially having seen Trump's opening moves (like appointing the head of the RNC as his chief of staff and Mike Pence as vice president).

And if that's the case, then I don't think now is the time for coming together as a nation, because we'd be coming together behind policies that liberals have been against for decades, which, as mostly a liberal, I'm not going to do. And those same Republican policies are not at all amenable to checks and balances, not when Republicans control the Senate, the House, the executive, and soon the Supreme Court.

***** We don't need to come together behind Trump, I don't think. I personally think Trump is a loon, a monkey in the reactor room.

I think we need to come together as a nation and a people, and continue to shake the tree of government until we shake as much curroption out as we can.

Most people are not, inherently, good or bad people. Most people simply want to live a comfortable life, and with a informed self-interest want their neighbors to live a comfortable life, because they understand that a fire in your neighbor's house can very quickly become a fire in your house.

Trump is likely going to do some stupid shit. We, as a nation, need to stand together and prevent it. He wants a wall? We vote no wall. He wants creationism taught in public schools? We vote no creationism. He wants to disband the EPA? We vote go take a long walk off a short pier into shark infested waters no.

The politician class will always be composed mostly of the worst of us. The system is set up in such a way as that to seize power, one benefits much more from heartless, sociopathic actions then one does from kind, altruistic actions. As such, the system naturally selects the worst among us to rise to the highest positions. We, as the people these government officials are supposed to serve, are not limited by that. We can, and should, push for understanding, education, and altruism. If not for every man on Earth, then at least for our fellow man on this continent.

I have to say, I am a bit disappointed to see tribalism in your refutation. You're not saying "Trump will appoint cronies who share his lunacy and sociopathic desire for power", you're saying "I, as a blue left tribe member, refuse to listen to anything that a red right tribe government says". There is no reason to do so. Democrat, Republican, Liberal, Conservative, whatever your damned color, you're at heart still human. People are global warming deniers not because they are somehow beneath us in intelligence, but because of faulty education. People are not anti-gay, racist, misogynist, misandrist, or any other -ism or -phobia because of some inherent factor that makes them irredeemably evil; they simply have a faulty education and a disinclination to question and empathize.

The solution is not divisive "us vs them" tribal mindsets, but "us together" education and empathy.

How are we going to come together and vote against a wall when half the nation very enthusiastically wants a wall? Moreover, how are we going to do that immediately following an election? I've been arguing against a wall since the Secure Fence Act on the basis that it's an expensive solution that doesn't fix the problem, I've voted against a wall to the extent that I was able to, I've written letters to my congresscritters about the wall, I've supported congresscritters who were against a wall ... and here we are, with a President whose rallying cry was "Build that wall!", so I don't know what else was expected of me, given that this ridiculous security theater has been going on for something like ten years now.

I am not saying that at all. I am saying that I /have already listened to the people Trump is going to select/. I already know Chris Christie's policy positions. I know Giuliani's. I've read speeches, I've watched debates, and then I rejected them on the grounds that most of what they say is simply not good policy - not policy that I feel is grounded in reality, or policy which is grounded in reality but which I feel prioritizes the wrong things. I'm perfectly willing to listen to the red tribe, but what I hear from the red tribe is a bunch of stuff that I disagree with ... which is why I'm in the blue tribe in the first place (which has its own stupid ideas I spend half my time arguing against).

******* The people I spoke to didn't care much about the wall, most of them agreed that Trump had said absurd things they didn't support. They either voted for him anyway for similar justifications liberals had for Clinton in spite of her controversies, or they dismissed his rhetoric as grandstanding without concern for how it would effect his policy.

That wasn't all that reassuring to me and there are still some who adamantly support extreme positions who aren't being reined in by their peers, but there are plenty of moderates. I still disagree with many of the moderates about things I consider very important to agree on in order for our political system to do good, but they aren't all in agreement either.

- Trump is going to build a wall, it's going to have Israeli anti-tunnel technology, it'll be 50 ft. high, etc.
- Trump isn't going to build an /actual/ wall, it's going to be a "virtual" wall using satellites, lidar, CCTV, etc.
- Trump isn't going to build a wall, he's just selling himself to people who don't know any better in order to get elected

I'm not even sure conservatives in congress have a coherent plan at this point since even they didn't expect to end up in this situation. All anyone in the right agrees right now is that they are okay with Trump being in office and don't express interest in denouncing other supporters they disagree with, possibly because they see liberals as monolithic.

This is either going to be the most easily malleable voter base in decades or the least and there's no way to tell. I have no idea whether they'll go along with anything Trump does, turn against him the moment he does something they don't like, or turn against each other when he does something that only some of them support. Western countries are all going through a massive populist movement right now and I don't know what will happen next.

He could put forth a law that demanded the execution of every animal in every zoo, and I would back it 100% because of how pissed off it would make the liberals".

Now, I don't give a fuck about animals, but that was one of the most legitimately evil comments I had ever read, simply because it proposes that /hurting people who disagree/ is more important than anything else. That hurting other people is, in fact, a terminal value which sits above all others.

I'm hesitant to repeat things like that, because I think pointing out the most horrible things just furthers the toxoplasma of rage, but it's one of the reasons that I decided that venturing out of my bubble wasn't worth it.

***** From the perspective of a gray who has been closely watching the red tribe bubble for a solid 8 years now, that line comes across as schadenfreude that expects to be taken as signalling/hyperbolic. There is a train of thought that exists in the red/gray tribe that believes that nothing short of "a taste of their own medicine" will remind the blue tribe of the folly, of, say, weaponizing federal bureaucracies as tools of political oppression, or using bucketfuls of lies to push counterproductive policies that serve no purpose beyond attacking and harassing the other side (i.e. the gun control movement). The blue tribe has shown very few scruples in regards to defecting while in power, so the red tribe is only shooting itself in the foot by, say, protecting the filibuster that blues were so recently willing to delete. And frankly, I see more reds cautioning their own tribe on the folly of /that/, than I saw blues arguing for civilized restraint when they thought they were in for 40 years of one party rule.

I see that line, and I can see how it comes off as evil in a vacuum. But the most legitimately evil comments /I've/ read /in the last three days/ were calls for the rape and murder of all Trump supporters /and their families/, because that's just the appropriate thing for Red Army fanatics to do to Nazis.

**** I want our community to avoid mind-killing politics, but I can't talk about this without revealing that I am a liberal who's been [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5c5utp/im_a_liberal_who_wants_to_try_and_bridge_the_gap/][talking to conservatives]]. Whatever you hear me say, please do not use it as an excuse to dehumanize your political opponents like I am tempted to.

A big one is that they have a much narrower definition of racism than I do that precludes the existence of institutional prejudice, even while believing in implicit bias. They not only dismiss accusations of bigotry against a person or group that has not committed hate crimes, but they are convinced that being accused of such is itself a form of prejudice against them.

I have spoken to people who politely explain to me their reasons, which they think are perfectly rational, for believing that white privilege does not exist in the US and reject my opposing viewpoint as either propaganda by demagogues or discrimination against them. I told them that I had been unfairly prejudiced against them and expressed interest in overcoming my biases, but they did not respond in kind.

That's just one of them. Others reject laws I see as protecting LGBT people or a woman's reproductive rights as infringing upon their freedom to practice their own religion. I spoke to people who knew I am bisexual that some businesses should be allowed to refuse service to me because of what I am, and thought that didn't count as discrimination. They said my demanding to be treated equally was discriminatory against them.

These are attitudes and beliefs that are considered acceptable in communities with opposing political views from mine, which in my communities are considered to be obviously immoral. I know that I should empathize with people who disagree with me and that will lead to the best possible outcome, but that's not what I feel like doing.

*** I'd recommend you just try again, harder. If your social circle is made mostly of people with the same political ideas as you, finding people with compelling opposite ideas is going to be hard.

I'm not sure what you tried, but I'd recommend you avoid dealing with groups that identify as supporters of whatever position you're trying to understand. They're likely to wear their beliefs as a mantle, and if it comes down to a choice between being objective and self-critical, or showing their loyalty to the group, they're more likely to do the latter.

I recommend looking for people in your extended social circle (colleagues, people who practice the same sports as you, etc); people who you're familiar with, but don't necessarily associate with you because of their similar tastes / outlook / social origins. Ideally, avoid public confrontations; actually, avoid confrontations as hard as you can: the closest a debate is to the "who is going to sound the most convincing?" format, the least you'll get out of it.

Tell your tribe to stop trying to disenfranchise me, and to please protect basic civil liberties, human rights, and the ecological soundness (ie: suitability for human habitation) of our land and water.

Those are my long-term, big-deal issues that go outside the normal flow of electoral or tribal bickering: can the world support the society I live in, am I in danger in the society I live in, am I a full and equal citizen of the society I live in.

[[http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2016/11/we-are-in-it-all-right-but-figuratively.html][Here's a guy from your tribe voicing most of my major concerns.]]

If you guys win an election, that's mostly fine. Things happen. I hated fucking Clinton, and voted for the Green Party. I only encouraged friends and family in swing states to vote Clinton to stop Trump, because I consider him, well, an out-and-out fascist. If he's not a fascist, he's cultivated a fascist constituency and enjoys bathing in their love so much that he's going to govern like a fascist. [[http://nypost.com/2016/11/11/kkk-celebrating-trumps-election-with-victory-parade/][He's got the KKK marching in the streets celebrating him.]] Do you get how that looks to a Jew? [[http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-04-08/does-ted-cruzs-new-york-values-comment-convey-anti-semitism][And yes, the "New York values" thing /did/ sound anti-Jewish.]] As well as just plain anti-New-York, which doesn't play well with me since I was kinda born there.

But my problem is: the party of your tribe consider themselves the /only/ legitimate political force, and at every opportunity has tilted the rules to ensure that we are stripped of representation.

Before you jump down my throat, consider the following:

- The 2010 redistricting gerrymandered a lot of seats in the House for Republicans.
- The result of the above was that in [[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/][2012]], the Democrats got more votes but the Republicans got more seats. We'll be coming back to this theme.
- The result of the above was that in [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/senate-democrats-got-20-million-more-votes-than-senate-republicans-which-means-basically-nothing/][2014, the Democrats got more votes but the Republicans got more seats.]] This was mostly due to the way small states and small-time elections work, as the analysis linked points out, but that's cold comfort for those of us who don't /really, deeply love/ political procedure.
- The Senate is structured to ensure small-state rural votes are overrepresented relative to large-state urban votes. Note that this means small-state urban votes, such as mine, are double-screwed: we don't have the House seats or Presidential electors of California, Texas, or New York, but we're not rural /enough/ to really get any force multiplier in the Senate.
- Even the name of our state is used as a kind of politician's slang for an unimportant, irrelevant state nobody should listen to.
- The upshot of the Electoral College system has, /twice in the last five elections/, been to hand the Presidency to the Republican who won a strict minority of the votes over the Democrat who won the plurality.
- Likewise, the "more votes, fewer seats" effect in Congress from 2014 has repeated itself in 2016, and will continue to do so until a Census and redistricting.
- [[http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/newt-gingrich-house-un-american-activities-committee/index.html][Gingrich may have /said/ his neo-McCarthyism]] will be directed only at Islamofascists, but that's very difficult to /believe/ when the /original/ McCarthyism was chiefly intended to force everyone in both the Republican and Democratic Parties rightward on penalty of being called a Communist.
- And [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination][let's mention]] how the Senate Republican majority said they would refuse to fill a seat on the Supreme Court, not because the nominee was really bad, but because it was a Democrat doing the nominating.
- [[http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/whats-the-opposite-of-court-packing/506081/][This was then coupled to the same Senate Republicans saying they would not allow a President Clinton to fill the Supreme Court seat /either./]]
- [[https://www.propublica.org/article/under-obama-more-appointments-go-unfilled][And various federal agencies]] and [[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/obama-courts-judicial-legacy-226741][courts]] now have numerous positions unfilled /because/ the Republican Party has been sandbagging those, even for stupid things like /public printer/ (yes, that's an actual office), until they can fill those seats themselves.

Most of these things, taken in isolation, would not be so alarming. But each of these things /is not the only one/, it's part of a larger pattern. What it all adds up to, in my eyes, that actually hurts, is this: your tribe's party is trying to convert the USA into a one-party state, and where we have more voters in the "blue tribe" or in "purple states", they simply dismantle majoritarian democracy and the normal functioning of bureaucracy so as to permanently entrench themselves.

It is very, very alarming to me that in order to win elections, the Democrats need landslides, but where Republicans get /even slight/ numerical edges, they end up utterly dominant in actual seats held. It is very, very alarming that when Republicans win elections, they quickly work to staff bureaucracies and courts with their own people, while when Democrats win elections (again, /with more of a numerical edge/), Republicans roadblock the entire process until they can win again.

Again, the pattern seems to be a creeping one-party state in which "Republican or nothing" is the motto.

Maybe you can tear apart my view of the facts here and teach me a whole lot about why nothing is actually that bad. I invite the reassurance. I also don't trust the reassurance, not least because Democrats under Barack Obama gave basically no indication that they even oppose this process in any vigorous way. As far as I can tell, the "Blue Tribe" and the "Blue Party" who represent them /also/ believe in one-party Red Tribe/Republican government.

At least, they [[https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/11/explaining-it-all][believe in the weedy details of political procedure]] more than they believe that their own constituents deserve equal representation, so when something happens along the lines of "Democrats get more votes, Republicans get more seats, for Complicated Procedural Reasons", they stick by the Complicated Procedural Reasons at the expense of their own constituents. When /Republicans/ win more votes, either by Complicated Procedural Reasons or by the simple means of having more supporters, /nothing/ is done to get Democrats disproportionate power for Complicated Procedural Reasons.

I realize that the federal system was original put in place to ensure that small or low-population states received fair representation. I realize. I /live/ in a small, low-population state: we've got fewer people living in this whole state than in New York City alone, or in Israel as a whole (other places I've lived). However, as my tribal peers in, say, Oregon or Washington could point out: right now, the federal system is not enfranchising /us/. It is extra-enfranchising /red/ states, correlated with smallness, /at the expense/ of blue states, correlated with largeness.

It is /logically possible/ to have a fair and egalitarian federal system. This just isn't it. This is a system that, in my lifetime and as far as I can tell, is designed to make sure Republicans govern, no matter what. The ideology driving this seems to be Red Tribe ethnonationalism, which unfortunately comes with a desire to eliminate the political influence of the Blue Tribe and its constituents as alien influences to a "rightfully Red" country, again completely discounting how many Red people there actually are versus Blue people.

********** I'm going to ask some of the same forbearance I don't know if I'm going to address your concern to your satisfaction or just seem to offer an old man's cynical bromides, but this a reply in good faith but there have been a lot of interruptions in my household tonight, so apologies if I ramble. In kind I will say the red tribe is too much in business and too little in shrinking government's action I won't say they are the all defector, but it seems that way sometimes. To put my principles clearly I'm excited to see Mars will likely be a private expedition, though I wonder if we will end up with Heinlein's Golden Rule or a Free Luna, and I'm cynical enough that I though Fiorina should have been the candidate so we could have a Woman to Woman, or Capitalist to Socialist race and either get some of the identity politics out of the way, or maybe had a referendum on a real issue.

I'm not sure of your state or ethnicity. Myself I am Jewish decent, Lutheran upbringing, service academy, followed by a decade in, went back to school after, and now successfully converted to programmer from military bureaucrat, it's a lot more fun than managing, most of the time. I've been voting in Florida since late '98 and I play the game theory choices with my vote, so Libertarian isn't an option, yet.

I think you are suffering from the same fears I've had with the Clinton's presidency and Obama's "I've got a pen. . ." Gerrymandering goes both ways over time, it's one of those evil Game theory anomalies that now is an institution, it went red's way this time, but I honestly had severe doubts where I had my money in the prediction markets, and while I'm very glad to see the results we've had I'd like any of Prof's recommendations to his constitutional convention near the end of /The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (TMIAHM)/ myself more than the republic we have, though some of theme are too democratic and I do fear mob rule, but we at least have a republic that, recent minor urban disturbances aside, frequently and safely changes regimes with [[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/11/09/man-who-predicted-nine-last-elections-including-trump-polls-stink-i-was-right_n_12885522.html][surprising regularity]]. In general though Prof's (from TMIAHM not Liechtman) recommendations are all conductive to a smaller system and I don't think we'll see as much of that as either of us want.

The system swings both ways, and it's always looks scary from the side of the minority party. The coup of swinging all three branches is sobering, and we will see if anything effective comes from it, the red tribe is better at being a minority party and sticking to it's lost small government principle by blocking action than implementing good reform when it has power.

I'm hoping, at a minimum, we finally see a line item veto but the arguments for and against that after the last 8 years of executive activism are sobering. The precedent against appointing a supreme court judge in the last year [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1SUn0zTGUQ][came from Joe Biden's speech in 1992]] but it's not all that new for [[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/26/long-supreme-court-vacancies-used-to-be-more-common/][nominations to be blocked]]. I'm personally glad this blocked another Kagen; Citizen's United and Heller are important victories for the 1st and 2nd amendment IMHO and I'm embarrassed for the court by Kagen embracing partition behaviour even more than I'm usually bothered by her minority briefs. Heck if Heller's implications ever get's fully implemented I might consider moving back to California.

As to the media's success conflating trump with Hitler or the really scary tribal racist idiots** /sigh/ try reading Scott Adam's blog, but do it the way you would a lesswrong article: look for what the assumptions are and see how the logic looks. I won't say I'll be second in line to assassinate Trump if he tries to be Hitler, the drives too far, other people will get there first, and I the tactics I taught were submarine tactics, but I know plenty of people reserving judgement. On the flip side Pence is good assassination insurance. New York Morality, as a southerner, a sailor, an occasional conservative, and probably at least a former membber of the intended audience makes me think of vice and Mammon, or the DeNiro film /The Devil's Advocate/

Personally we need both forces conservatives to return us to our principles, progressives to make things better, but often I think we've gotten to the voting themselves bread and circuses state on both sides.

I guess, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_members_in_United_States_politics][based on historic congressional KKK members]] you could infer at least some democrats support Trump <not joking>

I think this needs some corrections. The Republican Party competes for the Hispanic bloc. The Democratic Party simply assumes it, often to their own detriment.

But also, we both know that this isn't really about "legal immigration", because there isn't quite such an actual thing in America. Sorry, but if the process is so complicated that the immigrant themselves has to retain a bunch of lawyers inside the USA to navigate the process for pay, /and can often be defrauded and then thrown out of the country after years of living here peacefully/ (happened to a friend of a friend), if police can stop people and demand to see "proof" of citizenship but the state refuses to supply a universal national ID, then the /point/ of that process, in effect, is to create holes people can be punished for falling into.

I have similar doubts about your view on property. No single moral principle /can/ be maximized to the exclusion of all other moral principles without a post-scarcity civilization, and even then it would be morally perverse to do it.

Come on, unpack this statement. "How would a mostly egalitarian, top-to-bottom democratic society in which ownership of materials is defined solely by personal usage be constructed so that a shrinking minority of identity chauvinists obsessed with constructing hierarchies with themselves on the top don't gain control over the system of distribution?"

And it answers itself: the principles behind socialism and anarchism are not about "redistribution" in the social-democratic sense at all, but about /pre/-distribution. So the shrinking minority of identity-chauvinistic hierarchs would actually have to /fight/ the overwhelming majority of society.

Whereas in this reality, they basically played a narrow set of procedural games, won on a narrow set of procedural technicalities, and now get to walk around in fancy suits pretending that everyone loves them and supports them, while actually devolving society further into a corrupt orgy of death-worship.

I mean, that's great, but our immigration system is also a Byzantine mess meant to ensure that people with deep-pocketed sponsors get through while everyone else ends up going back to their home-country. And that's before we talk about the "illegal immigration" issue, in which employers basically ship people in en masse, on a regular basis, and we all look the other way /until such time as the employers want to be rid of their workers/, at which point we suddenly decide to enforce our borders with deportations.

The democrats chose to run someone who embodied the establishment, in an election where people wanted change. Obama won on change in '08 because people wanted the great recession fixed. The people in the midwest that lost their home and pension in '08 haven't recovered still- the only people to recover are those with homes or stocks. So in '16 the election is about change again, and Hillary vastly underestimated her opponent.

** Hey all, back again for an update on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5bmlsq/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d9pxhja/][my Singularity game.]]

I've made a rough sketch of the factions, and here's what I have so far:

*Military Research Team*

The Military's starting funding is the highest, at $10(billion). Their goal is a Sovereign AGI, which has the highest starting Risk of 99%.

Their Passive Ability is that they get double the reward for researching technology with the "Military Applications" tag. This reflects their country's willingness to dish out more money for ancillary benefits related to their field.

Their Active Ability is that they may cancel Sabotage cards by spending money equal to their cost. This reflects their ability to use other real world assets to keep their project and personnel safe.

*Humanist Research Team*

Starting funds are fairly low, at $4, and their goal is an Oracle AGI, which has the lowest starting Risk of 85%

Their Passive Ability is that they win ties on bids when recruiting Researchers. Generally this reflects that people are more likely to want to work for them, so all else being equal, they're more likely to get good talent.

Their Active Ability is that, upon making a trade of completed Research with other players, they can choose to stop either side from drawing a Sabotage card (which normally happens if two players make a trade of research or technology).

*Private Research Team*

Starting funds are fairly high, at $8, and their goal is a Genie, at the moderate starting Risk of 92%.

Their Passive Ability grants them twice as much money from new Technology Research rewards, reflecting their better ability to leverage the advanced technology commercially.

Their Active Ability lets them use an Action token to keep a temporary researcher on staff an extra turn (they still have to pay their minimum bid each turn). Since researchers always provide at least one extra Action token, but can also have other bonuses, this can be a helpful way of extending benefits during a crucial period.

*Revolutionary Research Team*

Was going to call this the "Terrorist Research Team," back when Win Scenarios were fixed, but changed it to Revolutionary now that they're decoupled. Starting funds are the lowest, at $2, and their goal is a Genie AGI, at 92%.

Their Passive Ability lets them continue to use Action Tokens after passing in a round. Normally once you pass you continue to get skipped for the rest of that round until everyone has passed and the next round begins.

Their Active Ability lets them spend an Action to take the top Sabotage card from the discard pile. Usually you get Sabotage cards by spending funds, and what you get is random: this gives them a cheaper alternative with some limited control.

So those are the 4 factions I have in mind right now. The Win Scenarios used to be fixed to them, but now I'm thinking they'll be assigned randomly, or maybe people just get to pick between:

Domination - You Win

Transcendence - Everyone Wins

Obliteration - Everyone Loses

Not quite sure how that each play out yet. Will probably have to get to the playtesting phase to figure it out, but any feedback is welcome!

** Sometimes I feel like being too attached to your current epistemic state is the worst thing ever, but other times I think it's practical. I mean, as a human right now, work is a part of my utility function. I don't just do things because I want the end reward; effort is not anti-utility. But we also make things more efficient so that we have more time to expend on things that require less effort. I don't really envision a wire-heading scenario as the best thing ever, but doesn't that seem like the direction we're headed in?

  And my first thought was: if your job can be done more cheaply without you, and the only reason you have it is because people would feel sorry for you if you didn't, so the government forces your company to keep you on -- well then, it's not a job. It's a welfare program that requires you to work 9 to 5 before seeing your welfare check.

I don't see how welfare programs (ie. basic income) factor into the existence of art and music. I get that, in the ancestral environment, we were much more at home with hobbies like that than working 9-5, but I don't know why we can't find the art in working. It certainly isn't a desire to be exposed to complicated and interesting problems, because there are plenty of productive jobs that do that!

It seems kind of strange to say that humans like a /certain fixed/ amount of complexity. (I'm using complexity in the sense of the distance N between the action and the reward) Like, too much complexity and the utility calculation ends up being negative, but we find the state of "eternal wireheaded bliss" to be /too simple/ and /too rewarding/. Where's the cutoff line?

** Estimates for how long it would take to develop superhuman AI (/not/ necessarily friendly superhuman AI) if a major world superpower like the United States decided to make it a major research priority a la development of spaceflight during the Space Race?

*** I don't think that hypothetical major research program changes much; the researchers just fail or do what they wanted to do anyway. In the short term it would drive up the price of private AI research, and in the long term it would lead to increased entry in the field because of increased prestige and salary. The government also cannot legally pay salaries high enough to compete on salary for even the median DL researcher.

I could be very very wrong.

**** What evidence is there to support those claims? waitbutwhy talked about processor speed and capacity, and many people point to things like Watson which is essentially a very, very large + powerful analysis and decision tree navigator, but I have yet to see large efforts to bring the various all together.

What pieces are you specifically thinking are going to come together to give AGI?

**** I agree because narrow AIs are now out performing people on tasks like [[https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/the-face-recognition-algorithm-that-finally-outperforms-humans-2c567adbf7fc#.n1slbjclp][face recognition]] which is a task that we have explicitly evolved specialized neural circuits for.

Sorry I can't provide an actual paper instead of a news article, I couldn't find a paper on the algorithm.

***** I think it's a fairly big step from specialised AI to a general AI. A key intermediate step, at least by my limited understanding of the problem, is creating an algorithm that can learn to solve general problems without requiring manual tweaking of hyperparameters.

So, for example, we have AIs that can outperform humans at Go and Chess, but it's not the same AI doing both. It's not impossible to create an AI that context switches between specialised networks, but that's not the same thing as an AGI (unless it's training the specialised networks and overseer itself).

The other issue is that we currently train some of our AIs with manually compiled data. It's a very different beast to actually have one scrape its own data from the wild.

That said, I believe that within 25 years there won't be any specific task that humans outperform AIs on, provided there's a metric for judging that (so art, writing, etc. would need a quality function first) and that it's not just because it's obscure.

Hell, I have prosopagnosia so I'm quite used to being outperformed by computers at this task.

Aside (obfuscated to minimise spoilers): I remember last week I was watching an episode of /Dr Who/ where the Nth doctor has a faux-flashback to him doing some heroic deed in the past. I thought to myself, "of COURSE it's the Nth doctor who is in this flashback, never mind he has N-1 other forms he could have been in for this!". Much to my surprise two scenes later it turns out that the Nth doctor was remembering himself as the N-1th doctor doing that deed, as is demonstrated when something timey-wimey occurs and they are both in the same place at the same time. "OHHHHHH. They are different actors!" I say to myself, surprised by the totally-unsurprising-reveal.

And their respective actors [[#s][(]]) aren't exactly twins. And each new Doctor /gets an entirely new outfit/.

Oh, and I'm only /borderline/ faceblind (3rd percentile). I weep for my lesser brothers and sisters.

*** I think it would help with some things like integration-- pulling together components from various researchers in language understanding, vision, planning, memory, cognitive architectures, etc... that are researched separately but would need to be brought together for a working system that has all the capabilities of a human. Massive training datasets could be assembled using mechanical Turk. Researchers would have access to powerful government supercomputers. You could get a good fraction of all the AI researchers in the U.S. working on parts of the same project. But none of that would be enough to develop human-like AI unless the time is right. So I'm guessing you could speed it up by 10 years, if you picked a moment to start 20 years before it would have happened without the project.
