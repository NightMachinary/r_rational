*** Considering how popular HPMOR and this fanfic is, I will bet 75% or greater probability that someone, within the next three months, will do so. Conditions for winning: a fanfic of any length greater than 2,000 words explicitly stated to be based on /Following the Phoenix/ published before 4/12/2015.

Propose your stakes for this most glorious bet! It's win-win for anyone going against me, since my opponent will either win, or receive a new HPMOR fanfic as a consolation prize.

****** Yeah, that was unclear. Ok, here's the bet I'm offering:

If a 2000+ word metafic of FTP is published on or before 11:59pmUTC on April 12, 2015, then you pay the author two months of Reddit Gold.

If such a story is NOT published by that datetime, then I'll pay you 2 months of Reddit Gold.

Do you take the bet?

EDIT: To cover some corner cases:

- The metafic only needs to be based on FTP content that is up as of today -- that is, things up to and including Chapter 36. If [[/u/heiligeezel]] publishes more after this and the metafic happens to overlap with / contradict events in those new sections, then the metafic is still considered acceptable.
- [[/u/heiligeezel]] is excluded from winning this bet. :P
- You only need to pay out on the first such metafic published.

Quick question for you -- is there anything in canon about a weight limit on what phoenixes / phoenix owners can bring along on a teleport? You had Xare carrying fifty schoolkids which says the limit is pretty high -- was that your call, or was that based on something canonical?

Not in HPMoR or HP as far as I know. In FtP, there's only these rules:

#+begin_quote
  "Now, Miss Granger, phoenixes can carry incredible weights. In fact, anything they carry gets lighter. You can transport up to fifty people at once, as long as they all hold each other tightly."

  She grabbed Harry's hand. She was a bit nervous about this one. She'd never traveled by phoenix before, and it would be Xare's first time, too. "And then?"

  "Just picture the place where you want to go in your head, and ask your phoenix to take you. They accept mental commands. You must hold her too."

Is "fifty people" a numerical limit (there is something about people that means you can't take more than 50 of them) or is it a weight limit based on average weight? Could you take 50 morbidly obese people?

******* Accepted!

Two last caveats to clear up though.

- Both of us are not eligible to write the story and claim the Reddit Gold. We are betting on someone else doing so.
- If the author is not someone who has a reddit account, then I'll pay you the two months of Reddit Gold instead.

P.S. I currently rate my odds of winning this bet to be at 80% since people on this subreddit now know they can earn Reddit Gold to by writing a measly 2000 words.

Alright, I'm willing to pay just *YOU* two months of Reddit Gold if you post a fanfic of /Following the Phoenix/ within the next three months by 4/13/2015. Don't worry about rushing it though. I know that you need to finish up a couple of other stories for your Kickstarter first.

"Pay Attention," on the other hand, is the single hardest thing I've ever written. I've already written it once and then thrown out 80% of it and started over. The entire planned setting of the second half has gone out the window. I'm currently at 12,439 words, I expect to hit 15,000 easy before I finish it (it was only supposed to be 9,000!) and I keep re-reading what I have and thinking "this has the impact of a wet noodle," so I suspect it will need major editing once I finish it again. If you (singular and generic) end up liking it, I am going to end up patting myself on the back so hard I'll break my arm.

Even though I gave a deadline well after his prediction of when the next chapter is coming out (which is stated to possibly be on 1/28/2015), I disguised this fact by agreeing to eaglejarl's condition that I would only pay out the first metafic written to incentivize speed (I would have included that condition if eaglejarl hadn't mentioned it first).

I'm actually mildly surprised that anyone accepted the bet at all. Of course the bet's now off, but I'm willing to wait and hope eaglejarl accepts my "terms of surrender" in exchange for some HPMOR fiction written by him (even if he publishes it after Eliezer starts updating again).

Possibilities with a lot of potential include Sirius Black's trial (Dumbledore promised he would /get/ one, but it never made its way into FtP - although I suspect EY is already going to be doing something with that, so this may not be a good option), Michael Verres-Evans' first lesson (he /was/ teaching for a week, so he got several lessons done, and there were some great suggestions on the reddit about it), and Hermione's summer job for the British space program (although some of that may already make its way into the epilogue - I'm just not familiar enough with the physics and progress of space travel to really do this justice; do we actually have sufficiently clear photographs of anything out of the solar system so Hermione and Xare could use them?).

Followed by an adventure story with significant timeskips, involving alternated research into HPMOR things and Indiana Jones-esque lost artifact hunting.

I mean, think about it, what are the good guys most powerful tools, things which have so far been used to save the day over and over and over again? Only one of them is a spell (True Patronus). The others are /all/ artifacts.

The Elder Wand, the Philosopher's Stone, The Resurrection Stone, Time Turners, the Cloak. Some actually able to be engineered today or copied, others not.

Then there are the old legends of Merlin being frozen by Nimue in a cave, in a very similar manner to Ignotus, or similarly to what you would expect modern cryonics to suggest...

***** Nope. Although one thing we COULD do is use Xaremione to get to Mars.

Or, alternatively, the moon. We build a giant telescope there (no atmosphere, great for telescopes) then use that to study one of the nearer earth-crossing asteroids. Hop to that, build another telescope, hop to another asteroid farther out, then to one of the moons of Jupiter, etc. We could island-hop our way pretty far like that. And, since we could launch telescope-equipped probes from each location, the "phoenix-able" zone would expand quickly.

Also, did HPMoR or FtP ever establish how Floo networks work? Because, theoretically, phoenix-hopping a Floo engineer to another solar system could be exploited horrifyingly well.

  In the quest for even greater angular resolution, dedicated VLBI satellites have been placed in Earth orbit to provide greatly extended baselines. Experiments incorporating such space-borne array elements are termed Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (SVLBI).

  The first such dedicated VLBI mission was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HALCA][HALCA]], an 8 meter [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope][radio telescope]], which was launched in February 1997 and made observations until October 2003, but due to the small size of the dish only very strong radio sources could be observed with SVLBI arrays incorporating it.

  Another space VLBI mission, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioAstron][Spektr-R (or RadioAstron)]], was launched in July 2011.

I suspect the final chapters of HPMoR will provide an answer to that. :P

The simple reason: magic + technology is /really really powerful/. Harry is giving away all the control he has, and for example, some well-meaning scientist might end up discovering and publishing a way to end world hunger, without realising (because they don't /quite/ have the eperience with power and cynicism that powerful wizards have) that the exact same magic / technology combination with a few small tweaks will destroy all crops in a country beyond magical repair. Add some terrorists who use that on, say, all western countries, and we're in for a fair bit of trouble.

(Of course, that risk exists even without scientists having magic, which is why Riddle dislikes them so much. However, without magic it will generally be harder.)

** The general reaction, both on FF.net and here, seems to be that this was a happy ending. Are we really sure about that? The setup of this last chapter really reads to me like Harry has just started talking to the boxed AI, and is just about to happily let it out of the box. Maybe this is just me being paranoid, but we've got a number of quotes from previous chapters related to existential risk that suggest Harry is...very bad, to be kind...at managing it.

  "have you managed to destroy civilization yet?" There was no anger in the question, merely resignation. [Ch 115]

What does Harry do in the last chapter? Just a partial list: he enters the tomb before anyone else, he meets the eyes of the /insanely powerful person/ from an /entirely different culture with potentially alien values/ without thinking twice, and as the story ends he's just about to give Ignotus the ability to possess the most powerful wizard currently alive today, with access to a phoenix and the Elder Wand!

  *Star lifting* is any of several hypothetical processes by which a sufficiently advanced civilization (specifically, one of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale][Kardashev-II]] or higher) could remove a substantial portion of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star][star]] matter for any number of purposes. The term appears to have been coined by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Criswell][David Criswell]].

  Stars already lose a small flow of mass via [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind][solar wind]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection][coronal mass ejections]], and other natural processes. Over the course of a star's life on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence][main sequence]] this loss is usually negligible compared to the star's total mass; only at the end of a star's life when it becomes a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant][red giant]] or a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova][supernova]] is a large amount of material ejected. The star lifting techniques that have been proposed would operate by increasing this natural [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)][plasma]] flow and manipulating it with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field][magnetic fields]].

  Stars have deep [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_well][gravity wells]], so the energy required for such operations is large. For example, lifting solar material from the surface of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun][Sun]] to infinity requires 2.1 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation][× 10^{11}]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule][J]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram][kg]]. This energy could be supplied by the star itself, collected by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere][Dyson sphere]]; using only 10% of the Sun's total power output would allow 5.9 × 10^{21} kilograms of matter to be lifted per year (0.0000003% of the Sun's total mass), or 8% of the mass of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth][Earth]]'s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon][moon]].

*** It's a spoiler in the same sense that if you're reading a book and notice that you're on the last chapter you have then been spoiled. The fic is even tagged as complete on fanfiction.net, meaning that anyone who gets to the fic through there will know it's the last chapter

***** Spoiler is in the eye of the beholder. I don't think it spoils anything to know that you're reading the last chapter of a work, and thus I don't consider it a spoiler. You're operating under a very restrictive definition of the term, and using it in a somewhat non-standard way. The fact that this is the last chapter is something that ff.net would "spoil" for you once this piece was marked complete, and we can infer that they don't consider it to be a spoiler. The author herself has said repeatedly that this is the last chapter, and I can conclude that she doesn't consider that information to be a spoiler either.

Calling something a spoiler doesn't mean that it's a spoiler.

******** I suppose in general it could go either way. For Harry Potter and the Natural 20, the ending of book 2 deliberately came as a surprise.

For FtP, if it is indeed a spoiler it's not a spoiler I minded spoiling, though - which is why I announced it beforehand. I don't really think it adds to the story if people get their hopes up that we're going to see awesome death-defeating shenanigans.

Speaking of spoilers, did anyone at all notice that [[#s][Spoiler for apparently-too-subtle-hints]]?

********** When he and Harry talking to the Muggles in Parliament, he mentions that the bomb he diverted detonated on [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Azkaban]["A small island in the North Sea"]], away from any other human habitation.

Then he mentions in a previous chapter that it was completely and utterly destroyed, and it was in fact a good sight for him, that he might share the Pensive thoughts with others.

So, yes, I noticed that! It wasn't entirely clear that it was Dumbledore that destroyed it in the first instance, but the subtle little hint int the other chapter suggested it.
