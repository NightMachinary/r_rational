Maybe you have ideas that only people from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] can do justice.

Let's post our ideas here and hope that someone picks them up.

** When AlphaZero detects that they are winning, it effectively starts producing garbage moves, just to hold its advantage. When you see this, you generally know you've lost, but you don't know why. A win is a win to it after all. The utility function doesn't take into consideration the margin of victory, merely the fact of it.

I'd really love to see something like this emerge in rationalist fiction.

On one hand, it could make for a nice explanation of why the transhumanly smart AI seemingly does stupid things mid-plot, and still crushes humanity, or why the humans even /seem/ to have a fighting chance at all, despite the overwhelming superiority of the opposition.

On the other and given could be leveraged by plucky protagonists acting in a sufficiently out-of-model fashion to defeat an at least marginally technically superior foe if you want to go with a more standard Hollywood trope.

*** "What else can you do?"

Minnie poured some milk foam into a cat.

Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that he tripped over a stray sack of coffee beans and landed hard on his bottom with a /thwack/. His hands came down to catch himself without quite reaching properly, and there was a warning twinge in his shoulder as the weight came down unbraced.

At once the small image of a tabby cat swirled back into just so much cream and coffee. "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," said the barista, sounding sincere, though the corners of her lips were twitching upwards. "I should have warned you."

Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. "You can't DO that!"

"It's only a latte," said Minnie. "Caff√® latte, to be exact."

"You poured microfoam into a cat! A /SMALL/ cat! You violated Conservation of Milk! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the foam of the espresso!

Daily reminder that N did nothing wrong.

The problem with nearly all "serious" pokemon stories is that you have to overhaul a /lot/ of the setting to have it be vaguely consistent, and end up with the shounen problem of "why don't the high level Pokemon curbstomp the low level Pokemon". It'd probably be less of a problem in this, since N having Zekrom/Rashiram and be unbeatable is a feature and having to politic you way into freeing Pokemon instead of pseudorational "we train in the mountains for 5 years straight and overthrow the government".

I've been thinking a bit about a Yu-Gi-Oh ratfic. The only answer I can find to how that would unfold is that you'd need to carefully study actually clever, surprising yet plausible strategies/decks within a given card set that is accepted as the one existing in the setting of choice (aka: Duel City). Then somehow manage to write a CHILDREN'S CARD GAME (sorry) in a compelling way, while allowing the reader to keep track of which cards are in play, what's the LP score, etc.

If someone has enough knowledge of the game and patience to undertake that work, it would be amazing. But the thought is frankly intimidating.

**** Yeah. Agreed. Part of the reason that I haven't written one myself is because trading card games are too complicated to depict realistically if you're not familiar with them. And if you don't like the game, then trying to write matches can be a huge pain. Which is sad because I had some good ideas for yugioh fic. I mean, I suppose you could replace duel monsters with magic the gathering or something. But then that messes with the ancient egyptian world building, I think. A large part of the premise of yugioh is that the pharaoh has lost his memories and is playing a cursed/enchanted trading card game that reenacts/mimics the battles of his past, after a fashion. And if you use magic the gathering you would need to explain why they are battling using cards instead of fighting like normal planeswalkers. Maybe in the story it could be a cursed game, but it reenacts battles of the past which are integral to the culture of the plane it takes place on, but which has been lost to time. Not sure how that would work.

Although to be fair, too many of the duel monsters in season 1 are medieval fantasy themed rather than ancient egyptian. I think the whole series would have worked better if the ancient egyptian theme was replaced with medieval fantasy, or if more of the duel monsters were egyptian themed.

***** The way it's supposed to work, I think, is that the monsters were 'bound' to the cards by the Pharaoh and his priests, whereas they used to exist and roam freely. So in a way if you play, say, Blue Eyes White Dragon what you're really doing is tapping a fraction of the power of the /real/ BEWD who lies trapped beyond space and time or whatever. As such the games are themselves pale reflections of the summoners battles of old, with the non insignificant benefit that they don't destroy the world any more. However they remain magically binding, which is why you can wager your soul on them, or use them to force an opponent to do what you want. In the so-called 'season 0' part of the story (before the card game gets even introduced) we see that the Pharaoh inside Yugi's body does this multiple times: he challenges someone at a game, /any/ game, and establishes an ante. If they break their part of the deal after losing, then the penalty kicks in, and that's usually them losing their mind or soul. The Pharaoh is quite hardcore and doesn't fuck around.

I think there is potentially a really interesting setting in there. You could even justify the variety of the monsters as them being 'archetypes' that belong to the human collective imagination and transcend time (a bit like Servants in Fate). It's just that actually designing and depicting the games would be such a pain. I played the game, mainly in virtual form, including recently on Duel Links. But early game had too few cards to create gripping strategies without all the fuckery that happens in the anime, and currently the game has /so many/ cards it's impossible to keep track of them all. You can of course just rely on established meta, but at that point you're not really creating anything especially original, most likely.

*** For #1, learn stacking techniques, make a cheap deck full of beatsticks/removal (or burn, if it's legal - I don't think it would be, since at 4000 Life Points, -800/1000 spells break the game), the win enough prizes to collect an array of best cards.DEK (around the time, it would've been Chaos Control - with Crush Card Virus added in, since it was legal in the anime). I could see cards like Messenger of Peace or Wave-Motion Cannon being more prevalent, since not every deck runs the silver bullet S/T removal that's essential for getting around those cards.

There was a season in the anime where destruction cards weren't legal. Duel Links metagame shows that in absence of reliable destruction, attack nullifiers (like Windstorm of Etaqua, Enemy Controller) become better.

The anime decks tend to be terrible, with tribute monsters and highly specific underwhelming support everywhere, so a deck like that would sweep shop.

Seguing into more of a ratfic YGO premise...

Depends if you want to either produce an in-universe reason spoiler lists don't exist (making to harder to determine/find what are the "best cards" - given its a much more competitive game in the anime, you could have Governments putting a ban on spoiler lists, or Illustrous Illusions redacting them for going against the spirit of the game), or develop your own metagame (which I think is probably more fun from a creator POV and a reader one, to be honest. You just establish a baseline with whatever real life/Duel Links format you found the most interesting, and include/design decks around that power level).

Or alternatively, since YGO was and always has been a broken mess of a game (part of the allure, really), you could have them play something like Exceed, BattleCON, Innovation instead, but then that's more of a ratfic gaming fic rather than a YGO one (...which does it with YGO's original premise of "any games", so... *shrug*).

** A ROB whith humanlike mind is bored and uses his powers to summon whatever human will make him have more fun from the set of all computable universes (or maybe just from a really big multiverse) into a cliche isekai fantasy world.

The Rob knows this is dangerous but still decides to do it, thinking that completely isolating himself from that world except from being able to see what happens its enough to be safe.

After a series of aventures that "just happen" to convince the ROB to give his power to the human the multiverse is turned into paperclips.
