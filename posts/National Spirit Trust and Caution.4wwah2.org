** I thought Esfand's chapter was a little rough. I'm still working on writing fight scenes. The fight between her and the spearman was interesting, but between two heavily armored people fights could actually be pretty boring, historically. Armor was relatively good at its job, and though armor could be defeated by weapons in the right circumstances, it wasn't uncommon for a heavily armored knight to be tough to kill.

The mail armor that Karian Varman wore was a classic, capable of absorbing a variety of blows. Cutting attacks, such as with swords, had their force spread across a wide area. Piercing attacks were more effective, but still often stopped. Certain weapons like longbows fared better against mail, and I suspect a concerted attack with spears or poleaxes would do well also. The segmented cuirass that Esfand used fell out of favor as mail became more popular, but still provided ample protection to the torso, especially when combined with padded armor. Metal bands provide protection well, and might be easier to clean and maintain than mail, which was probably very finicky.

I'm pleased with how Siwen's chapter turned out. Like many fantasy Queens, she spends her time worrying about AI friendliness.
