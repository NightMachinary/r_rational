"Tadashi is here.", Baymax insisted.

I sighed. Not /this/ again.

"He's not here. Tadashi is dead."

"Tadashi is here."

I wondered briefly whether the AI was just going through grief at its father's death. If this was how it expressed the first stage: denial.

"No." I told it firmly, "Tadashi died. I /watched/ him die." 'And I wonder how much permanent mental scarring /that/ caused...' I thought bitterly. "So just shut up, will you?" I immediately regretted raising my voice, but it was just too much. The AI was programmed to heal my body but this constant insistence of my brother's presence was only harming my mind. How was I supposed to let go with... /this/?

"Tadashi is here."

"Then where the *hell is he?! Go on! Point to him!*" I shouted, finally losing my temper.

Baymax did not point.

A very small part of me felt smug at having defeated the machine, but it was a hollow victory and I instantly began hating myself for it. This was something my brother had poured his heart and soul into and I had just crushed its spirit. Damn it. Why did I have to deal with this? Why did Tadashi have to give this thing /emotions/? ...Or was I just projecting? I probably was, come to think of it. Humans were bad with that kind of thing.

The screen on Baymax's chest lit up. It showed a medical scan. A window opened and displayed code in a language I didn't recognise, it scrolled down quickly, but the scroller-bar didn't seem to move.

"What is that?" I asked it.

"A complete biological scan of Tadashi at the moment of death."

A section of the code, as well as the CNS on the scan image highlighted purple.

"Tadashi is here."


** I was kind of expecting the movie to go into potential AI problems more (in a simplified, family-friendly way, obviously). To be specific, I was expecting the moment where he scans the entire city to lead into a hilarious scene where he tries to fix the medical problems of literally everyone in the entire city, and Hiro can't stop him and get him back to the main task because healing people overrides it.

*** I like this idea, although it's worth noting that Baymax is a PERSONAL healthcare companion. His primary directive is to ensure the health and well-being of his assigned patient. On the assumption that "bedside manner" is something that he's been programmed to observe, fluttering around the city performing ninja-like feats of sudden medicine before moving on is certainly not conducive to giving his assigned patient respect and attention.

** Dear Lord, I never considered the possible implications of the ability to "biologically scan" a person, an ability that was, in hindsight, ridiculously vague in the original movie.

*** The biological scan depicted in the movie is pretty much ludicrously impossible. It's able to scan DNA from dozens of miles away (and store and process the data of all persons in range), which is how they found the Kitsune's hideout.

***** "Because my unsecured, unoverrideable access to a literally revolutionary technology was used for a bad thing, it clearly must never be used for anything."

That was what I most hated about the movie. It's a small hate, though.

**** I don't think DNA is one of the things Baymax can scan at range, nor would it be necessary, as much lower-resolution details would be sufficient for positive identification.

****** No, they used his health data, whatever that means. Height, build, blood type, heart problems, allergies, pre-existing conditions, disorders, and any diseases he might have had. It's still not realistic, but it's not quite as ridiculous as finding DNA from a distance

*** An unintended consequence of having such powerful diagnostic tools?

Or maybe the AI is self-modifying and it considers resurrection to be just another part of its healthcare duties, a part that Tadashi didn't properly equip it to deal with, but that's fine! It can modify itself to be able to correctly perform its job, regardless of Tadashi's oversights.

*** Perhaps Tadashi didn't realize the implications. He was pretty intensely focused on building an awesome robot to help people rather than thinking about the long-term implications beyond "help people."
