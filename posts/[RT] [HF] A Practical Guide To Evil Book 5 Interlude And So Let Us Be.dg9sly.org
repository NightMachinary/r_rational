**** The titles of interlude sets tend to follow a theme. In this case, they've been lines from /[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/villainous-interlude-crescendo/][The Many Deaths of Traitorous]]/:

  You rogues and madmen\\
  Proudly claim the stage,\\
  Of this wondrous age

  We are not kind or just\\
  Deserving of any victory\\
  We are a thing of dust\\
  Promised only misery

  *[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/10/09/interlude-so-smile-tyrants/][So smile, Tyrants]]*,\\

**** The interlude chapter titles have been lyrics from a song about traitorous:

#+begin_quote
  “Then let us be wicked,

  Let us be reddest ruin

  Rent, broken, crooked

  Black hearted and cruel

  .

  Then let us be doom,

  To both friend and foe

  Fly banner of gloom

  We lowest of the low

  .

  Rise, rise all ye villains

  You rogues and madmen

  Proudly claim the stage,

  Of this wondrous age

  .

  We are not kind or just

  Deserving of any victory

  We are a thing of dust

  Promised only misery

  .

  So smile, Tyrants,

  And let us be wicked”

  -- Final monologue of “The Many Deaths of Traitorous”, a play on the reign of the Dread Emperor Traitorous

** u/vimefer:

  [Cat] had half a dozen other cats to skin, about then, and a limited amount of additional hands in Hakram and Vivienne.
#+end_quote

That's harsh, for such disarming banter. In fact I'll go out on a limb and call it heavy-handed.
