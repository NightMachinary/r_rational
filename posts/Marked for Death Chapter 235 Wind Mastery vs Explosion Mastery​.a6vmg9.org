** In which a contestant from Hot Springs goes all Mean Girl on Keiko and discovers that this might not always be a great plan. Also, pangolins and explosions.

** somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the [[/r/rational]] rules say that you're only supposed to post one update from an unfinished series per week?

*** I believe it's self-promotion once a week (the previous post wasn't created by an author). Practical Guide to Evil threads pop up every two-three days at times.

**** This is correct. The rule exists as it does to discourage repeated self-promotion, mostly because authors have an incentive to post their stuff a lot, and third parties presumably don't. In theory, the stories that get posted more than once a week get posted because people are really enjoying them, rather than because some upstart author wants to drown people in links until they submit.

That said, if a third party started posting once-a-day links to a story that updates daily, we probably would make a rule against it. In the past, people have been told to maybe knock it off, given that 1K word updates (or less) aren't much content and aren't really fodder for discussion, and largely serve to dilute other content.

(I do wish that Practical Guide had stuck to a twice weekly update schedule, and that submitters would just do one link when two chapters are posted at once, or failing that, that discussion would move to [[/r/PracticalGuideToEvil]] where it has room to breathe, but that's more personal preference than mod stance.)

****** It's just a bit annoying that we get one submission per chapter even if they come out the same day. I'll admit I don't see the appeal of Practical Guide but even beyond that I think it's kinda spammy and should get one post grouping all the new chapters (like WTC).

****** Definitely agree with this (Honestly kinda wish it didn't show up even that much because it's really only even borderline-rational-adjacent (ugh that's clunky) these days), but anecdote vs evidence and all that.

***** For what it's worth, MfD updates twice per week, typically Thursday and Sunday, and the updates are almost always 3k words or more. We've had a few chapters that hit 10k. I think it's fair to say that we aren't spamming and we are contributing value.

Also, I'm enjoying Practical Guide and am in favor of the frequent posts. I feel like this sub has quieted down a lot since I was last paying attention to posting rates (back when I was writing 2YE and Team Anko, 3ish years ago, I think?), so it doesn't feel like PGtE is drowning anything else out.
