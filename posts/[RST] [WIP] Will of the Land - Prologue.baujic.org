** Description copied from the RoyalRoad fiction page:

“A rebellion in the Pantheon of his father thrusted a young deity in a world he doesn't fully understand Despite never having visited the mortal lands before and finding those powerless creatures really strange he must try to develop and protect a civilization and a cult of his own or he will die forgotten with no chance of ever enacting his revenge on the rebels.”

Please include a description in the future when posting fictions, if you could?

Thanks!

** I downvote not because I don't like it. I downvote because it's only a prologue.
