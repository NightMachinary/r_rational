In hpmor chapter 16,

(SPOILERS)

Professor Quirrell calls Harry the most Dangerous Student in the Room for his ability to turn everyday objects into weapons. In particular, it is the propensity to make all his choices lethal or near lethal that Quirrell believes to be the crucial trait. I am looking for other protagonists, either in fanfiction or mainstream fiction which have either this characteristic, or the "creativity" Harry demonstrates throughout the chapter (and rest of the book, come to think of it). Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks!


** Note that Quirrell did not call harry dangerous for his "ability to turn everyday objects into weapons"; he described that as worse than useless. It was solely the intent to kill.

Ender, in Ender's game. (And his brother, Peter)

Ender's Game was one of my favorite novels as a kid :)

** Ender Wiggin is the patron saint of this.

Harry Dresden probably qualifies. Good at staying on target, ignoring convention and killing the unkillable.

Captain Tagon (Schlock Mercenary) is less creative, but good at the No Blinders thing.

** Parson Gotti of [[http://www.erfworld.com/erf_stream/view][Erfworld]], which is an ongoing web-comic with a similar theme as the /The Two Year Emperor/ but the rules are an tabletop war-game.

Though I think what you are looking for is lateral thinking in conflict, not just being lethal, but being effective.

** Takeshi Kovacs of Altered Carbon and its sequels.

Monza Murcatto of Best Served Cold.

The founder of Chasm City who's name I can't remember, of Chasm City. Jesus Christ that guy was stone cold.

All are fantastic books.

*** I immediately thought of Joe Abercrombie characters and I was pleasantly surprised than one showed up. I'd also count Logen and Ferro in The First Law trilogy.

** lots of larry niven characters have it. Mainly the protector species, but also the pupeteers, and to a lesser degree (non-creative, but reflexive) the kzinti.

*** The humans have way more effective intent to kill than the kzinti. When the kzinti met us, we has abolished war because we were /too good at it/. They found a human reaction drive slowboat in interstellar space, and their telepath told them it was unarmed. So, being kzin, they decided to microwave the human crew to death and take their ship. The humans cut them in half with their drive exhaust.

That's intent to kill.

**** gotta love that kzinti lesson "A reaction drive's efficiency as a weapon is in direct proportion to its efficiency as a drive." :D

*** I don't think that's accurate. Skitter can be rather gruesome and painful in her methods and is often unaware of how terrifying she is to others, but, IIRC, the first time she even attacks with deadly intent is the Slaughterhouse Nine (whom /everybody/ attacks with lethal intent) and the first time she kills anyone in cold blood ([[#s][]]), it's a Big Deal, taking place most of the way into the story.

*** Skitter has intent to win, not to kill. It feels same when you observe her tactics and plans, but once you realize she has to demonstrate her power to actually present herself as a threat, it makes her actions understandable.
