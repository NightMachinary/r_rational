Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I have a question to see if anyone can reconcile this form of magic. In this world, astrology and constellations are important for magic. However the worlds wider universe functions pretty much exactly as ours does. Can anyone think of anyway to have both of these at the same time. I just kind of want to see if anyone has any ideas.

*** Magic which is highly dependent upon time of day and time of year?

Suppose the Earth were orbiting through a cloud of aether which grants magical powers to certain people if the right techniques to harness it are used. The cloud could stay in a fixed position relative to the sun, perhaps a kind of gravitationally-attracted dark matter with an ultra-low density, so it is actually pressure that pushes it out to the orbit of Earth, rather than it maintaining a stable orbit around the sun. This is how the Earth is able to move through the cloud during the course of the year.

Suppose the cloud has many 'bubbles', and 'pockets' possibly of various 'colors' which are different in different places. The different colors of the dark matter tend to be cohesively drawn towards accumulations of the same color. If different colors have different effects on magic, perhaps allowing different types of magic or not allowing magic at all, then you'd have substantial changes in your magic system during the course of the year. Constellations would just be a proxy for time of year, so if magic works one way when Orion is highest in the sky at midnight, it should work the same way at the same time next year.

*** Astron particles are produced whenever nuclear reactions occur. They have two odd properties: First, perpendicular interference of astron particles is destructive, 120 degrees between sources is constructive. Second, when produced they are in a weakly interacting state. They maintain this state until they enter the vacuum of space (until they escape the celestial body that produced them) and once there they start interacting with matter much more strongly. While in the weakly interacting state the astron particles convert between types readily, meaning that different celestial bodies produce various flavors and concentrations of particles based upon chemical composition. While in a strongly interacting state, they tend not to transform.

Life on Earth evolved to use astron particles from the sun to inform circadian rhythms. However, particles from the other planetary bodies also affect the rhythms of life. Neurons produce the enzymes that produce the chemicals that interact most strongly with astron particles. The specific enzymes that an organism produces in abundance depend on which particles it was exposed to first: in short, which heavenly bodies are visible at its birth. There is an epigenetic mechanism that affects a person's ability to interact with astron particles.

A further complication: humans can willfully change how many astron-interacting chemicals their bodies produce, along with the specific position of their nerves, to cast spells. With a gesture and some will: magic. If the heavenly bodies are currently producing a lot of astron particles that the human is attuned to, without destructive interference, the spells get stronger.

All stars that undergo fusion produce neutrinos. Some, however, also produce rare astron particles in abundance. Which? Only those that coincidentally fall into a pulsating state, in which variances in pressure and astron particle density within the star become stable loops that convert some of the star's heat into astron particles--and those stars with an elemental composition favorable to a certain type of particle.

Humans notice constellations of stars in the night sky, and constellations that happen to contain a star producing an abundance of astron particles tend to be reinforced in the popular imagination. After all, if fire mages tend to be born when Mars is in Leo (when a star in Leo is constructively interfering with Mars itself), you'd notice.

Feel free to use all, some or none of these ideas. Also, preliminary consequences:

- fighting with magic underground is impossible
- you could keep children underground until fortuitous alignments
- nuclear reactors in vacuum chambers could power up spells
- the only way to get an Earth mage is to have someone give birth in orbit... or in a chamber surrounded by vacuum

** This might be the wrong weekly thread, but because it deals explicitly with Delphic, I thought I'd put it here. Spoilers for the most recent chapter (2.6 Painful Questions).

So, certain supers are using "enhanced interrogation" to extract information from criminals (ask a question, detect if the person is lying, inflict pain if so, rinse and repeat). When I introduced this, I took for granted that most people (and presumably the readers) would find this deeply disturbing and immoral.

That's not the feedback I received. One particular beta reader indicated that this "solves the problems" of interrogation by not physically harming the person, and that if this technique were possible in the real world, we should use it regularly.

Other comments I've received were primarily worried about danger in reputation or legal prosecution of the supers, presuming they must have some way of covering it up. The voices I heard from either indicated no immediate qualms with the practice, or minor concerns that could be overcome if the resulting intel was good.

So, have I just entirely misunderstood where people stand on these issues? Is inflicting temporary pain, in a situation where it isn't coupled to injury and can reliably produce information, as tilted on the balance of benefit versus harm that the controversy primarily boils down to controlling (ignorant) public backlash?

*** I think the problem is the simplicity of the frame. Not your fault so much as the fault of fictional stories in general.

What is a lie? If it's fact vs. falsehood then just ask the question to anyone (yourself, even!) and learn the truth from their guesses. No torture required. More probably the power is detecting the physiological process of deception.

How is this willful deception being detected? There has to be enough subtlety to distinguish between a lie by omission and genuine lack of knowledge, so by the time someone has been thoroughly tortured, their goal may so strongly be to end the pain rather than to answer the question that every answer might read as deceptive.

Even if the read is flawless, introduce (for example) an "innocent" who is protecting a criminal by pretending to be one. Everything they say will be deceptive.

Alternately a mercenary employed by a criminal may truthfully have no knowledge of the particulars the heroes want, but may believe truly terrible things will happen if the heroes realize this. "I don't know," will remain deceptive to some degree, even as it is also the truth.

All sorts of more subtle examples exist inside the minds of real torture victims. Knowledge is complex and deception is complex.

Your readers are reacting to a set of simple facts: The criminal is definitely guilty. He knows what the heroes want to know. They know exactly when he has told them everything he knows. This information is safe, and it saves lives at little cost to anyone. Very few real world situations match this frame, yet most fictional torture scenarios do.

And waterboarding, done properly, is almost exactly as "safe" and "temporary" as the paralysis/pain trick.

Even worse; if it triggers off intent-to-deceive, then the victim can make a completely (and knowingly) true statement, with the /intent/ for the statement to be taken as a lie (and thus disregarded), and it will be full of intent-to-deceive and thus assumed to be false by the interrogators.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Writeresearch/comments/8s83nc/ways_to_feel_miserable/][Crossposted]] with some rewrites from [[/r/writeresearch]]:

I'm looking for a way for a character to make themselves feel miserable on command. This character has a supernatural ability that is morally somewhat questionable, but using it feels really, really good so people with this power tend to find more and more justifications for using it.

The character in question is aware of this, so whenever she uses her powers she tries to counter this effect by deliberately inducing nausea, pain, depression or something similarly negative. Ideally I'm looking for some kind of mildly poisonous substance (like a pill or liquid) that makes you feel absolutely wrenched for a couple hours after ingesting it, but that is be at least moderately safe to take long term and acquirable for someone with a reasonable income and (if necessary) a cooperative doctor. Fast acting is better, but not a requirement.

A few of possibilities I have considered:

- Some kind of device that causes physical pain. The simplest form is just jamming a thumbtack into your skin, but there are all sorts of medieval torture devices to inflict physical pain on yourself. This is my current backup plan.
- Another option is to just have the character get stupid drunk the night before and only use magic with a severe hangover, but this is kinda impractical.
- A third option that I don't really like is to just handwave some (magical or biologic) feel-bad-juice and not specify the origin: "Oh this? It's just something that's going to make me feel like crap for a couple hours.", but even if I do something like that I'd rather that I, as the author, know the specifics.\\

I'd also be interested to know if there is any research into whether these kind of tactics are effective at preventing people from getting into (or helping them get out of) addictive behavior. My guess is "no" and the story works either way, I'd just be curious to know.

*** The first thing that comes to mind is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprinopsis_atramentaria][tippler's bane]], a mushroom that causes an acute reaction to alcohol. They're a super-easy mushroom to find, even in suburban environments, because they can often be found growing in lawns. Here's the relevant bit from Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria within a few hours of alcohol results in a "disulfiram syndrome". This interaction has only been known since the early part of the twentieth century. Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations and tingling in limbs, and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. If no more alcohol is consumed, they will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed, becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5 mg/dL, and prominent at concentrations of 50--100 mg/dL. Disulfiram has, however, been known to cause myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms, although they are milder as more time passes. Rarely, a cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation on top of supraventricular tachycardia, may develop.
#+end_quote

So, not the safest thing in the world, but you don't need a prescription and won't leave a paper trail that raises eyebrows, it's just some mushrooms and alcohol. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfiram][The page on disulfiram]] also gives some more information, if obtaining it from a pharmacy is feasible, and also provides some information on research into how it interacts with addictive behavior.

** The protagonist has been accidentally summoned to a different realm. He ends up as a student in a boarding school where students learn magic in addition to the normal subjects. Adjacent to this reality is a Virtual Realm that's based on a game that is suspiciously similar to Minecraft in our world. The protagonist is familiar with the game and is ludicrously OP (the entire thing is played for laughs). The story itself isn't very rational, but I would like to work on worldbuilding anyways. Here's what I've got so far:

- People are physically transported to VR through virtualization mats. If their avatar is killed, they simply respawn or return to RL. Despite this, people tend to treat death in VR just as seriously as death in RL. It's a little unrealistic, but it's necessary to set up some of the jokes.

- The magic system in both worlds uses magic circles, and the circles have identical meanings between the worlds. The only different is how they're used.

- Modern conveniences like indoor plumbing exist IRL.

- VR is split into shards, which are basically parallel realities that have different qualities based on the keywords used to create/access them.

- VR is very heavily gamified, with XP, crafting, loot drops, treasure chests in randomly-generated dungeons, and equipment and monsters of various tiers of strength.

- Physical objects cannot be pulled from VR to RL or vice versa. A banking guild helps move currency between VR and RL. Thus, events in VR can strongly influence things IRL and vice versa.

- Teleporters may or may not exist IRL. I haven't decided yet.

- A /lot/ of information about the game mechanics in VR have been lost to the ages. The protagonist knows /all/ of it, and constantly surprises his opponents. Like I said, it's played for laughs.

I guess my main question is this: in a world(s) like this, what large-scale resources are available, and how do those resources constrain or encourage population growth?

I realize that technically I should be the person to answer this, but it's just such a large question that I get a bit overwhelmed.

  What happens to your clothes when entering/leaving VR?
#+end_quote

While in VR your body is held in digital stasis while your consciousness inhabits an avatar. The face, hair, skin color and proportions of the avatar are all the same as your physical body, but you're given generic clothing to start with. If you want to wear a different outfit you either have to craft it or buy it.

#+begin_quote
  What sort of magic is taught in this world?
#+end_quote

Primarily the ability to create matter and energy ex nihilo. Sadly, a lot of knowledge has been lost and very, very few people can cast any spells outside of the 7 primary elements (fire, air, water, light, plant, earth, and darkness). Additionally, nobody knows how to customize their spells, so a spell will always have the exact same properties (strength, speed, size, etc.) each time it is cast. The protagonist is the exception to both of these rules.

No, you disappear completely in a flash of light as both your body and mind are converted to ones and zeroes. The body is used as a template to create the avatar, but what you were wearing is not used to create the avatar's clothing. Instead, your avatar wears whatever clothing you have equipped in-game (or the default clothing if you're a new player). Your mind controls the avatar from a first-person perspective. When you're done in VR your body (and clothing) is reconstructed IRL from the digital representation.

I have no idea where the digital representation is stored, though. Presumably someplace that is effectively impossible to access, simply because I don't want to write a story where a person's mental integrity is anything less than one hundred percent sacrosanct.

Interesting question. In theory this might be possible, but the VR mat technology is currently large and bulky and essentially connected to a land line.

You do bring up an interesting question that I haven't yet explored: how do people IRL get around? I imagine the Academy to be at least somewhat secluded, so how do people arrive and leave? Car? Horse? Magical creature that acts as transportation?

No. There are all sorts of safeguards to prevent something like this from happening. The primary one is a Unique Identifier (UID) that connects each avatar with their digital soul, though there are plenty of other safeguards as well. There is no known way to hack the system (though there are plenty of minor glitches that don't actually detract from the fun), and to bypass the UID constraints you'd pretty much need to be at the power level of the deity who created the system in the first place.

What can I say? That's just not the magical paradigm. Like I mentioned before, the system was created by some sort of deity, so some of the decisions are a little arbitrary.

Doesn't matter; they get different UIDs, which are created and assigned anew each time they enter VR, so there's no chance of them exiting into the wrong bodies.

In theory there's a chance of hash collision, where two UIDs coincidentally happen to be the same, but that's so unlikely it will basically never happen. Statistically speaking, the age of the universe wouldn't be enough time for a hash collision to happen even once.

********* So, if I /really/ want to deny someone access to a key (and I'm evil), then I get a mook to carry it, send him into VR, and then unplug his mat - until it's plugged in again, no-one gets the key.

If I'm more concerned about preventing access to the key than about using it myself, I can optionally disassemble or even smash the Mat my minion used (trapping him eternally in VR, but if I'm evil I won't much care).

It that has /ever/ happened then the minion in question is presumably still wandering around somewhere in VR, very high-level and more than a little bit miffed.

#+begin_quote
  this does open the way for a very interesting plot point, "Only the protagonist and some savages eat meat. Everybody else eats summoned plant matter."
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Question - can summoned matter be unsummoned?

If no - then summoned water, over the centuries, must have significantly raised the sea level. If yes - there's a potentially lethal attack against anyone who eats mainly summoned matter.

#+begin_quote
  Doesn't matter; they get different UIDs, which are created and assigned anew each time they enter VR, so there's no chance of them exiting into the wrong bodies.
#+end_quote

Hmmm... unless someone (i.e. the protagonist) finds a way to duplicate someone else's UID.

Idea - perhaps the UIDs are generated using the exact time (to the nanosecond) that the person logged in as a seed to a pseudorandom number generator. With a long enough generator, you could easily have a situation where the same UID won't turn up for two different logins for ten thousand years... /unless/ the two people log in at the exact same time. A Protagonist who inspects someone else's log files and is willing to manually re-set the clock on his own Mat can take advantage of this, should he so desire.

It's a combination of the login time /and/ the mat's location on the network /and/ a checksum of the player's digitized body. Like I said, there are a lot of safeguards on this thing. The current residents of the planet don't know how to access the demiplane where the digital souls are stored, nor do they realize that such a thing even exists.

The reason I'm so particular about "no body swaps" is because it feels to me like it would very easy for something to go catastrophically wrong if you tried placing the wrong brain in the wrong body. It would be like swapping out a code library with a completely unrelated one and then expecting the program to compile properly.

Of course, this is ultimately a fantasy setting, and I could /easily/ hand-wave that particular sticking point, but... I don't wanna. :P

If the aging process continues to affect their physical body, then Minion might well be in a situation where he'll crumble to dust the moment he leaves VR. But is it possible to die of old age while /in/ VR?

...actually, if you die in VR, you reappear on the mat, right? What if your Mat has been unplugged? Do you then reappear the moment it's plugged in again?

So, our key-hiding Villain can take things a step further by killing Minion in VR to make his key even more inaccessible... and the instant the Mat is plugged in again, Minion appears on it, key and all.

Okay, if you're determined to spoof it, you'd need access to the underlying software, which nobody knows about and nobody knows how to access, and probably requires a very, very large amount of mana to interface with. Once there, you'd need to alter the UID in some way, either swapping the UIDs of two people or just copying one person's body over another person's. Then you'd need to add some sort of hand-wave program to the code to prevent catastrophic failure and allow the mind to properly interface with a completely foreign body.

Once you've done all of that, then yes, it is possible to swap bodies. Far more effort than it's worth, though.

I don't know much about biology either, but if I understand right, proteins and cell walls and etc. are largely composed of carbon chains with various functional groups, and, well...

/The average ship's anchor chain has roughly 10 000 chain links/ (I pulled that number out of my ass) /in it, so I don't think it would be a big deal if a small handful of them went missing./

See the problem? God knows what biochemical properties you'll create if you randomly remove a carbon atom from a protein. And depending on the mechanism of atom removal, you might end up with unstable charged ions or reactive free radicals in places they really should't be.

EDIT: *never mind*. abcd_z said that individual /molecules/ were teleported, not atoms. So things aren't so horrible. (This has the interesting consequence that you cannot summon materials that don't already exist somewhere in the world I think?)

Well, that depends on if the spell can break down molecules into their constituent atoms and recombine them into new molecules, or if it just places the summoned molecules together. Even if it can't break the molecules down to the atoms, the spell still has a lot of leeway in how the molecules are put together.

Sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier. Death is a slap on the wrist in VR. If your avatar loses all their health, you're just given the option to either respawn at the nearest spawn point or logout. You also drop anything you had equipped when you die, but you keep anything in your inventory that wasn't equipped. Better hope nobody else picks up your dropped loot before you can get back to it.

I thought it might be interesting to explore a world where Objective Morality is definitely real and observable, but doesn't really correspond to our own sense of morality. I'm not sure if that idea is interesting to you.

***** I'm not sure I understand what you mean when you say the premise of Sword of Good is that good/evil is essentially arbitrary. That seems pretty different from my read of the Sword of Good.

My own idea was for an idea for a campaign which is in a world that's determined by D&D rules, and as part of that a lot of stuff that would normally be left to DM discretion is formalized, but in a way that isn't quite right, in the same way that HP doesn't really reflect how actual people become injured / die. Basically one extra level of approximation, since instead of a rule system to simulate the popular conception of a fantasy world, it becomes a rule system for simulating a world designed to fit the rule system for simulate a fantasy world. So the morality system for my idea would be part of a broader thread of a lot of things being slightly off and how that can be exploited.

Specifically, the morality system I had in mind for my campaign was a weirdly simplified version. Most NPCs and monsters would start with an alignment that fits their role- corrupt cops are lawful evil, lovable rogues are chaotic good, etc.

But actual alignment shifts only happens if a not-Evil character kills a good character, or if a Good character kills a Neutral character. Shifts never happen on the Lawful vs. Chaotic axis. I think this would explore the extent to which objective morality is a meaningful concept, as distinct from just another non-moral aspect of the universe.

I think this would work less well as a story, but if I was writing a story with a similar concept I might have moral obligation be empirically confirmed to literally vary with inverse square of distance, or something else weird.

It doesn't sound like this is the sort of thing you're talking about, because it sounds like the Lawful/Chaotic axis is part of what you're interested in?

******* The Sword of Good has the titular sword there though, which seems to follow what our sense of morality would be and provide a non-arbitrary benchmark.

With the alignment system, the only extra parts would be in how your alignment interacts with various spells and objects. Detect Evil and Detect Good detect your game alignment, I was also intending to have it be important for what spells clerics could cast (cure wounds is good, cause wounds is evil, neutral clerics can use both), and it's important for the Paladins to stay Paladins. But the main weirdness comes in because nothing else can cause an alignment shift, and the morality only looks locally, so it only counts the person who actually did the deed. The alignment system doesn't consider anything else we'd consider wrong- theft, torture, etc.

Yeah, I think I got the idea from MMO PVP rules. In my conception, there would be two types of NPCs, standard-type NPCs and PC-type NPCs, who who follow the same rules PCs do and 'act' like a PC might. There would be a meta-alignment in the sense of how different PC-types reacted to and interacted with the game alignment, which would hopefully encourage exploration by the PCs. Some PC-types might hold to the artificial alignment system. Others might treat it as just another game mechanic to work around, keeping their cleric Good to get better access to healing.

Another aspect of the meta-alignment would be how PC-types interacted with and thought about the NPC types and each other. For instance, it'd be pretty common for a PC-type to be Good and "play" the hero, but to ultimately not really think of anyone outside their party members as people with moral worth. In contrast they'd also be PC-types who consider all other PC-types people, and always act extremely morally toward them, sometimes risking life and magic items to save fellows, but don't consider standard-type NPCs to be anything more than a bag of loot and XP, and their alignment would usually vary with class. And they'd be a few PC-types who consider NPCs people and genuinely try to defend them, but sometimes have had to throw out the game-alignment to do so, for instance having had to kill the Good cleric of an NPC-disregarding party.
