Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** How would a non-human race develop technology in a different way to humans? I mean - consider, for example, a race with these characteristics.

- They are mammals, have two sexes, give birth to live young
- They can fly
- They have the ability to echolocate, 'seeing' in the dark
- They have five limbs (two wings, two legs, a tail) and one head
- Their feet are fairly dextrous, approximately equivalent in capability to a human hand. However, their legs are short - they can't reach all the way to their own mouth.
- Their tail is less suited to fine manipulation, but longer, stronger and more or less serpentine. (They can reach to their own mouth with their tail, and will use this, for example, when eating).
- They are omnivorous, eating both fruit and fish
- They don't like to go down to ground level on the land (at least, not at first) because ground level includes a lot of fairly large creatures (think dinosaurs) may of which find them delicious. Ground level at sea (to go fishing) is a lot safer.
- Their home continent is fairly temperate - they have no need of fire (in fact, it attracts Dinosaur Monsters, so it's a pretty bad idea).

I've got a fairly good idea of how these aliens work (I think) but absolutely no idea how their /technology/ would work. They should be slow to invent fire (if ever), and of course the wheel is not wonderfully useful to them, but how is this going to affect their technological development? /Can/ they even develop a technological society?

*** If they do not have natural weapons, their first tool would probably be weaponry. I can imagine some of them moving further inland and dropping rocks on small animals to kill them. In the process, they might accidentally chip the rocks and make sharp points out of them which they discover can be used to cut into carcasses of larger animals which have died of other causes. Later on they might begin chipping rocks intentionally for this purpose as they begin hunting larger animals.

Since they need to stay off the ground and their young may not be ready to fly immediately, I can imagine them potentially also developing nest-building behavior. Of course, I imagine they're a bit larger and heavier than your typical nesting bird, so they would need larger branches and sticks for their nests. Since they have opposable grasping appendages, they would probably learn to use their feet to break off branches of appropriate sizes for their needs.

Nest-building behavior could also turn into raft-building behavior if sufficiently low-density wood is available when the nest-builders' territory comes within range of the coast again. This would allow them to follow ocean currents far out to sea and potentially colonize other islands and continents while still in their prehistoric phase of civilization. They could even potentially sail with the wind by grasping their raft and simply extending their wings.

Agriculture would probably start accidentally. Trees that provide both food and safety from predators would probably be very popular for them. Constantly eating fruit from these trees and spreading it around would result in that particular tree species becoming increasingly prolific. The most desirable variants of it would spread the fastest, resulting in gradual coevolution and effectively domestication into a plant that acts as both an excellent food source and home for them. Since bands of these creatures would protect their trees from various leaf-grazing herbivores, the trees could begin to adapt towards producing more fruit rather than adapting defenses against their predators. As long as these creatures are mostly breaking off branches only from trees they don't find otherwise useful, they'll also manage to reduce competition for their preferred fruit and nesting trees.

With agriculture, they'll start to become more territorial. They'll become reliant upon fruit-bearing trees and will need to aggressively chase off other animals that eat the fruit or damage the trees. Basic spears made from sharpened sticks might first be used for this purpose.

With more advanced weapons and competition over territory, social hierarchies and more sophisticated language would like to start to form. At this stage, a chieftan system would likely begin to develop, with tribes of up to 100-200 of these creatures following an elder. Division of labor would also likely start to occur, with some specializing as fruit farmers, others as spear-makers, fighters, hunters, etc.

With division of labor, trade and barter would likely begin, and written language would start in the form of written tallies to serve as a memory aid for debts owed between tribe members, and later as a record of taxes as tribal federations begin to unite into larger and larger groups. Animal bones carved with sharp rocks would likely be used as tally sticks.

It's likely that civilization will likely linger around this stage for quite some time. Weaving and rope will be developed, cloth sacks, some animals may be domesticated for food, currency in the form of shells might be used, and the bow and arrow might be developed. Gradually, the population will grow large enough that abundant food sources on the ground will be needed, and large ground predators will become less acceptable. The population will have the means to kill these predators, and will increasingly do so.

With the ground cleared of large predators, I expect that ground herbivores would be corralled into wicker-fence type enclosures for domestication and farming. Some of the plants may also be cultivated at this point if they are palatable enough; if they aren't terribly palatable to begin with, a famine will likely be the initial impetus which brings them into the diet, and gradually leads to them being domesticated into increasingly palatable variants.

For these farmers, fire will finally be a valuable tool. As a natural occurrence, they'll see lightning strikes create fires which clear out useless forests and allow them to grow more of the trees they can eat from. No large predators will be drawn to it anymore, and it will be needed for clearing away vast tracts of land as their civilization expands out into the wilderness. Forests will be burned down and the barren landscape fertilized with ash will be cultivated with domesticated trees.

With fire harnessed, it won't be too long before cooking, pottery, and metallurgy are discovered. The early beginnings of industrialization will be seen, and finally wheels will be developed as a means of transporting far more material at a time. Domesticated animals might be used as beasts of burden to pull carts and wagons laden with wood, ore, and ceramics.

From this point onward, their society will likely progress much like human society did. Their wings will allow for faster exchange of information and ideas, although it will also make it a smaller world where large empires tend to be more predominant, resulting in slower social growth, and perhaps several starts and halts to industrialization as monarchs seek to protect their status from upstart industrialists. Slowly but surely, however, industrialization will occur, leading to an information age and later space age.

**** Hmmmm. Nest-building to raft-building makes a lot of sense. You make an excellent point that clearing the ground of large predators will open up a whole lot more options to them - and this can easily be done by, for example, dropping rocks or large branches on the nests of said predators to smash their eggs.

*** The primary "starting" technologies are tools, shelter, domestication of plants and animals, clothing, and transport -- I think everything builds out from there.

Their /first/ pieces of technology should relate in some way to their "starting" living conditions; if they're fishers, then maybe something to help with that, meaning spears to stab fish, or simple fish traps made from sticks (with nets being, IMO, a later technology once people have the time and effort to spend on something like that, though it somewhat depends on what raw materials are available). Other starting technologies should be ways of defending fruit trees, planting useful plants, domesticating small, manageable animals that live up in the trees with them, or maybe figuring out some way to make living high up safer. Depending on what they have access to, they might start making "nests" as raised homes, or transition to pottery for e.g. storing materials, collecting water, and as a tool to make more tools.

A lot of what they develop to start with should be food related, even if it's just tools to help open up a specific type of fruit seed that then give them a competitive advantage in eating that fruit. (By some theories, cooking food was the big benefit of fire, more than its other uses, since it allowed easier and safer calorie intake.)

*** Here's an idea.

The transition from pictures->ideograms in humans makes sense. We see things, draw them, start using drawings to communicate. Having an alphabet, where symbols represent sounds instead of ideas, came later (unless my understanding is flawed through popular misconceptions).

These aliens are much less visual. Maybe they communicate locations to each other by mimicking an echo you would hear near a location. The echo has 'far' and 'near' qualities to it--imagine a sweep of the landscape where nearby trees and large rocks stand out, while empty spaces feel more distant. Communication about travel is going to be much more important to a species that flies, especially one flying in the dark.

These aliens could discover a way of transcribing echos into ridges on branches they can grasp with their difficult-to-view feet. Deeper cuts mean longer return time on an echo. That could be their equivalent to an ideogram. What if their original writing (other than numbers) starts with 'echograms' transcribed onto sticks as ridges and valleys? I'd give them an alphabet from that relatively early, considering their use of sound.

Writing could later become finer by embedding stones in wood, or eventually into scrolls. Eventually they would be a species whose text is more inherently like braille--braille would be their modern, ultra-condensed text, read by rolling a scroll through your claws.

Just an idea.

I'll also note that they don't need computer monitors--computer speakers playing echograms would communicate information to them about as fast as monitors communicate visual information to us.

**** I'd imagined that, since their primary means of sensing is through sound and their language is also sound-based, that their primary means of communication would be through patterns of sound that bear some resemblance to the echo returned by the real thing - in much the same way as a charcoal sketch of a buffalo bears some resemblance to a buffalo. So their primary communication would already be in the form of sort of audio pictograms, if that makes sense.

This implies that language barriers would be largely a foreign concept to them - though more distant tribes might have a fairly thick accent, mutual understanding could probably be almost always achieved (at least insofar as nouns go).

#+begin_quote
  How would a non-human race develop technology in a different way to humans?
#+end_quote

The answer is, "they might not." Or rather, while they'd be likely to make simple-ish tools of stone and wood, we don't know enough about /human/ history to conclusively say why humans developed civilization. After all, a number of isolated humans groups /still/ haven't developed civilization, and I think it's pretty clear that it would be weird to develop advanced technology before civilization, if only because civilization is itself a technology, and once all other lower-hanging technological fruits are picked, if there's still pressure to develop new technology, then civilization will tend to be next on the list. And if for some reason civilization isn't feasible, that probably has negative implications for the cross-generational transfer and therefore buildup of technology.

That being said, with your bat species specifically, they actually sound a little similar to the indigenous tribes of the pacific northwest, who were sedentary, but didn't develop agriculture, and instead exploited local resources by fishing, trapping, and in general hunter-gather-ing, and then trading their good with other tribes. The bats might build relatively stationary communities around places rich in fruit and fish even without explicit farming operations, and then exploit flight to trade with other bats who live in other locations. That would disperse fruit seeds widely, and eventually lead to a form of artificial selection for fruits most likely to be picked by the bats, and capable of being grown in many locations. The bats might notice fruit trees being more likely to grow along their trade routes, and encourage that in various ways.

Even without explicit agriculture (difficult with the bats hesitant to be on the ground) the bats could develop a number of tools surrounding that practice, likely made primarily out of tree branches. The impetus for control over these fruit-filled trading routes would lead to territory struggles, with the technology used to defend the trees repurposed for use in war. Eventually, bats figure out that stones are more lethal than branches, and that they can use fire and poisons to take down rival factions' trading routes. Or alternatively, that it's easier to carry trade goods with some sort of harness, and develop mathematics to make trading operations more efficient.

From there, the bats start looking a little like the Aztec-- no wheels, no significant pack animals, but advanced mathematics and astronomy (for navigation) in spite of that.

**** Hmmm. I see fire as more of an area denial weapon than anything else - it chases away an enemy tribe, yes, but if you're not /super/ careful it also burns down the trees and closes down the trade route.

Having their mathematics and astronomy more advanced than their tools also makes a lot of sense. They'll also have a fair grip early on on the idea that the stars are Really Far Away (because no matter how far up you fly, they don't look any closer) - though they'll still underestimate just how Really Far they are for a long time.

I think I might have to take a closer look at the Aztecs for some ideas.

*** How about this:

Initially, they're isolated on a smallish, densely forested continent and stuck living in the canopy. They eventually domesticate some fruiting vines that can grow in the tree tops and start conducting complicated agroforestry, supplemented by the incredibly dangerous job of fishing in giant dinosaur infested waters.

They aren't able to mine or quarry, and fire is mostly taboo, but over perhaps dozens of millennia, their domestication of other species becomes far more sophisticated than anything we've managed. They breed not only food crops, but plants that grow in forms useful for tools or even shelter, along with a wide variety of animal species that will instinctively perform complicated tasks like harvesting food and sending messages.

With this abundance, they're able to afford a permanent class of philosophers, artists and inventors, who start writing books and creating things like wooden clockwork calculators and eventually printing presses. They also develop weapons- like the huge, highly portable ballistas that are finally capable of reliably killing the most dangerous giant predators. Before too long, most of those are systematically driven to extinction.

Finally, they have safe access to stone and metal. The taboo against fire is slow to die, but once it does, scientific experiments in smelting progress to industrialization within a few centuries.

During that time, they also discover a larger continent on the other side of the world, filled with even more huge and dangerous predators. Even once they have aircraft and radio, exploring that continent is fraught with danger.

One other thing: they often wear a tool on their tails that's shaped like a pair of tongs with loops on each of the handles. The end of their tails are threaded through the loops, and when the flex the tip, the tongs open and close, giving them a more precise grip with that appendage.

*** Fireuse was primarily driven by the much greater metabolic availability of cooked food, and that is old enough to have been written into our digestive system in a big way. A species of fliers is going to have very high caloric requirements, so will find fire for cooking purposes extremely advantageous.

This means early settlements will be very much driven by the need to find places to build camp-fires that large land dwellers cant get at. .. But an intelligent flyer is going become the apex predator on its world, at least on land, /very early/ in its history, because there is just no way for said mega fauna to retaliate against ranged weapons used from the sky, which turns them from "threat" into "Larder on legs".

I am not sure if agriculture of the kind known on earth is ever going to be a thing, just because walking around spreading seeds on open ground is not going to be very appealing. More importantly, with a flying work-force, the natural territory (the area of land its calories comes from) of cities becomes enormous, so maybe you get a civilization based on herding and fruiting-trees equivalents. - That is you have a city, surrounded by orchards and coppice-cropping plantings, surrounded by a vast territory filled with grazing animals that are occasionally herded to the city for killing, and if on the coast, a fishing fleet.

That gives you a concentration of people, and a good percentage of them not occupied with the pursuit of getting enough food full time, and that is all you need, off to technological races.

Also, if you can have an entire civilization of flying mega-fauna-ranching cow-boys/girls, ancient cities with bottom-less catacombs-libraries of plague victims and the bone-libraries written on their remains, fisher birds abandoning vastly over-rigged ships into the sky when caught by storms (over-rigged because of species wide obsession with wind and speed. The right answer to how many sails being almost always "MORE!" as far as they are concerned. ) and so on, why would you /want/ to recapitulate human technological development exactly? Go off-track. Skip entire parts of the tech tree, vastly expand other parts.

Global population might never get very high this way but it does not really need to be, especially, since with flying knowledge ought to spread from city to city extremely well.

Downsides: Plagues. Those will spread very well also. High-grade sanitation and basic medicine is going to be a major watershed where civilization stops falling into dark ages due to mass die-offs from pestilences.

*** Outside of the broad strokes of how their society might reach the agricultural stage and beyond, I'm having a head-scratching time imagining how their physiology would impact the creation of their first tools and how technology might be adapted to those limitations.

Do their feet have 'opposable thumbs'? And any fine manipulation all happens on the distal posterior and, assuming their wings are directly on the back, I don't think they would risk lying down on their primary means of travel (wings) in order to manipulate objects like an otter lying in water. I don't know what the rest of their physiology looks like, but I assume they'd have to find positions to use both feet, or else their tool manipulation would be restricted to a combination of a single foot + tail (assuming they stand on one foot and they don't have the convenience/inconvenience of manipulating things while flying). Or their legs/posterior are far apart enough that they could sit on a branch and wrap most of their tail around for balance: then most of the manipulation/building would have to take place on trees and that might limit possibilities for creation.

How much can their tail manipulate finely? Can they throw spears using it? How much angular velocity or torque can they squeeze out of their tails? If they manage to create rafts like someone mentioned, can their tails function as an oar by holding some flat object?

Technology develops to solve problems. What kind of basic problems do they start with? Or what problems are forced on them by their environment?

I imagine, as a hunter-gather society, that a major bottleneck is how much fish they can catch. They could easily weave large nets on the treetops and have groups go netting.

I think they'd have a tough time progressing beyond basic technology and the Stone Age because:

- being averse to the ground, they wouldn't have much incentive to start agriculture, especially if their environment doesn't force problems like bitter winters or fish/fruit shortages

- they don't have an inclination to manipulate fire, which is a cornerstone of technological advancement. If winters are cold enough that they have to build specialized shelter, fire doesn't mesh well with their presumed tree-dwelling habits.

- if they do turn into an agricultural society, dinosaurs seem to be the major threat as active predators. If they have a single martial bone, they could probably easily deal with them given their aerial superiority. Then would they become the apex predator?

- Given their preferred (or only realistic) means of traveling distances (flying), could they even waddle around on their short legs mining in caves, quarries, etc.?

It would certainly be harder for them. I imagine that swinging a pickaxe would involve (for example) grasping it with their right foot and their tail, while balancing on the left foot with their left wing braced against the ground. They might need to develop 'feet' for stability on the ground, something almost like a snow shoe with a branch to grasp it at the center so that they could more easily balance on one leg while using the other for tools.

I'm going to go with "yes".

#+begin_quote
  but I assume they'd have to find positions to use both feet,
#+end_quote

I was thinking that if they wrap their tail around a branch, they can hang upside-down and have free use of both feet. A platform made of woven tree branches attached to a rope made from a vine and then hooked over the same branch can then provide them with a handy 'tabletop' surface in easy reach, should this prove necessary.

#+begin_quote
  How much can their tail manipulate finely?
#+end_quote

Not nearly as well as their feet.

#+begin_quote
  Can they throw spears using it?
#+end_quote

Given that a spear can be thrown using a stick with a ridge at one end, I'm pretty sure that they can manage to duplicate the feat.

#+begin_quote
  How much angular velocity or torque can they squeeze out of their tails?
#+end_quote

I'd say... their species average would be more torque that an unaided average human can produce, but less than twice what an unaided average human can produce.

#+begin_quote
  If they manage to create rafts like someone mentioned, can their tails function as an oar by holding some flat object?
#+end_quote

Yeah, this makes sense to me.

#+begin_quote
  I think they'd have a tough time progressing beyond basic technology and the Stone Age
#+end_quote

Yeah, I have similar suspicions.

#+begin_quote
  they wouldn't have much incentive to start agriculture, especially if their environment doesn't force problems like bitter winters or fish/fruit shortages
#+end_quote

Eventually, their population will expand to the point of causing food shortages.

#+begin_quote
  If they have a single martial bone, they could probably easily deal with them given their aerial superiority. Then would they become the apex predator?
#+end_quote

Eventually, yes, they could defeat everything that tries to predate on them. Dropping rocks on nests leads to a very skimpy next generation...

#+begin_quote
  could they even waddle around on their short legs mining in caves, quarries, etc.?
#+end_quote

An excellent question. Mining /would/ be tricky - though they probably could accomplish it if they knew what could be done with metals.

*** How big are they? (I guess a little smaller than humans)

I assume trees are a thing.

How I think their ancestors lived:

- If fruits don't grow the whole year, they will travel between fishing grounds and fruit trees. If they can live of one food source they will.

- They will hunt/fish in the night, cause echolocation. [[http://animals.mom.me/nocturnal-animals-only-come-out-night-3324.html][(Because of predators, prey, competition or heat)]] Or maybe the water is to muddy to see with eyes.

- They will prefer to live in cliff sides or on trees.

- there should be a high varienty of similar races (species) on islands. Since storms can exile groups of birds to them. (Maybe they all died out later. Like neanderthals)

- I fear all agriculture will only be to protect good trees. Trees need too long to grow. At least for the start. They will also destroy trees that have no fruits.

Their first technologies will help in survival, hunting and food preparation. Like stone knives and sharp stones they drop. They will also build barricades against climbing predators. Or put sharp stones in the bark of trees.

They will make relative early flying stuff. Some flying cart, so they can move food and tools more easily. They will need to tow it.

No fire will prevent them from many technologies. At least until they start killing (and eating dinosaur monsters.) After they killed all predators, they will need a new reason to still keep wings. Maybe they have sex in the air.

After that they will get hot air ballons and metal. And their main focus will be lightweight materials. So chemistry. first from tree saps and oil

Oh yeah, don't forget most birds use their beaks as tools, so maybe they use their mouths too.

And smashing predators egg, will be hard, if the predators dig caves.

Also flying predators could be tough.

  ...how do you mean?
#+end_quote

While human migration was mostly landbased and so there were never really isolated populations cause they could just follow their footsteps back (or more like the populations left back on the way)

Birds can be driven of course out to the sea. Most would die. Some would find an isolated island. And die slowly or because of old age. And rarely their would be a group of birds stranded on one island. Or only a female with fertilized eggs. And that female could be an albino. And some million years later, you have a new race of the same species of birds, that are all white and they don't need echolocation or aren't night active because they lived on an island without predators. They would have adapted in other ways to the island, to be fit to live there. Like different teeth.

So anyhow birds are more likely to land on isolated islands. And so there would be more isolated populations. And evolution would tell us, that means, that population would change over time to a different race and after that to a different species. (Evolution happens 'faster' in smaller population and also if there is a higher selection rate aka death.)

Faster means here in less generations. If all non-blue birds die, the next generation will have only blue parents and will likely have a higher percentage of blue birds. and so on.

You could just ignore this. Or they split off not long ago (10000 years is not long.) But I think, that could make an interesting story and explain different variants. Like some who can dive. Or others that are smaller/bigger. Or better/no echolocation. Or monstrous ones, that come, when you look into the sun. (Like our buggyman or monster under the bed.)

I thought they could migrate to the same trees every year. And fight with each other for their old trees. And barricades could prevent climbing animals of eating the fruits too. And their children could be too young to fly. And maybe one family has one tree and eats its fruits the whole year around. And if they get more people, some would leave and look for their own tree.

Nets can surely be weaved with help of the mouth, without echolocation. (They do still have eyes?) And I do not see a reason, why echolocation should be impossible with beaks. (You could echolocate with snipping your fingers as sound source.) But I assumed they have mouths like bats.

About agriculture. They could develop hybridisation. They would take a tree and switch it with some other plant branch. Like a bush with berries. [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2437247/250-varieties-apple-tree--thanks-bit-hard-grafting-years.html]]

If they get somewhere light enough materials they could develop handgliders.

I really think you should rethink the predators as reason for flight/nightactive. Cause if you really want them to become inteligent, they would exterminate every predator. And there would be no reason for them to still be active in the night or fly. Of course, the predators could just be one reason of many for that.

Of course there were isolated populations. Why do you think we have racism today?

Alright, humans haven't really developed much in the way of independent traits - mostly just skin pigmentation - but still.

Still, that only reinforces your point - yes, different tribes is a thing that can happen, given isolated populations. I'm just not sure that an intelligent, flying species can have much in the way of isolated populations - their wings should give them mobility along the lines of humans with boats (at least the simple, stay-in-sight-of-shore type of boat) and their ability to navigate by the stars (which they should pick up fairly quickly) should allow them to figure out which way to go back to the mainland... though they might need a while to rest and recuperate after the storm a bit, first.

I think a lot of this would depend on the period of history that they're in. In their hunter-gatherer days, a singe tree won't provide enough (year-round) for a tribe - they'll form into larger groupings that families, I think - so perhaps a tribe will lay claim to an area, and chase off anyone else who intrudes on that area.

The concept of individual property (as opposed to tribal property) probably won't be a thing until they've developed at least rudimentary agriculture...

** I am making a world (for a video game) with chemistry based on the four classical elements and elementals in an approximately Renaissance setting. I've thought of a few interesting second order effects of this new chemistry, but I would like advice for more.

- The four elements form molecules. Bond strength and molecule shape detrmine properties. Mud is a particularly weak bond between earth and water, it is barely even counted as a distinct molecule. Alcohol, however, forms from strong bonds between water and fire, bonds that must be catalyzed with wheat/potatoes/etc. and careful brewing.
- Aether is the element of life. It is found in extremely small quantities in nearly everything. Concentrate it with energy, such as light, and it forms lichen and plant life from surrounding materials (seeds act as a template), concentrate the aether further, and animals can exist, concentrate even further and elementals can exist. Elementals are formed by adding concentrated aether to an extremely pure sample of element (or molecule). Once the elemental is formed, it can draw more of its element to itself in relation to how much aether is present.\\

  - Knock-on effects:

    - IDEA: aether remembers what it has been a part of

      - reincarnation, spiritualism
      - poisons
      - story: themes of identity
      - story: Eldritch aether elemental would be a zeitgeist god of all of life's remembered experiences. Anima mundi.\\

    - Elementals forming causes desert by depleting the aether available for plant life. -> Destroyed or dissipated elementals cause a bust of plant and animal life shortly after destruction.
    - Elementals are dangerous to life because they can suck up the aether a person needs to live (if no other aether is present. Animals hold on to their aether tightly.)
    - Areas with lots of light + heat energy form deserts as aether concentrates into elementals
    - Rain forests also have light + heat, but elementals from open sea blow in and are then killed by local life to harvest the aether.

      - magic-eating plants
      - reason for elementals to have some preservation instinct (would need some way to evolve)
      - Dead animals cause a burst of plant life shortly after death

    - Aether is only loosely correlated with cognitive function. Humans are smarter than other animals and elementals because they have more complex (brain) structures that function on aether alchemical reactions.

      - It requires eldritch amounts of aether to compare to human minds operating on less than a wisp, but eldritch elementals are not limited by human brain architecture.
      - Levels of elemental: wisps = basically mindless, nymphs = rodent intelligence, sprite = dog intelligence, eldritch = human or beyond.

    - An aether elemental is almost impossible to create--especially with the (lack of) technology in the world. It requires ridiculously concentrated aether in an absolute vacuum for it to draw in more aether instead of more of whatever element first touches the nascent elemental. And as soon as an aether elemental would start accumulating more aether, it would grow until it touches the boundaries of the vacuum and then explode into elementals of whatever it touches. -> need absolute vacuum + concentrated aether in absolute desert.

  - Elementals expending energy makes them lose size, aether, element.
  - Elementals gradually grow if enough element, aether, energy is present

*** Virtual elementals--small elementals form wherever aether is present, and also evaporate instantly. Only an elemental of sufficient size can pull aether from the surroundings and be stable. Maybe the formation of elementals in this world is like the formation of raindrops in ours, a balance that doesn't favor growth unless the starting point is large enough.

Fire is a unique element in one way or another. It seems to violate conservation of mass, assuming it is made of matter but also disappears like fire in our world. Maybe make a flame 'diatomic fire', and make 'elemental fire' the smallest of the four elements. This would be for the justification that without energy a flame degrades into elemental fire and diffuses. Alcohol forms in water with elemental fire that naturally pervades all matter.

Maybe valuable resources in this setting are 'elemental ores'--ores that are molecularly diverse enough to discourage the formation of elementals (and are thus stable) but are otherwise primarily composed of one element. I'm imagining they look like glass.

Possible existential threat: hungry aether elementals formed from supernova.

Perhaps ghosts or undead form when a living thing suddenly dies in a desert for any reason that isn't starvation or being eaten by an elemental.

How about elemental fusion?

- The universe is mostly elemental fire

- Elemental fire can fuse with itself to elemental air while releasing some aether, but only in extreme pressure

- Elemental air can fuse with more elemental fire (or elemental air, your choice) to make elemental water and earth, while absorbing some aether, at more extreme pressure.

With these rules, you get:

- Stars made of mostly fire

- A source of aether to drive life

- Supernova still occur (when stars become dense enough from cooling) and heavier elements still come from supernovae

Admittedly, I'm cheating by blatantly stealing our universe's rules. To make it more thematic, make stars full of warring elementals, and make the star's volume proportionate to how much they fight. Cooling stars go nova when there is too little aether to power fighting air and fire elementals.

These rules would be hard to work into a story, but they are fun to think about.

*** How about aether being the element that acts like a universal bonding force, where normally each element can only bond with itself? with aether being a structural requirement for advanced life forms, it makes sense that the simpler forms of life, only using two of the elements, would need less, while the advanced 4 element life would need an exponentially larger amount. As a result, "thinkyness" could be an essential part of all elements, and Elementals are just pure atomic chains/crystals of that element. As a bonus it lets you apply personalities to characters who have different elemental leanings, something like the classical four humors setup.

So ambient aether is more like bacteria and viruses permiating everything, and not used as a binding force in definitively dead, non-thinking things like rocks.

Classical four humors are an excellent idea.
