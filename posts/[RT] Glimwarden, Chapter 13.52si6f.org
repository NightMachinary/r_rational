** I made some Glimwarden fanart while waiting in between chapters.

[[http://i.imgur.com/Vyps3ZW.jpg][Hope I got the details right.]]

And with [[http://i.imgur.com/IvLerR1.jpg][title text.]]

I am not sure what I visualised in my head is actually how it is supposed to be what is described in the story. All the clothes are early 1900's-ish because the conversation about horses being replaced by tractors was something that happened in IRL history.

**** If what I imagined is close to what you imagined, then you have some effective storytelling. But I think my lantern building is probably not right. Does it have panes all the way around like a lighthouse?

I will do some more art by the time the next chapter is out. The hype is real.

***** I think [[https://quadralectics.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/177a.jpg][this]] is close to what I picture, but with thicker gray bricks and a simpler style and a little taller, with a few small windows to let in light for the workers and a bright, reassuring light on top. The outer lanterns have statues on top of them, carved from different types of stone (sometimes via the help of a glimwarden). In my mind they're much like light houses, partly because I love light houses, but in terms of practicality they should probably be more squat with the upper portion being more ornamental and holding only the light and the alarm system.

**** I based the drawing on my initial impression of the characters after the first read-through. The details sometimes don't match after a closer second reading, but that first Sander chapter was really great and memorable to me. I think it was the bollards. I've never seen bollards in fantasy before.

**** It might just be you. I wanted to draw them not only as I saw them, but also incorporate something of how in-universe characters see them. Melanie is the curmudgeonly old man in the body of a teenage girl, Sander is the guy who does stupid heroic things, Philip is the cool and calm guy who looks heroic.

I cringed a bit when Philip told his mother he liked his father more and made her cry. It might be obnoxious, but no one in Light's Hollow knows about it, and I wanted to draw Philip in the way they know him, and how he wants them to see him.

** Apologies for the delay. I've been spinning my wheels while writing, which is never a pleasant feeling. I wouldn't quite call it writer's block, as it's more borne of indecision and second guessing than anything else. (I'm still hoping to wrap up the first book by the beginning of November so that I can take a break for NaNo without having to come back to a bunch of open threads.)

**** Not really a series, just logical divisions of the serial. In 5-6 chapters there will be a point where I can definitively say "this is the end of this first section". The current plan is for between 3-5 "books", with the story being maybe half or two thirds of the way through the first book. (Assuming that I can hit my deadlines, there will be break between Book I and Book II during November, since I'll be working on finishing /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ then.)

******* I use a program called Scrivener for writing. It's got a compile function that turns the text into an epub, PDF, mobi, etc. During National Novel Writing Month, when I finish my ~1,667 words for the day, I just click "Compile" and target HTML, then transfer the file over to my site. So the CSS and HTML are all auto-generated, with just a few tweaks done via a .bat script between generation and posting. (It's basically the only way that I can manage the pace NaNo requires and still be posting it online every day.)

** It's funny, Melanie was the character I liked the least when the story started, now she's my favourite. Both because she grew on me and because I'm starting to dislike Philip and Sander, for different reasons.

By the way, I take back everything nice I said about Philip. Divide and conquer? Really? You're an asshole.

Otherwise, I'm glad this story is starting to tackle the "Immigrants with nowhere to go need to integrate among people with fundamentally different beliefs" issue. It's a currently relevant, complicated, super important issue and I really look forward to see alexanderwales' take on it.

I don't so much mean I can't root for him in that rooting for him feels bad or is morally wrong, but rather I just don't have the emotional investment. Instead it feels like watching something mildly gross like someone washing toilets.

I also find it difficult to keep who I want to win in fiction and real life separate the more difficult the more human they are, and while he is a fairly evil human he is very human. I can read stories where I am hoping the protagonist loses as long as the author isn't treating them too stupidly but if I don't care who wins I can't.

*** Yeah, this chapter has Philip doing or seriously considering some really unsavory stuff, including:

- Hiding the destruction of another town from the authorities. Reporting it might have prevented the crisis at Healer's Lantern or at least helped catch the perpetrator.

- Hiding the imminent arrival of refugees from the authorities.

- Attributing a highly valuable contract (feeding the refugees until they're housed) to the friend of his political ally, without having the official authority to make that decision.

- Planning to encourage and take advantage of the upcoming hostility between Light's Hollow and the refugees.

- Generally being a dick to his father by taking other his duties.

There's nothing outright evil in there, but it's really not something you want to see from people with political power.

How that? You think just because the council would have known that a town called Langust was destroyed somehow and that an unknown number refugees might be on the way to Light's Hope they would have somehow increased the sentries around Healer's Lantern?

He hasn't planned anything like that yet. He just hasn't excluded future plans of such kind as a possibility.
