Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Q-type mental disorder is chiefly characterized by a complete replacement of all previous values. Instead, the infected will dedicate their will entirely toward killing as many people as possible. They will eat, but only because survival is instrumental toward killing. They will socialize, but have no compulsion to do so outside of its instrumental value in killing more people. They are not like you or I, where they might get distracted by other pursuits or bored of what they are doing, and they can be thought of as effectively having a limitless supply of willpower, all put toward their goal of killing as many people as possible.

Now, I like this idea, but the problem is that if I were Q-type, my actions would actually look pretty uninteresting to an outside observer; I would become a model citizen, put my head down, and study/schmooze like mad until I worked my way into a career where I could have an extraordinarily high impact, like disease research, asteroid mining, or nuclear testing/control/safety. That's horrific in the abstract sense but it's not very visceral and it's not a terribly good springboard for the type of story I would want to tell.

I'm not sure what the best hack is to my Q-type definition though. Ideally the effect leads competence porn serial killers who put great effort into not getting caught and who don't care about gathering trophies, taking credit, or selecting particular targets (and in fact will shun any consistent MO, because that would make them easier to catch). Ideally it's something that can be summed up in a pithy line of dialogue and not "the causal distance between the killer and victim is less than thirty minutes from action to effect", which does not flow off the tongue.

Secondarily, I'm not a hundred percent sure what the MO would actually look like, if a serial killer was attempting to kill as many people as possible before their own capture/death. Pick targets that are unlikely to be missed, move around a lot, cover your tracks ... I'm not sure that I can model it that well, so any help would be appreciated.

I think the problem with such value-hijacking things is that it's assumed anyone infected by those would become a perfect actor. They won't.

Social interactions are full of unconscious cues, microexpressions and body language subtleties that won't be present in such a being. They would seem unsettling to ordinary people, firmly occupying Uncanny Valley.

Moreover, we draw from our own desires and emotions when interacting with other human beings, use them to empathize, understand, and indeed /model/ people. Having a deviant mind would lead to flawed intuitive models of others. Sociopaths already have a hard time dealing with it, and they merely lack empathy; what that implies about a being completely devoid of emotional makeup, but having neither an increased intelligece to create better models, nor a special acting ability to make up for it (pun honestly not intended)?

I'm reasonably confident they would seem autistic to the outside world, idiot-savant types, excelling in whatever field they choose to pursue but notorioulsy bad with people. They would probably occassionally slip into modeling others as bloodlusted as well, perhaps even doing so /out loud/. I'm doubtful of their ability to fool anyone for extended periods of time.

**** This is my reaction too. A Q-Type does not, by my read, immediately become a Moriarty-level Criminal Master Mind. Their VALUES shift, but not their intelligence, skills, impulse control, etc. If they gain only one goal, and that goal is killing as many people as possible, then the less intelligent/patient/skilled ones will get in their car and drive through a crowded sidewalk, while the opposite will try to work their way into a nuclear power plant and coordinate a series of critical system failures.

Unless you do mean that they gain willpower and insight and acting skills and so on, [[/u/alexanderwales]]? It's fine if they are able to commit ALL of their willpower to that goal without getting distracted by vices or boredom or whatever, but that's different from gaining an inhuman focus for maximizing the goal, in my view. Like, if the average person's goals all got deleted except for "eat cookies," they would not become super rich so they could eat a limitless amount of cookies. They would operate within their means to maximize cookie eating at the expense of all else, but if they HAVE no means, like they don't have a job or savings or can't think of a plan to get more money, they might just start stealing cookies.

No, the way I understood it, their impulse control gets rewritten by "kill as many people as possible", as does their impatience and their emotions.

That won't be enough to avoid /mistakes/, though. They won't become perfectly rational. Less methodical and critical ones would reach to some cached "how would I kill all these people" thought, and decide that the best way to do it is by driving a car through a crowded sidewalk --- /not/ because they're impatient, but because they would honestly think it's the best way. Ones previously less inclined to take whatever they do seriously won't take their new goal seriously as well, would go about it incompetently. More methodical ones would go for the long-game.

Since they're used to put themselves into other people's place to predict them, they would try to continue doing that. Only later would they realize it's not working properly anymore, try to readjust. Maybe their old mental models of close friends are still workable, maybe not; their ability to socialize would be severly impaired in any case.

"Infinite willpower" would let them put indefinite amounts of time into working on fixing their disabilities, learning to act, --- /if/ they think of it, that is. But they would still occasionally make mistakes, it would still be hard for them to model large groups of people, or get complicated social interactions right, simply because they no longer have software for that.

Their mistakes won't always be internal, either, they would occasionally try to make small talk about how they want to kill everyone --- they're not used to live surrounded by enemies, after all, they may forget about their orthogonal values, get distracted.

Living would be /really/ complicated for them.

***** I mostly agree, except impulse control is the one benefit that they get, mostly because all other values get stripped from them and there's no time preference to "kill people" except for that imposed by uncertainty (i.e. if I don't kill anyone this week, then maybe I'll randomly die of a stroke and not /ever/ get to kill anyone). Everything else /should/ flow from that, assuming that they think of it (which not all of them will). They don't gain acting skills, but /if/ they've decided that getting captured is a risk, they will try their best to not get captured, and part of a likely strategy for that is learning how to lie.

How powerful "infinite willpower" is probably depends on what you believe about willpower in general. I generally think that it's very powerful and consider a lot of rationalist techniques to be ways of circumventing the need to expend willpower, or to reorder time preference, or otherwise hack values.

(I am naturally less interested in those people who would be stupid about it; there's plenty of true crime stories out there about killers who were sloppy and irrational about it. For the purposes of the story this idea is currently embedded within, they're all probably drawn from the equivalent of SEAL teams, which means a certain level of intelligence and skills would be built-in. Not sure that I'm going to leave this idea in that story though.)

Makes sense, I was thinking that depending on how the story is set up, the world might know about the Q-Types in the first place because of these less-effective ones, and mistakenly believe that it just turns people into near-mindless killing machines until the first "sleeper" Q-Type sets homemade bombs off all over the city or poisons its water supply.

*** Some potential hacks:

- Add a personal experience component. "A Q-type wants to watch as many people die by their own hand as possible". (You could fudge the meaning of "watch" a bit.)

- Make it serial: "A Q-type has a target, and wants to kill that target more than anything. Once that target is dead, they want to select a new target more than anything. They can't change targets."

- Make each kill less important. Maybe the worst thing in the world for a Q-type is if they fail to kill /anybody at all/. So they value 10 kills way less than 1 kill, 100 kills way less than 10 kills, etc.

I think the third hack is my favorite. You would probably end up with Q-types who are hyper-competent leaders in their plausibly-world-ending fields, and then in their free time they murder people. (Also, these murders could increase in scale as the story goes on. Once the Q-type has killed 10 people, it sets its eyes on 100, then 1000, etc. etc., all while pursuing its dream of releasing a genetically-engineered superbug that ends all life on earth. It's a free dramatic arc, and an excuse to have prominent and well-respected experts murder people at night. You could also maybe have a side story where the government secretly tolerates known Q-types because they're so productive in their fields, and only kills them off when their nighttime escapades get out of hand. There's a lot of fun meat on that bone.)

*** Serial killing is ineffective if you want to maximize death. Instead of killing individuals, consider spreading lethal disease or poison working at fast food. Or contaminating a glove with something really nasty and going around turning doorknobs. Contaminate frequently used bathrooms: almost none even have cameras! If the Q-type is careful and meticulous, there's very little chance of them getting caught.

Maybe good places to go for killing people are third world countries, in the hopes that law enforcement is more ineffective there, medical care is worse, people are more vulnerable to disease, vaccinations aren't as widespread.

Intelligent people can research and synthesize diseases to operate on a larger scale.

Even if you're not very smart, well, you have limitless willpower, and that counts for a lot lot lot, so hitting the books is a good plan, learning about rationality and planning skills, and putting off murder until you're clever enough to evade getting caught.

People who believe abortion is murder can work on that.

The natural Schelling point would be starting either war advocacy or extremist environmentalist blogs and Q-types can find each other that way, share ideas, and work together. If Q-types are well-known, the natural Schelling point is anti-Q-type blogs. Since they have limitless willpower, they're much more likely to think about where the point is for five minutes and come to that conclusion.

Once a community is formed, a standard FAQ and things will likely be created: "So you're one of us: here's a catalog of the best ways you can kill people without getting caught" and "here's how to do encryption and op. security" and "kik me if you have any questions, newbies, I'd be happy to help ;)"

This would be a really cool setting to explore online, just because of how surreally creepy it could be and how fun internet settings are when done well. Maybe competition with confirmed kill counts.

This would be an interesting way for an apocalypse to happen. (Albeit really edgy.)

It's interesting that Q-types have infinite willpower and seemingly negligibly low time preference (behaving as a model citizen until reaching a good opportunity), but they don't just wait for humans to, like, die on their own.

If Q-types value killing people and not /extinction/, they might want to help create more humans. That could be through fighting against abortion, working to create a superintelligence that will maximize humans, under the premise that they will all inevitably die through entropy.

I'm imagining the universe tiled with constantly dying and reincarnating humans.

*** To depart from all these abstract comments, here's some concrete examples:

- Hyatt regency walkway collapse killed a lot of people as the result of a very simple engineering error that was initiated by the contractor. So have Q types working in construction roles and sabotaging the job in small but serious ways: I assume they're patient so they can wait 5-10 years for the collapse to happen.

- Basically look at any bridge or building collapse and someone screwed up to make it possible (e.g. a bridge collapsed in the 1800s because they just built it twice the size not realising that the weight scaled up by a cube but the strength only scaled up by a square) - Q-type's goal is to /be that guy/. With modern technology and standards either do it in the third world (engineers without borders is a thing: the old adage goes a doctor can kill one person at a time and an engineer can kill thousands), or be one of the construction workers.

- Another thing: landfill collapses in places like India and Brazil can kill thousands of people and are easily preventable which means easily causeable. Design a bad landfill located somewhere dangerous and then wait a few decades for it to collapse.

Small-scale, some murderers who got away with shit:

- probably the murderer who comes closest to the Q-Type modality is Israel Keyes, who killed an unknown number of people (some think he was all talk and only killed 3 since he died by suicide and didn't confess to any more than that; others think it could be dozens based on his boasting). He did things like hiding "murder kits" consisting of weapons, cash, duct tape, etc around the US and then coming back years later to use them in murders. One of his documented murders consisted of him flying into one city, hiring a car, and driving a long, long distance to a completely different city to murder a couple, and then driving all the way back. Definitely a guy to research.

- The Original Night Stalker is known by many names and committed a great deal of rapes and eventually murders in California in the 70s, and they were only linked together in the 90s when DNA was able to link them. He did things like sneaking into peoples' houses and stashing equipment to commit murders with, cutting phone lines, etc. As a rapist he targeted attractive women and their husbands, so that's not ideal Q-Type, but he did all sorts of sadistic stuff like phoning victims up 20 years later even though they'd moved house (again, probably not a Q Type trait, but still pretty creepy)

- Long Island Serial Killer is a currently "active" SK who is murdering prostitutes, has been for a long time, and seems to get away with it.

True crime's an interest of mine, and I work as a civil engineer, so hopefully some of these examples will spark something in you.

**** I'm a fan of true crime as well (though mostly just the extreme cases). Mostly I find it a little shocking how far the most successful serial killers got without having terribly stable brains. Ted Bundy got away with it for a long time and was only caught because he got really, really brazen. I think that would be a lot harder in our current era of ubiquitous surveillance, but still doable. A lot of psychopathy comes with a lack of impulse control, so the Q-type disorder would turn that on its head.

Engineers or contractors intentionally setting up disasters-in-waiting is a neat story idea, but different from the directions that I'd naturally want to go it. And I would also probably want to change the story so that they were doing it for a noble or at least morally ambiguous reason, like because they were trying to sabotage a violent regime or something.

*** If Q-types knew who each other were and were willing to cooperate on projects, the obvious path to maximum death is for them to get placed at every link in the chain which causes global thermonuclear warfare. Infinite willpower means that they would be incredibly likely to succeed, especially if they can get all of their non-Q-type rivals killed in plausible accidents by other Q-types.

You could change the definition by saying the Q-type maximizes the number of people who they personally see die. This slightly increases the risk of capture (which is actually a good thing for worldbuilding, as it means it is /possible/ for normals to break into the conspiracy), but also gives them far more available avenues. They could be battlefield commanders who send their own men on suicidal charges or nurses at understaffed hospices. They could undetectably trigger industrial accidents, cause open-pit mines to flood, bomb large sporting events, or even work for the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders.

Now that I think of it, they could hack hospital security systems to view death from afar as well. There's lots of options if Q-types don't have to personally cause the deaths.

*** Well for one thing it seems likely they would put significant effort into infecting other since that may effectively double the number of people they could kill (or increase it exponentially if the new infected also infects others).

Anyway I agree that if there were relatively few infected they wouldn't actually do serial killing instead messing things up on far larger scale which will probably indirectly kill thousands, however even if there was a larger number they would likely deliberately lay low so as to not draw attention to their existence and will likely coordinate to the degree that will be safe and if caught commit suicide. Mass death could be done by starting wars, or starting and maintaining cold wars on the chance they might be able to kill billions, developing bioweapons, etc.\\
Still it's not going to be flashy and unless the hero's get very lucky they will probably be successful in wiping out most if not all of humanity without anyone even knowing of their existence.

Instead of being 100% dedicated to killing, they're reversed altruists. Over time, the Q-types put more and more weight on their anti-altruism goal.

You can still have a handful of competence-porn serial killers in the same what that the real world could have a handful of competence-porn EA people. Those people would be terrifying legends, but rare.

The bulk of the Q-types would approach hurting people in the same messy, not-quite-optimal way that a community-minded person might go about helping.

Their emotions would have the same availability-bias and scope-insensitivity problems that the rest of us have, just towards reversed emotions.

To get specifics, I'd go down the list of non-EA charities and ask, "How is this project generating Warm Fuzzies?" Then reverse that payoff for your Q-Types.

*** One option for building tension might be that Q-types /have/ to kill at least one person every time interval or something bad happens to them. Maybe they die, or maybe they are "cured" (which means fewer people die and is therefore unacceptable).

They still want to kill as many people as possible, though. So you'd have people trying to work their way into high positions while also killing someone every week/month/39.7 days.

In a story where the protagonist is trying to stop these people, there would be a build up in suspense as they are using the killings to try and track the Q before they can set off a disaster.

If not killing results in a loss in the mental illness, there also might be a moral/emotional component as to whether the protag wants to kill the Q or capture and cure them.

Edit: Oh, and the Q has to kill the person themselves at close range. This would prevent someone setting up minor "disasters" to kill a few people every month, like burying poisoned needles in a playground or spreading a disease at a nursing home.

*** If you're trying to create something similar to serial killers, take inspiration from serial killers. They don't intrinsically value death, they just gain pleasure from arbitrarily killing people and want to pursue that pleasure. All you have to do is attach similar arbitrary conditions onto Q-Types.

I'd recommend basing it specifically on the serial killer from the Sherlock episode /The Lying Detective/. All he wanted to do was "make people into things", so didn't really care how the person died as long as he got to personally watch the light go out behind their eyes as he murdered them.

The key to creating these kinds of antagonists is to make them very individualistic. They don't want to just know people died because of their actions, they want to commit first-degree murder. They don't care about sheer numbers, just whether they get the personal satisfaction they desire.

That seems like a /really/ long-term, complex, fundamentally /unsure/ plan. What if the government just starts testing people for being Q-type before giving them the nuclear codes? Then the whole plan goes up in flames. This seems like relying on a lot more than three things to happen, and the real limit is two, so you should probably just drug someone's drink with cyanide in a bar every so often. Maybe find some junkies and deliberately induce overdoses. It'll really help if you take your victims from a stratum of society people already deride.

Maybe try knifing minorities in under-policed communities? If it counts, you could engage in some stochastic terrorism. That's really easy nowadays.

After all, it's the expected integral of people killed over time that matters, but you're usually very uncertain and not very able to control your exact life-trajectory, so you need /some/ episodes of murder to make up for the uncertainty about your Grand Plan.

** Because my imagination is nothing if not overly ambitious, I have decided my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6d2pfy/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dhzlbgd][kitchen sink superhero setting]] would be incomplete without ripping-off Dragon Ball. Clearly, I have gone mad and lost all sense of good judgement, so in an effort to preserve my well-being I have decided not to suffer from my insanity but rather to enjoy every minute of it!

The premier superhero league in the world is The Ideal, originally established as a parent organization to the various teams and social clubs of good samaritans before being declared a nation in its own right by an international treaty. Heroes have dual citizenship and their secret bases are legally considered embassies, though there's still a bureaucracy to hold them accountable.

However, China didn't want local heroes to be outside the control of its government and couldn't make it's own metahumans without violating the same international treaty, so they hired an expy of Bulma to find people with powers and manipulate them into protecting the state from magic and villains without joining The Ideal.

Definitely-not-Bulma is the highly independent daughter of definitely-not-Doctor Doom who made this deal because she wanted to study magic in China without interference...and because she wasn't very emotionally intelligent due to her upbringing and couldn't make any friends. Even in this version she still originally wanted to conjure a romantic partner.

She ended up convincing the Chinese government to not crack down on the secret societies of magic users in the country by using her wealth to become a major political figure in them who discouraged criminal activity. The rowdy metahumans also tended to get beaten up in the underground tournaments she sponsored.

I don't imagine keeping the state happy would be hard, she just had to point the demigods who trusted her in the direction of supervillains and mystical artifacts that needed protecting. However, I don't think there's a way to rationalize them resurrecting people the villains killed without The Ideal demanding that power be used for a more global benefit.

The Ideal can demand what they like. Officially, this power doesn't exist; and any claims that person X died and was resurrected are clearly false because he is clearly still alive. Maybe there was a clone, or a lookalike, a stunt double... or perhaps he only /thought/ he died (China explicitly denies the existence of memory implantation technology as well, by the way; in fact, they spend more time denying memory implantation technology than they do paying attention to the persistent rumours of resurrection technology).

**** I don't mean when the heroes come back to life, I'm referring to when the Z Fighters resurrected people en masse. Nappa and Vegeta blew up a whole city and a news crew who all got wished back to life months later. DC comics also pulled this kind of thing with Coast City, but that was an event many heroes were involved in so they understood how it happened and knew it wasn't repeatable.

The Ideal would be especially suspicious of people coming back to life since one of their members is Charon, the ferryman to the afterlife. This seems like the sort of thing he'd notice and the heroes would trust him on. China can prove /they/ don't have any resurrection technology or magic, but if the Ideal finds out who does they are going to ask for it from people who want to undo tragic deaths.

If I'm going to include this, and I'm still crazy enough to want to, I need to change how or why the Z Fighters resurrected people. There has to be a reason the Ideal or the Z Fighters would be unwilling or unable to transfer possession of the power. There also has to be some reason the Z Fighters don't go global, otherwise they would've undone the damage caused by wars or mundane terrorist attacks.

The reason for reimagining the Z Fighters as a deniable Chinese team is so they are largely separate from the rest of the setting. They've still gone on international adventures and met other heroes, but are fundamentally committed to protecting their homeland even when they don't think they're working for the government. They don't want to be part of a group that meddles in affairs unrelated to that.

Plenty of heroes have their own small corners of their world where they spend most of their time and are largely left to themselves, but can all contact each other at any time and regularly meet up. The Z Fighters would help with global threats, but I don't want them to be easily reachable or have close relationships with other heroes. Otherwise, Goku and The Ideal would constantly ask each other for help.

***** I... don't actually know a thing about Dragon Ball. But, if it was months later, and you're dealing with an authoritarian government, then there are other options as well.

Consider; what if the town was never resurrected? Instead, one of these Chinese heroes had... a lot of guilt over the destruction of the town. A /lot/ of guilt. Severe mental trauma kind of guilt. And, after therapy proved useless, said authoritarian government spent a month or two looking for lookalikes (they didn't have to be exact, this hero hardly even knew anyone in the town anyway), rebuilding the place, legally changing all the new people's identities to the old people's identities, and then more or less telling this hero "Look, they're back, now can you stop moping around and get back to work?"

It's... a bit of a dark take on the resurrection...

--------------

Second option - the attack that 'killed' the city wasn't a lethal event. It was a 'throw-the-city-into-the-future' time travel event

--------------

Third option; some villain (or some hero?) was on the scene in time and managed to (somehow) 'trap the souls' of the dead, preventing them from crossing into the afterlife and holding them still. Then several months for the cloned bodies to grow, and they get restored... Charon would know that something was fishy from the time of the original attack, of course. Then you have a form of resurrection that can only be used if the right guy is /right there/ at the time of the original death.

****** I think I can work with the last one. I already planned for the Celestial Federation to be full of martial arts demigods, but it also features a bureaucratic spirit world similar to Ancient Chinese mythology, which I conceived long before deciding to steal the Z Fighters for my own setting.

It combines magic with transhumanist technology to assimilate ghosts into a digital afterlife, so villains with pieces of that tech could come to Earth intending to build their own power by snatching souls. There'd actually be a reason for so many Dragon Ball villains to just want to kill people.

The government would certainly be happy with the PR that comes with restoring those people to their old bodies with magitech created by the state. Even if the Ideal demanded control over the project, the state could still reasonably claim credit for contributing to research into superpowers for the public good.

This could even make for an interesting plot hook: the people who's souls were found but were unwilling or unable to be restored to their old bodies. Some of them might've gone to the country of Sanctuary like other nonhuman refugees, but others might try to reintegrate into society on their own terms.

** I'd like some help fleshing out a natural hazard for a rationalist fantasy story.

For inspiration, I'm looking at the [[http://wiki.mystara.net/savage_coast][red curse]] from D&D's Savage Coast setting, [[http://pern.wikia.com/wiki/Thread][thread]] from Anne McCaffrey, and the [[http://www.jim-butcher.com/books/cinder-spires/the-aeronauts-windlass-1][mist]] from Jim Butcher's Cinder Spires.

The goal is to have something that limits habitable land, slows travel between towns, and can be resisted with planning or costly resources.

The setting's geography looks a like Greece. People live on islands, or on the coasts of larger landmasses. The interior of the landmasses is mountainous, so people travel by boat, or by caravans that follow the coastal trails.

Currently, the hazard is a magically-active mist that comes out at night. If you're caught in it, unprotected, it has some sort of corruptive effect.

To get around this, every settlement has magically-warded walls. People are safe so long as they're able to spend the night inside a town.

Town-walls are expensive, so there's an incentive to make towns as big as possible. The limiting factor is that farmers need to be able to walk to their fields each morning.

Travelers rely on a network of semi-permanent way-stations when they're between towns. These are buildings or forts that are set up every 10 miles or so along the coast. Unlike town walls, these protections need to be activated every night they'll be used. This activation can take an hour or two of work and is moderately costly.

Finally, there are (expensive) rituals that can protect a temporary camp, and (very expensive) talismans/magic that can protect people who are moving. These are used by adventurers, scouts, and certain kinds of extremely expensive couriers.

--------------

How would people exploit this? Imagine you've got a D&D party, and can cast "Protection from Mist" as a 3rd level spell. What kinds of things would you do with your (very rare) ability to move around freely at night?

What sort of resource would people use to power the temporary protections? I'm thinking that "sentient creature blood" might work, but that feels like the obvious answer.

Then, what would people do for the corruptive effect? I want to do something that leaves plants & animals unaffected, and allows there to be monsters living in the wild. This makes me think that the effect should somehow be mental.

At the moment, I'm tempted to say that mist lowers people's inhibitions, and makes them susceptible to to the influence of whatever supernatural creatures happen to be lurking nearby.

But, I'm having trouble making this effect sufficiently scary. And I'd like there to be some kind of semi-permanent effect that comes with excess exposure.

*** The Dead come out at night.

Ghosts burn and evaporate in the light of the Sun. This is known - has been known for centuries. But only Sunlight works - no lantern, no candle, no torch, no flame. Even /reflected/ sunlight works, though. (In modern times, people would pick up that it's the ultraviolet wavelengths that kill the ghosts).

So, in the daytime, travellers are safe. But in the night, ah, in the night the Dead roam. They ooze out of graveyards, slip out of the tombstones, whisper from bodies at the side of the road; the ghosts drift through the night, desperate for a touch of life again, for the chance to breathe, to see, to eat, to be.

To be caught out by the ghosts is to die, for the ghost displaces the mind already in the body, possessing it - and then fights for control with dozens, nay, hundreds of other ghosts, for the Dead outnumber the living, several million to one.

Sometimes the Dead will take over animals; these are rarer targets, as the body shape feels /wrong/, and only the most desperate will go for this option. But, for all that, possessed animals, animals with temporarily human intelligence, are at times seen of a night. And a /human/ body - ah, to the Dead a human body is all they desire, and they will fight, and fight hard, to hold onto one.

There are wards that can hold out the Dead. But these wards work on the principle of repelling /disembodied/ spirits; a ghost in possession of a body will not be stopped by the wards. It is fortunate, then, that not all bodies can support a ghost - a squirrel, for example, only has a small brain, and any ghost that wishes to possess one must discard much - memories, skills, instincts, /identity/ - in order to fit inside a squirrel. (Sometimes the Dead do such a thing. They squeeze within a squirrel, hop over the wards, and then - well, without their knowledge, memories, and skills, these desperate souls are no longer capable of remembering the part about taking over a human body, and usually live brief, squirrelish lives. But beware the ghost who is smart enough to choose a creature with a /large/ brain, like a tiger...)

When the ghosts take some unwary traveler, invading his mind, pulling on the levers that control his body, they care not for the safety or happiness of the original mind. They care only for themselves; for the ability to feel the breeze in the hair, air moving through the lungs, the beating of the heart. And the warmth of the sun on the skin - ah, how the ghosts long for that feeling once again! But it is a feeling that they can never have, for the lightest touch of the Sun dissolves them, freeing their victim - and it takes significant time for a ghost to reconstitute themselves after that point.

Some ghosts take their victims, dragging them to dark caves and hidden places through the days, holding their bodies out of the sun, so that they may longer prolong the half-life existence of their possession - many of these have forgotten small details, such as how or what to eat, what is poisonous or what is not - and even for those that have not forgotten, even the cramp of a pained stomach is heaven compared to the non-feeling of having no body at all.

But the wardings on the cities have one other weakness, and it is a severe one; it only prevents ghosts from /crossing/ the boundaries of the wards. It does not protect the populace from the ghosts of those who die /leaving their bodies inside the city/.

Muggings do not happen at night in the city. No mugger wants an angry victim's ghost taking his body. Muggings happen under the Sun, in well-lit areas instead - with the body dumped outside the city walls. Elderly and the terminally ill are kept in the Hospital at nights, a small region outside the city walls with its own, entirely separate system of wards and walls; and any activity that carries risk of death is carried out under full Sun, and outside the city. But for all the care that the people take, every now and then a man or woman will die within the city; and then that ghost will terrorise the city for a single night, usually attempting to possess either the nearest person, or the nearest person that the dead person did not like; one night of fear, danger, and the possessed person very quickly trying to accomplish the last aims of the recently dead, and then their body is removed from the city the next day, laid to rest in the Mausoleum outside the city, one more screaming, ghostly voice to wander the wilderness at night...

*** You are super super reinventing the premise of Peter V Brett's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Painted_Man][The Warded Man / The Painted Man]] series. Go read that series, it does a lot of what you're describing and it's pretty cool - and also you can make your stuff sufficiently different from his that you do something new. In his book series, at sundown demons rise from the earth and attack everyone not behind serious magical wards - until morning comes. These demons are supernaturally persistent, strong, and evil, but not particularly intelligent for the most part. Everyone can create wards on whatever using most mediums that you could draw or write on, but there's a lot of hazards with trying to etch complicated wards into the dirt earth - because a gap in the wards or the wards being covered or interrupted at all is quickly lethal, and the wards have to be precisely drawn accurately in order to have an effect. Some people travel by carrying wards etched on a series of laquered planks that they deploy around themselves near sunset, but it's tough and expensive to travel.

Sara Douglass had an apocalypse happen in her epic fantasy series the Wayfarer Redemption books that also bears some resemblance to this concept - in her fantasy series, the Timekeeper Demons mentally attacked and possessed anyone outside with any part of themselves being directly illuminated by the sun at certain hours of the day; they mentally dominated those possessed permanently and mostly caused them to attempt to attack others and kill them, or get them into sunlight, or to commit suicide, all in thematically appropriate ways for each different demon (each of them being tied to specific emotions like hunger, despair, etc). Douglass's work is substantially less recommended than Brett's, and anyways to understand it you have to read the (previous) Axis Trilogy as well, which itself is wholly unrelated to your premise.

**** Thanks! I just got the Warded Man on audiobook and am looking forward to seeing how Brett executes the premise.

Hopefully, I'll be able to hit some different themes.

One of my goals is to build a world where D&D's "points of light" setting makes sense. I really like the idea that there's some vast, unexplored expanse with ruins of a previous civilization.

But, whenever I encounter that in fiction, I always find myself asking why human farmers haven't already expanded and settled all the arable land.

The other goal is to build a world with some deliberate value dissonance. Lately, I've read way too much fan fiction where characters in a high fantasy world have the values of 21st century moderns.

Stuff like, "Book Burning is Evil!" works in our world. It's a much more complicated debate if some books teach people how to create the zombie apocalypse.

I lean libertarian, so I'm imagining the centralized wards as a way of making an authoritarian government become as defensible as possible.

**** I'm on Chapter 4 of the audiobook of 'The Painted Man' and I'm really glad you recommended it.

I can definitely see the similarity of the premise.

Do the characters get smarter as the book goes on? I feel like the author has missed some steps in the world building.

The characters live in a world where being caught out after dark means death. But they say stuff like, "Every dusk, I'll be on the porch waiting for you until you return."

If darkness kills, why would you ever be traveling anywhere near dusk? In an emergency, sure. But under normal circumstances? The culture should have rules like, "Tea starts 1 hour before dusk and is religiously mandatory."

Getting in 30 minutes before dusk should be a cold-sweat inducing story you use to frighten children. On par with, "I was caving, and lost two of my lights! I had to rely on my spare the whole way back! I could have died down there!"

Or the first act would have been outright solved if the civilization used mile-markers on their roads. Which you'd do if travel-time were a literal matter of life-and-death.

The annoyance is inspiring in a way. So, I'm happy I'm reading this, and hope I can have Level-1 intelligent characters reacting to similar sorts of problems.

*** Quick brainstorm:

During the night, the spirit world overlaps with the real world. I'd create some kind of apocalyptic event in the past that eroded the barrier between the spirit world and the real world. The barrier is still strong enough to stand firm during the day, but when night comes it becomes thin enough for spirits and ghosts to prey upon the minds of the living.

The dead, broken and twisted remnant spirits of the passed, always hunger for the bodies they /ache/ to possess again. They swarm any human being walking unprotected and try to tear their mind apart in a frenzied animalistic attempt to /get in/, to /have flesh/ again. To /live/.

The strong willed can resist these attacks... for a while. But if you are unprotected for too long, your defenses will be worn down and your mind torn apart, sending you into babbling madness and eventually death. Thus the ghosts attacks are doomed to fail, they will never gain the life they crave, but they are too far gone to see anything but the hot pulsing glow of life.

This way animals and monsters would be safe, and it is damn scary to go out at night because you start to feel the prescence of malevolent things trying to /get into your mind/. It starts weak, when only a few ghost fragments are drawn to you. But as more and more are drawn to your unprotected mind, the wailing and babbling and the /scratching/ on your mind becomes more and more discomforting until it becomes unbearable. You lose coherent thought and act only on fight or flight instinct, consumed by panic, fear and pain. People have clawed their eyes out, bashed their own heads in or attacked people that stand between them and percieved safety - even family and friends.

I would keep the only visual component some kind of mist, and let the other effects be entirely mental.

Excess but non-lethal exposure results in ticks, tiredness, nightmares, madness or paranoia, as the mind is more and more ablated by repeated assaults. Perhaps a slow erosion actually has the chance of leading to possession.

*** If it's a D&D setting, you could have the mist reverse character alignment after a minute or so of exposure. Towns of lawful neutral people become chaotic neutral and disband into roving murderhobo parties, then the next night comes and they realize their mistake but it's too late, all the guards are dead and the night creatures consume them. Paladins become useless as they lose the favor of their patrons, villains become lawful good and start massacreing their minions and freeing their slaves, all kinds of chaos.

The creatures that live in the wilds are either too unintelligent to have alignments, lawful neutral, or the mechanical automatons of a long-forgotten precursor race. You could even have a plot about how this precursor race caused the mist as an attempted superweapon gone horribly wrong.
