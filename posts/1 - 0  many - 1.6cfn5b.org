** Maybe a variation of privledging the hypothesis - once you have seen one instance of a unicorn most of the work into what animal you could see has already been done.

** I do see your point. I'm not aware of whether there's a specific name for it. Going from zero to one often involves the concept of whether a thing is actually even possible at all, such as when a new device is invented, or a new technique is tested for the first time and works.

Going from one to many doesn't have that same fundamental attachment to sheer existence; if one of something is already around, it exists, and making more doesn't change its ability to exist. (Although it does involve checking off the "reproducibility" box.)

** I suspect the math behind this is simple multiplication/division. =1= in infinitely many times larger than =0=, but =many= is only =many= times larger than =1=.
