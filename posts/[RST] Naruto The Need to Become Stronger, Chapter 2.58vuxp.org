** The pdf and epub versions are now available on [[https://www.mediafire.com/#og9fdufawqfj7][mediafire]]. Apologies for the delay.

All feedback is appreciated, as always! This is probably the chapter I edited the most, because it was actually the first one I wrote originally, so things like characterization kept seeming a little off. If you notice anything like that, please do tell me!

Btw, if anybody could tell me how to make a picture show up next to this post's link on the front page in the same way as some other posts do, I would be much obliged!

Add this to your page headers ...

<meta property="og:image" content="[link to image]" />

Your writing has a very clear voice. I look forward to seeing how the story progresses.

**** Hey. Thanks for the tip, but I still haven't managed to figure it out. Where should I add that line of code exactly? In reddit when creating a new post? Or on my website? I have tried adding it to the title of my posts and the website itself, but that isn't working. Are you saying I should edit the site's code itself somehow?

As you might be able to tell, I'm a bit of a newb at this :P

***** Here is how to do it, but you may need the paid version of wordpress ...

Otherwise, I believe you can just have the image somewhere in the foreground on your published page. Reddit wants an image to put next to your post, so it looks for one.

** Loved what's been written so far. I don't suppose you'd consider making an RSS feed for this? That's how I keep track of stories that aren't on Spacebattles/SV/FF/AO3/etc.

** Ok so far so good.

i am enjoying the behavior you've shown of Sakura and Naruto in this chapter, making his crush seem natural, rather than PRETTY GIRL MUST HAVE! the canon had.

The refusal to learn by his body goodly describes acrasia people expirience IRL. I am wondering from a AU perspective if there is hidden reason for this, like say, someone lowering his mental faculties to keep him in check.

Speaking of hidden reasons, You have used RST tag in posting this fanfic, so my question is: In what way is this fanfic different to canon? Because so far the changes seem small and Naruto behaves sort of like his OG self, only well written.

You just read a segment about a precocious boy and a studious girl researching the nature of magic using pure logic - that could have been a scene straight from HPMOR. Before that there was a scene with an evil cynical teacher explaining that the , and before that a scene which introduced a villain who actually uses his brain instead of confronting Minato head-on (like the masked man did in canon did, despite being able to TELEPORT, and then not using that teleportation to do anything meaningful for the rest of the story). Idem Dito.

The difference is that HPMOR is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy, while NTBS tries to be more realistic. HJPEV knows everything about science at age 11 and everything he does is awesome and every challenge he encounters is perfectly set up to be solvable with the tools he has which he was given for free. He seems super rational because the story is stacked in his favour in a way that would never happen in real life.

Naruto in NTBS on the other hand is much smarter than in canon, but he is still clearly /Naruto/ - and even if he is the main character who is supposed to save the world, the rest of the world doesn't necessarily know that. So he may seem less rational, but I don't think that makes NTBS any weaker as a rationalist story, not at all.
