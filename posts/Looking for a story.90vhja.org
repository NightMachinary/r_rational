I /think/ it was posted to this sub before but I can't find it. Spoilers about the story ahead: It was about a team of programmers that find something weird and fall down a rabbit hole of mysterious bugs. [[#s][Spoiler]]

*** Thanks for the link. I *really* like this story. The story sells the fundamental alienness of computers. It is in some sense a "first contact" story, except instead of sci-fi-astronomy aimed at distant aliens, it is real-life computer engineering, forcing the reader to take a new perspective on the computers already in front of us.

I'm constantly disappointed by how little top-tier sci-fi really addresses computation, instead extrapolating on other sciences, such as futuristic space travel, or future ecological catastrophes. This story by contrast is a breath of fresh air, for making me thoroughly freaked out about computation while staying totally grounded in the reality of the technology. Amazingly, the computational concepts are all accurate, nothing made up, and used in a plausible way so as to illuminate plot developments. I can't say how much of the nuance in the story will be missed by people who aren't familiar with all the jargon, so the story might not work for everyone however.

**** I don't have a CS degree and I have never worked with any language lower down than Python. Although some of the specifics of what they were talking about went past me, the gist of it was clear enough that I was able to understand and thoroughly enjoy the story. This is a sign of EXCELLENT writing. I agree with all of your points about what makes the story good, I just think that it's also well written enough that anyone with even a passing familiarity with computers will be able to enjoy it.

***** Also, as someone with a CS minor and with experience in C, assembler, and embedded systems programming, this story remarkably does not induce Gell-Mann Amnesia - the author knows his stuff and uses all the right tech at all the right times. Even the dev timelines are reasonably accurate! ...if not the dev team who gets paid for weeks of work chasing down something useless.
