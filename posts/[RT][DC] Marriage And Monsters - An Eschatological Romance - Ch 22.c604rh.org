** Hah! Excellent final line.

I am still a bit miffed at Aslan's instakill dagger overruling Pathfinder spells when we just went through the whole Cecelia arc to show that people in stories are most effected by things that match their stories when conflicts happen. Sean being in Haley's story should overwrite Aslans.

Between this and fusion beams barely inconveniencing Flagg, it really seems like Haley's powerup is flashy but useless. Despite it being story magic based its treated like physical attacks against conceptual attacks.

It is clearly done because without narrative rules, Haley has already become God, but it still leaves a dirty taste in my mouth when a protagonist wins early and then has that win invalidated for plot reasons (external Doylist plot not Watsonian).

*** The thing is Haley changed her story. Initially it was Seans story about keeping up with his idealized wife; when she took over it changed to being her story of finding purpose.

Sean isn't part of her story explicitly because she denies him /being/ her purpose. He became just a plot Macguffin for Haley to use against Aslan.

Sean isn't a part of any story when Aslan traps him, so Aslan has priority.

*** (Spoilers: current chapter) [[https://narnia.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_Knife][Boden's dagger]] is the Narnian version of the Lance of Longinus, though it's never quite called out as such. It has narrative priority over... a /lot/ of things.

**** Having read some of the Narnia wiki (is been twenty years since I read the books) I think I know where you're going with this. A bit Deeper.

***** Yeah, to anyone who has read the books or even seen the movie, /how/ he 'survived' is rather obvious.

*** Well, given that he isn't /dead/ dead, maybe something else trumped it.

Flagg/O'Dim (and countless other names besides) is a functionally immortal being who is highly skilled in magic, alchemy, and social manipulation. He has 'walked' pretty much every ruined version of the Tower multiverse, and in most cases has been the cause or at least the catalyst of their destruction. He also has a patron in the form of a demonic entity that is functionally a Lovecraftian incarnation of chaos.

He was at ground zero for a /nuclear blast/ at the end of *The Stand*, and escaped simply by moving /sideways/ to an alternate Earth. He's darn near impossible to kill by any physical means if he is able to act, and it's only through mind control by a powerful psychic that he was ever finally defeated at all.

I'm cool with a suddenly radioactive knife being unable to kill him. She was lucky to get his hand.

** Little bit behind but here's the thoroughly blinged-out character sheet for Haley post-Wish Engine. This one's valid from chapters 18 on.

We just hit trending on RR in the last week, really picking up some steam on the hits. Thanks for reading along!

**** Thank you! I have a pretty deep backlog which allows me to go back and revise unreleased stuff for consistency with future plans. I also revise each chapter before it goes out, so you're usually seeing second or third drafts. If I had to do this seat-of-the-pants... oof.
