Oooh la la! It's February once again, with its holiday dedicated to love, hearts, and cute, fluffy things. That's right...it's Groundhog day!

To celebrate this special time of year, what better way than to write some genre fiction?

For the month of February, your challenge is to write a ROMANCE.

A short description of the genre:

/The romance genre places its primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and usually has an ‘emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending,' aka the main characters get a 'happily ever after.' The plot of most romances can be summed up as: ‘people who have a hole in their hearts find that missing piece in each other.' (And yes, that line is actually from a book I read about writing romance. It fits surprisingly well.)/

Other than that, the genre is pretty broad. Though there are PLENTY of tropes to choose from, you can read about a few of them here: [[https://blog.reedsy.com/romance-tropes/]]

Guidelines:

• There is no set word limit. Write and post as many words as you like! (technically there's a 500 word minimum, but I'm not counting)

• You're encouraged to include rational elements in the fiction, but the main challenge is to write an enjoyable genre fiction. Everything else is gravy.

• Post your work as a comment to this thread, which can include a link or the entire story (if it is flash fiction). PM me if you want me to post your work anonymously.

• Last day to post is February 28th!

Optional prompts: (prompt 11 has me cackling)

(Bonus points if your story includes groundhogs, the real MVP of February.)

I'm also thinking that if this contest runs all year, I'll create an archive of all our 2021 genre fiction stories. It would be sort of like a rational fiction anthology. :)

That's all guys! Start writing!

Grug turn red. Want run, want hide.

Grug say quiet, look at own feet "Grug not know how weave wreath. Grug think Fara good fisher. Grug make fish trap for Fara"

Old Wise Woman think long. Long silent. Look at Grug like hawk on rabbit. Grug feel very nervous. Like eels in gut.

Old Wise Woman say: "Grug many stupid. But today Grug make good Think. Grug can go talk Fara now".

Werg laugh again: "Werg think Old Woman not very Wise! Grug go with Fara, maybe make ugly baby one-eye? Grug too ugly, too stupid, better not take woman, not make baby. Fara not good for make baby, Fara one-eye!"

Many tribe folk stare in shock. Bad omen talk bad at Old Wise Woman. Bad omen talk bad on baby. Werg make big bad omen. But Werg son of Chief. Folk afraid anger Werg.

In North Cave Fara say: "Wise Woman, Grug cut bad. Many blood go. Fara afraid Grug spirit go! Wise Woman help Grug fast! Fara do anything help!"

Old Wise Woman ask: "Fara do anything help? Anything? This omen word. Fara make sacrifice to Bear Sprit, make Grug heal? "

Fara say "Yes!"

Old Wise Woman ask : "Fara sacrifice one eye to Bear Spirit? No eye left?"

Fara shudder, hesitate. Fara speak: "...yes, Wise Woman. Fara sacrifce eye for Grug"

Old Wise Woman say: Fara prepare sacrifice. Fara make Spirit Chant. Wise Woman stitch wound. Make Grug wake up.

Grug half-sleep half-not sleep. No blood make weak. Hear Fara speak. Grug think in head: "Fara no lose eye! Grug better die. Grug stupid no use to Fara, no use to tribe."

Fara sing Spirit Chant. Fara cry, Spirit Chant not very good. Fara afraid lose eye. No eye left. Fara fear Grug die more.

Old Wise Woman ask: "Fara ready? Make sacrifice? Fara give Grug Waking Herb. Fara give Grug kiss. Then Fara pluck Fara eye, make sacrifice. Understand?"

Fara give Grug herb. Kiss lips. Lie down Grug side. Hold Grug close. Fara say: "Grug please not die. Grug please wake up. Fara make good sacrifice."

Fara reach flint knife, put tip to eye. Grug hand grab Fara hand. Buffalo-strong. Take knife away.

Grug whisper: "Fara no pluck eye! Grug no worth eye. Grug think eye very pretty".

Old Wise Woman laugh. Take knife from Grug. Take Waking Herb from Fara, chew herb. Old Wise Woman say: "Eh, Grug hard kill, like boar. Maybe not need pluck eye. Wise Woman see Fara eye always for Grug!"

Old Wise Woman wag finger at Fara. Chew more Waking Herb. Laugh more.

Fara ask: "Many Tribe hate Grug hate Fara for attack Werg. Not share meat. How Fara feed Grug?"

Old Wise Woman say: "Stupid ask Fara. Grug make Fara big pretty fish trap for Flower Wreath Day. Fara go, catch big pretty fish!"

Grug listen. Head dizzy. See Old Wise Woman go. See Fara stay in cave with Grug. Fara smile. Fara cry. Grug grin. Grug feel happy. Maybe Grug feel Waking Herb in head? No. Grug think Grug feel heartbeat for Fara.

I'm going to finish the dang story I was working on last month (I was sick for 9 days which threw a wrench in my writing plans) but look at me shaking my fist at you for this!

*** Interesting idea! My only critique is the android's verbosity was kind of tiring to read. I found myself skipping some parts of the dialogue.

I did read to the end though, and I liked the ending. :) Nice work!

*** Great work! I really liked this.

There are a couple of his lines that stay in her font. I think it should be easy to notice because the paragraphs usually alternate, and these were three in a row of her font.

***** I found one instance of this:

#+begin_quote
  There are parameters in my personality matrix concerning Partners public relations and customer retention. These parameters are not affected by the honesty and intelligence sliders.

  I should have known.

  Your expression confirms my prediction that this would disgust and frustrate you. I knew you would not approve of these parameters; such is your fury against manipulation--
#+end_quote

The middle sentence has an incorrect font.

I greatly enjoyed this story - although I found out /after/ I checked it on my desktop that Buddy had comic sans font - he had this extremely hard to read stylized font on my phone... I think it was unintentional, since comic sans matches his character much better...

I really enjoyed this story, and I'll be saving it to come across in months to read again.

** okay, after last month I'm more aware of what I can achieve, so I have brought a draft flash story up to a "I am not ashamed for this to see the light of day" sort of standard.

Concept: what if people who had been "sappho and her friend"ed by historians were alive today to find out about it? With urban fantasy, they can!

This is a non-canon possible future in "Vampire Flower Language". Unfortunately, no groundhogs.
