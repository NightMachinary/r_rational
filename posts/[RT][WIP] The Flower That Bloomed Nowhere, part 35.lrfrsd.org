Honestly, I would have preferred this be part of a bigger chapter with either the previous one or the one afterwards, but I've been having a tricky time adjusting to a strict schedule. My day-to-day is already sitting at home grinding it out on a word processor, so too often, I just feel wrecked.

Still, I think this is a pretty interesting chapter. The next several are all probably going to give people something to think about, actually.

For new readers, TFTBN (not exactly acronym conducive, huh?) is a murder mystery about a bunch of mages trying to achieve immortality, which I am aiming to be a solvable whodunnit. It's a very indulgent work on my end, so it's probably not for anyone, but give it a shot!


** dang cliffhanger ending

+every chapter, Utsu progresses 1/2 of the remaining distance towards meeting Zeno+

*** I'm sorry! I /really/ wanted the whole scene with Zeno in this chapter instead of in the next one, but I keep having migraines after work recently, and I'm coming precariously close to having to cannibalize my backlog/Patreon advance stuff to not miss weeks, unfortunately.

***** ...damn, that's a really embarrassing mistake to make on a subreddit like this, lmao. I think I even had it partially in mind when conceiving the character, too.

I swear, this story is turning my brain into soup.
