** I'm looking forward to the perhaps never gonna happen sequel as I really enjoyed the prime intellect story and universe in general.

MoPI is not everyone's cup of tea largely due to the sexually and violently graphic first chapter (which I personally didn't mind), but this short story doesn't require knowledge of the universe and has no graphic content at all.

Upgrade isn't my favourite localroger piece by any means but it's hard to top a lot of the stuff he's written (Passages in the Void is my personal favourite). The "reveal" about the alien culture at the end is something I've seen before, [[#s][in]], so I didn't feel it had payoff like maybe it "should" have, and I thought the story was interesting enough without having to have a payoff. Then again I like silly meandering stories with no real plot (/The Time Machine/ typifies this IMO, wanders around, doesn't get into major conflict, just observes a bunch of stuff and then travels 40 million years into the future just for the heck of it).

It does remind me how much I love post-singularity sci-fi, does anyone have any recommendations? I never got into the Culture series as much as I wanted to, started both Consider Phlebas and Player of Games but never got gripped...

*** While it's not actually post-singularity Charles Stross' Glasshouse features a post-scarcity society that deals with lots of transhumanist themes (e.g. the meaning of identity when you can create copies of your mind and later merge the experiences).

**** Glasshouse and Accelerando, as a transition between here and there are both well worth reading.

As far as Banks I think OP started with quite possibly the two worst novels to try and get "gripped" with the culture series. Personally, as someone's who's handle and flair are culture allusions, I'd recommend, Excession and Surface Detail, even if both abuse the Godzilla threshold on the morality front with their respective [[/s][spoiler Excession]] and [[/s][spoiler surface detail]].

Edit: addition Mater is also worth reading if only as an example of the prime directive subverted i.e. [[/s][spoiler Matter]]

*** Also not post-singularity, but Blindsight was also a post-scarcity economy with transhumanist themes and brain uploads into a paradisaical land. Much more interesting than just "should I upload or not", that part is relevant but not the focus. Quite possibly you've read Blindsight already.
