Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have the power of Deadspeak (from Lumley's Necroscope series). You can converse with the dead and learn knowledge and skills from them (including paranormal abilities and skills that would otherwise require physical practice, like martial arts).

Bonus round: you are in the world of Harry Potter.

*** Honestly I think this ability is incredibly strong. I would predict that most dead people are willing to let you learn their most important skills since they would be interested in leaving a legacy and doubly so when there is no risk of them being outcompeted by an apprentice.

This does seem to be really powerful in any supernatural framework, however it really shines in the HPMOR universe since it can circumvent the interdict of Merlin and thus be abble to creat say more Deathly Hollows.

- Sell "afterlife insurance" once your abilities are public: people can bank up funds pre-death, or dedicate them in their will, which buys your time helping them out after their death at some hourly fixed rate. That could involve sorting out unfinished business, transcribing their novel, identifying their murderer, or simply relaying messages to loved ones. The main issue here might be locating their ghost.
- If the ghosts have any ability to influence or observe the world, you could parlay this into effective telekinesis or clairvoyance, respectively.
- You could earn a lot of money from companies with low [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor][Bus factors]]: how much would they be willing to pay to regain the expertise of a departed employee who failed to train up a successor, or even just to ask the sysadmin for the root password?
- Retrieving cryptocurrency keys would also prove very lucrative.
- Necrojournalism could also be popular, asking what dead authors think of how their work is interpreted, or getting deceased presidents to weigh in on the political issues of the day.

Learning paranormal abilities seems particularly valuable in the world of Harry Potter. Could you learn a Veela's allure? Are there magical abilities that are costly and harmful to acquire under normal circumstances that you could access with much greater ease? The only one that comes to mind is being able to see Thestrals, which comes with seeing death, but that seems like a given with this particular power.

In canon and in my AU, magical strength is determined by a host of factors revolving around maturity and knowledge and social status among other things. Gaining knowledge is a huge factor, so learning from the dead would boost your power, but it's still your power. You wouldn't be able to just download the sum total of the magical might of all the dead of wizardkind. That would definitely be broke and trivialize things.

If Y does not think the word X in the next 24 hours, Y will have X permanently deleted from their vocabulary and cannot relearn X no matter what. Your ability can be used as often as you want, on as many people as you want, but a person cannot be targeted twice within 24 hours.

Another way to get around it would be to target babies, or people with a different native language.

Removing "the", or similar extremely common words, would probably be the most harmful. You might be able to extort people that way, if you can inflict it on enough public figures for it to become a known phenomenon. They could always switch to a different language to get around it, but that could still pose a significant impediment.

Similarly, you could make babies forget their name before they learn it and use that for blackmail.

Another approach would be to choose words that are uncommon, then introduce them to the target yourself. For example, being able to set up "What is Aleppo?" incidents with politicians might be enough to sustain a career as a journalist.

I don't know if "the" would be that harmful, depending on exactly how it works: plenty of languages get by without having an equivalent of "the".

It'd be a mindfuck as you become completely unable to learn the meaning of an apparently very common word that all your friends and family insist you used all the time, but eventually someone would get frustrated trying to teach you and say "look, it doesn't actually mean anything all that important, just ignore it and you'll still be able to understand what other people are saying". You'd waste money going to neurologists to try to work out what the heck happened, and you'd not be able to do public speaking, and your writing would be poor quality and have to be edited by other people... but you'd get used to it.

Then again, after writing out all the above, I'm guessing that you were talking about that level of inhibition rather than "literally becoming a snivelling nincompoop"? Because the above does sound pretty bad.

This would work to some extent. Your ability deletes the word from their vocabulary, so they will forget what the word "Aleppo" means. But they wouldn't forget the existence of the city itself, nor what has happened there. They just wouldn't know what the name of the city is and can't relearn it.

And in saying this I just realized your blackmail idea would work wonders on celebrities and companies. Simply threaten to erase their names from tons of people. Most of them aren't famous enough to have people thinking of their names every day, yet plenty are famous enough to have their names been learned, so your ability would work on a significant fraction of people you target. Which can be a huge amount of people since you can just look down from a tall building or wander around a shopping mall and target everyone in sight. And while forgetting the name of a celebrity or company won't make people forget the existence of them, it would make getting any news or advertisements from them a huge inconvenience. An ad could be like "Come down to store X to find massive discounts!" and the viewers would be like "Where?" when you erase X from their vocabularies. And you could ruin actors' careers since any movie advertisement going "Starring Actor Y" would just have viewers going "Who?" once you erase Y from their vocabularies.

**** Removal of common words that would require drugging your targets will probably be useless, given that if your goal is to cause harm to someone and you already have them drugged and unconscious for 24 hours you can basically do whatever harm you want, including killing them. There's not much you could do with removal of common words that you couldn't do via other means if you can reliably get people into this situation.

You either need to pick obscure words that nevertheless are noticeable when absent (the names of certain nations?), or if you get someone who is bilingual and swaps to thinking in a certain language when in a nation that speaks it, you can sabotage their use of the other language. You could perhaps remove the English "the" from them while they're in France, and then remove "le" from them while they're in England or the U.S.

- [[https://toarumajutsunoindex.fandom.com/wiki/Imagine_Breaker][Kamijou Touma's Imagine Breaker.]] You can safely assume every other power on this list can be negated. Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu can be ignored and can be permanently dispelled for everyone by touching the activator(eyes/blade), Path to Victory does not know how to deal with you, you are immune to detect thoughts and can temporarily end the spell for others by touching the victim/suppress the spell for everyone by touching the caster, and can temporarily dispell Mystique's transformation by touching her. You get the 4th pick of countries.

- The ability to obtain any ability whose player is eliminated by you, defined by controlling their last or one of their last supply center in a build phase. You get the 1st pick of countries.

Additional rules include:

- Any players caught using their power by the GM is immediately forfeit. Their country goes NMR. Criteria for catching includes perceiving the verbal or somatic component for detect thoughts, witnessing an activation of Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu, or witnessing a transformation of Mystique. The activation of Imagine Breaker does not count as evidence against anybody. Edit: GM is immune to everybody's abilities.

- No players can harm a player or using their ability to cause any players harm. Edit: This rule applies to GM as well. This is magically enforced.

- Every player knows every player's abilities from the start on a surface level. Details that would be considered a secret of their power is not known initially. The exception is that the player with Imagine Breaker knows how to disable others' power from the start.

#+begin_quote
  No players can harm a player or using their ability to cause any players harm.
#+end_quote

Say you use Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu on one player to make them punch another player.

Technically, you have not harmed a player with your ability, you just made them punch another. Or heck, you could just make Kyoka Suigetsu show an illusion that makes a player want to punch another, that way you have another layer of indirection since it was ultimately that player's choice to punch, you didn't make the player do it.

Would that be allowed for you? Would that get the player who did the punching disqualified?

Can you make all the players gang up on Imagine Breaker and beat up Imagine Breaker until they can't play properly? Same for Path to Victory if they get the idea of closing their eyes so you can't use your ability on them. Or just make someone else hold Path to Victory's eyes open so you can get them.

I bet you can use Kyoka Suigetsu faster than it takes for Path to Victory to convince the others to close their eyes! Especially since for all they know, closing their eyes for a while could be the activation for some ability, and there's no way to tell who is Path to Victory or whether they are lying.

The only problem would be somehow avoiding the GM's eyes while you are brainwashing the players.

​

Which brings me to my next question: I noticed that you didn't say you can't harm the GM. Can I Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu the GM into thinking all the other players have broken the rules and disqualify everyone but me? That way I instantly win and Path to Victory can't do anything about it since there is literally no set of actions that could let them stop me in time.

***** Aschente.

New plan then. I noticed that Imagine Breaker can only negate Kyoka Suigetsu if they touch your blade, not touch your brainwashed puppets. In other words, you're thinking of Kyoka Suigetsu as something like Innocentius which cannot be erased without erasing the source right? This makes things easier.

Plan remains roughly the same: begin by distracting the GM somehow ("Look a UFO!" or just ask about some obscure rule to make them check the rulebook) and brainwash everyone except Imagine Breaker (who is immune) and Path to Victory (who knows not to open eyes). Step 2: use your 4 brainwashed puppets to hold down Imagine Breaker and Path to Victory physically. Since its just holding instead of punching, you aren't violating the no harm rule. And though it will look weird to the GM, there is no evidence that you used Kyoka Suigetsu since you may have just persuaded them somehow through mundane means. Since Imagine Breaker is held down, they can't erase your brainwashing and so can't get free from the brainwashed puppets.

I would assume that the game has turn time limits (otherwise any losing player can just stop playing and force the game to never end). So Path to Victory and Imagine Breaker will time out every turn without doing anything and you have free reign to win the game against 6 other players who all do nothing every turn.

​

The loophole in this plan is since your 4 brainwashed puppets can only hold, not attack, I imagine it is a lot easier to Path to Victory to compute and execute a Path to dodging all their grabs without hurting them. Still, Path to Victory can't save Imagine Breaker because they can't predict Imagine Breaker: if they try they will just get in each other's way and actually allow your puppets to take down Path to Victory. And if they don't save Imagine Breaker, that means Path to Victory has to compete in the game against you + your 4 puppets (who can take turns holding down Imagine Breaker in threes so they can all play their turns). Even if Path to Victory can see the path to maximizing their odds of victory, attempting to win the game of Diplomacy 1 vs 5 is going to be very difficult. That's like trying to win a game of chess with only your king and a single pawn against the enemy's entire army. I don't rate Path to Victory's odds of victory as high, even when maximized with their ability.

​

Unless of course Path to Victory starts counter-cheating by instead of computing how to win the game, computes how to make you want to make them win the game instead. But that gets into really vague territory about how Path to Victory works. They can't compute a path to do the impossible, so exactly how impossible is it to make someone want to someone else to win? What are the limitations here? Can Path to Victory compute before the game that the best plan is kidnap your family beforehand and blackmail you into losing? But if you're allowed to use your abilities before the game starts, the complexity suddenly increases by orders of magnitude.

Every player will be waging a shadow war using their abilities, stealing what's precious to the others to blackmail them, finding some way to turn the others (especially Imagine Breaker) to their side, etc.

I'm assuming the fact that Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu works through sight is the main secret of their powers (like it was in their series), and so not known initially.

In which case, the other players have no idea how the other's ability is activated. It could be sight sure, but it could also be sound. Or through knowing someone's name. Or by drawing a circle around them and chanting some spell. Who knows? In which case, if you're up against people whose abilities you don't know the activation sequence of, why would you ever close your eyes and let them do all kinds of shenanigans while you blind yourself?

And in fact, there IS a player whose ability only works if you close your eyes: Mystique. If people don't close their eyes, Mystique can shape-shift all she wants and everyone will still know its her. But once you close your eyes Mystique can shape-shift into anyone else and start impersonating endlessly, especially since she can copy voices perfectly. So if your game plan is close your eyes in case of Geass or Kyoka Suigetsu, you just gave Mystique free reign to do whatever she wants.

So if the players don't know how the other's abilities are activated, there's no reason for them to close their eyes and every reason not to. Even if someone claiming to be Path of Victory tells them to close their eyes it won't be easy to convince them.

Hmm... Imagine Breaker just became much much stronger. You can't harm or hold him without breaking rule 1, but he can totally touch you and so nullify all your abilities without breaking the rules. All he has to do is walk around the game table, regularly touching everyone else to ruin all their ability-based plans.

By doing so, he gives away the fact that he is Imagine Breaker (especially if someone tries to use their ability while being touched), which could cause the other players to gang up on him to eliminate him and so restore their powers... but would they? Not all powers are equal, so for players with weaker powers, like Detect Thoughts and Obtain Ability, the fact that he is nullifying everything is great news for them. Ganging up on him would let abilities be restored and swiftly end in their loss since their abilities are weak.

Only players with strong powers like Kyoka Suigetsu or Path to Victory would benefit from eliminating Imagine Breaker. So trying to attack Imagine Breaker would immediately out yourself as having a strong power, and encourage the players with weaker powers to ally with Imagine Breaker and beat you first, while your powers are still sealed.

Even Path of Victory with her invisible ability would be defeated by this alliance with Imagine Breaker, because she cannot predict Imagine Breaker, and so cannot predict allies of Imagine Breaker who are playing in coordination with Imagine Breaker.

Imagine Breaker would become, if not the King, at least the King-Maker. Because his actions during the alliance phase will determine the final winner. Whoever he attacks first will almost certainly lose the game regardless of their ability.

******** Great work.

Nobody wants anybody to be controlled by Kyoka Suigetsu or Geass, so they will actively seek out the Path to Victory player and attempt to buy information from her ("You will tell me how to avoid Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu for Munich"). PtV player will also tell the two sight-power players how far can they take things or else she would tell everyone how to stop them.

IB will permanently disable Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu(until IB is eliminated) if he touches their eyes/blade, but doing so essentially establish them as your permanent enemy so as to restore their power. I'm imagining he would also bargain with them as to what actions are acceptable ("don't cross the stalemate line unless you don't want your abilities").

So there are 4 factions on the board, IB alliance with IB, detect thoughts and gain ability, anti-IB alliance with Geass and Kyoka Suigetsu, Mystique, and Path to Victory.

I predict the country layout looks along the lines of something like this and for those reasons:

Gain ability - France (rather hard to attack, can access many centers on the board, allows access to both sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ocean)

Detect Thoughts - Germany (access to many centers, close to the stalemate line, proximity to France)

Mystique - Italy (Slight inclination to attack PtV, participation in both sides of the board)

Imagine Breaker - Russia (helps towards PtV and against England, throws a wrench into anti-IB Juggernaut, Sweden guaranteed thanks to German ally)

Geass - Turkey (really hard to attack, leaving Austria to PtV, an England-Turkey alliance is still effective)

Kyoka Suigetsu - England (really hard to attack, leaving Austria to PtV, an England-Turkey alliance is still effective)

Path to Victory - Austria

If we start guessing with this lineup then indeed looks like Imagine Breaker has a very high chance of winning.

********* I suspect Mystique will be in the IB alliance, because shape-shifting is one of the weaker powers. I mean, it is completely nullified just by keeping your eyes on her, and PtV would never be fooled by her. If IB is eliminated, I doubt Mystique stands a chance against PtV, KS, or Geass.

Also there's a huge problem with buying information from PtV. How can you tell whether she is lying? Sure she has a motive to prevent KS and Geass from gaining too much power, but who knows how the path to victory will lay out? Maybe tricking people into falling for KS to eliminate them first IS the optimal path to victory. Or maybe telling them extra false information, like "Close your eyes AND do X to avoid Geass" leads to a better outcome for PtV. Honestly, a massive amount of PtV's power comes from being able to say things that manipulate people into doing things that increase PtV's odds of victory, so if I were playing rationally against PtV and I wasn't IB, I would ignore everything she says no matter what. (Not do the opposite of what she says, just straight up pretend I heard absolutely nothing.)

********** Let's give Mystique some more credit. She's not going to show up to the game in her, say blue form from the X-men movies, she's going to show up as a normal looking person. Or looking exactly like one of the other players, or looking like any of the characters that had those powers in their respective series. Remember the players don't know who has which power until they figure it out themselves or Path to Victory just flat out asks for the answer, so if somebody looking exactly like Aizen shows up and nobody else carries a blade (openly) your first thought is likely that 'this player looking exactly like Aizen is probably the player with Kyoka Suigetsu'. For all you know you might well be playing the real Aizen, how else would somebody just have Kyoka Suigetsu? And let's also give her a unisex toilet to work with and with that she can be an important wildcard impersonating here and there.

The point about PtV giving false extra information is solid, and even if you are IB you still need to be aware of that. That would then swing the balance of power back towards KS and Geass a bit as now it'll be really easy to fall victim to KS and Geass, and subsequently IB gets a little more leverage.

** I'm following a most excellent quest, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/][Dragon Ball: After The End]], and was hoping to pick [[/r/rational]]'s brains for some ideas on the latest challenge (with the author's permission!)

Avoiding spoilers, the players have finally gotten started on a long-planned research project to recreate the lost art of the Perfect Multiform - a technique which splits the user into multiple identical bodies as strong as the original, far superior to the currently-known Multiform which splits the user's strength as well. The challenge is in deciding how to achieve this.

#+begin_quote
  Premise 1: Multiform, as a technique, functions by using one's energy to split into multiple physical forms, all of which draw from the same energy pool when determining their own. Naturally, this splits one's energy pool into equal parts (historically, two to four).

  Premise 2: It is a matter of historical record that achieving a four-way ["perfect"] multiform with each clone being at the full power of the original is possible. Furthermore, this historical instance appeared to be without serious intrinsic drawbacks, although it was certainly far less decisive than one might expect.

  Premise 3: It is not theoretically impossible to outright demand that one's energy duplicate itself, although practically speaking it has never been done, and it would likely involve a significant up-front expenditure of energy.

  Premise 4: Similarly, there exist plentiful techniques to boost one's energy level beyond its default maximum, and thus the clones resulting from a multiform could artificially boost their energy levels to, "base," at the cost of significant ongoing strain.
#+end_quote

The default options are:

- To simply split the user's Ki reserves and avoid losing potency, which would leave each body with 1/4 of the stamina.

- To investigate stretching out the clones' ki with techniques that boost the user's strength for brief periods, which would leave them at "full" strength - but such techniques invariably cause great strain on the body, drastically reducing the time the clone survives for.

There was some discussion around making use of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox][Banach-Tarski Paradox]], but after investigation the author ruled that this was not compatible with their model of ki. The author has outright invited the players to try and game this system if we can, but we're stumped. Admittedly it might just be that no better solution exists, but does anyone here have any ideas? To again quote the author:

#+begin_quote
  The moving part in question [given the above premises, which are assumed to be true given the information available to the thread] is that multiform intrinsically involves splitting off new physical forms from an existing ki source. Is there some other way you can think of to game that system?
#+end_quote

(I originally posted this in the [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b9sbqi/d_friday_open_thread/ek823rc/][Friday thread]], but it probably fits better here.)

*** Ideas:

- What happens if each of the clones eats a senzu bean? Could this be used to overcome the power cap? This would be expensive if you need to do it every time you split.
- How do transformations like Oozaru affect the clones if you perform them after splitting?
- The fusion dance hasn't been mentioned in the quest, but looking at doing that in reverse might be informative for an alternative method of splitting.
- Similarly, the sealing and unsealing might provide insights in terms of how they affected Jaffur's ki reserves.
- Could seer powers be applied to the problem? Use future-sight to see if or how you manage it in the future?
- What about using mental projection while you have a multiform running? Do all the copies project?

**** - I don't actually know! I'll ask.
- Oozaru is modelled as using a separate pool of energy, which can't be accesses at the same time as the regular human pool, but a clone can go Oozaru while the regular body doesn't - this is currently just about the only way to get any value in combat out of regular Multiform.
- The fusion dance is sadly a lost art, and one that research into has been very lacking in, since apparently getting it wrong can be lethal. That's an interesting idea though, and I might suggest looking at Multiform if we ever do go looking into it.
- The sealing literally sealed away his ki above a certain level, and the unsealing reversed that - could you clarify what you think might be learned?
- The funny thing about the Sight is that it models exactly what would happen if you hadn't used it - in this case, it would show success (or failure, I suppose) of whatever method is decided upon - but if the players don't come up with a superior method, we won't get to see it, because it won't happen.
- Astral projection stops Multiform entirely, for reasons unclear.
