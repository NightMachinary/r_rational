I'm a pretty big fan of the universe; Legend of Korra in particular seems like it would be ripe for a rational rewrite:

- Under-explored flawed hotheaded main character

- Tons of fascinating worldbuilding

- Promising but ultimately flawed villains

- Lots of politics where no side is clearly right or wrong

Does anyone know good Korra rational-ish fic that explore these themes?


** Hydrogen. Helium. Lithium. Beryllium. <list goes on for a while>. Tennessine. Oganesson.

Long ago, the 118 nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.

Only the Avatar, master of all 118 elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.

A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, a nitrogenbender named Aang, and although his nitrogenbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

But I believe Aang can figure out what the heck is up with those fire benders. I mean fire is not even an element. And how do they do that lightning thing. What's that got to do with fire? I really hope Aang can figure that out. Oh, and save the world.

** There is a great Zuko centric fanfic somewhere on Fanfic.net - found it! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers]]

Been a while since I read it! But hasa ton of really great background details based on canon facts, fantastic worldbuilding.

We follow Zuko in his exile as a prince, and what would happen if he was not as consumed by demons of the past - Zuko is more powerful, plans more, looks out for his people and has more powerful allies. While Aang is still an airhead and screws everything up with his /good intentions/. Zukos rants at Aangs stupidity are quite entertaining.

*** I've seen Embers recommended frequently. I tried it and could not enjoy it. I felt like it took a really interesting concept, adding nuance to the ethical situation of the people involved in the Fire Nation war, and took it to bizarre extremes. Suddenly all characters in the world agree that the Fire Nation is noble and just, while the Avatar and his few supporters are selfish and evil.

I could understand if this was shown to be the perspective of characters on the Fire Nation's side of the war. But from what I read before I gave up, the author seemed to be attempting to present this as the objective reality of the story, seemingly due to being a Zuko fan and wanting to make Zuko into the world's principal protagonist.

**** If I recall correctly, the fic took the cartoon conventions from the show and brought them to logical extremes.

It argues that Aang's technically a pacifist because he doesn't /directly/ kill, only lets people die after putting them in a deadly situation. Which, just, c'mon. That's ascribing some immense stupidity to him and everyone who follows him.

Those fire nation soldiers Aang floods off Zuko's ship in the first episode? They froze to death in the water. That sort of thing pops up again and again, and it did ultimately make me stop reading the fic.

The idea was interesting, and there were some actually decent arguments for the Gaang's lack of responsibility, but the fic rode a relatively small detail - that was pretty clearly meant to make the story work in a children's cartoon format - pretty damn hard.

***** Yeah, I've seen fics that do this kind of thing, and I never like it.

In canon, the idea is that characters never accidentally kill anyone in combat (unless it's part of an arc about how some character is reckless and ready to endanger civilian lives or something). So those fire nation soldiers Aaang throws in the water are perfectly fine. This isn't meant to be realistic, it's meant to be an abstraction: the characters don't kill unless they want to; people do die in the war, and clearly characters like Azula can and do kill people on occasion (offscreen).

You can move away from canon, and go for a more realistic "there's no such thing as a nonlethal weapon", but then you have to update all your characters accordingly, not just your protagonists. So either Aang accepts that sometimes killing your enemy is inevitable, or he goes the extra mile to keep them safe (fish them out of water, or even get them medical attention) and is torn apart whenever doing that conflicts with his greater goals.

Keeping Aang's actions the same while changing the consequences of these actions technically /is/ "bringing conventions from the show to logical extremes", but it feels dishonest to me. I think this is an area where the "If you give Frodo a Lightsaber, Sauron gets a Death Star" principle applies for me. If you make a character more able to detect the setting's inconsistencies, then you have to make the setting more consistent in response; else you're not making a good rational fic, you're just engaging in "I'm right and everyone else is insane" power fantasy.

****** No worries, I understand.

And the reason I disagree is because isn't that kind of the point of rational fiction? To take the conventions of a story and extrapolate them out to their logically consistent conclusion?

HPMOR did this with tons of HP lore that was definitely meant to be there to simply enrich the story, as opposed to being consistent/accurate and it was lauded for it.

Metropolitan Man does this with Superman by throwing in all of the side effects we rarely see in the main stories, such as the political implications, the fact that Lois and Lex are perplexed by his 9-5, etc. Superman being Clark Kent was all for the purpose of story; it was to make him relatable and human, for all that he was not.

Pretty much every ratfic out there is guilty of this; of taking elements of a work that were simply put there to aid/enrich/brighten/enhance//insert adjective here/ and deconstructing it. So it's a bit unfair to accuse Embers of doing the same thing.

It's also worth noting that the soldiers Aang tossed over didn't die but they definitely came pretty close to it; that's why Zuko was so pissed. Not so much because Aang attacked his soldiers; they were on opposing sides and Embers!Zuko is big on honor and all that, but because of how innately hypocritical his actions are. He claims to be a pacifist and not want to hurt/kill anyone yet throws tanks off of thousand foot cliffs and bonds with a spirit to kill hundreds, if not thousands, of Fire Nation soliders (And it's worth noting that Embers characters, for the most part, looks on using spirits in war the same way we look at using nukes which, if you've seen the end of Book 1 in canon, is a pretty damn accurate comparison)

Again, Zuko's main issue isn't that Aang killed (or tried to kill) so many of his people, though I won't say he's pleased about that. He's angry at the sheer hypocrisy of Aang's ideals based on his actions.

******* that hypocrisy only exists because the author tried to make a setting with more realistic consequences without altering the actions of any non-Zuko characters. If canon Aang lived in a world without cartoon physics, he wouldn't throw people off cliffs or into freezing water. Or if he did, he would treat it seriously, like he did with the Koizilla incident in canon. Basically the author insisted on the Gaang adhering to the Stations of Canon when it wasn't remotely rational in context.

******** But Aang is not rational, nor he's meant to be. Both in canon and in Ember. He is a young kid, raised by monks and never exposed to violence and its consequences, who thinks that others kids are the same as him while (in the fanfic) they come from a place where surviving requires killing (animals) and mad and dangerous people are left to die on the permafrost. His friends never feel they have to correct him as they too think he must know the same reality when in fact he does not. It's a much more realistic take on cultural clashes, I think.

**** No one is saying the Fire Nation's actions are just and noble; what they're saying is that the Fire Lord was nuts and the nation had to follow along with it, for the most part. Even canon does this, showing us more and more that the Fire Nation is just that; a nation. With all kinds of people. But most of them just want to live their lives and be happy as opposed to burn down the world.

No one says Aang is evil. Aang is definitely treated as childish and selfish but, canonically, that's exactly what he is. Especially considering the fic starts at the beginning of Book 2, before a lot of his character development. He's also treated as ignorant and naive which...he is. And that's not a bad thing or unexpected; he's a twelve year old monk from a century in the past. It would be more shocking if he wasn't a fish out of water.

Zuko is definitely the main protagonist of the story but he is by no means the world's principal protagonist.

*** I feel like Embers is in some ways like korra, flawed in character while having immense potential in setting and worldbuilding. If anything, maybe it needs a rational rewrite as well.

For those who haven't managed to get through it, Embers has an expanded worldbuilding to TLA, with major focuses being spirit interaction (and old conspiracies), international politics, and cultural differences. I think a lot of the fic is pandering, and the gaang characterization is bad, but the worldbuilding is really good.
