I am not a rationalist. This seems like a fairly large problem in the way of me posting in a rationalist thread. As a matter of fact, I am also completely new to reddit, and only ever come here to occasionally peek at [[/r/rational]] for fic updates. That, and due to a number of factors, I have a patchy idea of how to write english perfectly anyway.

Despite all of this, I feel intelligent today, and had a few ideas on Big Hero Six. If you've seen it, and are a rationalist, you've probably already spotted the most attention-grabbing plothole. Sadly, I have yet to understand how to use spoiler text in my first post, as formatting help doesn't seem to help me there, so there's not so much I can talk about without spoilers.

All that background in place, I'd appreciate help. I am not a rationalist because I do not believe myself capable of performing such a delicate science, as it's difficulty is beyond me. I do appreciate and respect it, though. I'd like to do a rationalist! version of the movie, as a fanfic, but I can't quite get it. Tilt it this way, it's completely anti-climatic. Tilt it the other, and the villain's (It's a super hero movie, of course it has one) plot becomes unstoppable. If someone can teach me how to use spoiler text or PM me, if Reddit does that, I'd like to discuss some ideas about it with a rationalist of some degree or just someone else who respects rationalism and who has also seen the movie without threat of spoilers.

I attempted to figure out the spoiler tag hiding-thing, and failed. Thus, figuring out how to do that would be helpful. Please comment if you know how to do so.

Testing spoiler tags: [[#s][SPOILER]]

Whew, that seems... A little clunky, but hopefully it will work. Okay, so. The main hero is a kid genius. That much is known from the commercials. [[#s][SPOILER]] So, with this in mind, a rationalist! version doesn't seem too bad. But, I run into two problems.

If Hiro is empowered with more direct, rational thought,[[#s][SPOILER]] This is anti-climatic. On the other hand...

[[#s][SPOILER]]

Now, the first rationalist idea can be countered by the second. My only nerf for the second is the idea that [[#s][SPOILER]] , but I'm not sure how valid that nerf would apply.

This is just basic thoughts on the way home from the movie. I won't really touch upon the obvious plot-hole other then that it exists [[#s][SPOILER]]

So... Thoughts? Sorry for being dumb on a smart-people thread. Please go ahead and comment. Don't hold back- If my ideas have obvious logical flaws, I would rather have my tenuous thoughts destroyed then live to be in clear error.

*EDIT:*

Wait a tic. Here's a thought: [[#s][SPOILER]]


** Hey there, and welcome!

First, off: don't be so afraid of rationality. You're not "dumb" just because you notice others being "smarter" than you. Rationality is more of a skill than you think, and to some degree, a lower amount of "talent" can be made up by a larger amount of work and study.

So don't be so down on yourself! You never know what you're capable of until you try, and even if you don't ultimately accomplish what you want, you still learn from the attempt :)

Now, onto the story:

I very much enjoyed the movie, but you're absolutely right that the "genius" characters were cripplingly dumb. Hiro has somewhat plausible excuse: [[#s][]] The villain is the real issue: if it was just some random guy that saw Hiro's invention and decided to steal it, his ridiculously poor use of the technology might be understandable, but as written, we need a lot more.

My idea: change his goal. [[#s][]]

As for what role Hiro and pals might play in that, he might learn of the plan and realize that [[#s][]]

The major problem, really, is Baymax.

Forget the [[#s][]] thing. Why the hell is Baymax important at all? Hiro is unforgivably, brain-numbingly dumb to think that, no matter what upgrades he tries to give him, he would stand a chance against *what he himself made and should know the capabilities of.* He keeps saying Baymax can "take" the bad guy, no matter how many times the bad guy demonstrates that this is very much not the case. That kind of stupidity is only passable in a kid's movie.

Baymax can't just be a comic relief rock-em-sock-em-robot if he's going to have any relevance at all in the story. He has to be something more.

What that is, I think, is up to you, if you decide to write this. I would say that's your first real challenge. For my part, I'd be interested to see how it goes :)

*** Baymax could be given a huge, huge, huge rationalist upgrade if his total dependance on humans was removed. He can reason, but reasons only in canon to serve humans medically. Even as he becomes a superhero, this is purely for his patient's 'mental health'. If he was able to use his robotic inteligence to do goals other then "heal"... I can't even imagine that kind of potential this late at night.

Fist chip: Oy, that's a spoiler, shh. Secondly, because he's a character, as far as meta goes, and thirdly, because [[#s][SPOILER]] , and so of course he's important, at least to Hiro. I will admit he is kind of cripplingly dumb at times, so I'm not sure how a rationalist! upgrade would fit him.

**** Right, the character himself is important, but functionally, he has no uses as-is, other than being a medic. If Baymax was actually /true artificial intelligence,/ that would completely make him useful and awesome. It would also completely change the story. If you're okay with pretty much tossing the script as written, that's the route i'd go.

Hm. I guess that is a spoiler. The phrase only makes sense if you know what happens, and by then it's kind of obvious anyway, but I'll bleep it :)

****** Against the brute-force version of the villain, yes, the fully upgraded Baymax eventually shows some use. But breaking tendrils is just a stalling tactic without the portal to suck them up, and ultimately, him being useful is just what the story required. Against a villain that actually used the microbots to their true potential, he is too localized to stop such pervasive, fast, and deadly threat.

** I was shocked at the stupidity of the characters as well.

1. Hiro's microbots are neat, but the real prize seems like it should have been the headband. A brainwave-reading piece of technology that can transform complex thought to complex instructions without invasive implants? Seriously, the psychic-tech impressed me much more than the metal Lincoln logs.

2. Beymax was innately capable of performing about 30 different complex medical scans in about 1.5 seconds from across the room. His helmet increased this ability to several dozen blocks (through walls, even).

3. The chemist girl wasn't performing science, that was alchemy. Some of her reactions were similar to real chemical reactions, but much bigger and faster. Say goodbye to the second law of thermodynamics.

Those are my top 3 gripes, but there are many more.

*** Honey Lemon, Chemist Girl, pretty much behaves like some kind of idiot savant compared. It looks as if she could whip up a chemical cocktail to do pretty much anything in seconds with a device slung over her shoulder, but it fails to be put to intelligent enough use, especially with the kind of intelligence that she must have to do so in the first place.

Baymax starts off as an idiot, but does gain character development- Very well done character development, as the robot develops only from it's experiences, and we are shown just what it's learning from. Good effort put in there, I'd say. Shame his self-optimization levels seem to be low.

*** Also, the metal lincoln logs are fairly good prizes, too. Brainwave reading technology as evidentally flawless of Hiro's is good... But your limited by the constraints of whatever it's hooked into. You may be able to navigate your computer 300% faster at minimum, but it still does whatever the computer could do before and no more. The Micro-Bots, on the other hand, were shown to be able to do more or less anything imaginable, and thus their pairing with the headband is what greatly increased their technological potency, so to speak.

...does it count as spoilers if it's in the first part of the movie?

I think with a sufficiently intelligent [or number of intelligent] writer, a rationalist version fic of Hero Six would be interesting, given that two characters are designated as geniuses, and the other supporting heroes are probably also geniuses, as it's their technology used later on to become their powers.
