[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3jf4jw/weekly_challenge_dinosaurs/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Dinosaurs!". [[/u/AgentOfDimir]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3jf4jw/weekly_challenge_dinosaurs/cuqenbu]["Calvin was right about everything"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair.

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
This week's challenge is "Defied Prophecy". You know what? [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny][Screw destiny!]] There's no fate but what we make and if prophecy says that something is impossible, we'll just have to go [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible][beyond the impossible]]. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, September 16th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][in the meta thread]]. Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-week
   :END:
Next week we'll be dipping back into the TVTropes pool with "[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][Orange and Blue Morality]]". It's not good and evil, it's not law and chaos, it's some third axis that (tends to) lie perpendicular to normal human political axes. Cthulhoid monsters, paperclipping AI, benthic creatures, fey nobles, and starfish aliens are all a good starting point, though don't be afraid to use simple humans with their own strange ways of thinking.

*Next week's thread will go up on 9/16.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]]. If you want to discuss the week's theme, feel free to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/submit?selftext=true][make a post about it]].

**** I guess it confirms that the person can make a real prophecy, not that the middle bit is actually a prophecy.

Also, I imagined for whatever reason that the prophet must be speaking when making the prophecy, so other people would hear the original. That would make the checksum sufficient.

*** Very good story, I liked it a lot! I saw the trick of the protagonist coming, but it was still neatly resolved. I was expecting an explanation for how the prophets could force the prophesy - something based on acausal reasoning manipulated with precommitments in order to end up with only one possible prophesy - but I guess that would have made the story too long and complicated.

**** Thank you for your feedback. I'm hesitant to explain the events of the story, because I wanted a reader to project onto the main character as much as possible. I kept it vague intentionally. I'm not sure how to flesh it out without lessening the impact for those who projected heavily. My own thoughts about what was happening were [[#s][]]

I appreciate the feedback immensely. I typically write for clarity, so I like to put ambiguity into my short stories. Perhaps I should work on making the ambiguity more focused, so that it could be easily stated by a reader.

**** Well, it has to be finite - there is just a finite (even if enormously big) number of quantum states in your brain, not even speaking about the number of distinguishable neuron states, so the experience has to loop eventually. This does not make it much nicer.
