** Chapter 2 of Future Horismos.

Apologies, my main webserver went down, so I have to host somewhere else. My main website should be up again by mid-June, but the posts will keep coming.

Ch 3 isn't done yet, and I'm gone for a week; it'll be done on time, but leaves me less buffer room than I am comfortable with. That's my fault for procrastination.

And I do know that this form of immortality is not quantum immortality. Closer to a save/reload, but without the connotations of save scumming.

** So, the Richard Haines native to this universe got anomalied out of existence, apparently triggered by the incineration of the time-travelling Richard. That's an interesting outcome - almost as if whatever is tracking him accidentally targeted the wrong version, because the native Richard was a closer match to... whatever parameters it was checking... than the pile of ash was.

If that's right, then burning another Richard would most likely cause either the pile of ash or some other human similar to him to be the next target. Good call on not experimenting further.

... Are all Anomalies like that? Controlled by some teleportation tech that's not working right, so it keeps disintegrating random passerby instead of the person it's supposed to teleport. Maybe even random passerby in another universe, assuming that multiple universes do in fact exist. (False memories are more common than alternate universes in my experience.)

Hope you weren't looking for constructive criticism, all I have here is wild speculation in future plot points.
