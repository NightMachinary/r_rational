I think the core of this story is contained in the title and in Red's ambition, to discover the originating principle of Pokemon species.

I think it will essentially turn out that Pokemon evolve and adapt rapidly, like over a few hundred years you see the progress that we exhibit over tens of millennia.

Just a thought I guess ü§î


** For me it's pretty obvious that this stories resolves around Giovanni building the ultimate weapon against the birds, wich is mewtwo.

Even red psych powers are probably in the story so he can connect to whatever happens in the final battle.

And since that is true, the title must mean something about mew. It makes sense with the rest of the plot. Whatever the rationalization of the origin of species be, it will be about mew/rocket cloning him/mewtwo.

*** This would resonate with canon:

Bulbapedia: "Mew is said to have the DNA of every single Pok√©mon contained within its body, and as such is able to learn any attack."

Pokedex of Pokemon Crystal on Mew: "Because it can learn any move, some people began research to see if it is the ancestor of all Pok√©mon."

** Normal bugs are already like that. So are selectively bred pets (for example toygers, domesticated foxes). Doesn't explain why they appeared all at once though, or how they got the powers with no missing link

*** Where is it stated that they appeared all at once? I was under the impression that they'd always been around. Didn't they discuss the theory that humans are a type of Pokemon?
