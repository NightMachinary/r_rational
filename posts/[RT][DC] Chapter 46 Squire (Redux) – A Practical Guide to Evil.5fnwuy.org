** God damn I love this web serial. I still think that at some point Catherine is going to rip her Seek aspect out of the demon still in Akua's standard, maybe with some neat augment from being part of a demon for so long. We don't know enough Name lore yet, but I wonder if any Named has ever grown into their three aspects and then forcibly taken a fourth at some point.

(Yes her third aspect was cut out by Masego, but when she was in the Name vision I recall the demon saying "Mine," almost as if it was stealing her aspect by corrupting it)

** I've been wondering for weeks if her having "permanently crippled the name of Squire" (Masego) would stick to the name (after someone else got it) or to Catherine (after she gets another).

Who'd have thought the answer would be "neither" and you could simply reboot that thing? Nice job fixing it, villain.

*** Erraticeratta had already answered those questions, I think in a comment reply to a previous chapter. If Cat had gotten a new Name, it would have 3 aspects, and the next Squire would have the full three. What actually happened was actually the one eventuality not covered in the explanation, but it follows well enough.
