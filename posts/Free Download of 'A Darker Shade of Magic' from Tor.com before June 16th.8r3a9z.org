** I have read this book and it is not rationalist fiction. I enjoyed it but don't jump in expecting anything crazy it's just fantasy.

**** Sam Hughes, aka qntm. Hannu Rajaniemi. Peter Watts. Quintessential hard science fiction authors, with Watts in particular having a tendency to make his source citations almost as long as his books are, to contextualise the more outlandish-sounding phenomena he includes in his works.

** 'A Darker Shade of Magic' looks to be an interesting book, but I haven't read it yet so I don't know if it is suitable for this subreddit or not. I just wanted to post about the free copy since otherwise the free offer would expire before I finished reading the book. It's appeal is from the world-building with four parallel versions of London and how the main character abuses his rare ability to travel between worlds.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Kell is one of the last Antari---magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black.

  Kell was raised in Arnes---Red London---and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see.

  Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.

  After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure.

  Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.

** I've read it and it was good, but not hyper rational. It's well written fantasy with a cool setting and realistic characters, but none of them have the "extremely intent on logical reasoning" quality that defines rational fiction.
