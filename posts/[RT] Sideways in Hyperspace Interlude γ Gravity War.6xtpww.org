** Wouldn't the huge momentum exchange tethers have been very easy for the UN/Martian forces to cut? There is no stealth in space and the locations of the tethers would be widely known if they were on the scale needed to transport mass out of Jupiter's Gravity well.

*** location data =/= easy to hit, after all being a tether, it's a thing and long target to hit with good accuracy. Granted either end are perfectly valid targets, but if it can reel in, then it can jink at will and basically without fuel costs, making it hard to hit either end without larger fuel costs to course correct against an evading target, and overall hitting the tether itself would likely be impractically difficult.
