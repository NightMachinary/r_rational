And after iterating the setting into fanfic, e.g. Miltank retains a lot of Cow traits beyond its general appearance, which suit it to the role even outside that real-world context, in much the same way it's not really a "coincidence" that Gyarados is an apex predator.

** We do have Mewtwo's POV on his mental shield:

#+begin_quote
  It is a hard thing to keep my mind *partitioned*. To let the false-hope, the harmless-hope, show on the surface for Sabrina to read, while inside the desperate, anguished, starving hope rends at me. I sense her concern as my mask leaks briefly, and some of my true feelings go through.

  ...Again I struggle to keep my mental mask in place, remind myself of all the false hope I've been fed before.

  ...She sends humor, concern, trepidation. I carefully add resolution and eagerness to my mask. Yes! Thank you for telling me, Sabrina.
#+end_quote

So it's partition based, and the main unique thing is Mewtwo's maintaining two separate partitions/thought patterns at once and hiding one of them. Though he's putting in conscious effort and having emotions leak between them, which is sort of weird if he needs to explicitly add emotion to his "model" mind.

Also interesting that Mewtwo talks about "surfaces" and "masks" in the sense of entry rather than depth, which hasn't really been a concept in these psychic rules I think? The only kinda similar power is Red's unique ability to notice intrusion attempts that only hit his "surface", which'd explain why no one's explored this area yet. Guess it's possible Mewtwo's learned HPMOR-style +legilimency+ occlumency and is using "partition" loosely (not like he has access to psychic literature to know the proper terminology).

Huh.

*** I continue to think that it is just partitions. Like, Past Red will truthfully answer questsions about depression, so will Present Red. The psychic will read both as sincere, but they will not be the same answer.

​

That said, the mention of Psychic Pokemon being able to do tricks that humans just can't might well be the answer as well. Like, the quote above was him a while back. Modern Mewtwo may 'mask' his intentions by altering the memories of those reading his mind or something similar. His combination of human level smartness and pokemon powers has never existed before, so his exploit may not be discoverable by human exploration, like a MaChamp coming up with a 'new wrestling move' that was easy with 4 arms but impossible without.

Does Past Red have memory of everything Present Red sees? What happens if Present Red deletes a memory, does Past Red also lose that memory?

*** I wonder how much of it is from some inherent bit of Pokemon brain/capabilities in comparison to human ones. Like they upfront say in the chapter that there are inherent differences in both mentality and in psychic abilities. I mean they even go so far as to reference the inkay line which is psychic/dark.

Maybe it's even something like a distributed nervous system is enough to "ping" back in a way that is different enough from the human perspective to not be seen the same.

Or I guess in more psychological terms maybe there was enough difference between the subconscious mind and the more surface level thoughts to be good enough to lie, but again be able to be read as lying by Giovanni.

** Aww, Red, was it really that long ago? I'm having a bit of trouble picturing what Blue and the rest were doing other than the change of arena in the footage. But I suspect the second will be right in Blue coming there soon.

I'm liking the exploration of the psychic phenomenon, and I'm glad we have a concrete tie between Red and Mewtwo storyline now, possibly with Leaf and his mum coming into it from their angles too.

Seeing as though the project is almost certainly about Mewtwo, it could be a mixture of Red and Rei's theories realistically, or even Rowans, it'll be interesting to see what they come up with.

  "Does three days seem like a reasonable amount of time to meet again and see how we've progressed along each of our experiments?"

  "I would request longer," Satori says, which takes Red by surprise. [...] She looks at Jason. "Unless three is enough?"

  Jason is quiet a moment before saying, "I think I can do it in four."
#+end_quote

Is this the best mind-reader Satori allowing for the possibility that Jason could merge with Pokemon faster than her... or the best mind-reader Satori detecting his panic at the deadline and requesting more time on his behalf?

Maybe I'm looking too much into it, but when you are surprised /something/ about your model is wrong. Red thinks she is more interested in his idea than expected, but it's possible she is more considerate than expected.

More importantly though, if you actually forget the truth yourself, you would have to forget a lot of connected things so that a sense of having forgotten something doesn't come up too. Even then, you can't lie /strategically,/ and you can't really mislead people nearly as effectively, if you totally blank that part of your mind, even assuming that level of self-editing wouldn't result in super obvious changes.
