** So...the message here is that immortality sucks and it's better to die than do the thing that will make it not suck?

*** Seems that way, and frustratingly apparently it's rational to use anecdotal evidence to avoid examining the things that will make it not suck. Seems like an anti-rationalist anti-rational story if I ever saw one.

*** I think that's slightly mean-spirited towards the story: Twilight's is one perspective. Luna's was another, Cadence's a yet third. Celestia is left undecided as to how to proceed.

Neither Luna nor Cadence found immortality to suck, but Twilight finds a simple end to her existence to be more tasteful than what the paths these two took -- or at least what said paths looks like from Twilight's external point of view.

This was basically a story discussing transhumanist ideas, not really a "rationalist" story.

**** Well, let's examine the options:

- Twilight: decides that her life is boring and / or pointless. Prefers dying to trying anything that might change that fact.
- Cadence: decides that wireheading is the best possible use of an immortal's existence.
- Celestia: keeps doing the same thing (re-creating Equestria and its ponies over and over) instead of trying anything new.
- Luna: Transcends. Granted, this appears to be a positive outcome, or at least might be. We simply have no data -- the only thing we know is that all prior interests and attachments cease to matter.

Also, the protagonist's decision should legitimately receive a greater weighting than the other characters'.

*** And they completely ignore that intelligence enhancements might enable them to think of a solution to their problems.

** The other stories are good as well. At least [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/212395/3/flashes-of-insight/paradigm-shift-487][two]] of [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/212395/4/flashes-of-insight/no-free-lunch-490][them]] are about economics.
