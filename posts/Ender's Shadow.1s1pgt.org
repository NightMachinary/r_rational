** Not sure this counts. It's been a while since I read it, but ISTR that Bean tends to be right by opaque thought processes and authorial fiat.

*** I'd agree with this. Bean is a genius and no one else figures out what he figures out, and the reader can't follow along. Achilles is "evil" and not sympathetic or understandable besides being evil. I think this is more a supersmart character beating everyone by virtue of the author declaring they are a genius and giving them the answers than anything in-universe. Or any application of rational thought in universe.

**** Definitely, the /Ender/ series had pretty good worldbuilding, but it wasn't /rational/ worldbuilding.

** Idk, this counts, right? An even-more-rationalist version of /Ender's Game/?

*** I think so. Discussion probably won't get far outside of people who have already read the book, but I don't see why not.

Edit: Actually it's looking more like this doesn't belong so much.
