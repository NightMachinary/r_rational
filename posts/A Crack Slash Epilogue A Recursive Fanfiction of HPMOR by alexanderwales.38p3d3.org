** I'm mildly surprised that [[/u/alexanderwales]] hadn't posted this to [[/r/rational]] yet, but I assume that he was being modest.

*** Or sleeping and doing whatever he does during the day (work of some kind?). It's only been 17 hours. Maybe he is organised and promotes his writing on a schedule?

Hilariously brilliant story. Interesting how Wales' utopia resembles [[/r/TheCulture]] - reminds me a little of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][this crossfic]].

**** Partly humility, partly because I wasn't sure whether there was any interest. This [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2zakjx/spoilers_all_a_crackslash_epilogue/][was posted to /r/hpmor some months ago as a self-post]], and I figured most people had seen it by now. I've lately been trying to gather together a lot of bits of things that I've written into some kind of centrally organized way. That means putting things on ff.net or on [[http://www.alexanderwales.com][my website]]. I don't really intend to post everything from this cleanup process here, even if some of it is intended for this audience, or was initially posted here. There are a lot of things that were posted somewhere and then forgotten about, either as a Google Docs link or a reddit comment. So me putting this on ff.net is just the first part of a spring cleaning of sorts.

([[http://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/36o0mm/stuff_thats_not_on_my_website_fictionpress_or/][You can find my working list of that stuff here,]] though some of it needs editing before I can post it in a more formal way.)

(Work right now is web development, which means frequent reddit breaks. This message brought to you by one of those breaks!)

***** A lot of people here came from [[/r/hpmor]] and would be interested. But it's very likely that some stopped paying attention to [[/r/hpmor]] when HPMOR ended and didn't notice your post. I know I wouldn't have noticed it if it weren't for the fact that I follow you on fanfiction.net.

EDIT: Is there a reason the story isn't marked Complete or did you forget?

***** If you're looking for more ideas, which you're probably not, I'd like to see your take on protagonist Moriarty. Or maybe you could do a Holmes fic set in the universe of [[http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf]["A Study In Emerald"]]; I've always wanted to see more of that world.

**** Thank you for a very enjoyable two hours reading that link. It's everything I wanted from a Harry Potter / Culture crossover.

(Yes, it's unfinished, but I like stories that don't overstay their welcome.)
