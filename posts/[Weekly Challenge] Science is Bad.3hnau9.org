[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3gs5ko/weekly_challenge_disney_movies/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Disney Movies". [[/u/ZeroNihilist]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3gs5ko/weekly_challenge_disney_movies/cu1s7vx]["Monsters, Incentivized"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations [[/u/ZeroNihilist]]! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
This week's prompt is "Science Is Bad". We're all familiar with [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/][Caveman Science Fiction]]; this is your chance to do it /right/. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad][See the entry on TvTropes]]. Your challenge is to do this in a way that won't be cringe inducing for people in this subreddit. Yes, you can also use this opportunity to do "Engineering Is Bad" instead. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, August 26th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]], and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][in the meta thread]]. Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-week
   :END:
Next week's challenge is "Dueling Time Travelers". Two people, with access to time travel, in some sort of conflict with one another. Your choice of [[http://qntm.org/models][time travel model]], though it's highly recommended that you keep it rational. Yes, you can include more than two people in conflict, or just have one person in conflict with their past/future self.

*Next week's thread will go up on 8/26.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]].

However, following the same line of thinking that other rational redditors have, when they are skeptical of threads with "you suddenly believe you have X superpower" as the truth, I put a filter of doubt on the scenario and would advise going to a psych ED if you ever found yourself in a similar situation.

But doesn't Nick Bostrom's [[http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html][famous essay]] already presuppose intelligent people would believe this already. So that even if you think you are in ...conclusion of that essay... then there's really no extra evidence and the conclusion of said essay isn't to do what's in your black box warning.

So then I don't understand how you can estimate likeliness from that kind of position. I still agree with your black box warning I just think the conclusion might not follow.

I feel like the chances of anyone reading this at this point who is worried about spoilers is small but oh well.

Quick question--the AI's goalset prior to integration was to salvage refuse, right? What caused the change to preserving humanity? DId integrating other AI mean taking in part of their utility functions but not the other, more friendly parts?

  Basically, the main AI, after increasing its computational power massively after integrating so many other AI, got to a point where it broke down its 'salvage refuse' goal. That is, it looked at WHY it was salvaging refuse, the answer being to preserve Earth, so humanity would have a home to live in...

****** The ability to deduce and critically examine its goals is a feature it developed on its own after absorbing enough AIs. It looked at its salvage refuse goal, sought to execute it as optimally as possible, and the attempts to optimize it, along with some narrative magic, meant it developed the ability to deconstruct its goals, in an attempt to keep with the "spirit" or motivation behind the goal, instead of following it verbatim.
