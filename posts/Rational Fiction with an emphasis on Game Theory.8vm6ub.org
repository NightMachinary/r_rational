Hi Looking for fics where strategy and game theory is used, preferably by both sides. Any suggestions?


** The Manga [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Game][Liar Game]] contains a lot of Game theory.

*** Seconded. The first volumes are annoying, but it gets a lot better when the games start becoming more complex, and the main female character stops holding the Idiot Ball.
