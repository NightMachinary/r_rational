*** Yeah, Wildbow is an incredibly prolific author.

But I'm done with Worm, at least for now. 3 months of reading it in all of my spare time was enough to burn me out.

** I just want to know how the fuck Wildbow manages to keep up the volume of writing. I mean seriously, 10k word updates two or three times a week?

*** Practice. Wildbow has conditioned himself for speed over the years. When Worm started, the chapters weren't quite so long as they are now, but he's ramped up as he's gone along. (There was a week when Worm updated every single day, which I think shows that he can go much faster if he really needed to.)

** Is there an ebook of Worm yet? I don't really feel like reading multiple years of blog posts.

*** Nope! Wildbow still intends to do a full edit of the story before starting the sequel, so it's all blog for now.

*** There are various unofficial ones. If nobody has sent you a PM already, let me know and I'll send you the one that was sent to me.

*** If you're planning on devoting the substantial amount of time it will take to read, then you can do what I did and put your own ebook together. If you're strong with python and such there is an ebook creator script on github that you can run. I didn't have luck installing it as well as the necessary add-ons to make it work, so I made my own ebook with a little autohotkey scripting. I just automated the process of copying and pasting the text from the blog post which was extracted with a Readable bookmarklet. It took a few hours of mostly babysitting the script, but when I'm devoting the next month or two of my life to reading this thing, I wanted it on my Kindle and with chapter headings.

I would pop onto the wordpress to read comments on some particularly insane chapters, but other than that I tried to stay off because spoilers could abound since early chapters were still open to comments after the subsequent ones.

*** Also, unofficial ebooks may be frowned upon by Wildbow.

And, of course, no sharing.
