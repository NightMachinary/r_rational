** Finally, I've been waiting for the continuation for what feels like forever :)

I feel that the antimemetics storyline is hands down the best on the site, highly recommend it if you haven't read it yet.

** I think they've done something to the previous stories in the series, so they won't load? It's very appropriate, but outweighed by being incredibly obnoxious. Especially since it's been quite a while since I've read something in the series, and I'm not sure if I've missed something.

*** Going from [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][the hub page]] they all look fine to me except the immediately preceding entry, "Ará Orún"

I'm fairly sure I successfully loaded that page just earlier today, so it failing to load is new since then.

*** This chapter is the continuation of two storylines: Marion Wheeler's and the one with the ghost foundation.

You can skip the ghost one. It's by a different author, and feels more gimmicky, less well-written than the mainline antimemetics series. It really doesn't have that inexplicable oppressing feeling that the qntm stories have.

** What I find strange is that reaction of the rest of SCP is not shown at all. It is as if only antimemetic division exists. It should be other way around - the SCP is more visible and antimemetic is hidden.

**** That is "now". But on the initial stage of invasion there should have been a lot of activity. Takeover didn't happen instantly. There was time for SCP operatives to get something is wrong on large scale. Most dangerous SCP artifacts should have been unsealed. End of the world contingencies activated. There should have been destruction on geological scale. Big part of population dead, cities ruined. Or at least there should be explanation why it did not happen.

***** The Foundation wouldn't activate the dangerous SCPs even in an end of the world scenario. But aside from that, there *is* an explanation for why it didn't happen:

#+begin_quote
  SCP-3125 incarnated the following winter.

  Its first act upon its arrival --- or, depending on the degree of intelligent agency you ascribed to it, the first side-effect of its arrival --- was the neutralisation of the Foundation. In the space of a night, an international staff of tens of thousands disappeared into oblivion, or became amnesiac, or simply dropped brain-dead where they were standing. Foundation Sites became hollow, inaccessible dead zones. A few anomalies broke containment in the chaos, to devastating effect; thousands of others were choked into irrelevant obscurity beneath SCP-3125's antimemetic pressure.

***** How can you possibly mount any kind of defense when you don't even know you're under attack? Anyone who ever found out about SCP-3125's invasion either had their mind ripped out on the spot and their entire personal history and body of work erased, or wiped their own memories with amnestics to make it stop attacking them. You don't even have to know it exists, even suspicion that something like it /could/ exist is enough to draw its attention to you.

Even right up until the very second before SCP-3125 fully manifested, nobody had the faintest idea it was there. Marion Wheeler said it best:

#+begin_quote
  "Do you see? It's a defense mechanism. This information-swallowing behaviour is just the outer layer, the poison coating. It protects the entity from discovery while it infests our reality.

  "And as years pass, the manifestations will continue, growing denser and knitting together... until the whole world is drowning in them, and everybody will be screaming 'Why did nobody realise what was happening?' And nobody will answer, because everybody who realised was killed, by this system...
