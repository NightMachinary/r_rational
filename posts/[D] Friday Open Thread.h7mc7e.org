Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I'm up to 36,000 words in my mid-year NaNoWriMo's knowingly-terrible novel. And I've gone to the second stage of re-developing my writing process, having managed to convince a couple of people to beta-read and offer comments on the draft. Next up, my daily word-count might be slowing down some as I shift focus from world-building and simple character interactions to a bit more on developing conflict and the motivations behind it.

I'm doing the 'write-by-the-seat-of-your-pants' style of plotting, so even I don't know exactly how the plot is going to go, but I do have at least one firm ending point for the story; which means I'm confident I'm going to end up with an actually-complete novel, by the time I'm done.

All in all, I'd currently describe myself as... pleased. Maybe even chuffed. (And I could certainly use another beta-reader or two, to help point out if I stray too far from the rational/rationalist tropes; I'll cheerfully PM a link to the draft's GDoc if asked. :) )

** Itch.io has put together the [[https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality][largest games bundle in history]] in support of racial justice and equality.

I felt bad about not being able to participate because Space Trains is too new for me to comfortably give it away, but a friend suggested I should submit a game from back when I won Java4k. That was deeply tied to applets, which nobody can run easily anymore, so I spent three hours last night porting that to javascript.

So now I have the weirdest damn source code I've ever made. A combination of all the tricks you use to make a game compile small in Java (notably writing everything in one giant function), plus some absolutely filthy shims to use Java's file and graphics APIs in JS.

Also I had to disable the heat shimmer effect because sometime around 2012-2013 it started being painfully slow on all computers.

I hope for their sake that they spend a week in hibernation afterwards first.

**** Mine's not in yet! My little story happened late last night. It'll be Burning Man when it's in.

Some games I would recommend:

- Celeste - Excellent hard platformer

- Super Hexagon - Abstract action game that's actually too hard for me

- Cardinal Chains - A fantastic abstract puzzle game

- Anodyne - Like Zelda, but it's a journey into the uncomfortable parts of your mind. (I would say though that the first dungeon is weak, and the game is much better once you hit the open world after it.)

- Minit - RPG / Zelda-ish thing with a clever mechanic

And games I've heard good things about but haven't played yet: Octodad, Hive Time, Oxenfree, Nuclear Throne, Starseed Pilgrim, Tonight We Riot, Lenna's Inception

** This week I enjoyed browsing through the amazing [[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/ctnlistPubDate.asp][Timeline of Science Fiction Ideas, Technology and Inventions]] by Bill Christensen.

It's a great place to visit if you ever wondered about the first use in fiction of a:

- voice-activated machine ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=657][Detectophone]]),

- machine-translation of human languages ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=658][Language Rectifier]]),

- [[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=664][personalized news]],

- sleep teaching ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=678][Hypnobioscope]]) or a

- fax machine ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=652][Telautograph]]).

All from [[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60944][Ralph 124c 41 +]] by Hugo Gernsback, published in 1911. His writing is an acquired taste which I failed to obtain.

I also learned about the first man-made propulsion system ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=2069][Moon Machine]], 1657). It involves a man "falling from the Moon" on a tree in Canada. Alas, it was not the first story with a machine on the Moon. That honour goes to The Man in the Moone by Francis Godwin (1638). What could go wrong when a man "trains forty wild geese to pull his flying machine" ([[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=3228][Gansas]]) and "doesn't realize that they migrate each year to the Moone". Interestingly, the idea of migratory birds "was not widely accepted for more than a century after the writing of the story".

*** Star Trek, especially The Next Generation, is relentlessly humanist. But not horribly scientific.

Asimov's writings, especially his short stories, tend to be puzzles about how the AI rules he is known for are insufficient, but they're not grim or anything, and tend to have an optimistic feel towards being able to actually solve these problems. (Disclaimer I read these when I was like 12.)

The only optimistic hard sci-fi I can think of off the top of my head is The Martian, in which everything goes wrong but we can fix it because scientists are cool.

As a bit of a weird rec, The Conquest Of Bread, an anarcho-communist treatise from 1892, is relentlessly positive about future technology and progress, but its idea of what's futuristic is more than a little outdated given its age.

(Also you can build friendly AI in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJP0tie-30][Space Trains]], which I think is an excellent game, but I'm biased because I made it.)

** So my birthday passed recently and one of the topics we discussed on my bday hike was academic redshirting: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirting_(academic)]]

What are y'all's thoughts in it? When done voluntarily, does it enhance and encourage success later in life? Naively, it seems like childhood developmental trajectories feature lots of positive feedback loops: extra years of physical development benefit your performance in social and physical competition -> increased confidence asking questions in class, navigating social environments -> increased likelihood of achieving leadership positions; OR increased cognitive development -> higher performance on tests -> placed in the advanced track -> higher test scores applying to college -> qualify for scholarships, attend a better uni, etc.

Skimming the studies in the linked wikipedia article, a lot of them seem to be retrospective (and some confounded by e.g. intentional planning of birth months), with the redshirting driven by a need to hold children back because they're underperforming. It seems pretty intuitive that the initial boost of being a year or two older than your peers will eventually fade as everybody's development plateaus (likewise, students who skip grades will probably do well in life relative to the broader population, since the same factors that allow them to skip might also engender lifetime success). What I wonder about is the state of the evidence on whether to redshirt children who'd otherwise do fine alongside their same-age peers? Have there been e.g. any studies using instruments that capture some underlying causality? (across multiple years' worth of redshirting, not just birth-month effects).

There also seem to be a few plausible downsides, e.g. academic redshirting might perpetuate inequality in the classroom, and unlike other interventions does so in a zero-sum way, or in a way biased towards the wealthy who can afford another year or two without free public school childcare. Or maybe being ahead lets you more easily rest on your laurels -- lacking the struggle to keep up, older students might become slackers without an additional source of challenge or stimulation. Googling around people also suggested the loss of an additional year of income (esp. compounded by investments), but it seems like even a modest effect to overall career success could outweigh that.

(also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/h0hgu3/thoughts_on_academic_redshirting/][posted]] to the ssc subreddit)

*** I view it as a net positive for individuals but at best a net neutral for society. Academic and career success are ultimately competitions against your peers, and having an extra year of development is a massive advantage. You also get long term advantages from positive labeling and self identity such as "I'm smart" or "I'm athletic" that carry forward. Keep in mind that competitive advantages also compound so I would expect a 1% edge on classmates to result in more than a 1% gain in income.

*** Is there anything about doing the opposite? The typical age to start kindergarten is 5-6 with redshirting being 6-7. I'm wondering if anyone has done studies about starting at 4 years old.

**** I'd be curious too -- can potentially envision a mechanism whereby the additional challenge and difficulty forces the kid to work harder to keep up and develop more effective study habits, and then when everybody starts to plateau they keep going a little farther to even greater heights.

(I think both stories are intuitive enough, and good data needed to discriminate between them. Though I guess I myself was greenshirted? Cyanshirted? And don't feel the above description to apply, per se, in retrospect maybe wishing that I'd been held back a bit instead)

*** From the wiki article you linked:

#+begin_quote
  In the academic arena, advantages are seen not for older students, but for those who are young for their year. In a large-scale study at 26 Canadian elementary schools, first graders who were young for their year made considerably more progress in reading and math than kindergartners who were old for their year
#+end_quote

This is consistent with my (limited) experience. But I can see how redshirting is a social advantage. So it's sort of an academic/social tradeoff. Interesting.
