Something related to Harry Potter being able to somehow travel earlier in time than the limitations enforced by the time turner would be a neat suggestion.

I'm however more interested in Ratfics which are traveling even further back in time. Say to a different period. Mainly to understand the preparations involved in packing and planning for events. For instance, going to say Europe near about the time when the Bubonic Plague happened and considering things like people burning suspected witches, or further back around the time of the birth of Jesus Christ, or the purge of Rome or the Byzantine emperor.

*I guess what I'm looking for is historically educational Ratfics involving time travel. Any involvement of magic from the Potterverse is a plus.*

Please let me know if you have any recommendations.

PS: I started thinking about it after watching this: [[https://youtu.be/wPODghAr3Vc][Unlimited Rice Pudding - Exurb1a]].

** Timeline by Michael Crichton sounds like exactly what you're looking for minus the magic. It's about a group of history students who travel back to 14th century France to rescue their professor.

Crichton, best known for Jurassic Park, is also well known for investing heavy research into his works and it really shows in his construction of the historical setting. From the language, to the customs and combat, it's so realistic that I was able to choose this book from a pre-approved list of books to write a report on back in high school history class.

It's not like the ratfics usually recommended on this sub as it's a traditional Sci-fi novel with no magic. However, it's definitely rational-adjacent and educational with a compelling plot.

** It's been more than a decade since I read it, but The Redemption of Christopher Columbus by Orson Scott Card was pretty good for this iirc. First part of the book is the invention and prep, second part is the actual travel and you see more of the prep as it takes place. I feel like it ended with a hint of a sequel that never really happened. Anyway, decent book from what I remember.

*** Orson Scott Card... yikes....

So much wasted talent on a bigot. Ngl, after reading the wikipedia summary of The Redemption of Christopher Columbus, I'm more upset over what this book could have been.

The time travelers come up with the following ideas on how to strengthen the Native Americans:

#+begin_quote
  They use genetically-engineered viruses to spread immunity to Old World diseases...
#+end_quote

...yes, yes good..

#+begin_quote
  and work to strengthen Indian society for the coming European contact, including by spreading a pseudo-Christian religion among them...
#+end_quote

BIG FUCKING YIKES

#+begin_quote
  and outlawing human sacrifice.
#+end_quote

Love the implication here that all native Americans are inherently obsessed with human sacrifice.

You could write this off as it "being a book off it's time" with it being written in the ancient time of 1996 /s but seeing as the author is OSC I very much doubt it.

Columbus also seems to regret the monster he would inevitably turn into but may I ask why would you want to redeem Columbus to begin with? Like if we wanted to redeem baby Hitler, I doubt many people would enjoy reading it besides people who already /want/ to forgive Hitler aka nazi apologists. Columbus is viciously hated for a reason by native Americans. Proselytizing is bad actually.

I also have to acknowledge that while this is an alternative timeline story, it pretends as if everything pre Columbus going to America is fact and not revisionist. Like no, Columbus was always a huge fucking asshole and everyone at the Portuguese court hated him.

**** Card has this seeming obsession in shoehorning his Mormon beliefs into his work. It's so annoying, as once you start to see it you can't really ignore it, and it really ruins the story, at least for me. The spreading of religion among the American natives was such a dumb idea that it undermines the entire rest of the story. It's obviously there just there because his religion hypes the idea of Jesus having come to the Americas.

**** That's a pretty strong opinion there, considering you haven't read the book.

The Aztecs did have a lot of human sacrifice, didn't they? I thought they've found tens of thousands of skulls in some places. So what's wrong with outlawing that?

The religion thing made total sense in the context of the book; they had very limited "levers" they could use to gain influence as complete outsiders, so using religion seems like an obvious choice. It did not come off as preachy, and I say this as an anti-theist.

I read the book before I knew anything about OSC's personal views, so maybe I'd read it differently now, but from what I remember it's a /fantastic/ example of what OP is asking for.

****** I just did a Google search, and apparently human sacrifices by the Aztecs is supported by archaeological records, so what's wrong with what I said?

Asking seriously; not sure why my comment is detracting from the conversation here.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  Some post-conquest sources report that at the re-consecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, the Aztecs sacrificed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days. This number is considered by Ross Hassig, author of Aztec Warfare, to be an exaggeration. Hassig states "between 10,000 and 80,400 persons" were sacrificed in the ceremony.[12] The higher estimate would average 15 sacrifices per minute during the four-day consecration. Four tables were arranged at the top so that the victims could be jettisoned down the sides of the temple.[19] Nonetheless, according to Codex Telleriano-Remensis, old Aztecs who talked with the missionaries told about a much lower figure for the reconsecration of the temple, approximately 4,000 victims in total.
#+end_quote

An estimated 4000+ in one ceremony, supported by modern sources.

** The Xeelee Sequence features heavy use of internally consistant time travel, and the author is a physicist, but is very hard to get into and is all over the place. For example, one book is about a secret society in ancient rome, and then another is about tiny people inside a neutron star, and then a massive alien war, and then a mission to proxima centauri across a multiverse. I genuinely do not understand what is going on anymore.

** Taking a closer look at this paragraph:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I have to recommend the /Time Scout/ series by Robert Asprin and Linda Evans.

The basic premise is that a bunch of rifts opened up to past times and places, some of which are stable, some aren't. The Time Scouts go on to new rifts and try to figure out where and when on Earth they come out. If the rift is stable and goes to a hospitable place, companies start setting up tours to the past, and there's a lot of discussion about the kind of preparations you're asking for.

** *Lest the Darkness fall* - a classic about a modern linguist stranded in the final years of the Roman Empire, and trying to prevent the cultural decline. Not really a rat-fic but close enough: the protag is a smart and reasonable guy, mostly makes rational decisions, and only fails due to lack of information not bad thinking.

*Cross-Time Engineer* - an engineer from 20th century is stranded in 1200s a few years before the Mongol Invasion, and decides to use his technological knowledge to fight them. Again, not a typical rat-fic, more like a engi-fic (the protag sees all problems as engineering issues to be solved with technology, and fails more often at things like [politics and diplomacy)? Not sure if it is a pro or con, but it is also the /most Red Pill and masculine series I have ever read/, easily beating Conan in that regard.
