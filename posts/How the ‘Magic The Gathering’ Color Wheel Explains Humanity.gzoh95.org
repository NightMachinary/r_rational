** As big a fan as I am of [[/u/TK17Studios]], a gentle reminder that this is a subreddit for discussion about rational fiction, not rationality in general. Looking at humanity through the lens of an existing fictional framework does not, I think, pass that sniff test.

I could be convinced this is wrong if you have a good persuasive argument. Until then this joins all the other philosophy blog posts in removal hades.

*** Awesome I love that guy.

Anything else big planned after The Reckoning wraps up?

**** I have an original novel that was half-finished, which I will start over from the beginning (and pretty quickly race through to halfway) before finishing.

I also have a rationality education curriculum that I've been kicking around for years that I might start taking more seriously.
