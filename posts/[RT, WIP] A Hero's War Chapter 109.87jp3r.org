** Calculating lens shapes is doable if you know snell's law and have a good way of solving differential equations numerically. But even if you know the perfect shape, you'll often notice that spherical lenses are much easier to produce. Iirc the biggest telescopes don't even use lenses, they use parabolic mirrors to get an image. Something worth considering, I suppose?

Magic crystals are not birefringent, are they?

**** At what level of detail would you need to know how coal makes heat? I think you can calculate the energy of carbon and oxygen separately, then calculate the (rest) energy of carbon dioxide (probably in a rather complicated fashion, I can't derive it as of yet) The difference is released as heat. Or do you want to understand the process in more depth? Or do you lack a chemical understanding of how combustion works?

****** Quick rundown: A chemical reaction between two substances can occur if there is enough energy for it. Imagine walking up a hill. Your current height represents the energy level of the system. Essentially like this: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Activation_energy.svg]]

Before the reaction occurs, you just have some coal (made of carbon atoms) and some oxygen (technically you have air, which contains oxygen, but let's pretend there's only oxygen even if that makes the burning go much faster than it normally would), preferably mixed or touching each other. What you then do is you add some energy called the "activation energy" for the reaction. It's energy needed to have the reaction occur. Imagine it as the effort you need when trying to push a gigantic round boulder up a mountain. If you exhaust your stamina before you reach the top, the boulder just rolls back down again. So you need enough "activation stamina" in a sense, though it's not actually stamina.

But once you're past the top, the boulder keeps going and stops on the other side of the hill. Chemical reactions are kind of like that.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy]]

In all chemical reactions, you need some energy to have it occur. Now, for some chemical reactions, you don't need a lot of energy. Sometimes even the heat energy you have available at room temperature is enough. Sometimes, you only need a lot of energy to activate the reaction, and you get most of it back afterwards.

Now there's two kinds of chemical reactions: Exothermic (they release energy in total) and endothermic (they require energy in total). Generally, in Chemistry all reactions are theoretically reversible, it's mostly just really unlikely to reverse some reactions. Like trying to unburn a piece of wood. It's essentially a matter of entropy. The piece of wood is a special configuration of atoms. It's not random in the way a randomly placed collection of atoms would be, so trying to add heat to a bunch of carbon dioxide and water wont suddenly give you back oxygen and wood. You might also ask: If reactions, at least simple ones, are reversible, how does matter know which state to remain in? It doesn't, and that is actually something you can exploit. So for example, if you heat up a mix of substance A and B that can react to form C, so that 1 A+1B-> 1C which means that 1 particle of A and 1 particle of B react to form 1 "C" particle. Then you will also sometimes see 1 "C" particle go back and split into "A" and "B". But if you keep removing C's as soon as they form, then you can effectively turn all of A and B into C particles, as long as you have enough B particles for every A particle. So in the case of combustion, the carbon inside the coal reacts with oxygen in the air to form a gas called carbondioxide. That gas has a fairly low concentration in the atmosphere and it'll keep getting removed from the burning piece of coal because it'll spread out into the atmosphere.

Khanacademy has an article about exothermic and endothermic reactions, maybe it'll help you. [[https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/chemical-processes/thermochemistry/a/endothermic-vs-exothermic-reactions]]

Btw, if 1A+1B->1C is exothermic, then you automatically know that 1C->1A+1B is an endothermic reaction.

So that's the chemical side of things. Now if you want to actually describe what happens in these reactions mathematically, and if you want to predict whether a reaction will happen, you technically need quantum physics. Why only technically? Well, chemists are smart people, and they knew they wouldn't be able to work if they took 10 years to calculate if a piece of wood would actually burn or not. So what did they do? They tested it a whole bunch of times, and came up with some simplified models that are somewhat true, and predict results correctly in like 95 % of cases. They're not completely true because they found some reactions that shouldn't work according to them, but that's the price you pay for only learning highschool chemistry. At uni you also learn quantum physics in the later semesters iirc.

****** If you just need an image in your head, imagine coal heating up (vibrating faster and faster) and when an oxygen particle smashes into the coal, some of the coal sticks to the oxygen if you hit the coal in just the right moment. If the coal is not hot enough, the oxygen and the coal can't stick together. Like trying stick a knife into a piece of play-dough. If you only press very lightly, it wont stick, but if you press hard it'll sink in a bit and stay stuck.

*** I would say that Snell's law is known but numerical solvers are still beyond them. Currently, the University focuses more on empiricism than mathematics, even if Cato is recruiting some mathematicians.

Zombie Crystals: They can be magically manipulated to change their refractive index, or activated to turn reflective. The reflective version is a near perfect mirror.

**** This is more of an afterthought, but why do you need the lense in a certain shape if you can just change the refractive index locally instead? Iirc lenses are more about every possible path taking up the same amount of time than being a certain shape. See e.g. figure 36 on page 58 of Feynman's [[https://de.scribd.com/document/358478820/QED-the-Strange-Theory-of-Light-and-Matter-PDF][QED]].

You might also consider so-called zone plate lenses for some applications.

I think you can calculate the shape of a focusing mirror analytically because the relationship between the incoming ray and the outgoing ray is much easier to handle.

***** Hm. I suspect all of those might be out of the range of their current mathematics and lens grinding precision.

Glass is still at a very early stage, I had them mention inventing the float glass technique. It costs a ton of magic to control the heat properly, to maintain a molten metal bath. Just making uniform clear glass is already a significant industrial outlay.

Also in my notes, Cato still has not re-discovered the Normal distribution nor digits of pi/e beyond what he's remembered. Never mind sine and cosine.

If they can grow a magic crystal, could they change its refractive index as a parabolic function of distance from the center? Growing clear crystals is probably easier than making clear glass if the crystals themselves are transparent.

Edit: Are zombie crystals and magic crystals different?

******* Yeah, zombie crystal, if/when they figure out how to make it, can be used as lens material. That is still currently beyond them however.

Yes, there are many different types of magical materials that appear as a crystal. So far, I think I've introduced

Magic crystal - Generated by compressed magic, doesn't seem to do anything; used as power source; high density variant formed in high magic energy and high magic density conditions

Crystal - Behaves like magic disruption when exposed to spells; suspected to be part of the material used to make crysteel; crysteel drains magical energy from spells that contact it

Flare - A red grainy material that is nevertheless crystalline. Sheds heat over time and slowly evapourates back into magic; one of three forms of Fire magical material series (gas/liquid/solid); most efficient heat per magical energy source but also slowest release

Zombie crystal - light manipulation properties? Armour? Stores magic for zombies?

I have not given information beyond what the current knowledge in the story is at. (in particular the fire material series thing is wrong)

*** I cannot rightly claim credit for the idea of using cooling spells instead of heating spells for heat engines.

That comes from here: [[http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=124435&sid=04785fde612c68d5d110ff5fd85dbbe4]]

Where I asked a question about heat engine design assuming magic in this story as the fuel. Though I was thinking more of the airplane version (which wouldn't have coal, instead running on pure magic since coal has weight and compressed magic does not).

Credit to gmalivuk, Zamfir and Tub for provoking the original idea that a "cold" engine was more efficient than a "hot" engine.

**** Very interesting. Thank you for the link.

Yes, magic allows for a lot of what isn't possible in our world. A rocket fuelled by a weightless energy source, for instance. Perpetual motion. Magic that radiates cold instead of the absorption of heat? So many rules to play around with.

***** Of course, this strongly depends on what magic can do at all.

Still, classical fantasy tropes like an ever-freezing sword results in strange and interesting applications like using it as an infinite heat sink.

Suddenly stealth is possible in space?!

****** Lol, yeah. Such a sword could be more useful as a thermodynamics-violating material than as a magic sword itself, as you said. Also violates conservation of energy with that heat-destroying gimmick. Kind of difficult to write about all the possibilities, since you can't exactly demonstrate or test in real life.

Which is why I like stories like these so much. Possibile avenues of research that wouldn't be plausible in the real world becomes "common sense" in a fantasy one, with all the consequences that entails. I like it, please keep it up!
