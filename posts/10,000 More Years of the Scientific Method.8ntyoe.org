** That ended on an unjustifiably optimistic note. Science can do a lot, but you need good politics to fund the right research, and the right incentives to actually try to progress humanity rather that develop Huxley's Brave New World, and I don't see it. Automation, which should have freed up our time, was instead used to not pay employees for that time and will continue to freeze out billions from opportunity while we are hitched to a scarcity-based capitalist economy. Space travel, which was interpreted as a continuation of manifest destiny, was motivated by little more than militaristic posturing and dried up the moment that particular utility was exhausted. No one has yet come up with a reason for space colonisation that's good enough to actually try it, and the reliance on unknown future science to solve problems, especially problems that could be solved by choosing not to cause them anymore, is the same as relying on miracles: you don't know that that future will happen or is even possible, you don't have a plan to get there, your sci-fi imaginings conveniently ignore the chasm between now and then like they all do, and you are not paying sufficient attention to the immediate problems that threaten to scupper that and all other worthwhile futures right now.

** I don't know man, If I could bottle good intentions I'd have control over the most destructive force known to man. And the only difference between an explosive and a propellant is how well you control it.

** Has anyone read the creator's [[https://www.amazon.com/Exurb1a/e/B06XFM14M8/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1][books]]? If the books are anything like the video, I think I'll get them to read.

*** The Bridge to Lucy Dunne is fantastic all the way through. Pretty much all the short stories have the same weight as the video, and they cover a variety of topics. I'd heavily recommend that one to anyone on this sub.

Prince of Milk is a bit more abstract and hard to follow. It's a lot of concepts woven together by a loose premise, which makes it sometimes feel cluttered. There's a lot of interesting ideas that are explored, and all of the characters are written very well, but if you can't keep up with a large cast, I'd say you should skip this one. It's very Pratchett-esque, if that's what you're into, especially the dry British humor.

Logic Beach is one I started but never finished. From what I read, it's very low-concept and it takes the metaphysical aspects of Prince of Milk up to 11. I wouldn't say he got worse at writing over time, but he moved gradually from rational to rational-adjacent in the same vein as Unsong. My reccomendation to pick up Lucy Dunne and move on to Prince of Milk if you really enjoy his style.
