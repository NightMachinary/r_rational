** Yeerks have the right idea. To quote the skin tag, "leave the factory, leave the factory, leave the factory..."

Remember this line from earlier: “Yes. It had been the Howlers' /first/ move, as it turned out---they'd seeded the atmosphere with a plague that took weeks to incubate. The rest of it---the burning, the killing, the torture---that was just because they liked it.”

Everyone who was on earth at the start of the attack is almost certainly infected. A military victory might occur, but is likely not the point of the Elimist and Crayak's game. My guess is that all this is just to set the table for the final dilemma, which is that Jake has Quatazhinnikon's work and Visser 3 has the martian biolab, and synthesizing a cure would take both of these. The entities are interested in a scorpion/frog/river situation between those two.

*** Since my other reply may have been overly oblique - this is a brilliant synthesis and is now absolutely what I expect TK17's been leading up to. I'll add that I think that the reason that multiple times everything the protagonists have done has seemingly been obviated (all of Ventura, acquisition of the local yeerk fleet) is that the contest has come in multiple "Rounds", and the board is reset after each one's conclusion. What you describe may be the championship round.

But it wasn't /just/ because they liked it. If the Howlers had just silently killed the Pemalites with a plague, or the Pemalites had fought back, the Chee would never have come to earth.

***** I suppose I probably should have added a /s. The comment wasn't in reference to what's been published yet.

** So the Yeerk fleet is planning to leave. It is somewhat sensible given the overwhelming nature of the enemy. But they could maybe also take into account the fact that this is only the start. A fleet like this is going to burn it's way across all the local worlds, Yeerk, Andalite and Neutral worlds will all die the same to the Howlers. They should be figuring out what they need to do to fight back, even if not here than somewhere.

Also they think the way out is clear, but they only know it's clear on this end, the Howlers might have mined the exit of the Z-space bridge. Bottlenecks in space are quite rare after all, the chances to kill prey by mining them is a very rare opportunity that I think some of the howlers/some fraction of the howler over mind would take advantage of. It would also be a convenient way for the story to keep the Yeerk fleet in system. They can still leave vial the slow route, but then they probably end up coming out in real space to all their planets already dead. Months of time is too long to be cut off from the universe.

Well, if you want to influence events. On the other hand a few months stuck in a Z-space slow time bubble might be perfect if you just want the Howlers to move on to the next region of space without noticing you.

*** Note: this has not been made obvious to the readers via being explicitly spelled out in text, but the intended interpretation is that the Howlers are /completely unaware/ of the fact that there was a bottleneck. They just headed for Earth on the natural course that they would've naturally taken, and it /just so happened/ that all other routes were blocked.
