** Looking through [[/r/rational/top/]] (and limited to those I've read):

- /The Martain/, a man has to survive alone on Mars (exotic location but small scope)
- [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/?xcbv][/The Cambist and the Lord Iron/]], a story about economics in a small city

Everything else accelerates in scope towards the end or just starts with a scope that's quite large. (Or I haven't read it, or I don't recommend it, or I was skimming.)

** I would have to reread it to see whether it's actually rational, but the young-adult novel /Hatchet/ might be something like what you want; it's just about a teenage boy surviving in the woods. (If you've already read it, let me know whether this is sort of what you mean by "smaller scope".)

****** I preferred /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46128][Perseverance Island]]/, myself--it reads like a game of /Dwarf Fortress/! [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1127697713][It has, however, been excoriated as rather non-rational.]]

** I'd recommend [[http://web.archive.org/web/20090414062819/http://www.asimovs.com/hugos_2009/Truth.shtml][Truth]], a 2009 Hugo nominee novella by Robert Reed.

I'd also recommend reading it with zero information going in, not even the little blurb at the top.

**** Yeah, it doesn't fit with the letter of what you were looking for, but I figured that keeping it contained to a (mostly) 1v1 mental battle made it close enough.

** You need to try E. E. Smith's stuff. It's the trope-namer for [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace][Lensman Arms Race]]

His first novel was "Skylark". They start out with handguns and by the last book they're using entire galaxies as weapons.

Err... maybe you need to not try it.

** More seriously, Larry Niven's "Gil the Arm" and "Beowulf Schaeffer" stories avoid the scope creep that his better known "Ringworld" series is known for. The "Gil" stories are science fiction detective stories, and I find them quite rational.
