** To piggyback off of this, does anyone know any stories that specifically feel more like act 1 of MoL? I love MoL of course, but the points where I loved it the /most/ were in the first act, where surmounting the obstacle with a direct head-on assault seemed impossible, so it was focused more on the trial-and-error, broadening options and trying to learn the intricacies of the repeated month/grow closer to people he originally never paid attention to rather than the more straightforward research-ramping it drifted towards in the later acts. It'd be cool to see a time loop story like it where there /are/ multiple loopers but the big obstacle at the end of the loop truly is insurmountable with normal means so the protagonist entirely has to focus on learning every aspect of the loop and overcoming the antagonistic time traveler that way.

*** It originally would have, I remember reading somewhere that Nobody103 intended to end it with the exiting of the time loop, but the fans heavily disagreed, so he decided to continue it past the exit, I think this was pretty early in the writing, so years ago.

Should probably have made it a sequel? But anyway, now I have more shenanigans to read, so that's OK.

** [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]] and its even more complex AU cousin, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]].

Hard Reset is fairly standard groundhog's day stuff, again with a smart protagonist that powerlevels and doesn't angst much.

Hard Reset 2 is hard reset plus multiple opposing loopers.

edit: after a re-read, I'd like to retract the bit about "minimal angst." It does happen in a realistic, rather than overbearing way though.

Edit 2: after a re-read, it turns out that hard reset 2 isn't actually completed, but ends at the beginning of an arc that slots almost neatly into the original's timeline.

****** It's a legit good story, despite, ir perhaps even because of, its origins. There's a pleasant frission I get from reading believably dark stories that come from a cotton-candy source material. Though I suppose if MLP just isn't ror you, there's nothing I can do.

** For me it's the Ground Hog Day story element that I really like about MoL. If that's the part you're into, there are unfortunately only a few stories that really do that shtick. Someone else mentioned time braid...

Most of the others I've read have been smutty stories on [[https://storiesonline.net][storiesonline.net]] . They have a category tag called DoOver which usually involves only one trip back in time, but sometimes repeated ones. Most stories on the site list their amount of sexual content with some having none, so you can somewhat moderate the concentration of erotica you endure.

I've found the scores on the site to be /relatively/ accurate. Anything over 8.5 probably has really good writing. Anything under 7.5 or so has quirks in the English or the plot that are highly noticeable to me, and anything below about 6.3 is basically unreadable trash.

Because of their Premier Membership thing for unlocking search details, the best way to search the site, after your first page of free results from the Category Search, is actually with Google. Do something like:

#+begin_example
  site:storiesonline.net  DoOver [words/tags you want in the story description such as Ma/Fa] 
#+end_example

You can also add random tags along with the one you want to keep some of the initial results off the first page and get a few more results before resorting to Google--or just pay the $68/year membership if you can justify it.

--------------

I also really like the way magic is done in MoL but again, finding stories with the same kind of universe is hard..

Do you know any particular stories that have distinguishable plotline and writing, and are the closest to be deemed as rational? The generic "I know which industries are going to be booming soon and so I am investing in them" is just a too low-hanging fruit.

**** Most of them are like that, plus getting laid more in high school etc. Some of them are super sappy romantic--be warned if you start anything /labeled/ romantic.

There's a series of stories set mostly on Mars by Al Steiner with books titled Greenies, and A Perfect World and I think one other one. I think it's A Perfect World tha has a guy who gets cryo-frozen, wakes up in the future on mars, and then there's some time travel that would spoil the plot. Not really a full loop though. It has the most realistic depiction I've ever read of what warfare in space and in Mar's atmosphere would be like.

Only real downside to the books IMO is bullshit exposition detailing a vision for a leftist Utopian government (which of course is what his future-mars has. It's not Ayn Rand's John Galt speech long, but it's there.) Characters also love weed a bit much for my taste, but otherwise it's a good series.

*** I really enjoyed Time Braid. There were definitely some weird points (What you mentioned + the romance + some minor stuff), but overall it felt like a strong cohesive story with a satisfying conclusion. Probably the most similar story out there to MoL, and still very readable if you aren't familiar with the Naruto fandom.
