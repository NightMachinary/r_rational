I wrote a short snippet for [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/][MLP Loops]]; and started to write a longer set, but they were rejected due to not quite fitting with the setting.

I seem to have caught a writing bug - since then, I've found myself doing some worldbuilding and plotting for a story. Not MLP, not related to any particular setting; including Hanson's [[http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.pdf][Long-Term Growth]] article as background, as well as cryonics, immortality-seeking, the size of AI mind-space, my usual play with changing the usual one body to one mind ratio, prediction markets, attempts at munchkinism, and other such rationalist tropes.

What I haven't actually done... is make the decision to start writing the thing. Somewhat relatedly, I haven't decided which, if any, online techniques should be used in the writing process (betaing, using Google Docs, etc) and/or where to make the story available (Personal website, DeviantArt, a forum such as SpaceBattles, LW Discussion, etc). I'm posting here to /rational in hopes of evoking suggestions I may not have considered; so that once I know what the available options /are/, I can decide whether or not to pick any... and whether or not to write at all.

So: What suggestions have you got?

  What suggestions have you got?

Just start writing as quickly as possible and publish regularly somewhere. Something really simple like Wordpress blog or Google docs. If you have more energy you can do something more fancy, but that shit is secondary. You can post links to [[/r/rational]] and people here would offer feedback. You can post links to other websites.

It doesn't have to be good in the beginning. It's generally agreed that [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/][Worm]] kinda sucked during the first few chapters, but it became really, really good later on because Wildbow just kept writing a /lot/. Just write and you'll improve.

A piece of advice that's hard to argue with.

"Looking back, I suppose my story really begins on the day I died. Of course, I didn't realize that had happened for quite some time..."

Alternative for an /in media res/ first paragraph:

I woke up as sick as it was humanly possible to be. The only reason everything within five feet wasn't covered in noxious fluids was my GI tract was, mercifully, already empty. Even given all of that, somewhat more concerning was the discovery that my legs ended mid-thigh. Thinking about that used up enough of my cognitive resources that I didn't even try to figure out how concerned I should be that I was hallucinating a pink-furred rabbit-woman puttering around at the head of my bed, and was barely able to pay enough attention to the fact that she was naked to try to remember the more aesthetic details when I could properly appreciate them...

(Second paragraph: Throw in an earthquake, or at least what seems like one, and build up from there...)

***** Okay, so maybe that could be a meta-text blurb, ala part of a novel's back cover, instead of part of the story proper.

I suppose that also means I should leave out anything along the lines of "This narrative is derived from personal memories, available recordings, written notes, and interviews of willing survivors. All of these have their various biases, and narration imposes its own requirements on what to include and what to leave out - but the result is as true a story as I can make.", or any other hedging about where the story actually comes from.

In case anyone's still reading this post... I've written 3,000 words today - and they're gloriously terrible, full of infodumpy badness and horrible conversationing, and attempts to imply things that are so subtle they're downright invisible. It's going to take a near-total rewrite before I'd even be willing to show the result to anyone else to tell me how bad it is. Still... it's 3,000 words more than I've written in just about any day in recent months.

******* I think I've come close to my limit for writing as fast as I have been. I had 8 days of 4k words a piece, yesterday was 3k, and today's probably going to be less than 2k.

I think I'm close to a spot where I can call the first arc complete. I could even stick in a short epilogue right now and call it good. I've had some issues with my last few attempts at writing at pulling off anything like an ending. I think I'm going to wait until I decide whether to call this 'first arc of several' or just 'a novella' before I post a new submission here.

(Somewhere around half Stross's 'Vile Offspring', half Yudkowsky's 'God of Evolution', half the mismatch between virtual FOOMing and the speed of physical activity, and half might never make it into a first-person narrative at all.)

Also, in case it might interest you; the section I've just started is going to explore some of the ramifications a non-superintelligent AI with a core directive and certain constraints. Hopefully an unexpected and entertaining look for anyone who hasn't read the relevant Sequences, and at least a passable iteration for anyone who has.

******** As far as I've been able to work out, just about anything I could write that's post-Singularity and contains a self-insert protagonist that's even vaguely recognizable as being remotely human falls into the 'soft and implausible' range. So I picked a set of implausibilities, and am running with them.

It's still a lot /less/ implausible than getting turned into a cow in a land of magical talking ponies, or going to Hogwart's, and yet reasonably entertaining rationalist fics have been written based on both premises... :)

********* Ok, I've been thinking this over further, and the fact nobody else seems to be reading and commenting, so i should say this: The first part of the story is by far the weakest, but I think there are a few sublte tweaks that can fix this. Specifcaly, /lampshade/ the parts you know are unrealistic given what is known so far, such as the singularity not spreading outside cities. For example, by making the protagonist surprised, or by first stating that they happened INSTEAD of whatever had realistically happened. Second, cut down a bit on the people-being-transformed as the only examples of events, since it risks the reader marking the entire thing as a fetish story and stop reading if they're not into that. Love the story, hope you find this advice constructive.

********** It's been some time since I've tried writing a narration; I fully expected to start badly and gradually get, if not good, at least a bit less bad.

I'm not exactly sure how I'm writing as much as I am, but since whatever I'm doing is working, I'm hesitant to go back and start trying to tweak things while I've got momentum to add more at the end. I don't disagree with your particular suggestion, either; in fact, I'd made at least a few attempts at some of that, by mentioning new species being farmed (heroin-producing snakes, 'red' tea), and should have had the first bunch of farm-girls mention less pleasant curses.

Put another way - an editor or beta-reader or any other source of specific feedback wouldn't hurt. But as long as I'm producing twice as many words a day as I managed with "Myou've" on good days (and that includes cheating by inserting song lyrics), I'm probably going to focus on the one piece of advice that got me kicked into gear: "Just start writing."
