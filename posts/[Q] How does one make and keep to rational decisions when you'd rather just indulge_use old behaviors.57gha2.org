I'm afraid it is - we're a sub for rational fiction, not rationalism in real life :/

** I have one trick, though I haven't tried it out yet (refer question again to understand the irony :P):

Make an overarching goal for yourself. Thereafter, connect what needs to be done to that goal.\\
Eg: Wish to be healthy and run around with my kids and grand-kids and not be limited by sickness, which I am prone to.\\
So, the next time I have to do 3 situps which I can't bring myself to do, I can look at the intrinsic value that it has - bringing me closer to that goal of being able to live a fun life.

I guess that's one trick which helps emotional beings make more rational decisions - a reason with some emotion and big future outcome attached, as opposed to just a standard "practical" reason.

** I don't know about the general problem, but there are browser addons you can install that block access to any sites you're not supposed to be on, like [[https://simpleblocker.com/]] (IDK how good it is, don't use it myself).
