Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** One of my characters can increase the gravity of a single point. This point is the focal point of his eye-lenses --- meaning that if parallel beans originating from one of his eyes passed through his eye-lense they would meet at a focal point, and when both focal points of his eyes meet /that's'/ where gravity will increase. Because of the way our eye-lenses work that means that he can't just look forward and decide where the gravity-point be at an arbitrary distance from him. There must always be something for his eyes to focus on.

He can increase the gravity of the point whenever he wants but he can only have one unusually attractive point in space at any point in time. The unusual attraction of a point has a life-span that gets shorter the stronger the attractive force of the point, but he can also end it at will. After an unusual gravitational point becomes normal he has to wait 10 seconds before he can create another.

If he creates a gravity-point that's strong enough to lift a single coin but too weak to do anything else it will last so long that he has not bothered to check. (I'm thinking of something like a year, but it could be more if necessary)

I'm trying to find a limit to how much gravitational force he can put on a point. I already know that, if several conditions are met, with many power-ups plus a MacGuffin and with him dying in the process he would be able to create a black hole the size of the head of a pin for a tenth of a second, but that's a final-showdown kind of thing and not a very practical limit for daily use.

With the exception of the will-die-black-hole-final-gambit, this is not supposed to be any world-ending, triumvirate-tier power, but it should still be powerful. I'm hoping this story will be something of street-level power fights.

Having all that in mind a) how do I muchkin the hell out of this power --- utility and offensive purposes are all welcome --- and b) what would you suggest to be a limit.

*** Unfortunately, the gravitation effect on an object's motion does not depend on that object's mass - it'll accelerate a bowling ball exactly as quickly as a coin. The limiter on gravitational acceleration is actually "distance from the center of the mass" - since your mass is described as 'point-shaped', this produces.. some inconsistency.

If the thing can pick up a single piece of invulnerable adamantium buckshot at a distance of 1m, then if you put that same piece of shot 1cm away from the point and let go, it'll accelerate toward the point at about 100,000 m/s^2 (and more as it gets closer), pass the point, start decelerating the same way, and come to a stop roughly 1cm on the other side. It should basically oscillate, and fast enough to cut through most things it can come into contact with.

Why 'invulnerable adamantium buckshot'? Well.. when it gets close enough, tidal forces will rip any real material apart - when the acceleration on the front half of the sphere is 1k, 10k, 1M times higher than the acceleration on the back half of the sphere, it will stretch out and deform - that will actually happen far faster than any real material can deform, so it'll really shatter into tiny pieces, which will also all oscillate around that center point as a cloud of metal dust. And we can go further, since the individual atoms will end up ripped apart by the same effect when they are *close enough*.. and ripping apart atoms is pretty exothermic.

This is the problem with trying to create physics based powers that violate physics - the effects always turn out to be explosive because of the boundary condition issues :-\

  gravity-point that's strong enough to lift a single coin but too weak to do anything else
#+end_quote

That's not how gravity works. Gravity affects everything moving through its field the same way. It could be that things larger than a coin are large enough that parts of them get pulled in different directions--because different parts of the thing are in different places--but if it's gravity then it doesn't matter what's where the coin is, it will get pulled all the same.

Gravity falls off with the square of distance. So if the point exerts 1G at 1 meter (like you are trying to pick a coin up off the ground with your power, focusing on your hand) it will exert 10000G 1 centimeter from your hand and that coin will hit you like a bullet.

The way around this is to make it something other than a point. We don't fly to the center of the Earth at 10000G because the Earth itself gets in the way. You could make the power produce a sphere of some size, where outside that sphere it exerts 1G and inside the sphere it does nothing. That is what the Earth would be like if all its mass were concentrated at its surface.

Otherwise, as written... I'd throw a glass projectile with a target painted on its tip. Focus on the tip through the projectile, use my power. The projectile is accelerated forward and my eyes continue to focus just ahead of it. The limit on speed is the limit on how fast my eyes can focus.

*** Any mass has a Schwarzschild radius (the radius of a black hole with that mass), and a point is going to lie within it and be a black hole (which should immediately evaporate due to Hawking radiation if it's sufficiently small), so your mass could be distributed in a constant-sized ball the size of the head of a pin (foreshadowing!) that can be with enough effort swallowed by the Schwarzschild radius.

Gravity decreases with the square of the distance. Think magnets - as you remove magnets a few of their sizes from each other, their force goes from strong to maybe barely noticeable. How far up does it lift the coin? Enough acceleration to hold the coin is one Earth gravity. Enough acceleration at the surface to lift it up from 10 cm away is about 1778 times that. You really really don't want 1778G in the space your brain is moving through.

******* .75 would be the diameter, and Shell's theorem says a spherical mass attracts things outside it as though it were a point mass, so the distance to the center is relevant. Agreed on the sig figs, though 1778 is less egregious and rounding when I say = is also iffy. 1778G also sounds like less of just a statistic than 1800G.

*** Others have pointed out how "only strong enough to pick up a small object" isn't a thing with gravity, and how a focal point becomes a terrifying shredding tool because falling off at a ratio of 1/r^{2} means that when r is very close to zero the force gets an absolutely enormous multiplier.

If I remember my basic physics correctly, once you are inside of an (even, ideal) hollow shell, the gravity of the shell as a whole is basically zero as it is balanced out on all sides.

So obviously the other thing you need to have to limit the power of this ability is that the effect needs to be produced as spheres of varying sizes, with anything resembling a point being a top-level effort.

If the sphere adds a meter per second per minute, it's fairly useless for launching coins but capable of demolishing buildings trivially with a little time. Stuff that enters the sphere basically just ignores it until it exits the sphere, limiting the force that it gets up to, and mostly resulting in stuff settling into a bowl-like shape at the bottom where the gravity of the sphere is balanced by the gravity of the earth, assuming that the gravitation is strong enough to lift things straight up at all. (Which would make it enormously powerful for crushing people with buildings, mind you.)

*** Offense:

Increasing the gravity on a point of an enemy. A stronger field on the eyes or nose of an enemy to mess up their vision.

Utilities:

A weaker field near their mouth if you just want to mess up their talking (like a disliked politician on national news, or someone else trying to hit on your girl). Smaller fields on the head to mess up someone's hair. Lots of pranks like that.

Counteract gravity for jumping higher or cushioning falls.

Weakness:

Distracting the character so they look away and break the effect. Blocking the character's vision with smoke, a piece of paper, etc.

*** Available exploits depend a lot on what exactly the properties of the (infinitesimally small) point gravitational anomaly are. What do you mean when you say that you can increase the gravity on a point? Does that mean you just calculate the total gravitational attraction exerted at that point by all the matter in the universe and then multiply it by some factor? Or do you mean that the gravitational attraction exerted by objects at that point on other things is increased (or decreased?) by some factor. Or both at once? Something else?

If it's actually an infinitesimally small point-shaped anomaly, all sorts of strange things are possible, down to splitting atoms.

If it's not actually a point, then the nature of the boundary of the affected space allows for all sorts of odd things, potentially messing with microcircuitry in fun and novel ways.

With a little bit of practice, he should be able to look /beyond/ nearby objects and, for example, make a gravity point on the opposite side of a wall (albeit with appalling accuracy)

*** Some of you pointed out that this is not how gravity works. It's perfectly possible I had no idea what I was talking about and ended up saying nonsense. As such I'll describe the effect I had in mind when I described the power as 'increasing the gravity on a single point' and try to mitigate inconsistencies from there. The idea is that the point (though if being a point is itself a problem it could be a small spherical region) will attract everything around it with a force that is stronger the closer something is to it. My idea was that if I placed an object in the center of that attractive point/small spherical region it could break in of itself, but it would depend on how strong the attractive force of the point/small spherical region was imediately outside of it, and that is a variable the character should be able to control (though perhaps if it is too weak to break objects in of themselves it is too weak to be of any use at all? I would expect this would depend on the resistance of an object). If it does not break in of itself, the object will be suspended with 0 acceleration, with it's center of gravity and the point/center of the small spheric region coinciding, until either the effect stops or the object is hit by another. And, of course, all of this is relative to earth's center. No things being kept behind while the rest of the plat keeps moving on its orbit.

That one requires something really wonky is going on. Closest I can think of (short of a completely artificial day-night cycle) is a giant ring shaped solar panel at the L1 lagrange point that perpetually casts a shadow on the parts of the planet that are on the border between day and night.

** Any suggestions for munchkining the power of Universal Translation? That is: the wielder of this power is able to learn and subsequently speak, read, or write any language that is known to the target, with very little time required. If the target's understanding of a language is incomplete, the gained knowledge is also incomplete, and with only one sample, or several, the wielder might speak with an accent. The target must be living and conscious. Machines are ineligible.

​

The setting is science fiction, with aliens. While the wielder is technically reading the target's mind, the wielder is not permitted to read or project thoughts or emotions. Body language is, to some extent, included in the definition of 'language.'
