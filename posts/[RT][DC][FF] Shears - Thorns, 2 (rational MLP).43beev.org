** Okay, I have to say this, because every fic does this and at some point I'm just gonna explode.

Equestria isn't a kingdom, it's a principality. A kingdom is ruled by a king or queen, a principality is ruled by a prince or princess. Princess does /not/ mean "daughter of a king/queen", it means ruler, from /princeps,/ which means (more or less, and I know someone's going to swoop in with a slightly more correct definition) "in charge." Popular culture has forgotten, but there were a lot of sovereign rulers whose title was prince or princess.

As far as I know you haven't done this yet, but while I'm on princessly terminology peeves, generally a prince or princess is referred to as "highness," not "majesty."

EDIT: Equestria isn't /necessarily/ a principality. It could be whatever the hell Verona was, or a city state, or whatever, but the generic term would be principality.

In the show there were occurrences of both "highness" and "majesty". Probably, some writers think "princess = highness", and others "sovereign = majesty". Alternatively, they just didn't care.
