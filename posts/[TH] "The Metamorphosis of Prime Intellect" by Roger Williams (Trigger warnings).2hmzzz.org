*** Subjective or objective seconds?

If subjective seconds, you'd experience the universe slowing down exponentially, and you'd probably hit the heat death of the universe in a matter of minutes... unless Prime Intellect finds a way around that, in which case you'd end up alive, but isolated from the rest of society.

If you're slowed down by a factor of two every objective second, you'd experience only two more subjective seconds, and then die.

***** Yeah, that's clearer, and would probably work until external events changed things.

From a Doylist Point of View though, I doubt it would work if such an idea was expressed in the story, PI isn't a genie, and isn't an unchanging Rules As Written system, it explicitly adapts around attempts to commit suicide. One person might get away with it for a while, but once their simulation is so slow as to be indistinguishable from a person in stasis, PI would clarify the rules, and set a lower bound on your possible simulation speed.

  in my eyes, the only acceptable use of a trigger warning is when there are depictions of violence that legitimately could cause a PTSD sufferer a flashback
#+end_quote

This story revolves around detailed depictions of extreme violence. If we go by your definition, a trigger warning was appropriate here.

In any case, I don't think it much matters whether it's called a trigger warning or just a warning. It's courteous to warn people if they're about to view something disturbing. Yes, some people use trigger warnings inappropriately. OP did not, so I don't see a reason to bring up Tumblr at all.

** The same author has a fair number of other short stories, many of them set in a common universe. They're quite good. I used to read him when he posted on Kuro5hin (before it reached infinite suck).

** I find this relevant, although it wasn't actually what I was looking for: [[https://www.erowid.org/columns/teafaerie/2012/05/]]

It covers part of the foundation of the actual thought I've heard from the TeaFearie, which goes something like this, although I really can't do her prose justice with my paraphrase, and is the thought I thought of upon completion of the story:

  What would make the perfect game? Well, for starters, you'd be in it, and other people would be there, too. Then, there'd be challenges. But they'd be challenges you set yourself, and very importantly, they'd scale with your level: they'd get harder as you got better.

  Well - when things are at their best, doesn't that kinda sound like life?

*** #+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No: games involve extra lives. A well-designed game has a space for blatantly reckless exploration of the possibilities. Real life is /great/ at being (often) nonlinear and having no set story you get forced through (freedom), but it's actually /complete shit/ at letting you explore the possibility-space without suffering catastrophic penalties (such as death, destitution, or mental illness). Worse: the tutorial levels (childhood) are deliberately constructed to shield you from the complexity of the real game (real life) instead of building you up to having the strength for it, so when you /do/ get thrown into the real levels (again: real-life adulthood), it's a basically sink-or-swim challenge that breaks a lot of people and dramatically cuts off possibilities for almost everyone.

The biggest barrier /stopping/ real life from being a great place to live is precisely that we are forced to spend most of our efforts on survival rather than on self-actualization or doing good for/with others.

*** It's a fun read, but the author doesn't quite seem to understand that if they're judging the detail of a spaceship with the same faculty that is generating it, the fact that this faculty finds nothing out of place should not surprise them.

**** I don't know. On those rare occasions I'm lucid enough in a dream, and on the much more frequent occasion I can inspect memories of a dream, I can tell I'm not in Reality because there are no unimportant details.

Your suggestion also posits that there's just one faculty in the brain being used for both; AFAIK, indications are that the brain is closer to many faculties that are blurred together. I'd be surprised if Imagination and Observation were the same software/hardware/wetware (or blurred together that much), and I wouldn't be surprised if the involved substances effected one but not the other.

***** No, but, say, if you dream of a spaceship, what's happening is based, in a sense, on your internal model of a spaceship. (And other parts.) It's like a collage.

(Also, what's an unimportant detail? My dreams have lots of details..)

Basically, the dream (or vision!) is a remixed reflection of your existing knowledge. Maybe people don't normally remember their dreams? I don't know. My dreams usually have a lot of detail to them. Occasionally, I can even recognize where it comes from. :)

****** That's neat! Mine don't :P My dreams are primarily narrative based, so unimportant details are things like the deep texture of a desk: totally unimportant to the narrative. Also, I rarely /hear/ words, although I know what people are saying, like I'm reading a book.

Maybe you have your unimportant details in a different medium?

I can totally believe a collage, and while that reduces the required processing capability, it doesn't eliminate it.

That's quite possible. My dreams usually tend to be visually detailed, but don't make much sense plot-wise. (I just woke up, so it's fresh in my mind :) Like, I could probably sketch you a detailed walkthrough of my current one, architecturally, but I don't think I can remember detail except for the precise things I was paying attention to. I think it's filled in on demand? Like, I want to know about a detail and it fills in. So I can recall exactly the marble texture of that stupidly giant staircase I just went down on my way out of the building that started out as a school? and for some reason bordered a shopping center? which was not visible from the outside? And which I escaped through the gardening section before jumping onto a helicopter? ... Dreams, man. Anyway, I can sketch the layout of the architecture in detail, but there's no global sense to it because my brain didn't have a plan going in.)
