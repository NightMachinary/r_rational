[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Reddit-r-rational-upvoted/117575/]]

This is the current list.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate]]

These are two potential additions. I added every story from [[/r/rational]] that had over 10 votes in total and was on fanfiction.net having searched for all top posts. I added one that was on another site and also on fanfiction, Luminosity.

Does anyone have any suggestions for if any of these should be excluded or included? Eliezer noted an issue with Time Braid. Does anyone have any suggestions for must have rational fanfiction on fanfiction?

**** I think so.

- /To the Stars/ is a far-future /Puella Magi/ fic featuring the hardest possible transhumanist science fiction... with magical girls.

- /Forging the Sword/ is, in my opinion, the most-rational Harry Potter fic in a close-to-canon setting.

- /Saurman of Many Devices/: when an author disagrees with Tolkien's view of industrialisation==evil, this is what might happen (with excellent treatment of the setting)

- /Depart Azkaban/ - HPMOR!fic, diverges at the Trial.

- /Son of the Western Sea/ - I actually just posted this one here. It's a very nice post-series Percy Jackson character/world mythology piece.

- /Game Theory/ and /Power Games/ are a rational take on /Nanoha/, where the first-season antagonist is (much) less crazy...

- /Myoushuu no Fuuin/ is a fairly ratioal take on /Naruto/, though not explicitly rationalist.

***** I added the first four. I skimmed them and they seemed fine, took your recommendation.

I look at the fifth. It may be nice, but in the first chapter the main character notes that they are a cheetah and are out of energy, then lifts up a ship. And gets super rich. And gains a new Hermes like power as the plot demands.

As such, I am not sure if the rules are consistent or if the character solves problems through intelligent application of knowledge rather than new powers as the plot demands. You also don't mention if it's rational.

I'll check out the other three.

** It feels like we need separate collections for the "fic that is explicitly rationalfic" and "fic that felt rational to a lot of people on [[/r/rational]]". I wouldn't mind seeing Time Braid in the latter.

I do anticipate that a lot of authors may not /like/ having their work be called 'rationalfic' without being asked about that, which is why I feel like the first collection, "Rationalfic", should be mostly authors who've expressed approval of or inspiration by HPMOR, Luminosity, and the other seminal works. Calling the second collection "[[/r/rational]] upvoted" is unambiguous, and kind to authors who may not approve of us (you can't control who upvotes you).

*** I did note in the description. "These are stories that have been posted on [[/r/rational]] and which the community sees as rational and intelligent fanfictions." so I think the community which I started more fits your second category than your first.

I made it more explicit.

#+begin_quote
  These are stories that have been posted on [[/r/rational]] and which the community upvoted.
#+end_quote

And I changed the title to reddit [[/r/rational]]

Do you think that would be ok?

I see you gave a new name later on. I combined our names.

In my opinion,

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

Milo does things because of the plot, and is aware of that.

Although, I love that fic, so if you're ok with that, leave it.

***** More, he does things because he thinks utilizing his knowledge of the plot is an effective tool to solve problems. He is often proved right. That rule is about irrational actions, not about rational actions that are meta-aware.

Do you have any actions of his that are actually irrational, and so would rule him out? Times when he held the idiotball?

** I think it would be very useful to readers to split the list into categories Complete/WIP/Abandoned. There are many of the latter two kinds, and some people wish to know before deciding to read. What do you think?

**** Yes, you can filter the ones marked as complete, but other than that, it's not too easy to distinguish between "completed long ago, but not marked as such" and "abandoned", or "recently completed, not marked as such" and "work in progress". I was thinking about having the categorization in the community description text. I'm not sure if you want to have this information in the description, and/or are willing to invest effort into maintaining it.

****** Abandoned/on hiatus: Depart Azkaban

Probably abandoned: Forging the Sword; Hogwarts Battle School

In Bad Faith might also be abandoned, though I heard that story has very irregular updates, so I might be wrong. But it doesn't seem likely to be finished anytime soon.
