** Funny thing, better solution you propose is [[https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-78c02092653ffc25064a24fcfd69bc95?convert_to_webp=true][exacly what happens in comics you complain about.]]

Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne has lots of heroes that are protagonist or antagaonist depending on your point of view. Illidan, Kael'thas, Lady Vashj, Maiev, Sylvanas. They took full advantage of player switching sides.

*** Nice, good to see that was used at some point. It still makes that version of Lex a terrible "genius," but a better character than one that just dismisses it.

And yeah, Warcraft 3 and the expansion was honestly one of the best video game stories I ever played. It's a shame WoW drove its lore deeper into the ground with every expansion.

** I couldn't agree more about Magneto. I think that he would be the most promising candidate for a rational protagonist in an X-Men fanfic. Not necessarily as a hero, though if you include some of the stuff from the comics (such as alien invaders) it'd be easy to cast him in that light.

In the movies, his power is massively underutilised. At one point [[#s][X-Men 3 spoiler]] . That makes him astonishingly powerful, and in other scenes he is shown to have fantastic fine control (though it's implied the degree of control scales inversely with the total mass/volume he's working with).

What he should be doing is manufacturing weapons or powering generators or something (or dropping large chunks of metal from hundreds of metres in the air if you really need to just destroy a base). Hell, just put bullet-shaped chunks of metal through the brain of all your opponents, or entomb them if that wouldn't work.

Jean Gray and Professor Xavier have similar problems with underutilisation, but as the "good guys" you expect that sort of thing. If they solved their problems the most efficient way, either there'd be no conflict or it would be portrayed as crossing a moral event horizon.

Villain protagonists are perhaps the most interesting to me, and Magneto is likely the best rational villain from a non-rational franchise.

*** Yeah, as I mentioned in a previous episode, anyone with psychic and telekenetic abilities should be grossly powerful, but it makes sense for them not to abuse them due to morals or the lack of proper mindset. Magneto can do such ridiculous things with his powers that a rational story from his perspective either has to find justifiable reasons to limit him that are never explained in the canon works... or have him win in the first few chapters and then face some new threat greater than his powers can immediately help him through.

** My favorite villain from Justice League was always Darkseid, just from his sheer inhumanity. He is the ultimate evil that seeks to destroy or dominate all of existence for the sake of it, and every word he speaks is drenched with such arrogance you can tell he's talking down to you. The only reason you exist is because he permits it, for now. He's the case of a shallow, evil villain completely embracing his role and actively desiring it, which is kind of terrifying.

My favorite version of Lex Luthor, so far, is from the Young Justice cartoon. While he doesn't have a huge role and isn't even really the main villain, they absolutely nailed his intelligence and personality. He always acts like he's in control even when he's in mortal danger, to the point where he uses his own smugness as a tool to manipulate his adversaries. I totally believe that he is a criminal mastermind that has never been arrested.

The best example I've seen for a villain written as if they were the protagonist is Kingpin from the Daredevil show. He was such an amazing character it didn't matter if his plan was never fully explained, and despite the horrible things he did I felt empathy for him at every step. He was a monster, without a doubt, but he really believed in what he was doing, had people he cared about, and was even afraid of becoming a villain when he didn't want to be one.

Kilgrave from Jessica Jones is just as well done, though in a completely different way. He's a completely unrepentant monster that believes people only exist to serve his sadistic pleasures, and the story is so good at putting you into his warped mind that he never feels shallow. He also ties in perfectly to the protagonist's conflict over victimization and the show's themes about sexual abuse and stalking.

I wish I could come up with favorite villains that weren't from superhero stories, or superhero noir in the case of JJ, but most of my favorite stories are more about the protagonist facing an internal conflict, a nebulous antagonist, or an ambiguous situation. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has great villains, but I still found the conflict with them to be secondary to the personal struggles of the other characters.

*** Yeah, there are some fantastic antagonists from manga/anime and books and movies, but for whatever reason superhero stories come to mind quicker than most when I consider villains. Hell, Quirrel is one of my favorite antagonists ever, but he's not even really an antagonist for 90% of HPMOR.

** Wizard from Wicked (musical). Even though he's mostly absent villain it's clear how big impact indirectly he had on heroine life. His lies filled her with fales hope and made her better person. And when finally confronted he doesn't drop the act. His [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c4JuzT_X5E][villain song]] is all about how he is not bad person. He invoke everything that cast him in better light, and even for a moment convince heroine to his side. It's never explained if what he said is truth or tailored lies.

Adversary from Fables. He has great backstory, slowly going from good intentions to despicable villany, never stoping thinking of himself as a hero. He munchins his fairy tail powers and goes to conquer multiverse with them. Even than he makes every possible precaution and listens to advices of his generals. And he trully loves his children.

*** You're the first fan of Fables I've seen on this subreddit, so I want to know: Why do you like it? I heard it was great but I gave up after 10 or so issues when it became clear I didn't like any of the characters and they weren't developing into something I would like, which is really bad for a drama. What's especially weird is that I loved the very same characters in The Wolf Among Us, and enjoyed the drama in that game immensely more than in the comics.

**** Simply put, it gets better. First three volumes (18 issues) are not representative of the rest of the series, they lack many key characters and aren't realy in the same genre. Main plot kicks in volume 4: March of the Wooden Soldiers (issues 19+), and series shifts focus to big battles, great heroes, combing magic and technology, political intrigue and tactical planning. There's still personal drama but many great characters are added, so don't worry about getting stuck with characters you don't like.

It's also not that wierd that you didn't liked characters in first issues. Wolf Among Us is prequel, but they retroactivly included years of character development.

***** I got two chapters into Wooden Soldiers before I decided nothing had improved since I had last stopped. The writing is still bland, the characters are still stupid and/or assholes, the plot still moves too slowly, and people's expressions still look weird. It's like a soap opera, and I don't think increasing the scale of the story with war and politics is going to make me care any more than I currently do.

I liked The Wolf Among Us because it was a noir story that explored themes surrounding poverty, crime, and prejudice in a community. It wasn't perfect, but it knew what it wanted to be and pulled it off thanks to good acting and writing. The comic just kind of...happens and I don't care about any of it. I don't understand why I'm the only person who feels this way.

I haven't gotten far enough into Fables to tell if I agree with you or not: I only read the first two issues that a friend lent me after Wolf Among Us, I believe it ended with the coup attempt at the farm. I enjoyed them, but not enough to go out and buy any more.

In any case, you can probably rest assured you're not the /only/ person who feels that way :) Somewhere out there are others who lost interest in the comics and just never posted online about it in places that you've seen.
