Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I guess the answer is probably "yes", but: did you see the news about someone in China creating the first genome edited humans with CRISPR?

[[https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/claim-of-crispred-baby-girls-stuns-genome-editing-summit/]]

There's a ton of ethical and safety questions but at least the specific modification attempted here seems relatively benign - a gene whose suppression should make people resistant to HIV and malaria. However this goes in the future... this is probably one day that'll end up in the history books, though right now it's passing by relatively low-key.

*** i think the biggest problem is unexpected negative externalities, such as if the gene has a problem with some other gene that isnt expected. it could be a problem that only shows up generations later. is there a recessive problem with it? does the gene do something else besides its intended purpose?

**** Eh, good questions. I understand very little of the topic, but I've seen people claim that /suppressing/ the gene was already a therapy used for HIV. So basically all this is doing is removing it altogether. The main issues with this I can see is:

- errors can happen - did the CRISPR really only alter that gene?

- is there any unforeseen interaction or consequence that can take place in later generations because of this?

I'm not sure whether there would have /ever/ been a fully ethical way of testing this in humans, though. It's not like heart transplants, where even when the technique was rudimentary it was applied to adult people who could consent and for whom it was the only chance at a slightly longer life anyway.

** I just played my favorite take on a true detective game (i.e. a game about genuinely deducing stuff based on limited though sufficient evidence). It's called The Return of the Obra Dinn ([[https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/][Steam]], [[https://www.gog.com/game/return_of_the_obra_dinn][GoG]]). A ship lost at sea has returned years later, with no-one on board. Your mission is to find out what happened to each member of the crew. By the end, you have a complete list of 60 crew members (including passengers), know how they look like, and have listed their fate (dead incl. cause of death and possibly perpetrator; or alive incl. where).

HPMoR is a great detective story, with far more satisfying deductions than typical crime novels. This game felt similar. Probably worth a top-level post here.

EDIT: I think [[https://steamcommunity.com/id/alphyna/recommended/653530/][this review]] is a good take on what's so special about the game.

**** There's a really interesting post about the graphics: [[https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.msg1363742#msg1363742]].

I suspect the compression artefacts in the video are interfering with some of the strategies used to reduce discomfort, since video compression is really not built for things like this, but I don't know for sure as I haven't played the game. The videos also look a bit different to the link above, so maybe it has been changed since then.

**** All I can say is that the graphics didn't detract one bit from the gameplay, for me.

In case anyone is unsure about the game but wants to try it, two options are a) briefly trying the [[https://dukope.itch.io/return-of-the-obra-dinn][free demo]] from 2016 (though given that it's from years ago, it might look quite different from the final product) or b) buying it on Steam and, if it's discomforting or not enjoyable, requesting a refund (if such a thing matters to you, this is also sanctioned by the dev [[https://twitter.com/dukope/status/1052969879572078592][here]]). The latter requires a Steam playtime of <2h, and having bought the game <14 days ago, but is essentially automatic if both conditions are satisfied.

It's good. I end up guessing a lot though by the end. Would like to see someone figure out how you can figure out properly the names of the four Chinese sailors or that guy torn in half who I kept thinking was Irish, for example.

Guessing it has something to do with the numbers on their bunks? Or is there a less time-intensive way?

**** Regarding the Chinese sailors, there's a spoiler discussion [[https://steamcommunity.com/app/653530/discussions/0/1732090362050477541/][here]]: The hammocks in the night scenes at the beginning of two of the chapters have numbers corresponding to the crew list. You can also check the "who is present in the scene" thing to see that all the ca. 22 people in the hammocks are obviously sailors and topmen, not midshipmen, stewards, officers or passengers. So that already reduces the possibility space by a lot. Some sailors you can directly identify because they're lying visibly in their hammocks; in case of the Chinese sailors, only their shoes / socks / etc. are visible, but are visually very distinct.

In general, the [[https://steamcommunity.com/app/653530/discussions/][Steam forums]] of the game are full of discussions, including what hints there are for identifying each person. I recall a great thread that explained how to identify all the seamen, but can't find it anymore.

Oh, and (more spoilers) [[https://gameplay.tips/guides/3292-return-of-the-obra-dinn.html][here's]] a list of more evidence for all characters. Seems like a very useful resource once one has beaten the game. Though despite what the article may say, there's probably way more supporting evidence for many of the characters than the author found - given the absurd attention to detail of the game, I'm very skeptical about claims like this one: "Hamadou Diom. You can't tell who Diom is by his appearances or his hammock. You can only identify him after you've identified all of the other sailors [...]"

** From Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill, this quote matches my intuitions about how the world works, but it goes against what I've learned from my exploration of rationality.

#+begin_quote
  Analysis of several hundred people who had accumulated fortunes well beyond the million dollar mark, disclosed the fact that every one of them had the habit of REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY, and of changing these decisions SLOWLY, if, and when they were changed. People who fail to accumulate money, without exception, have the habit of reaching decisions, IF AT ALL, very slowly, and of changing these decisions quickly and often.
#+end_quote

Rationality is a tool that should be optimized to reach our goals, so if we reach a suboptimal action/thought/decision, then we are not acting rationally. The attitude I've seen from our sphere has been of careful consideration during decision making, and a willingness to change the decision in light of new information. Napolean Hill wasn't a very sciency guy and it looks like he exaggerated some of his claims, but he clearly knew how to be successful. So what happened here?

Hypotheses:

- People predisposed to making quick decisions have other traits that help them be financially successful

  - Perhaps we are predisposed to slow decisions, and this unintentionally selects for people less likely to have these traits

- Making decisions quickly (and not changing them) has other effects that I am not accounting for (such as minimising distraction, increasing determination)
- The data only accounts for highly successful people, not considering quick decision-makers that have failed or fallen into debt

But these effects would have to be severe to give such a low representation of slow thinkers. If rationality works properly, we should expect at least some bias towards success? So:

- I've missed some key information and I'm misrepresenting rationalists or financially successful people
- Rationalist dogma doesn't account for some detail that affects financial success

*** Napoleon Hill wasn't being scientific, the plural of anecdote is not data, and success isn't a skill.

That said, people who make decisions quickly and change their mind slowly are risk takers and most extremely rich people are, indeed, risk takers. You've realized part of that is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias][survivorship bias]]. I think most of the rest is iterative: People whose risks pay off early become more likely to take risks, people whose risks do not pay off become less likely to take them.

Starting in comfort, or even wealth, also helps: If your consequences for failure are low, you can afford to take more risks before you start getting shy. If you fail, you won't wind up in Mr. Hill's sample.

Now there /are/ people who get modestly rich without taking big risks... by living below their means and investing the remainder in reliably safe vehicles. The old book of choice for that method is George S. Clason's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon][The Richest Man in Babylon]]. Safe investing is still about being slow to change your mind, even if you're slow to make decisions.

So rationalist dogma and wild financial success do not necessarily overlap (as Nicholas Nassim Taleb put it, "If you're rich, why aren't you so smart?") so temper your expectations. A lot of it really is being in the right place at the right time, and being willing to take a gamble and stick with it. None of that requires much in the way of slow thinking...

...and none of it is a guarantee.

**** I don't believe you when you effectively claim that financial success is based on luck to such an extent that good decision making is not even a noticeable factor.

Napolean Hill gave lots of methods to promote success in his book, completely unrelated to luck. And there are plenty of other authors with methods to improve the chance of success. It is entirely reasonable for a rationalist to need a large wealth, and would seek out such resources. An effective rationalist could benefit from these more than the 'not smart' businessmen that you've implied make up the obscenely wealthy demographic.

But they don't.

I'd assign 99%+ chance that there's a genius to these businessmen that isn't being fully realised in our formulations for what makes effective decision-making. That is, excluding my main hypothesis that this discussion has already taken place and I've simply missed it.

***** Both Hill and Clason wrote their first books in the Roaring 20's, both of them lost almost everything in the Great Depression, and both of them tried again and succeeded. Hill's rises and falls were cyclical thereafter, Clason decided to settle down.

The millionaires Hill was interviewing were the business and innovation successes of that bubble era. People flocked to hear their secrets the way people still flock to the words of get-rich gurus like Robert Kiyosaki and Stephen Covey and Tai Lopez. The thing that makes /them/ rich (sometimes impressively so) is those self-same secrets. It operates a bit like the Emperor's New Clothes. If their advice isn't working for folks like us, either we're not doing it right, we're not doing it enough, or we're not really as smart as they are after all.

I don't believe it.

Good decision making /is/ a factor to obscene wealth. These tycoons and innovators aren't idiots. They wouldn't be rich if they hadn't had some good idea at the right time, and not just anybody can do that. People who aren't them could have, though, and didn't. They had that idea too late, or they had another idea that didn't work out for some reason or another. Maybe they started their map business right before the Great Depression. Oops.

*If you want to make money, live below your means and take some smart risks with your excess capital.* If you want to get obscenely rich, go ahead and try to find and foster the next big thing. Be aware, however, that you're not alone and that upwards of 80% of businesses fail. You'll likely invest years in it and have it blow up in your face or just sputter out to nothing. If you really do find the actual thing that people want, there's a chance you'll still be an also-ran as somebody a little quicker or sooner or better situated than you runs off with a slightly more successful version of your idea.

Stuff like that happens all the time to wannabe tycoons and innovators, and very few of us will ever know their names.

****** Ok, I see what you mean. Let me see if I got you right: There are a lot of unpredictable factors that affect the financial success and the number of savvy businessmen >> savvy rationalist businessmen. The savviness that they exhibit is not consistently reproducible, but people with similar personalities/abilities will be able to to use it, corrupting Hill's sample. The ability difference between an effective rationalist and a smart Hill-like person is not enough to noticeably impact the quantity difference, and so after the filter of luck, the 0.01% is vastly dominated by these Hill-like people.

I agree with your assessment, but I can't be sure that this all there is. It's still entirely possible that some part of their success comes down to reproducible techniques (other than the one you mentioned), whether or not they've identified them. I don't know how to rank my new confidence though, though it's less than my previous one.
