Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I've mentioned a thing I'm working on where a guy who goes serial-isekai'ing gets minor boons. He's got fifteen boons. Here's what I've decided on:

Out of the five Primes (Soul, Society, Body, Mind, Works) the MC has Soul (Mana-Sight, which leads to further options for magic and divinity) and Society (Comprehend Languages, leads to further social options).

There's a sort of Path of Exile thing going on with Constellations of boons, but they form between them Skies. Bardic Sky, which the MC has, is composed of...

- The Constellation of Language; four boons plus the Social Prime (hands, eyes, voice, mind as capstone). Write/sign, read/interpret signed language, speak, and finally think natively in all languages.
- The Constellation of the Traveler; five boons. Poison resistance (including food poisoning and ingested toxins), disease resistance (including things like the water borne fecal stuff), seasoning food you're cooking by singing at it with an audience (approximately), weather sense, wayfinding as a capstone.
- The Constellation of the Sojourner; four boons. Appraisal (both knowing how much something you want to buy is worth in the context of the sale, and how much something you want to sell is worth), intuiting social dynamics when you arrive somewhere new, one more non-capstone boon, and one capstone boon.

Finally, the MC has the Capstone of the Bardic Sky, which gives him the soundtrack of his own story playing in his head. He can't use this to guide future decisions - no playing twenty questions using the music as an oracle - but it's still super useful both to understand the context of the scene he's in and because it makes him immune to mind-reading and mind-altering effects. (If someone tries to read his mind, all they get is TMBG songs.)

I ask your help because I am terrible at naming things. Along with the two boons I haven't decided on, what are the dang /names/ for these things? I don't even know what style to go for. Obviously for the Bardic Sky capstone it'll be something flowery like "And Ever Was A Song Upon His Lips", a-la Chanter song names from Pillars of Eternity, but should I do that for the others as well?

Also, I need some help coming up with things he /could/ have gone for that linked out of the Soul Prime, which he didn't. Doesn't have to be super detailed, but hit me with your coolest equivalent ideas!

*** Oh, hey, I remember this guy! Mostly because he managed to hit my comfort power fantasy of gradually acquiring subtle but useful boons, especially mental ones. That aside, I also like naming things, so I'll try my best to help you with this task!

So, it might be nice to have a naming scheme that has capstones /feel/ like a pinnacle, something that was worked towards, while maintaining a coherency between them. Given the bardic theming you're going for, perhaps have them form the lines of a poem-esque thing.. For example, with the Constellation of Language, you might have "With Open Hands", "And Open Eyes", "Let Open Mouth", "Bring Open Minds". Alternatively, for each to sound a little better individually rather than as a group, you might just have open hands, open eyes, open mouth, open mind. Want to remove the repetition of open? I would help but I accidentally got it stuck in my head.

For Traveller, you could have "Stomach of Charcoal", "Blood of Silver", "Voice of Cinnamon", "Skies of Glass", "Feet of Mercury". The last two lose a little of the obvious connections that the first three had, but there's still an obvious theming. Less poetry like, though. If you want something more mundane sounding or game sounding, something like "Strong Stomach", "Pure Blooded", "Song of Spice", "Internal Barometer", and "Guidance" might work.

For the Sojourner I'll just give some mundane sounding ones to peruse. Appraisal is already pretty game-sounding, and then you could have "Social Cartography" for the second.

As for Soul Prime stuff, the mana sight thing made me think that a Constellation of the Farseer might be cool. Five perks just off the top of my head... Vision extended into UV/IR a bit would be a nice opener, mostly makes things look more interesting but also works as heat vision a little? Vision of how 'open' something is (easier to wound, enter, insert into, etc) sort of as an constant overlay/additional pair of eyes inside your own that feels natural. No trying to open locked doors, identifying weak points in objects and creatures, and so on are all consequences. Then vision of metaphorical 'impact'. Another overlay/sense, but this time gives a subjective assessment of how important things in the environment will be. More important things, and those more important in the near future look 'brighter' to this sight. Looking at a screen with an image would only show how important the screen and the image in particular are. They 'dim' if they have finished being important. For a fourth boon, momentum sight. Seeing the future physical paths of objects for a short while in the future, becoming more accurate the faster they move. Then for a capstone... Connections sight, to mesh with his Society Prime? Seeing the connections between people as another overlay, different 'colours' meaning different sorts of relations, and 'brightness' being the intensity of that connection. Of course, in all these cases the colours would be indescribable to someone who hasn't seen them, for fun :D

Hope this all helped, or at least gave you some ideas!

** How would economies and ecosystems, at various levels of size and tech level, be different in a galaxy/equivalent that had far more iron, nickel, and cobalt, and far less hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon, silicon, etc. due to all of it having been used up in fusion long ago leaving? What would the actual alloy/mineral that you end up instead of the kind of rocks that are common here be like?

Actually, I'd expect far more rocky planets, since those CAN be made of iron, and there's much less of the mass tied up in hydrogen stars and gas giants.

** So I have a question about mental illness and rational choices. If you are not sane, meaning you have some type of major mental illness, can you still be rational? To quote a joke from a certain Batman comic:

See, there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum... and one night, one night they decide they don't like living in an asylum any more. They decide they're going to escape! So, like, they get up onto the roof, and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moon light... stretching away to freedom. Now, the first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But his friend, his friend didn't dare make the leap. Y'see... Y'see, he's afraid of falling. So then, the first guy has an idea... He says “Hey! I have my flashlight with me! I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me!” B-but the second guy just shakes his head. He suh-says... He says “Wh-what do you think I am? Crazy? You'd turn it off when I was half way across!

Do either of the men count as rational?

*** No, neither men are rational in that story. Both men have a distorted and untruthful conception of how reality works and reason on that basis, which is irrationality. Rationality on the other hand is developing good, accurate reasoning that is widely applicable, and that will lead to being correct more often than not. [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv/what-do-we-mean-by-rationality-1][More on that here.]]

To answer your first question(at length), I think yes, it's possible to be mentally ill and make rational decisions, but it gets increasingly difficult the more serious the disease gets. At a certain point mental illness isn't something you can work around with good thinking patterns, you will have big blindspots and vulnerabilities in your worldview and decision-making. One might think I'm referring to schizophrenia or something equally serious, but even boring old depression or ptsd can make it impossible to make rational decisions or have rational thoughts about certain topics.

To use a personal anecdote, I suffer from severe depression and I regularly(every few months) self-medicate with LSD or psilocybin mushrooms. The sheer difference in my thinking patterns before and after I dose is so stark sometimes... It's hard to describe it. It's almost like I get the ability to look at myself from a third person point of view and make truthful evaluations of myself, as myself. Or perhaps I lose that ability when I'm severely depressed. Put it another way, it's like a recalibration of the relationship between my id and my ego, allowing me to ignore certain physical imperatives and focus on mental ones(or vice versa) or to better prioritize one mental imperative over another one. If you feel that doesn't make much sense, welcome to the club. Thankfully it mostly works without my having to understand it.

Anyway, I know for a fact that my ability to make rational decisions at my lowest points are dubious at best, even(sometimes especially) straightforward decisions with no downsides that are completely for my own good. It's aggravating, but a part of life at this point.

*** Most mental illnesses make you irrational, but someone who is entirely sane also cannot be rational; rationality requires you to be insane in just the right direction. Psychopathy helps, very /mild/ depression helps but even slightly more intensity than optimal pluge you right back into irrationality, and there are several kinds of things that aren't recognized mental illnesses but anyone on the street would recognize as utter insanity and be correct that are very much true and a rational person must believe. There are also a number of things that any rational person will realize are true and will /cause/ mental illness in any sane OR rational human, requiring you to be insane in the opposite direction to cancel those ones out in order to remain rational.

Well, more or less, I am kinda simplifying things and being dramatic because I don't feel like spending hours on this random reddit post.

*** Hmmm. Difficult.

The first man may be entirely rational; he may, in fact, have an entirely sane worldview (albeit with some psychopathy). He /proposes/ the Flashlight Plan, but that doesn't mean he thinks it will /work/ - he might be deliberately suggesting something that he knows will fool the second man.

The second man, again, may be entirely rational. He hears the proposal of the first man, hears and recognises the unstated assumption in that proposal that a flashlight beam can be walked on. Perhaps he knows that he is insane; that his assumptions of how the world works are occasionally suspect; and therefore, perhaps he accepts the unstated assumption in the question as true without comment. And then he finds a different flaw in the plan (that he cannot trust the other man to keep the flashlight on), realises that that flaw on its own is sufficient to reject the plan as proposed, and then rejects the plan - based on the flaw he has recognised.

*** I would argue that anyone who is purely rational is throughly insane. For example a complete sociopath who cannot feel empathy yet is very smart, could probably emulate empathy convincingly or perform socially manipulative tactics to execute rational plans, yet they'd still be classified as "insane" if they took an honest psych eval. Also, severe mental illness comes in many flavors and "insanity" is generally regarded as an antiquated/outdated medical diagnosis.
