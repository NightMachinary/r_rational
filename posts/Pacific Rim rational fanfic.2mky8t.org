Basically what the title says. It continues the story of the two scientists, Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb, after the events of the movie, and deals with the physical and psychological fallout of a decision they make (spoilers: to mindmeld with the alien species in order to save humanity).

It is /very/ intelligently written and includes a lot of science and philosophy, although it does focus more on the characters than the plot (not much happens action-wise), so if you're not into that I wouldn't waste the time (it's quite long). Additionally it's quite an involved universe, so probably a lot easier to understand if you've seen the movie beforehand.

It's definitely rational fiction, and probably not rationalist, though I'm not 100% sure. Either way it was one of the best stories I've read in some time, clever and thought-provoking and hilarious at moments as well, so it comes with my full recommendation, whatever that's worth.


** The first chapter is extremely full of itself. I can't stand to read it. I can just see the author congratulating himself after each sentence: "I am so awesome. And intelligent. James Joyce has met his match."

*** I feel I am in the same boat, I've pushed through it and while the writing is so needlessly complicated and incredibly difficult to read it is written very well in that style.

It's something that I think is very rare to find so consistent, even with the obvious issue that it is so pretentious that it fills a niche for that kind of writing.

**** It's also very repetitive but I suppose that tends to happen in mental breakdowns and I don't think I've read a better way of putting the reader in the mind of those enjoying cognitive he'll
