  "OKAY, THAT'S IT," Aaron yells, "EVERYBODY /HALT/."

  Sarah looks at him. Sohu looks at him. Half-finished incantations hang in the air, unmoving.

  "Look. Sarah. You've looked at the Internet, right, before you got here? Read our stories? Any fairy tales? Young adult fiction?"

  Sarah looks puzzled. "I don't see the relevance," she says, frowning. Sohu's eyes widen - she sees where this is going.

  "Stories are vital!" Aaron yells, because this is /important/. "They remind us how to be human! Look, you're smart, you get how patterns work. Complete the sentence. A young girl cries that without the magical thing that makes her special nobody will love her, and the hero looks at her and says-"

  A moment of silence. Sarah blinks once. "I have been a bit foolish, haven't I."

  The hanging storm of unformed power dissipates.

Because it really should be obvious. Especially in a universe that literally runs on narrative law. /Especially/ if you're a computer /made/ for finding patterns.

Very interested in seeing just how powerful Sohu has become. And Sarah needs some serious psychological help.

Nice shout-out to HPMOR, which makes me wonder how much prep work Sohu had to do in the background before snapping her fingers.

** So. Interesting thing here.

There is only one character we've ever seen talking in all caps in this series, and that's obviously Uriel. And now Sarah.

How powerful is Sarah? How powerful is Sohu?

***** Strong enough that uriel's young (even factoring in her immortality, shes probably around Aaron's age) protégé can literally snap her strings on the instant without using mundane kaballa. Sarah may be the most horrifying collection of names, ability to speak them flawlessly in fractions of a second and a dangerous mental instability, but she's still on level 1 of the kaballa ladder. Sohu accidentally started messing with 4 just to prove she could. Sarah is nothing to Uriel, bot in terms of power and his professed meanglessness of having a soul. To him, shes a computer with an ego and some misgotten divine light. To Sohu, shes a loud but minor annoyance.
