** I keep on trying to get you guys into dawnSomewhere, and it keeps not happening.

But he mentions HPMOR in this one, so yay.

I recommend the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNC_sRuPtMonAOP46gqW9Q6E4ESFmum6d][mechwarrior series]] on the same channel. Politics, economics, giant robots, guerrilla warfare, and military tactics.

This is mostly just him rambling on about all the lovecraft tropes, fair warning.

*** I watch some of the series from this content creator, although I was already into it before you posted the mechwarrior video.

But hey, now you know at least two people in this subreddit watch Dawn Somewhere, so that's nice.

*** God, I love Dawn Somewhere. Greg's rambles aren't necessarily the best introduction, though.

** Ooh, Lovecraft! I'd love to watch this whole video, but it's half an hour long and he seems to ramble a little bit. He repeats himself a lot, and the "but"s and "yeah" in this video are off the charts. Maybe a script would help him get to the point more quickly.

On that note, what story should I read as an introduction to the mythos?

*** Couldn't say, he has a few suggestion in the video, but they've slipped my mind.

Consistently outputting content is important, and I think that's he idea behind the personal times. Quick low-production-cost video's. He seems to be trying to do things across a range of production values, to see what sticks.

But yeah, I honestly don't expect this to be very appealing to most of the people here. I generally watch them in the background, while I'm doing something else.

Added a disclaimer to my root-level comment.

** This is half an hour of a guy talking. I have to know what it is and what it is about before investing that amount of time. As far as I know it could just be a guy rambling on for half an hour trying to rationally deconstruct Lovecraftian horror stories or something.

Yeah, that's about it honestly. He occasionally has interesting points. I tend to put it on in the background.

I expected this to be downvoted, it's not as good as most of the rest of the stuff, particularly [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Jd5Vsca9Y&list=UUSNd59iRYuFSqo-vb0qjJuQ][this]] (for sheer production quality), which hasn't historically done well here. Video's aren't a format I think most of us like. And none of it is really rationalist.

**** I'm confused. What then was your rationale for posting this video in particular? Also I don't think people have a problem with videos. They just have to know what they are investing into. And of course they have to be both relevant, interesting and of some quality.

***** My rationale was mostly that he mentioned hpmor in this one, and that I think you guys should probably watch the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNC_sRuPtMonAOP46gqW9Q6E4ESFmum6d][mechwarrior series]] by the same studio.

I tried to more or less imply as much in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2iybwh/personal_time_with_greg_lovecraft_mythos/cl6l9x3][this]] comment.

Last time I posted his mechwarrior series, it didn't get much of a response. Because it starts off a bit rough, and it is a time commitment. My hope is that by associating the author with the whole "lesswrong cluster" people will be more inclined to see it through, and one of the rare video-things I enjoy will get more viewers. Hopefully making his viewership more rational-subculture and less pony-subculture.

Especially since he's trying to get into original content for legal reasons.

****** Is mechwarrior rational media then? I don't even know if said mechwarrior show you want us to see is a narrated fanfic or a cartoon made by him or him just talking /about/ something called mechwarrior.

******* It is a parody, so no, not rationalist /per se/. But it's a parody that will happily talk about debt based economies for a while. I wouldn't call pratchett "rational" it's a fantasy world that doesn't really run on reductionism. But at the same time, it talks about the real world.

So sort of like that.

Consider that series to be mechwarrior fanfiction, basically.

******** So let me follow your thought pattern. In order to gain more viewers for a show you like (that is an intelligent parody of another show) you take a monologue of the guy who makes said show and post it on a subreddit that was first inspired by a fanfic that is mentioned in passing in said monologue, this being the only relation between show and subreddit?

mechwarrior parody <-> half-hour monologue by same person with passing mention of a fanfic <-> subreddit about rational fiction inspired by fanfic

Seems like a bit of a convoluted way of doing things.
