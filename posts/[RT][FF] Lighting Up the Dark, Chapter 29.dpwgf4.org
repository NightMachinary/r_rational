** If only naruto was a little older and aware of certain kinds of things, he might have called out his elders for raping drunk civilians and then joking about it.

I really wish that part had been treated more sensitively. I know it goes over naruto's head, but the mission he was just tricked into by those older ninja was esssentially to commit sexual harrassment.

Most readers who read this chapter who arent already familiar with velorien will assume, however rightly or wrongly, that the author is okay with rape and sexual harrassment and that he thinks it's something worth joking about. This is not something to take lightly. Velorien I urge you to retract this chapter and edit it. At the very least put some foreshadowing in that what these ninja are doing is dangerously unethical, even if naruto is too young to understand the implications of what hes being told to do. make the humor look like it's meant to feel uncomfortable and meant to not really be funny, rather than just being presented/treated as straight up light hearted fun. Seriously you are a good writer and you can do better than this.

That's a pretty extreme take away. I don't think most readers assume that an author condones the things that happen in their story.

**** You know, I used to think that, but I have had a number of unpleasant reality-checks along those lines over the past few years...

I mean you can't please everyone all the time, and a lot of people carry biases into a story that affects their reading comprehension. But there are definitely people who seem inclined to think the worst of a writer if they touch on certain topics at all outside of very narrow circumstances.

*** Thank you for your input. I'm sorry you've had such a negative takeaway from the chapter.

I must admit I am bewildered by the notion that including ethically dubious behaviour is inherently equivalent to condoning it.

I should also mention that "teenage boys attempt to peep on girls at the hot springs and receive their just comeuppance" is a well-known manga/anime trope, and nobody familiar with the medium of the original series would assume that that its presentation is intended to validate the boys' actions.

While I'm here, this is in no way a comment on you personally, but I'd like to mention cultural double standards. This is a work in which violence, from comical to attempted murder, features repeatedly, yet I believe this is my first serious call for censorship.

**** Sorry, this might sound a bit condescending, but explaining this entirely will require crossing too large of an inferential distance for a single conversation to suffice. I will say that its not a mere matter of the inclusion of the questionable content itself, its a matter of how its presented and narrated. Most readers take context and tone and presentation and style into account too, not just the literal meaning of what is being said and shown. You really need to learn to understand how things look to readers and how to present things in a way that will come across the way you intend them to come across.

As a skilled writer, you ought to be using Presentation mindset a bit better. Presentation mindset is made of communication mindset and facilitation mindset. Facilitation is made of tactics and strategy, which is good if you're trying to write something that maximizes the chances that readers will interpret the writing the way you want them to and minimize the risk of misunderstandings. Communication is made of semantics (scripted analytical communication) and empathy (unscripted spontaneous/creative communication). You need to improve your skill at using empathy mindset and then apply that to improve your presentation mindset.

The mindsets are the fundamental building blocks/similarity clusters that all skills are made of/fall into, and at their core they are made of bayesian probability stuff, even if it's not always immediately clear how.

Hope that helps at least a little bit.

There's not much else I can tell you that will be understandable until extradimensionalcephalopod writes and posts more of his lesswrong sequence.
