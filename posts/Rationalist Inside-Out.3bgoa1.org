So as you might be able to guess, I just saw Inside-Out. I liked it a lot, and given it's focus on representing the mind I felt it would make for a neat rationalist fic.

Now often when doing this on more fantastical works folks are tempted to make sweeping changes to make it make 'sense'. In this instance, I think it would be better to make the minimum number of changes necessary for it to be internally consistent. The biggest thing to think about would be whether to treat as an abstract representation, or as its own 'world' to be investigated. It would probably depend on the story you want to tell.

As for introducing rationalism to this conceptual mental world, there are a few options. Maybe the five basic emotions are dealing with a complex problem and one of them goes into the long-term memories to figure out how to be a bit more effective. Maybe the person in question did that making a mental construct thing that some suggest, and they bring them in for advice. There are a number of options, really.

So basically, does anyone have plot or world ideas? I'm pretty sleep deprived right now so I can't think of much beyond the basic concept. I thought of one possible plot, but it's a bit personal so I don't know.


** BTW, I'm vaguely disappointed that the last shot in the credits wasn't the camera zooming in on Joy's head, and then Joy's Joy's head, and then Joy's Joy's Joy's head, and then...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11334905/1/Further-Out]]

I invite anyone to use this microfic I did as a starting point for a rationalist Inside Out.

One additional, more weighty idea I had, that was far beyond the scope of my little microfic: Actually Changing Your Mind. How does the structure of Riley's mind change as she applies rationalism with deliberate attempts to improve herself mentally?

** It would be one eight year old humanoid avatar inside a grimdark Jurassic World mental setting. Mostly pools full of mindless fish and hungry, scurrying, scared little mammals. Oh, and somewhere a clever little lizard with delusions of grandeur, stomping all over everything. It's barely cadged, and sometimes the power to the park defenses goes down, or the one lone frightened human has to venture into the greater park area to fix something that breaks, and leave the neat little tourist concession stands that do nothing but provide her with empty comforts.

** I would replace the five basic emotions with a bunch of more realistic sub-minds, either anatomically (visual cortex, limbic complex, prefrontal lobes, wernicke's area, ...) or conceptually (with analogues for all seven sins, and the story would have them turning out not to be completely bad guys after all).

"Hey, why isn't she doing anything, she's just sitting on the couch."

"SLOTH!"

"Don't look at me, I've been locked up all this time..."

Gee, it seems that when you lock up someone's motivations they veg out. Who'd have guessed?
