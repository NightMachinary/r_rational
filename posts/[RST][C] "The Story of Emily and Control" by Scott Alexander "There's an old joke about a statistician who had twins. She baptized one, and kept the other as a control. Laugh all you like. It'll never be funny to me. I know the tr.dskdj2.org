  What if the next morning, I had found Control dead? Then I would know with all the certainty of science that it was better to die than to live; that life was empirically and incontrovertibly pointless, that those who passed away were the lucky ones compared to us condemned to remain on Earth.

  And if I saw her the next morning, bright and lively as ever? Oh God, how much worse that would be! It would mean scientific proof that no matter how wearisome and unpleasant life become, what awaited us beyond the grave was far, far worse. It would mean living in fear of an eternity whose content was unknown, but whose dreadfulness was incontrovertible.

I mean, even if you accept the premise that Ouija boards work, it's a false dichotomy.

Let's change out the "destinations" here.

#+begin_quote
  What if the next morning, I had seen Control at the airport? Then I would know with all the certainty of science that it was better to travel than to live in New York; that life in NYC was empirically and incontrovertibly pointless, that those who traveled were the lucky ones compared to us condemned to remain in NYC.

  And if I saw her the next morning, bright and lively as ever? Oh God, how much worse that would be! It would mean scientific proof that no matter how wearisome and unpleasant life in NYC becomes, what we would find by traveling was far, far worse. It would mean living in fear of a world whose content was unknown, but whose dreadfulness was incontrovertible.
#+end_quote

It's reducing the entirety of existence to the dichotomy of "If Emily thinks [A] is better than [B], then [B] is pointless; if she thinks [B] is better than [A], [A] must be superlatively awful." It ignores the range of outcomes between "[A] is better than the best possible experience of [B]" and "[A] is worse than the worst possible experience of [B]."

And then it leaves it there, with either option being a source of existential dread, but /not knowing/ is fine, which might be the bigger crime against rationality.

If there's a question where the decision you make based on the answer will be the same /regardless of what the answer is/, then you /don't need the answer to make your decision/.

So, if either answer leads to existential dread, he should be experiencing that /regardless/ of the choice Control makes, and even /in ignorance of/ the choice she makes.

*** I would think rational horror stories should involve a lot of adult fears (e.g. children acting out bedtime stories with real life fatal consequences) and unnerving or disturbing implications. Like a "road to hell paved with good intentions" kind of thing, or the ending of the monkey's paw where only the vague shape of the horror can be discerned. Fear of the unknown, a feeling of claustrophobic paranoia, that sort of thing.

As others here mentioned ITT, it was a big leap in logic and a suspension of reader belief to think Ouija boards work in that story, without any prior set-up. Otherwise, it just feels like the guy is trying to escape being associated with an ex's possible suicide attempt.

**** I totally get what you're saying, that's why I described it more along the lines of creepypasta-- it's not a rationalist horror story from a writing perspective, it has plenty of problems, etc. But creepypasta as a genre is very bare bones in worldbuilding and is more about an atmosphere or evoking specific fears emotionally. The dread itself that the story is aiming to evoke struck me as rationalist in its themes. Does that make sense? So, not rationalist fiction, but creepypasta evoking rationalist-adjacent themes.

The only two that really get me are the one about [[https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/White_with_Red][the pale woman]] and the one about [[https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/The_Portraits][the angry paintings]]. Both have that "OH NO" realization at the end where there's nothing supernatural* or even dangerous, just creepy as hell! (*The linked version of white-with-red has ghosts, but not all do, it's a pre-internet campfire story so there's a million versions.)

The fact that they're both about realizing people were staring at you probably says more about me than the stories themselves, lol.

**** But it's consistent with her beliefs to test it! How can you not respect someone that dedicated even after her sister has died. I would have to imagine she'd be looking for a reason /not/ to do the same as her life without her sister is hardly all roses, is it?

But that's just my interpretation. I've found recently that having people support you in times of hardship is absolutely vital for mental health so perhaps what I would say in the context of the story is, I'd want someone to be there for her in a similar way to her sister, and I'd be willing to be that person even knowing the story behind the situation.

That's along the lines of my main anti-suicide position.

The universe has been around for billions of years, which is a really long time. And, according to current theories, will be around way, way longer than it has already.

If you want to be dead, that's fine, you may have good reasons to desire that. But compared to the universe, you're only going to be around for a small blip of time. *There is plenty of time to be dead, later.* Try to make the most of this unique opportunity you have right now.

For a while I was sketching out a story involving a mad psychologist with twin children, testing out the common fantasy trope of "twin telepathy" by raising them to believe they were one individual with two bodies.

*** Hmmm... if I were that scientist (and had the capacity to perform unethical experiments on my own children to roughly the extent a very rich person really could, along obviously with having no morality), my thought would be to try and make that "twin telepathy" a bit more literal by implanting a chip in each one's brain somewhere (where specifically would depend on exactly what you wanted to accomplish) connected to a wireless control system such that when there's a lot of electrical activity in the brain region around the chip for one twin, the other twin's chip would generate matching electrical pulses, meaning the chips would basically coordinate to synchronize activity between the twins in that area of the brain. Ideally including some way to inhibit activity in that region too so that it can be adjusted in both directions. Maybe that gives you some ideas?
