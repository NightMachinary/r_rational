The premise is a female paladin is sent to a remote outpost for misfits and renegades to recover from her PTSD after a group if necromancers murder her husband and son in front of her.

The reason I'm asking here is because the rational aspect of the story is the antagonist necromancers who have(at least on the surface, sensible rational goals that they attempt to achieve in sensible rational ways, including using the settings burgeoning scientific knowledge to use their magic in new and unique ways)

***** Sorry I missed these notifications! The protagonist is battling PTSD in a manner that is realistic(ie not used solely for plot advancement or freak outs) and the antagonist necromancers are not only skilled:rational adversaries, but have their own sensible goals besides “we're evil neecromancers let's make a zombie horde”.

I would say PGTE tops it, but I would definitely recommend it, as the author has since properly edited the story from when it was just available on a PDF, and it's much improved from something that I thought was already quite good.

Also the supporting cast is quite good, with the cimmmon theme being every soldier sent to the camp they're in is recovering from a tragedy or some kind of job related screwup.
