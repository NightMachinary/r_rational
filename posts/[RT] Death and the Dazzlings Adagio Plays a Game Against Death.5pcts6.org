** Yes it's fanfiction of /My Little Pony/. No it doesn't require any knowledge of the show; in fact it could have been written as original fiction with only a few minor details changed.

Either way, it's a short story about Adagio facing Death and coming up with a clever solution using his rules to bring her friends back to life while worrying about whether or not to trust her friends and I recommend reading it.

You really don't have to justify that. We've had them before. They're awesome.

*** If anyone wants another /My Little Pony/ story about meeting with Death, how about [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/225100/1/long-live-sonata-dusk/long-live-sonata-dusk][Long Live Sonata Dusk]]? It's not necessarily rational (which is why it's not in it's own post), but the subversion at the end is just so clever, I feel compelled to share the story. It's a similar premise where Sonata meets with Death, but with different "rules".
