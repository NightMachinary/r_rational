** I have been keeping up with every single new chapter of this fic. I am also a GM who made the mistake of recommending this story to his friends. I'm either going to switch to a homebrew system or just institute a "If Jake does it, you can't" house rule.

Cause I have to.

**** As a point of pride: some of what Jake has done is original. For example, the Wall of Iron trick and the cannon. Even the Helm trick was original, although I later learned the internet thought of it first. Curse you, internet, for preemptively stealing my ideas! :)

** Oh, that reminds me. So, cannons don't work because explosive reactions aren't part of DnD physics. Why did the antimatter transmutation thing work, then? It's not like antimatter is any less a phenomenon of real-life physics than explosive combustion is.

** Left a review (I know, wow, right?) wherein I speculate on balanced binary trees and possible logistics issues.

I still can't help but wonder... what's the velocity of a commoner railgun, really? If you transport someone five kilometers, they arrive six seconds later. If you transport someone five hundred thousand kilometers, they still arrive six seconds later. A light year, and it's still just six seconds.

So where are they, during the course of the turn? In transit? They must have some experience of being transported. Either time is stretched out for them, so they experience the turn of every person who is transporting them every leg of the way even though they themselves only formally get one "turn" (booooring) and each person transporting them only experiences that one turn in between (so time is local, not global), or... they teleport. What's the experience of traveling by commoner railgun?

What happened to E=MC^{2} ?! Why is time twisting like a pretzel?

EVERYTHING JUST BREAKS DOWN. /SOB/

D&D is seriously so broken...

Edit: Also, correction for my review - it shouldn't be called a tertiary tree. I think the proper term is ternary /or/ trinary.

*** Yep, ternary tree.

Let's see...once Grǫfhamr is organized as a balanced ternary tree of 50,000 nodes, 1/3 of all nodes are in each subtree. Given that you start at an arbitrary node and need to travel to another arbitrary node, 2/3 of the time you will need to travel to another root-child subtree, which means the root is a huge bottleneck (the city is also far less defensible the way it is now, but that's a separate issue).

There are only a few nodes that are of particular interest, however: the exit (root node), the bathrooms (distributed fairly evenly throughout the tree; each cluster has one), the waste disposal vats, the water creation plants, the store (of which there will soon be more than one since redundancy is good), the food engines (much less important now that the store(s) are there), the war room, and the homes of any friends.

The friends are the real problem. Before, people would have mostly been friends with their neighbors, so very little travel would have been required. With all the nodes being moved around so much, people are now thoroughly scrambled and friendship groups are no longer near each other, requiring far more travel. In practice, most people will simply lose touch with the old friends and make new ones. How often are you willing to walk ten miles to chat with your old neighbors?

** All this bending of space gave me a thought...

We're in the D&D world where adventurers impossibly carry around tens of thousands of gold coins in their little belt pouches, and the gold weighs nothing, right?

But are there any rules anywhere for the weight of -raw- gold, like gold ore or something? Or even if not, the world would probably accept non-money gold as being a physical object that must be hauled around, no?

'Cause if there is, you could rig up a wallet with a fire trap or something hot enough to melt the gold inside the pouch. Think that'd count as changing the gold from an abstract unit, to a solid mass of suddenly very heavy molten gold?

You could make some -really- awesome cannon shot with that, or make orbital strikes even more deadly. Hell, maybe you could even make it so that the sudden appearance of so much mass in so little space collapsed into a black hole! (There'd be no risk of it devouring the world, since it'd evaporate almost instantly, but it'd give you one hell of a boom and completely annihilate whatever the goldsphere was plopped on, for much less magic than a sphere of annihilation, probably.)

Also, I kinda wonder how well Grǫfhamr would react with a [[http://ihititwithmyaxe.tumblr.com/post/22331104288/breaking-d-d-3-5-the-locate-city-nuke][locate city bomb]]... The explosion could be centered on the entrance hole, no? And if you had a second guy there to close the passage up on the same round as the mage casts (readied action?) then the townspeople would be safe from the blast... I think

*** Ooh. I like the idea of cannonballs made out of gold. I'll have to use that -- I'll credit you when I do, though.

The locate city bomb is actually the reason that I added the "no such thing as metamagic" rule to the world: doing so eliminates so many abuses. It's not like casters aren't overpowered enough, you don't really need to give them new and highly abusable mechanics on top of that.

Metamagic is a good example of a problem I've struggled with throughout the story: when Pun-Pun and other game breakers are a thing, how do you make it so that the characters can be smart and exploit the rules, but can't use these game breakers? You can't just say "well, they didn't think of it" -- these people are literally superhumanly smart, and Jake has read plenty of internet posts about exploits.

I have a solution that I've been using: when you exploit too badly, the gods smack you for fear that you will ascend. This is literally Deus Ex Machina, and readers may or may not like it, but it makes perfect sense given the overarching plot arc. (Which involves things that haven't been revealed yet.)

**** Eh, I like the gods thing. It makes me think that there must have been some /previous/ two-year-emperor that put the fear of gods into them.

I did some more searching around, and it turns out there /are/ rules for money weight. According to [[http://dungeons.wikia.com/wiki/Gold_Piece][this wiki]] the offcial rules are that 50gp weighs one pound, in second edition and up (first edition it was 10gp to the pound.) So I guess whether goldshot works in TYE would depend on whether they honor that rule, or go with the more common unwritten weightless-money house rule.

** I just read the entire thing. That was awesome. Is it still updating every Saturday?

Also, if they kill high-leveled vampires, given that they used to be good guys, can they be resurrected to fight for Flobovia? And would the Helm of Opposite Alignment work on a lich?

*** Yep, still updating every Saturday. (And, <shameless>if you felt like dropping a few reviews for chapters you particularly liked, it would be much appreciated.</shameless>)

Yes, if they found a vampire who used to be non-evil, they could destroy it, resurrect the original person, and that person would be back to their original alignment. Of course, the trick to making tiger soup is in catching the tiger....

Yes, the HoOA trick would work on a lich. The chances that you could get a lich to hold still for it are minimal, though. The method they used on Colburn would be very unlikely to work on, say, Hammond or Afi. Colborn is an arrogant jackass who assumes that he can muscle through any problem. Afi is an enormously powerful caster who has been around for tens (rumors say hundreds) of thousands of years. He's got backup plans for the backups of his backups of his backups, and he's not going to be caught by such a straightforward trick.

*** Hm. Not a bad thought, actually. Thanks. :)

One thing I hadn't realized: Polymorph Other is *wildly* broken. Permanent duration? Any creature, not 'any willing living creature'?

Turns out that Polymorph Other is a 3.0 spell (2YE generally runs on 3.5 rules); I didn't know that until after the chapter was online, so I thought about it and then said "meh, whatever." You could do all the same things using Polymorph Any Object so I figured it wasn't critical. Still, PAO is 8th level and PO is 4th.
