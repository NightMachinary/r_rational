** Much of this story was written when I was writing ch 56, but my $300 goal on [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]] was that I would finish it, which I did yesterday (and that actually worked as motivation a lot better than I thought it would). I don't consider it required reading for /Worth the Candle/, though it is suggested; maybe stay away if you don't like the tabletop parts of the story as much.

**** Kind of? The biggest difference right now is probably my wife, who is super proud of me, and much more willing to give me writing time if it's helping support our family rather than just my hobby of sitting in front of my computer for hours at a time. Not that she wasn't great before, but it's also easier for me to ask when it's not just "hey, I'm going to disappear for a bit, watch our son, please".

Motivation is probably minor though. I'd be writing either way, it's just a matter of how much I try to sneak writing in on the off time, or how much I think about writing when I'm not writing, and stuff like that. Maybe I'm a little more conscious of trying not to do unproductive things (like arguing with people on the internet). I'd like to be able to say that every time I get a new patron, or someone increases their pledge, I race to the keyboard, but it's not really like that for me.

And motivation is distinct from inspiration, which has a much bigger impact. I won't say much about it, but there was a point a few chapters back where I had this "a ha" moment of being able to tie two different plot threads together, and that's the sort of thing that A) makes writing a lot easier and B) is really hard to induce artificially.

*tl;dr:* Motivation gets my butt in the chair, inspiration gets the words flowing, patronage does help motivation (though I'm already pretty self-motivated) but doesn't help inspiration.

**** Edited the first one slightly, because you're right, it's clunky.

The second one was due to editing. Time taken while people speak is always one of the hardest things to nail down in prose, because it's hard to account for speaking speeds, pauses that aren't noted in the text, distractions, etc. It's now noted in the text that Solace asks her question as she comes back, which I don't think is unreasonable given how long it took me to speak the lines out loud ... but maybe it still reads poorly. (I have no idea if the internal geometry of the treehouse is written down anywhere, but the cellar is basically just down a ladder from the common area with the big table, so it's equivalent of stepping into the next room with the door open.)

Thanks for pointing those out.

** If Joon /didn't/ want to kill his players' characters, his death save system seem /very/ harsh. Immediate death on any failure (which, if I understand it correctly, is almost always more likely than a success), and you can only recover on a critical success? I'm thinking the system may have been designed for dramatic tension first and foremost, so death is at stake on every flip, by comparison D&D 5E death saves are very safe, but very unexciting. Or maybe that's Joon's "DM taking his grief out on the players" approach lingering on.

*** There's a difference between not wanting to kill a player's character in the moment, and not wanting there to be a penalty of death. I've played a variety of systems with different rules on death and dying, and usually find the more permissive ones to be grating. If it's /really/ permissive, where "reduced to 0 HP" just means "knocked out", then the player is just taken out of the game, and combat can last a long time, so they've got nothing to do. Even 5E can result in people checking out, because their "turn" is a single roll of a die that they have nothing to add to, leaving their fate entirely in the hands of the dice ... just more drawn out, which is a problem as far as tension goes, IMO, since you get "oh right, he's dying" moments that tend to make it fall flat.

Besides that, part of the point of them playing the tabletop game, in-story, is so that they can get a feeling for what it's like to play a tabletop game, and relatively harsh rules on character death help underline the "death and re-roll" aspect of how parties work, narratives get cut short, etc.

It just appeared to me that Joon was being a bit of hypocrite at that moment, like he didn't like the idea of dealing with the drama of Grak's character dying there, and tried to take a moral high ground, like there's nothing he could've done, but in fact he personally designed the system so it's stacked /very/ harshly against the players. I think there's something to be said for the difference between having a penalty of death and stacking everything on a single fickle save-or-die (with awful odds too boot, if I understand the system correctly, a person with average End would die on the first flip with the probability of ~71%).

And with harsh rules it's over quick, but then the players checks out until the end of combat at least plus however long it takes to get to the point of the introduction of the next character (unless you're suggesting there's supposed to be hot swap, like the new characters enters the next round already somehow).

I guess there's a difference in styles, to me it feels like having the fate of a character that represents a quite sizable personal investment/attachment depend on a single throw with bad odds is /very/ harsh, like something you'd do with the purpose of making a particularly hardcore or mean game.

Anyway, thanks for the reply.

  After you've flipped a card, discard it. Once your discard pile is full, shuffle all the cards back into your deck and start over.
#+end_quote

I'm not experienced with tabletop rule creation, but was this rule created purely to curb Fenn's elf luck? Or to guarantee a wider range of outcomes and prevent streaks?

It just seems to tempt card counting and, consequently, a potential lack of suspense (or fun) when the deck thins to the last few cards at a critical game moment.

*** There are three reasons for it.

1. It makes "luck" fairly even, so that a streak of bad luck will immediately be balanced out by a streak of "good luck".
2. Shuffling after every flip is a lot of busy work and overhead, especially if you're going to be calling for multiple flips in a row, which as the rules are now is a definite possibility.
3. Having a discard opens up a lot of design space for magic items, class abilities, enemy attacks, spells, etc. If you have a discard, you can have effects that put cards into it, pull cards from it, that shuffle it into your deck on certain triggers, activate when it's at a certain size, etc.

The rules do caution that card-counting might be a problem though. "Hidden" discard is the easiest but probably least effective option to deal with it. Shuffling after every flip removes a lot of design space and makes things more random, but probably doesn't hurt you that much unless you were actually using the design space. Alternately, if you really wanted, you could increase the size of the player's deck to make card counting much more difficult; it's at fifteen cards per player, which is pretty small and easy to track.

For the actual story, I think I made flips twice, then just faked everything else (but kept careful notes so that no one would flip a card that they logically couldn't have).

For the end of play, when Grak had to make a flip for survival and Amaryllis had to make two flips for revival, I actually wrote it a few different ways and then picked the one that I liked best, both as it sits within the story, and as it sits within the larger narrative (IMO, here it largely provides an up note and a counterpoint to down notes that happen a few chapters away from where this sits). I also think that's where fudging is most noticeable though, but it was a tradeoff I was willing to make.

I actually wrote [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9AfeqVGDHDY5ldctk444LNCt4V33ffl2DWCqQo7zLc/edit?usp=sharing][an essay on Simulationism vs. Narrativism]] you might find interesting.

*** Unfortunately, they use essentially the same part of my brain. I've also had mixed success with online games; there's a bit of a disconnect with people, and everyone comes in as a stranger, which means that it first takes some time for everyone to find their groove with each other, and sometimes it just falls apart because people are bringing in different ideas about what the game is or should be.

My DMing right now is limited to linked one-shots that I do with some friends, less than once a month (and it's been a while since the last one). [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEEMqsW05SEGhp42JLmHOTVy_elHOXIXGJfpKbvqH-U/edit?usp=sharing][Here's the setting doc,]] I'm fairly sure I've linked it in one of the worldbuilding threads before, to the wide disinterest that worldbuilding docs usually warrant.

That said, I've thought about it, it's just more something that I would try at a meetup or convention than as a reward over the internet (partly because I don't think I can guarantee a good level of quality).

Besides, I think I'm a better writer than a DM.

You're great enough at writing that would you have to be worse at almost everything else by comparison. :P

The way you make character development and conversations WORK is incredible. Fenn's jabs, Solace's caring, Amy's strong methodical nature. And Grak who is so hard to understand that it feels so much nicer when you get those glimpses. Like when Joon said that he didn't think Grak meant it when he said “clever”: that was hilarious.

Thanks so much for writing this and your other works.

Worldbuilding doc looks cool too. I'm sure you're selling yourself short as a DM, but of course I believe you about the challenges and reasons for online being a poor medium.

To add to that, it's /really/ hard to get a good feel going with just a videocall; jokes fall flat, people check out constantly because there's no subtext channel, and generally meh.

Which is a shame because conceptually Blue Stairs / Red Stairs was right up my valley :(
