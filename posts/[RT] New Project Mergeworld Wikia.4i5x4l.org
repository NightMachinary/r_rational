** Ok. What is this. Is this a project you found or one you made? In what sense is it rational? Can you elaborate at all on it?

*** Yes it's one I made. Mainly posting it here because I appreciate the variety of fiction I read here and think that the kind of people who also appreciate it might appreciate this as well. It's rational in the sense that it follows (at least to the best of my ability) the rules on the sidebar:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'.

- If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

Basically it's a rational take on a super-hero universe.

**** Simply "merging" the existing marvel/DC backstories as it appears you've been doing thus far doesn't really seem to fit the whole "things don't happen just because the plot demands it"

**** It may be a rational story as it progresses, but it isn't even a story right now. And the current backstories aren't particularly rational as they are just merged versions of irrational source material.
