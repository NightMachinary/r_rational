In your case, bothering with such a policy seems entirely consistent with the level of significance you are assigning to this whole issue.

When the item is a) posted by '*mylittle*economy' and b) its domain is *fim*fiction.net, I do not have much sympathy for your argument. Either one of those factors alone is enough to infer 'It's MLP'.

EDIT: However, searching domain:fimfiction.net in [[/r/rational]] suggests that this particular post is atypical and 95% of other posts aren't very clear on this issue. So I suppose I've ended up supporting your proposal.

Note however that if it's the erratic pornographicness of fimfiction.net that is the real problem, an MLP tag may not help you all that much (it's not as if fimfiction is the only website with MLP fiction or with NSFW content). A 'NSFW site' tag may be more relevant.

Also note that AFAIK story thumbnails are not permitted to contain explicit content, so it's appropriate to report them if they are.

****** There is an optimal level of warnings and information provision in general which will usually never be at a total provision or total absence of information because producing and distributing information is costly. Thus there will inevitably be some false positives and false negatives. When people get hit by some such error, they will inevitably complain about the level of information provided, and they are right to do so /even if the level of information provision is optimal./ And indeed, considering the frightfully pornographic nature of fimfiction.net, it is unlikely the level of information I provided in the title is optimal.

This is all simply my mistake, and I thank [[/u/literal-hitler]] for bringing it to my attention. Now if we are going to argue about something, let us argue about how widely spread marginal cost pricing is in practice and how useful it is in theory, and how economists performed in the full-cost pricing controversy.

Eh? I just turned off NoScript in case this 'pornographic' stuff is in the ads, but I don't notice any.. and there is the occasional vaguely-suggestive text or image, but I'm not sure how you'd run into actual explicit content without specifically seeking it out -- fimfiction's rules* are designed to prevent it, and do a decent job at that.

So I guess I have to take back my 'erraticly pornographic' comment, which is considerably milder than your 'frightfully pornographic' comment.

******** Yes, that is right, but I suppose I'm still a little shocked by it all. I know that in theory the Internet is supposed to be able to fetishize anything, but somehow I thought cartoon ponies with no sexual features would have been the limit. Presumably if they made a cartoon about rocks--not anthropomorphic rocks, but just hard round things laying in the dirt--people wouldn't be compelled to write stories about one rock accidentally stumbling in on another rock in the shower...right?

Actually, on the topic of MLP, There is Tom the rock (who is definitely /just a particularly large rock/, not anthropomorphized), and there's definitely Tom/Rarity shipping. There's probably also Tom/Rarity porn. I mean, there is [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/6608/1/airshipping-is-magic/chapter-1]['Twilight and Trixie as airships' shipping]]!* -- surely Tom/Rarity porn is positively mundane next to that. Tom/Maud porn should be practically guaranteed, given Maud's field of interest.

* story is SFW, just rather bizarre. Airship romance and betrayal!! (yes, really)

Somewhat more seriously, I'm pretty sure that anything that has an appealing face qualifies, and anything that looks interesting may also spontaneously acquire a face (Google Image Search 'anthro fighter jet' sometime, for example)

I guess my overall conclusion is that well.. people are obsessed with relationships and sex, and that's really all that there is to this whole matter: putting any given X in the same sentence as 'sex' or 'relationship' seems to be just a matter of time, hence rule 34.

*********** That understatement. Hehe.

As I was writing my previous comment, I looked up "tom_(mlp)" on e621. One of the images shown depicted [[https://e621.net/post/show/457774]["Tom and Boulder 'copulating'"]]*, with 'bodily' fluids oozing out where they are touching. I believe that broadly fulfills MLE's 'rock x rock' idea; it certainly fulfills my 'wat' quotient.

Also, [[https://e621.net/post/show/290275][aforementioned toaster porn]]* -- not the only instance, but the funniest one. It's even *furry* toaster porn, however the hell that is supposed to work.

************ Sure, since I already looked, why not.

Twilight gives potion to Maud, with instructions to apply it to a rock. Maud applies it to Boulder (that's the name of her pet rock, which is decidedly not a boulder, if you're not aware). Boulder turns into a sort of well endowed squishy grey android (pondroid?) with creepy blank eyes. Maud proceeds to appropriately utilize said endowment, while monologuing to Boulder-pondroid in a sort of understated but overall porny way. Consent, as well as sapience or even sentience, of Boulder-pondroid is rather ambiguous. Ultimately, Boulder turns back into a pebble and inconveniently digs into Maud's back.

It's more silly than anything, really. Although probably less silly than [[https://e621.net/post/show/457774][this]], which is literal, non-anthropomorphized rocks having sex.. somehow.

YMMV though because I think a lot of things that seem to squick other people are just silly. If it's not physically possible, it's pure fantasy and pretty hard for it to get worse than 'silly', IME.

I mean, look, they're of humanoid mind-design, except with extra emphasis placed on positive social relationships. Of course they're going to /have/ sex lives.
