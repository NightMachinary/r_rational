** It's been too long since I was writing original fiction and this has been kicking around my brain for a while.

Blurb:

Athos is a good dog. He likes frisbee, bacon, and his family (SmolFriend, Mom, and Dad). He's not so keen on falling through an interdimensional portal to a fantasy world where floating boxes tell you that you've just been given status as the 'Supreme Exemplar' of your species, a powerful package of abilities that includes human-level intelligence. Sure, being smart is nice but less so when it comes with the need to survive in a land made from bits of different dimensions stitched together like patches in a quilt. A thousand species, a thousand lands, sorcery and super science rubbing elbows, wars and intrigue everywhere...it's exhausting for a good dog who just wants to go home!

*** Ow his poor tail! Why is it that keeps happening to good dogs? Stephen Matuchek in Operation Chaos, and I think Professor Wolfe Wolfe in The Compleat Werewolf, both had their tails shortened in the course of the story.

Eagerly awaiting chapter 2.

** I thoroughly enjoyed that first chapter. I think you did a good job representing a non human intelligence at both cognitive levels. Plus he is rather adorable, as any good pupper would be. As far as the language goes, a dog who can't understand those he wants to get pets and belly rubs from, doesn't seem like an optimal doggo, so looking forward to your mentioned magical solution.

** I wrote a comment about this not being [[/r/litrpg][r/litrpg]] and hoping to see some rational worldbuilding or characters, but deleted it when I noticed who the author of this post is. I have high hopes!

*** I'm flattered. :>

Are LitRPG stories definitionally not rational and therefore not suitable for [[/r/rational]]?

**** No, but they are also not definitionally rational, and there's an occasionally recurring problem around here of people posting entirely-irrational stories that just happen to share a format or genre with some rational stories.

I wanted to try to head this off early if it was here just because other litrpg stories are here, and not because it [eventually] contains rational plots / world / characters.

***** Gotcha.

I'd like to think it will have rational etc in it, but we'll see!

  This guy? This guy was making me wonder if perhaps there were limits to the whole human/canine friendship compact. If so, I felt like he was definitely crossing those limits.
