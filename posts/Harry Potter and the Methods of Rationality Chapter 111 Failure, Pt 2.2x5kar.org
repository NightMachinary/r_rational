** Still reeling from the loss of Dumbledore honestly. That's a masterful chess move if I ever seen one. The definition of playing the game "one level higher than you do".

I really want to see what Voldemort's end game for Harry is. He's seemingly investing a lot (although I guess, on his scale, a unicorn, a murder, a troll and a 5 minute ritual isn't THAT much) in Harry's well being here. Even accounting for the prophecy here. In addition, I feel like prophecies play the game at level zero anyway. As in, I feel they're invulnerable to the sort of direct manipulation Riddle (both of them) favors.

*** I'm pretty sure that 'one level higher than you' remark was specific to Harry. QV is literally one level higher than Harry at any point in time because he can run an internal self-simulation of Harry's rational processes.

** So uh, why /didn't/ he kill Harry, then? Why is he able to parseltongue-promise to kill him if he tries anything (indicating that killing him couldn't be /that/ bad) yet has not already killed him?

Maybe killing Harry is no use, maybe he just gets transferred to another Horcrux since he shares a "soul" with Riddle? (Riddle fixed the whole continuity issue, right?)

*** I think that Voldemort isn't killing Harry because he wants an enemy that is challenging to him, even if Harry isn't there yet. He's not willing to risk his own death for that though. If Harry ends up being a current threat, Voldemort will kill him.

I think Voldemort recognizes the need in himself for a challenge. He's a grandmaster chess player who lives amongst masters at best. He wants to live forever, but living forever would be extremely boring without something interesting to do. I suspect that if Voldemort were to kill Harry, he'd simply raise him again.

There's also the mention of a prophesy, which Voldemort doesn't seem to want to interfere with.

*EDIT* Corrected spelling of Voldemort. Odd. For some reason I've never realized I spelled it wrong.

***** Voldemort went as far as trying to teach an entire class of students to fight intelligently. I don't see it as entirely impossible that he wants those students to be well-led. The more I think about it, the more it seems to me that Voldemort is creating either an enemy worth having, or shaping Harry, Hermione, and some other students to make a prophesy valid.

*** No. Magically moving dirt doesn't actually make the dirt magically in anyway. This way Voldemort can block Harry's spells without his magic 'touching' Harry's magic in any way. It's why he reacted so quickly too. Voldemort was already prepared to block a spell or some non-magical projectile (I thought Harry had tranquilizer darts, I mean where did he even get a gun from? The Weasly twins?).

**** Those other languages are spoken, not signed. So the pouch needs to have both a microphone equivalent /and/ motion detection equivalent, unless it's directly inferring intent regardless of how the communication takes place.

As a real world example, Siri understands commands in ~10 languages, but none of them are sign languages, for obvious reasons - they require vastly different technologies. (It wouldn't be impossible by any means for an iPhone to understand sign language, but it is a very different problem set.)
