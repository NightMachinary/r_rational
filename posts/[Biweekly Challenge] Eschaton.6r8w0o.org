[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6okl44/biweekly_challenge_moores_law/][Last time]], the prompt was "Moore's Law". Our winner is [[/u/Laborbuch]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6okl44/biweekly_challenge_moores_law/dkqz3iq/]["The Linear and the Quadratic"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/Laborbuch]], enjoy your flair and reddit gold!

This time, the challenge will be *Eschaton*. Basically, write a story about the ultimate fate of the world, whether that's its utopic, dystopic, weirdtopic, or apocalyptic. (Usually there is some divine element to an eschaton, but it's often used in other contexts, and the religious association can be freely dropped for the sake of this prompt.)

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, August 16th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge is *Metafiction*. Write a story which in some sense acknowledges that it is a story. Characters realize that they're in a story, or simply accept that as fact. There's /some/ overlap with genre savvy, though genre savvy characters don't typically realize that they're in a work of fiction, they've just seen enough fiction to not fall for the usual traps. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 8/16.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat will be posted later tonight.
