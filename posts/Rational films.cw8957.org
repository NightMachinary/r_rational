Can anyone recommend good films told by the principles of rational fiction?


** Decently rational:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Annihilation2018][/Annihilation/]], science fiction. Follows an expedition into an anomalous, slowly-expanding area which formed around a fallen extraterrestrial object. Rare case of the movie being better than the books.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenCloverfieldLane][/10 Cloverfield Lane/]], psychological horror. After a car crash, the protagonist wakes up in a bunker. Its owner doesn't let her leave, claiming that the outside world was "contaminated" while she was unconscious.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Circle][/Circle/]], sci-fi/psychological thriller. Fifty people wake up in a room. Every two minutes, a device kills one of them; either whoever the majority of them votes for, or a random person. What follows?

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwistedTheUntoldStoryOfARoyalVizier][/Twisted/]]. Well, it's technically /a play/, but it's still a live-action moving-pictures work, so is there really a difference? ^{/s}

Somewhat rational:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer][/Primer/]], science fiction. A consistently-written & complex time-travel conflict.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinInTheWoods][/The Cabin in the Woods/]], horror. Cliché premise leads to a very rationality-esque deconstruction. /Worm/ : Superhero fiction :: /The Cabin in the Woods/ : Horror fiction.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmMother][/I am Mother/]], science fiction/thriller. After an extinction-level event, a lone robot raises a human girl from an embryo in an underground bunker. Notably competent portrayal of AI.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissSloane][/Miss Sloane/]], political thriller. Follows a very competent and ruthless lobbyist as she attempts to pass a challenging bill.

[[/r/rational][r/rational]]-adjacent:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pontypool][/Pontypool/]], horror. A group of people operating a basement radio station in a small town start receiving reports about worrying incidents during one of their broadcasts. Features one of the best examples of a memetic threat I've seen outside of text-based fiction.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Resolution][/Resolution/]], horror. I'd suggest going in blind. A supernatural entity is trying to orchestrate a horror story in reality.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Oculus][/Oculus/]], horror. The beginning (first ~30 minutes?) features a decently munchkin attempt to defeat a powerful hostile supernatural entity, but the protagonists take leave of their senses shortly thereafter.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoureNext][/You're Next/]], a deconstruction of slasher movies with a competent protagonist.

*** The premise for Annihilation is fundamentally irrational. The behaviour of the people isn't rational even when outside the anamoly so they don't have an excuse.

There are no rules to the mutation which basically means that it becomes deus ex for whatever the writers feel like.

** I recommend this a lot, so I'm probably biased. But Lucky Number Slevin. There is approximately one place where someone makes a stupid error for the sake of the plot, and it's believable. There is a /substantial/ twist ending, but it's a Fair Play Whodunnit; the characters don't have all the information to see the twist coming but the viewers do. The character's motivations are not really proportionate, but they're consistent and believable.

** *The Edge* is a 1997 American survival film writen by David Mamet, directed by Lee Tamahori, and starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin.

Hopkins plays an eccentric fashion designer billionaire on an Alaskan photo shoot. He's a skittish fellow, an intellectual who isn't used to the wilds of Alaska, but who is confident he can figure out how to survive if given the need. And boy, is he ever!

CHARLES: You know, I once read an interesting book which said that, uh, most people lost in the wilds, they, they die of shame...Yeah, see, they die of shame. ‘What did I do wrong? How could I have gotten myself into this?' And so they sit there and they... die. Because they didn't do the one thing that would save their lives.

BOB: And what is that, Charles?

CHARLES: Thinking.

** /Primer/, /Circle/, /10 Cloverfield Lane/ are usual recommendations.

/Moneyball/ and /Catch Me If You Can/ are both intellect and hacking based, both true-ish stories.

There's a whole genre of "people in a room" which is pretty popular for indie films for the obvious budget reasons, and most of them will /tend/ to be more on the rational side if they have any problem solving at all.

** [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100519/][Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]] is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Tom Stoppard play. It has characters who know only that they have been summoned to see the prince and do their best to figure out who they are, the nature of their world, and what's happening around them as they are railroaded through the plot.

Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, and Richard Dreyfuss give a really memorable performance that I think would appeal to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] crowd.

**** I always felt like R&G were more than passengers on the plot train- they were desperately searching for a way to exert some sort of agency and be more than spectators of their own lives and bit players in Hamlet's story. The movie has a few scenes without dialogue that weren't in the play, where the characters do various scientific experiments or just wonder or delight at various bits of their environment that don't make any sense rationally. I walked away with the impression that the characters were rational and did the best they could with the tools they had, but they were caught in a situation where science and rationality couldn't help them... so they did the best they could with philosophy. Here are some of the scenes that come to mind:

I think [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752][Ex Machina]], [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/][WarGames]] and [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709][Her]], all have good aspects in portraying AI (none is perfect).

Maybe [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778][Contagion]] and [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384][Apollo 13]] can fit also, as the characters and decisions are mostly rationals (although they not very fictional).

*** I was thinking of it. I loved that movie, not sure if I'd call it "rational" just because it's not necessarily the kind of movie that usually would /not/ be anyway. It's basically an investigative court thriller, set in real time, so it's hard for it to be very fanciful. Still, beautiful investigation of human psychology, bias, and justice (though apparently, not very faithful to what the /legal/ system says in theory: jurors aren't supposed to further investigate evidence!).
