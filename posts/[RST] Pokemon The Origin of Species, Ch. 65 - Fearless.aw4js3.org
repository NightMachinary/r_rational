Like, I dunno, a kid who retreated into depression after losing his parents in a car crash being pulled out of his shell by new friends and growing to rely on them only for his class to get into a bus crash where they all died, leaving him alone again.

He's dealing with the aftereffects of the Pressure, his own grief from overexerting himself psychically, finding dead children, witnessing people and his Pokemon being killed or wounded, and watched his friend and crush get terribly injured by a fuckhuge monster and had to carry her perhaps a mile or so through a ruined, practically war-torn city, still full of monsters and corpses, and sit alone in a hospital for hours while his friend his patched up without any support.

By himself, without other friends, without his family, without his Pikachu, and without an adult.

** I feel like Red is getting some flak here, but in all liklihood he is correct - the risks here seem very high for a very uncertain payoff. The Second is being motivated not by a logical cost-benefit, but by a debt he owes - which is 100% a good thing to die for, human values matter, but Red and Aiko dont have to commit to that. I dont think Aiko is wrong to want to have her moment where she sacrifices and overcomes fear, but that can be used to justify anything. Red may be totally drained, but I see no reason to think he isnt the one thinking most clearly. (Of course both sides can be correct - sometimes you have to just defy the odds for yourself)

‚Äã

Still, now that Aiko is charging in, I feel like Red should shift is mind after some thought - his loyalty to Aiko is much stronger than to random people, again human relationships matter. So I hope he does try to help later on in the next chapter.

****** To elaborate on what I'm trying to say, even a single very strong punch by a strong human man (let alone any other ape) could kill the average person. So the fact that she basically got up again suggests it was, in fact, force on a human scale of things. Even if the force was more than what the /average/ human could procure, it was not above the range of what a trained human fighter might be able to deliver, and far below what for instance a gorilla would deliver.

This surprised me because throughout this story I've sort of been assuming that pokemon power is orders of magnitude above what you'd expect bullets and shields to be effective on, let alone an ape. if pokemon force operates on those scales, you would expect a human with a weapon to be somewhat more effective against them. Therefore you'd expect trainers to be armed with something more than just pokeballs (for the odd occasion when they ran across a pokemon low level enough to take on themselves). I thought the reason Trainers did not bother with conventional weapons, and the reason Pokemon themselves were not trained to use weapons, was that Pokemon were just so tough and so strong that an ordinary weapon would not realistically add anything to the situation.

(I was similarly surprised that e.g. Machamp could not carry two human beings and not be slowed down to less than a human's running speed - due to the absence of weapons I've been imagining bigger power differentials between humans and pokemon than perhaps were intended.)

That is to say, if that's the best Drowsee has to offer in terms of brute force, (Dark type) Blue holding a spear would have a pretty good chance of slaughtering it. Add a gun and it's no contest. Which means the rangers would be carrying guns, just in case they encounter a situation like this.

(Anyway, this is now more nitpicking about a relatively tiny detail than is necessary haha)

#+end_quote

The sudden vibration and Aiko noting it as an ill omen bring me into the mindset of "action scene, something is happening right now." Immediately following it with a couple-minute time skip in the same sentence gave me narrative whiplash.

** So does this mean Aiko has a thing for Red? Are we going to get a love triangle situation? Also, someone please save these children, they are only 11 or something. God, please, get them to safety.

I don't think so at all. It's a single isolated action without any further elaboration; it sounds to me more like she's stepping out of her comfort zone on multiple fronts, especially after her musings on Elaine's action from before.

** Honestly, I'd just like to say that I can't wait for the next chapter, and man, I really can't predict if someone is going to be ok, or not, you've been proving my expectations wrong in a great way, it's nice to not be able to trust what I think is going to happen.

Will we see what happened to Seto and the woman who was driving Laura?
