New to the sub but long time fan of this kind of fiction. A lot of these novel based subreddits have a sticky somewhere listing the commonly updated stories and completed series. Does this subreddit have something like that?


** If we stopped posting the updates in the sub itself, it would start looking awfully empty.

There used to be more discussion and worldbuilding type threads, but the mods elected to move that stuff into weekly threads and leave the main subreddit interface almost exclusively for story updates.

*** I think the idea is to have links to the home page (or first chapter) of regularly posted stories, but also continue postings for new chapters.

**** It's not a terrible idea, really. Subreddits have two sticky slots available, and while one is used for the biweekly challenge, we're not currently using the other one, which could very well be "New to Rational Fiction? Start here."

But we do like to use that sticky slot for other stuff from time to time, and there are links (which could maybe be a bit more prominent or newbie friendly) in the sidebar.

***** You could link the "New to Rational Fiction" thread permanently, and swap out the bi-weekly challenges with the occasional announcements when they come up.

*** I don't know if that's a greaaaat list -- I think Shade of White and Branches definitely belong on the second list and some on the latter are just much more central -- Worm, FiO, The Reckoning, Origin of Species, even MoL.

Even if you could argue that Shade of White or Branches are more "ideal expressions" somehow, the above are much more popular among [[/r/rational]] and better written -- new readers shouldn't have to wade two-thirds of the way down the list to get to Worm.

Also even if it's not meant to be an A-lister and a B-lister list, it'll be seen that way.

** Nope, but you can just take a look at the last couple of weeks of updates and build your own list.

Also, you should end up with a pretty good list if you ask for what people are reading regularly on the Recommendations thread.

** The wiki on this subreddit has many recommendations. Unfortunately I'm not sure how to access it from the redesign... but here is the direct link to it: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index]]. Most of the series are completed but several still are going (and updates get posted here), such as [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The Reckoning]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: Origin of Species]], [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]]. There are also links to sites like [[http://rationalreads.com/][RationalReads]] and [[https://rationalfiction.io][rationalfiction.io]].

Besides the sites linked above and in the wiki, I enjoy perusing the list on [[http://topwebfiction.com/]]. It's not all rational, but many are and most are enjoyable no matter the genre.
