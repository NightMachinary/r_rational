** Loved the monty python reference, and as always, love reading about exceedingly competent Hermione. This is one of my favorite HP fics, good to see updates! :)

**** exactly! A well written Hermione is so satisfying. I wish there were more, but I'm generally unsuccessful in my ffnet searches.

***** Effloresco Secundus has a very good one, if you've not read it. It's a Naruto crossover with a special place in my heart for its fantastic fight scenes, worldbuilding and characterisation.

****** I'm reporting back. Effloresco Secundus is fantastic, and I binge read it all. Thank you so much for the recommendation!

******* Glad you enjoyed it. I occasionally go back to read it every now and again in the hopes that some of their writing skill will rub off on me.
