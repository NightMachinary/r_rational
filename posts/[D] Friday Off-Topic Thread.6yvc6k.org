Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Recently edited and updated some old thoughts on "being naive" and the difference between complex and simple beliefs, interested in feedback on how useful or true people think it is, or whether it's overly obvious or wrong in some way:

*** I don't think it's necessary or entirely accurate to reference blockbuster movies as an example of appealing to an uneducated audience. Instead, I think the ones with very simple conflicts are appealing to the same emotions engrained into us by children's stories. Pointing toward children's stories is enough to make your point since their entire purpose is to teach basic moral values to people who lack any ability to understand the context of real world conflicts.

Other than that, you put forward some ideas that offered insights I hadn't made before and I liked that. However, at the end I didn't get the impression that any conclusion had been reached. It's nice to have knowledge I didn't before, but I'm not sure how I could make use of it. Defining naïveté and exploring it's rhetorical use is interesting, but there didn't seem to be a strategy of how to improve discourse with this information so I don't feel a need to share it.

I think it's important to point out that most major media we consume, even as adults, is selling us an overly simplistic narrative (a lot of people for example think that House of Cards is an accurate reflection of what US politics looks like because it's cynical, and it definitely contains a lot of truth to it, but it still simplifies things immensely to create a compelling narrative), so I'm going to try to reinforce and save this point rather than abandon it just yet. Would it help if I clarify that I'm specifically referring to people's ignorance about the issues addressed, and it's not about being "stupid" at all?

#+begin_quote
  However, at the end I didn't get the impression that any conclusion had been reached.
#+end_quote

The conclusion was basically this:

"Acknowledging complexity would directly challenge our surety in the rightness of our Values, and so we do not confront our naivety in these fields because it is far easier to take an assertive stance that makes sense to our Values than to face the uncertainty of a complex world."

Do you feel like it needs something that's more explicit? Like "This is what you should do?" There's something in me that resists being so directive, though maybe just a summary of things to be aware of would be good?

***** Okay, now I get what you meant. I retract my criticisms, though the specific wording could possibly be better. I like the example you give of House of Cards since that's considered relatively "high brow" media, and while I don't believe it appeals to ignorance I completely agree that it doesn't dispel it.

For the conclusion, I misunderstood and thought you were saying "this is the way it is" rather than "this is what we shouldn't be doing". It's not an entirely new idea and I think effort should be put into how to correct this incentive for toxic behavior, but it remains a useful insight.

  Acknowledging complexity would directly challenge our surety in the rightness of our Values, and so we do not confront our naivety in these fields because it is far easier to take an assertive stance that makes sense to our Values than to face the uncertainty of a complex world. But that's exactly what we have to be willing to do if we want to ensure our beliefs are aligned with reality.

  Simplicity should be embraced in predictive models that are demonstrated to work, but we should be skeptical of it when debating hypotheses about how the world works.  Being "naive" is considered a bad thing because it makes one easy to fool... including by one's own preferences and biases.

*** I definitely agree with your viewpoint, and have to add that in a lot of ways, my worldview is what many would consider willfully naive. The fictional character closest to my view would be Papyrus of Undertale.

But I hold this view because I see cynicism as a sort of race to the bottom. It doesn't help anyone but oneself (in whatever regards it /does/) to look poorly upon people, and quite frequently, /genuine belief/ in them can change them. Not always, and I'm not advocating a lack of caution in how or where one shows such empathy, but I find it hard to imagine nearly as many situations where a cynical, pessimistic outlook could make the world a better place so much as their reverse.

Ultimately, whether or not you're a cynic shouldn't be about what you wish the world was or what you want the world to become, it should be about having correct information. If the world is made of selfish people, I want to believe the world is made of selfish people, and if the world is made of kind people, I want to believe the world is made of kind people.

**** Yeah, I believe that cynicism, if we're defining it as "believing that people are motivated by self-interest; distrustful of human sincerity or integrity," is clearly wrong the same way that its opposite would be.

But (just for the sake of argument, I know you qualified that you don't advocate unthinking empathy) I do see Papyrus (and Pure Mercy Frisk) as basically that opposite. The second Papyrus meets a player who's morbidly curious, slightly bloodthirsty, or even just not curious at all in exploring the game's other options, he dies. And Frisk can only do what he does because the game's conceits are 1) The monsters are fairly weak, to the point that a child can get away with letting them attack him, and 2) He can reset as many times as he needs to find the right solutions.

***** Honestly, while I don't /advocate/ unthinking empathy for other people... I'm not entirely sure that I wouldn't do exactly the same thing as Papyrus in that situation. I /actively/ admire him for choosing to do so, even at the risk of his own life -- he admits later that he was scared if you choose to spare him, so it's not like he was being ignorant in doing so!

And there's a certain type of person that he would serve as a stopping point to, in the context of the world, or the game.He's the first monster, who /will not kill you/ -- and on a genocide route, he won't even harm you.

*** Pedantic frenchperson here. It's actually spelled either naivete (english version), or naïveté (french version).

I agree with the point of the article... well, I can't finish this sentence, because reading it again, I don't see a central point. More like several, inter-linked points.

Overall I think it could be structured better (maybe with distinct parts, /a la/ Slate Star Codex). The whole point on rich people with Person A and Person B is interesting, but it's a bit of a tangent, and I think the whole dissertation would be more streamlined with a shorter example. On the other hand, the part about /House of Cards/ and how fiction portrays cynicism could probably be extended.

Also, you touch on the difference between naivete-as-positiveness, and naivete-as-simplicity in the beginning, but you present it more like a semantic "we use the same word for the different meanings"-type problem than a fundamental error we tend to make. People talking about naivete refer to an un-informed understanding of reality, there's no confusion about that. The problem is that people often think cynicism is equivalent to being informed, because both of those are traits you rarely find in young children.

I also subscribe to a couple magazines and newspapers that give me a regular supply of things to read. The San Jose Mercury News, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Foreign Policy, The London Review of Books, Car & Driver, and Popular Mechanics regularly give me plenty to read.

We can't reply to this in depth unless you mention what the root causes are. I'll go ahead and give my general advice:

If it's caused by a temporary situation focus on it being a temporary situation. I've found that I can push myself through quite a lot of garbage as long as I know there's a point where it'll end. Be prepared for delays though.

If it's a feeling coming from the external world (politics, international events) I highly recommend limiting the time you view or discuss such content.

If it's from work or interpersonal conflicts I'd try to make it a temporary situation. I.e. move or find a new job.

I hope it's not related to family.

** I've gotten really good at dealing with internal sources of anxiety, but I remain terrible at combating external sources and am not sure what I can do about that. I have a social contract with every person I know to be brutally honest about each other's behavior to resolve situations that make it difficult for me function, but when someone refuses to change their behavior after I've explained to them how it hurts my mental state I have no fallback.

It's gotten to the point where I'm screaming myself horse at dogs for not listening to me, so I think I need a new tactic. I have plenty of strategies to correct and prevent situations that cause me stress, but have no endurance for situations I cannot control. Cutting myself off from the world and exposing myself to relaxing stimuli is enough to calm me down when I'm having a panic attack, but it's always a temporary solution if the situation persists.

I thought I could get through life by using my problem solving skills to stop stress from forming in the first place, but I keep running into problems I don't have the power to change and just need to survive. Allowing anxiety to form has never been a concept I've considered before, to the point where I utterly despise stories where characters get continuously screwed over and don't succeed in a timely manner at overcoming the force that's hurting them.

I've been dealing with chronic anxiety my entire life and have always had this problem.

***** Have you tried therapy or medication?

I know some people that had good success using either of them. They had severe anxiety and managed to reduce it drastically to a level they can manage.

Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to work best from what I've been told.

Mental health problems may seem overwhelming, but this perception is usually caused by the condition affecting our brains, not by a fact of reality that it has no treatment. I had great success with therapy, some with medication, but I had the same perception of impossibility before.

***** Do you mind sharing some of the causes? Financial, family, danger, etc? I have found my anxiety was completly caused by my fear of how others felt about me due to fear of not living up to expectations. I had to completly rethink my life, including selling my business, isolating myself from certain people, and exercising, and minimizing alcohol consumption. Exercise has been the hardest, but I feel much better and I am much happier. Because I don't feel the need to impress people any longer, making less money only impacts brands, and not quality. What I really learned was how to be more selfish, you stated you told a person and they aren't changing. Unless it is blood I would try to find others. There is a very small pool of people out there that can discuss a lot of topics the rational community holds dear, but if you find a hobby, it can be a great equalizer for common ground.

****** I have dealt with social anxiety in the past, but right now the main cause is a feeling of being antagonized. It's happened with my narcissist sister, though the primary source are dogs my family is watching that refuse to stop barking. There's one in particular that goes berserk every time she sees our cats and is driving me insane because she won't listen to us no matter what we do.

******** I've learned to deal with social anxiety through communicating with others, meditating to relax, setting goals to step outside my comfort zone, and using my introspection to experiment with different mental strategies. When I'm being continuously antagonized, such as when a person refuses to stop doing something that they know I find annoying, all I can do is avoid the source of the antagonism or ask someone for help before I get overwhelmed.

I didn't finally get a break from my sister's verbal abuse until she left for college. Whenever she comes home I take care to interact with her as little as possible. I had to file 4 official complaints about a coworker harassing me before my boss held a meeting and told them to knock it off. With the dogs, I wait out their stay by distracting myself and boosting my serotonin through exercise, probiotic supplements, and lean proteins in food.

When I'm in a bad state and need to break my mind out of the loop it's caught in, I turn to slice of life stories. Anime like /K-On!/ and /Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid/ came along when I desperately needed somewhat-mindless wholesomeness to remind me that life can work out okay. However, my favorite example of this genre is the Avatar fanfic /What I Learned at SRU/, which you can read my full pitch for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6ffjma/monthly_recommendation_thread/dijbsfe][here]].

*** Meds.

In my experience, anxiety is much like depression in that you can't just think your way out of it. You aren't anxious because you need to change the way you think, you're anxious because something is going on in your brain to make you that way regardless of logic or reason. Meds can help fix that problem so that you /can/ actually think through it.

It sounds to me - from what you say - that what you're missing here is the serenity to accept the things you cannot change. The things that you mention here, are things that you /know/ you cannot change. You /know/ you cannot avoid. You /know/ they cause you stress. (And dwelling on this fact is just going to stress you out worse).

Any of your /current/ causes of stress may have individual solutions. I don't know enough about them to say for sure one way or another. But the overarching problem remains - that you do not have the serenity to accept a cause of stress that you cannot change.

...I don't /really/ know how to fix that. All I can suggest is not dwelling on it. Think about something else, instead. (Like pink elephants. Or better yet, make a deliberate effort to /not/ think about pink elephants.)

So first, a riddle:

#+begin_quote
  ketura-Last Monday at 1:50 AM

  And I've got the whole day off tomorrow, and on top of that my wife is taking my son to go visit grandma

  so a whole day to code with no interruptions

  and all this dratted dll shit is finally taken care of

  so I expect to get at least a /little/ done
#+end_quote

Can the viewers at home guess what happened next?

A. Got a little done on Labor Day

B. Got a lot done on Labor Day

C. Got a serious case of the shits on Labor Day and spent two days weeping and staring listlessly at the computer screen

If you guessed A) or B), no cookie for you! It just goes to show that I am such an /amateur/ pessimist. I really can't help but tempt fate.

Fortunately (as odd a statement this is) the entire week was not Labor Day, so I did get stuff done, just not the huge leap I was aiming for.

Over the weekend I cleaned house on the code and got it resembling more of a respectable repository than the polished trash heap it was. This involved extracting all of the compiler-specific code into its own project, which was done at first as a means of tracking down an obscure bug but in retrospect was actually a good move for encapsulation--if, in the far distant future, one wanted to support using different implementations of a C# compiler or even compiling different languages, then having all the relevant code hidden behind an interface is the first step to that. I don't think I'll need that, but it's nice to have a solid, well-built design nonetheless.

I managed to standardize the naming schemes, finally cleared up all the warnings that I was shoving under the rug as I developed, and even found the root cause of the obscure bug from earlier (it was causing the entire project to recompile every time I ran it--regardless of whether or not anything changed. Made debugging a pain in the /ass/).

As the cherry on top to this spring cleaning, I also formally adopted a software license. After mulling over the question for a few days and discussing it with [[/u/PeridexisErrant]], I decided to fling (most of) the received advice to the wind and go with Apache 2.0. So, all the files are now marked with the appropriate notice, a long-form license is included, and while I was at it I added a readme and some notes for when I next have to wrestle with reorganizing references (this summary downplays it, but it took a /lot/ of work to get the stupid library references to play nice with being yanked up and repositioned wherever I felt like).

--------------

I spent a lot of time grumbling about switching the stats over to use =dynamic= (as suggested by [[/u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl]] last week). At first I had rejected it out of hand, especially once I had come to the conclusion that using dynamic could result in, say, two units of the same species both having an ATK stat that was different numeric types. I had all but convinced myself that this would be too unwieldy while serializing (not to mention I was loathe to throw out the work I had made into the current “solution”), but eventually I realized that I could simply use a private =dynamic= value, and re-wire the =Value= field to read (and cast) that field.

All the overloaded math operators use the dynamic =RawValue=, while other classes can only access or set the strongly-typed =Value=. It seems to work pretty flawlessly, actually, and I'm pretty sure that this will be reasonably ironclad once I've got the tests and benchmarks rewritten to accommodate the new status quo. Thanks again for the suggestion, potato.

--------------

So I guess this week's TL;DR is “buncha technobabble and very little else”. I'm still a little salty about losing my Monday; I was ready to knock out the asset serializer, which is the first step to loading/saving unit data. Guess that'll be the first thing I tackle this weekend instead.
