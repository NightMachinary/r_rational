** New chapter of Legacy (Worm fanfiction). Cenotaph and Wake precede Legacy, read them before starting on Legacy if you haven't yet.

*** How is Legacy? The writing in Cenotaph and Wake was almost comparable to that of Worm. But I thought I'd leave Legacy hanging until it's ready.

**** Equally excellent, albeit different in theme - Legacy is about rebuilding the entire city, and maybe Taylor's disconnection from normality. Less fights, more politics; but brilliantly written.

**** Well, I think it's really good. There's maybe less fighting so far, but it feels like events are getting a bit more intense.

** Yeah, saw it. Took me a while to remember which fic it was, since I'm following like 10 other Worm fics.

***** It's pretty unfortunate, there's [[https://ficsave.com/][ficsave]] (which is great for Fanfiction), and a couple others that work sporadically on other sites, but I still haven't found anything that works on Spacebattles or Sufficient Velocity.

Meanwhile, the [[http://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule][20-20]] rule and taking frequent breaks were lifesavers once I learned about them.

****** This isn't exactly super user friendly, but... [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmgwmqgh939dco0/SB-SV-QQ-ETC%20EBOOKFAB.zip?dl=0][here]]. It is a bit jury rigged but it is something I made to get stories off SB/SV/QQ and onto my kindle. It does require using the command line and installing Node.js though.

******* So far downloaded node.js and tried to run epubgen.exe, but there's no prompts for a URL, documentation on what to do next, etc. Is this something a few simple commands are enough for?

Thanks for sharing, but unfortunately I'm not familiar with javascript to dig into this without direction.

******** Shift right click in the folder and click "Open command window here" Run the command "node dl2ci_legacy-worm.js" That should do it. epubgen.exe is used by the script, it isn't used directly.

********** Great - if you want to use it for any other story on those sites, just open dl2ci_legacy-worm.js in notepad or something and replace the link in the beginning bits to Legacy's threadmarks with the appropriate threadmark link. Then save it (I tend to make a new file for each story) and run it the same way.

******* Tried the calibre addon fanfiction downloader? works for creating ebook files from SB, SV etc. I've also found bloxp useful for creating files from stories on blog sites like wordpress.

******** I tried that way back, but it didn't work very well. Even if I could get it to work I probably wouldn't use something like that now - having done it enough, its easier now for me to configure a script for whatever website I'm trying to scrape.
