Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/40060/BNA][Brand New Animal]] is a rational, pro-transhumanism anime.

"Wait, what?" You might be tempted to say. BNA is obviously an irrational, rule of cool Trigger anime with a side plot about discrimination, just like zootopia or beastars.

Wrong! Without exception, every character in BNA makes choices based on their values, skills, and goals, rather than mere plot necessity. Even the characters that are obviously irrational (comic relief slum bears) are irrational for clearly explained, deep seated socioeconomic reason. Plans are made with fallbacks and neither the heroes nor the villains are stupid. There are 'unfair' coincidences (typically, characters meeting each other at convenient times), but these coincidences could have easily been replaced, as every major event in the story would have had character-driven reasons to still happen. So even the 'irrational' parts are justifiable, as they happen for storytelling reasons rather than "move the plot ahead" reasons.

Yes, the fight scenes involve throwing lasers around and friendship based powerups. But these powerups match the enemy unfair powerups beat for beat, so a fight's winner is still who you'd expect to win at the beginning of a fight based on levels of athleticism and training (combat or otherwise.)

Finally, we have the issue of the 'technology' used. It would deserve a spot on tvtropes 'artistic license - genetics' page, except that it's very clearly sufficiently analyzed magic. It works in a self-consistent manner, and technological upgrades are foreshadowed.

So now that I've explained why BNA is rational, I'm going to explain why I reccommend it. And to an extent, that recommendation depends on the 'Death of the Author.' I made an earlier assertion that BNA wasn't concerned, thematically, with discrimination. But it does, in fact have a pretty lukewarm but unobjectionable anti-discrimination theme (it's a bit of a broken aesop for a few reasons, but I can' t go into why without spoilers.) But, probably by accident, it manages to have a very strong pro-transhumanism stance. Most anime about the future shoehorn in some sort of "technology can have drawbacks" or "we need to be careful not to lose our humanity" subplots. BNA goes very much in the opposite direction. Can't say too much because that would be spoiling the plot, but BNA is of the opinion that genetic modification is awesome, people should have whatever bodies they want, and being something other than human would be pretty damn cool.

And of course, the characters are likeable, it got some genuine laughs from me, and (as with any trigger anime) the fights are awesome.

It does have one YMMV drawback-- namely, that it is unapolagetically furry. But I would recommend it to non-furries despite that (as it wasn't made for the furry fandom, it just happens to fall directly into their wheelhouse.)

****** Aside from what others have said, there's probably a taint by association: Furries (the real-life suit-wearing sexual deviants) really loudly like a certain sort of anthropomorphised animal, and people really don't want to associate with that.

That being said, from what little I've seen of this anime, it's not really that sort of 'furry'. The japanese 'I want to fuck anime monstergirls' fandom has always been a separate thing, and the anime art style means the animal-based monstergirls are less uncanny valley than western-style furries, usually.

Not exactly. A better description of the phenomena would be "anthro(pomorphic)", as there's a gap between talking/funny animals and kemonomimi where the furry fandom resides in. The shows you reference are furry-adjacent in the same way we call things rational-adjacent, but they're more stuff the fandom takes inspiration from, rather than stuff that was created to appeal to the fandom. BNA doesn't really have that excuse; I can almost guarantee someone on the production team considers themselves to be a furry based on character design and themes.

In general to me it just seems like an easy (if unoriginal) way to add fantasy races to a setting that aren't Tolkien based.

But I guess I am committing the typical mind fallacy and there is a significant slice of the population that is viscerally creeped out by this stuff, just like others are creeped out by holes.

****** As mentioned by IICVX it's a uncanny valley kind of effect: people generally dislike things that are too human but not human enough. So popular things tend to be either very inhuman or essentially human to avoid this(media format also matters). Talking animals? No problem. Humans with tails and ears? Ok. Humans with "realistic" animal heads so you can't read emotions? Nightmare fuel.

Bugs and Mickey are inhuman and very cartoonish in appearance and action. Thundercats could mostly be humans with makeup/accessories. Beast is a disfigured human and has that portrayed negatively throughout, she learns to overlook his appearance and her kidnapping. Digimon are probably considered talking animals.

Zootopia is a good example of toeing the line while also jumping across it for scares/action.

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.57643/][Companion Chronicles]] is /technically/ a multicross fanfiction, specifically a jumpchain if you know what that is, but I think it would be more thematically accurate to call it original fiction set in a jumpchain setting. It's the only jumpchain I've read more than 100 words of, and it's... different.

I don't think it's exaggerating too much to say that Companion Chronicles is to the jumpchain genre as Worth the Candle is to the isekai/SI genre.

A jumpchain is, as I understand it, a structured multicross where the protagonist ("jumper") is imported into a fictional setting for a number of years at a time, with selectable perks, drawbacks and objectives on import (similar to the Worm CYOA, which some may be more familiar with). Once the failure or success condition is met, or time is up, the "jump" concludes and the "jumper" is transported to the next setting to do it all again, with an intermission in between to recuperate. The jumper keeps the abilities between settings, and may bring characters from settings with them as "companions", which can also go into settings with them and accumulate abilities themselves. If you think this sounds a whole lot like powerwank wish-fulfilment fantasy, you're right.

This story is an attempt to deconstruct all of that.

Companion Chronicles is not about the jumper. It's about Cassandra, a new companion who chooses to leave their (author-invented) setting and follow the actual jumper on their Doctor Whoesque wacky journey that has been underway for centuries. And she knows what a jumpchain /is/, which works to both her advantage and detriment, because there are tropes and genre conventions that aren't exactly a /good idea/.

Companion Chronicles is about many things. It's about how struggles to reconcile free will and the knowledge that she's the younger version of a anime character from a franchise most people she meets have seen (note that she leaves her seemingly baseline world years /before/ nations starts building giant battle-mechas to wage international war, so her own setting sounds to her exactly like the incredibly dumb anime plot that it is, about dealing with her complex motivations, history and traumas boiled down to tropes on a cast list and continuity errors retconned into lore. It's about the morality of intervention (think Prime Directive; her first jump after leaving her homeworld being /Worm/ just pre-locker probably already tells you a lot) and about the consequences of indulgence in power fantasy, which are very real and explored with a heavy hand. It's about narrative and predicting the game master. It's about identity and the consequences of functional immortality. To a large extent, it's also about the personal journey of Cassandra, who's a three-dimensional character in her own right instead of a blank slate like the majority of authorial inserts, and about a continuous struggle to look past the tropes and conventions of a plot she knows to the people behind. The comparisons to WtC write themselves, and I mean that in the best way possible.

As of right now, Companion Chronicles has finished Cassandra's first two jumps: 10-years in Worm, which taken alone would be a novel-length Worm SI better than most I've read, and a foray into Star Trek which has a lower word count but still packs a punch. It updates roughly weekly with 5-10k chapters. It is severely underrated and receives nowhere near the amount of traffic it should, which is a huge shame.

**** The MC goes on a "gender identity rant" because another character (because of cultural ignorance) called her a trap. It's an /in-character/ rant, and even calling it that is arguably a stretch. It's an expositionaty device to highlight culture clash and the personalities of the interacting people.

The story isn't a soapbox for the author's "SJW" rants, if that's what you---or anyone else reading---is worried about. The vast majority of the text doesn't focus on sexual or gender identity. Because of superpowers bullshit, Cassandra cheats past most of the transitioning "experience". Companion Chronicles is not a trans story. But the viewpoint character is MtF, and it's a part of her character, and as the other replier said, an element of the SI true to the author.

If you're simply not interested in reading social justice rants (a term I'm not really comfortable using because of the belittling connotation, but it conveys the concept), you won't have any problems with the story. /Pick a random chapter, and it's going to be people strategizing on how to solve problems, effect societal change and beat each other up---not gender counseling and pride parades./

If you're just uncomfortable reading from a MtF viewpoint, the character is biologically female for most of the story, and it's not like the narration is drawing any attention to it otherwise.

****** That part was fascinating because it's not as much an allegory as a /story about allegories/, and the subject being a trans metaphor is merely Management making it in-character for Cassandra. I would argue that despite having transness being a plot element, the arc isn't /really/ a trans story since the themes and moral of that arc aren't about identity, fear, bigotry etc., but about agency, narrative and tropes as you said---and also about how changes in circumstance and opportunities can lead to disconnect from a community, and how societal change can lead to the obsolescence and fading of such communities, which are again widely general.

***** The problem is that its a probably a million year old character (Homura) that's supposed to not know that calling someone a "trap" is offensive.\\
The Doylist reasoning is that the author wanted an opportunity to put some gender issues into the fiction. That is all fine as long as it makes sense _in universe_. The author's work is even harder here since it is an author insert, so the default assumption is that the author shapes the story to the author's whim which breaks SOD, which makes the story unfun. This is even acknowledged at the beginning, but that doesn't make it better.

****** You make a good point, but it doesn't break SoD that much for me. Homura spent most of her life in anime Japan reliving permutations of the exact same events over and over, so it's not surprising that she didn't pick up "Western values". She's characterized as deliberately antisocial to her jumpchain peers in an attempt to not form attachments, and is hyperfocused on specific goals, /and/ most settings don't deal with (modern human-style) gender etiquette anyway. If she really is a million years old, it's implausible, I agree, but it's also implausible that a million-year-old person would mentally and socially functional in any way, so...

Edit: it's also possible that she knows the "correct" way of addressing a trans person, but doesn't realize that using "trap" is significantly offensive, because again---she doesn't talk to people much, and you only know something is offensive when you're called out or you see someone else called out for it.

***** It's tribalism. If I read something and get the impression the author is from a different tribe than me, and wearing it on their sleeve/putting it in the work, it creates distrust of the story as a whole.

The above written isn't exactly right; I can't properly put it into words. But there's some vague feeling I can't quite identify that is, I think, why people react this way.

This was written by a person, but text is compressed and lossy. Decompression, reading, necessarily requres some simulation of the mind of the author. That's probably part of it; your model of the author/speaker/narrator informs the interpretation of the entire rest of the text.

**** It's kind of a CYOA thing, for which there are many documents floating around. You/your character is about to be dropped into a fictional setting. You start with 1000 points to buy a bunch of benefits at various costs, and drawbacks that give you extra points. You are then dropped into that setting for 10 years, or until you die, or possibly until a victory condition has been achieved or failed. You then have the option to go home, stay in that setting, or move onto another Jump, keeping all the benefits you've purchased and none of the drawbacks, and often taking a Companion along for the ride.

There's a bunch of jumps created for various settings, and supplemental documents, and min-Jumps, etc.. They tend to be fun to make decisions about what your "build" is going to be, and also lend themselves to story formats.

** Hello all. I hope youre all staying well in this time of quarantine.

Due to only working every other week I have been burning through my lists of books and fanfics.

I just finished Baru Cormorant and was hoping for something similar to it. I have the sequel lined up to read and will probably finish that today or tomorrow.

Id love some fanfica of boku no hero of similar quality to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13933635/chapters/32073363][From Muddy Waters]]. Ive read the My Hero School is Going Wrong, As Expected mash up. I want whatever youve got that's good quality and either updating regularly or finished. No dead works please.

Additionally I just finished my reread of Dune. Are the sequels worth reading? Ive heard mixed reviews on them and dont want to read them if they spoil the excellence that was Dune.

Additionally Id like to recommend an anime that has kept me motivated to be active during the quarantine. How Heavy Are the Dumbbells That You Lift? Is not rational but motivating with interesting characters that all become interested in working out at a fascimile of Gold's Gym. It's light and uplifting and always gets me pumped to do an at at home workout.

*** WRT Dune, I'm gonna recommend the first 4. They successively get more and more complex, and take more and more effort to fully parse, but IMO they're worth it. They go deeper and deeper into the horrific tragedy that is the existence of prescience, and the fourth concludes in the only way it possibly could.

You can pretty much stop after any if you get tired, and I wouldn't say that any of these spoil the first. (I cannot say the same for the later books).

That said, I found that it's taking me many re-reads to feel like I fully grasp them, but each re-read I feel like I 'get' one more of them. (I finished my 3rd re-read mid-2019, and finally felt like I understood the 2nd. The 3rd will have to wait for next time).

I will /also/ rec some of Frank Herbert's other works, including my second favourite book of all time: The Godmakers, which is set in a totally different universe, but goes deeper into his explorations of society and it's relationship with religion, but is much shorter, and IMO, tighter. (He also has the Jesus Incident, which is good, but not as good as Dune.

*** Dune Messiah(2) is great IMO, but it does tarnish some beloved characters, which is why I feel it gets a bad rap. People get attached to characters and dislike it when they get torn down.

Children of Dune (3) and God Emperor of Dune (4) are both amazing, and are the 2 sequels that are almost universally praised. 4 is especially mind-bending and original. Again, Herbert was certainly not afraid of upsetting the apple cart, maybe because he had that fuck you money by then.

Dune 5 and 6 are not as bad as people say, but they do have a lot of issues. I still don't know what Herbert was going for, and it's a shame he never really got to complete his vision.

As to the other books (prequels, sequels, spinoffs) written by his son, they really don't deserve to be even mentioned in the same conversation as the originals. I can't think of a more disrespectful thing that has ever been done to a father's legacy than what they did with those novels. It's the equivalent of trying to pass off a 2 year old's play doh mashing next to Michelangelo's David. I sometimes fantasize of an afterlife so I can imagine Frank reuniting with his jagoff son and beating the everloving shit out of him with jumper cables until he got it out of his system.

**** The problem with 5 and 6 is that while you have a complete story after the first book, or after the first three, or the first four (I personally think that /Messiah/ isn't complete without /Children/, but wouldn't argue the point), you can't really say that about the first five or even all six Frank Herbert Dune books. /Heretics/ and /Chapterhouse/ clearly switch from entries with their own conclusions, into more of a multi-book build-up towards some never-written conclusion. If nothing else, they suffer for that: they're /incomplete/.

As for the Brian Herbert books... I think the /ideas/ in them were based on his Father's notes, which he gained access to at some point after the /Prelude to Dune/ series (/House Atriedes/, /Harkonnen/, /Corrino/) were written. You can see it in the way that the /Prelude/ series has many more continuity issues than the far-past /Legends of Dune/ prequels (Butlerian Jihad, Machine Crusade, Battle of Corrin), or Dune 7 (/Hunters/ and /Sandworms/) do. Heck, it's hard to reconcile /Prelude/ and /Legends/ into the same universe, despite being by the same authors.

So, if it's the /plotline/ that you don't like in /Legends/ or Dune 7, that's probably Frank's fault.

However, the execution by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson is poor enough that it's hard to say if the ideas would have worked to bring the series to the conclusion it deserved if they were written competently.

*** For Baru Cormorant, do you mean the politics, the intrigue, or the themes?

Ah, I personally didn't like the 2nd book in the Dune series and I never read the rest but I've heard that the prequel series was pretty good.

Two my hero academia fics I enjoyed that are both finished were yesterday upon the stairs and Hero Class Civil War

Yesterday upon the stair is a story where Deku has a quirk that that he keeps hidden that lets him see and interact with ghosts. It doesn't have much use in combat, at first anyway, but seeing all the death, past victims of villains, and the presence of a ghost girl who seems to have adopted him have made Deku much more mature and competent. He is a little traumatized but in a realistic way and he is very ruthless with villains as he can literally interact with their past victims and his classmates admit he can be a little scary when he is focused.

Hero Class Civil War shows a class activity where the class is split into two teams. One who will be playing the role of heroes, led by "Paragon" and the other playing the role of villains, led by "Kingpin." Bakugou is acting as Paragon, while Deku is the Kingpin. There is a lot of great strategy and action, people having fun in villain roles, and it shows how scary Midoriya could be if he was a villain.

**** Sorry I just saw this.

For like it, it felt very rational. The best part for me was how it made you feel towards the end, similar to Professor Quirrell in HPMOR. You KNEW what was going to happen yet you didnt want it to happen anyways. You liked all of the characters and didnt want what was going to inevitably happen to them occur. It reached the rational ending and was satisfying despite going against what you wanted.

Do you have links for those fanfics?

*** In the Dune series I'd recommend reading the first three books by Frank Herbert: /Dune/, /Dune Messiah/, and /Children of Dune/.

In comparison to the first book, /Dune Messiah/ and /Children of Dune/ have plots that aren't as fast paced or finely focused on the goals of a single character, but it my opinion they still have plenty of action, intrigue and suspense woven in with fascinating worldbuilding. Their outlook on the world created by Muad'Dib's victory is much bleaker, but also more nuanced than the relatively simple 'good guys win' ending of the first book.

** Wildbow has started his new webserial [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][*Pale*]], which is set in the [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] universe, but, crucially, does /not/ require people to have read Pact before.

It seems set up to be different from the stories Wildbow has written so far, from what he mentioned he wants to keep this one short (so probably just like one or three normal books' worth of content), and it's told in 3rd person perspective, switching between at least three main characters.

The writing is atmospheric, I already like the setting, a small Canadian town for which Wildbow has even provided [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/05/07/brochure-experience-kennet/][a brochure including a map]]. The main plot seems to be a murder mystery with supernatural elements.

These three main characters are the most childlike Wildbow has written so far; they're three normal (not magical) girls around 13 years old. (Technically, the Lambs were younger, but they were trained assassins and don't at all compare to these three). So I don't think we'll see them be competent badasses on the scale Wildbow's protagonists usually are.

There's too many possibilities, and names often have their own set of readings anyways. Based on my pop-up dictionary the readings are technically possible.

****** In a functioning world, you're totally right. Undesirable role so the reward grows until people are willing to fill it.

The smart thing about the setting though is that Delve's world is in decline. The story doesn't bash you over the head with it like Worm or something, but there's little hints sprinkled all over. The big magical Empire fell a long long time ago but the world has never stopped sliding. Fel Sedanis is smaller than it used to be (the whole city fits with room to spare inside the shield dome now), or the remaining platinums are too few in number to raise another person to plat (if they could even get along to do so), the Watch doesn't patrol so far out.

And in this context, it makes sense. If you're in a state of uncertainty, you /can't/ afford to go with the economic choice of support. A support class could be enslaved or robbed. Hell, the MC himself might have been enslaved if he had useful buffs for the city's leader instead of a different buff path. Even a 'steady' job is risky, because they can lose their livelyhood charging up teleporter pads all day if their city gets invaded (or just get robbed by a random awakened). At the very least every awakened needs to be able to run off and hide in the wilderness without dying to trivial monsters, in case the Empire of Adamant comes knocking.

It leads to a terrible cycle, because supports really are necessary. The fewer supports there are, the more shitty things become, which causes fewer supports. But nobody wants to be a support, because things are just getting worse.

It makes the MC's unique build actually make sense, because the world really does have a gap and the whole setting is hurting because of it. It also means he's better as part of a force multiplier in a group, instead of going by himself solo'ing world bosses, which is a significant fail state in many stories.

******* While I agree that Delve's world is in shambles compared to the time of the Majistraal, I wouldn't call it more than /local/ decline. If you treat the Majistraal like Rome, then Rome fell and we're in the Dark Ages, but that just means there's less infrastructure (i.e. smaller towns) and weaker concentrations of power (i.e. no platinumplates), not that the whole world is continuing to decline.

Getting to Goldplate is a snowball effect. When you have a party of golds, you can reliably elevate someone to gold. We see this in the DKE being able to sustain dozens of goldplates, for instance. The same should apply to platinum, but in this post-Majistraal world there just aren't enough platinums to reliably elevate new people to platinum, so we're stuck with gold as the cap until enough people are lucky enough to make platinum at once and agree to get the snowball rolling.

The shrinkage of Fel Sadanis is clear too. The Majistraal had extensive teleportation infrastructure and could sustain a larger city than with just local farms, and while the teleportation arrays still exist they appear to be much less frequently used, meaning Fel Sadanis has to shrink to a sustainable size over time.

As for supports, while I do think that (outside of the Empire) there are generally fewer than you'd want for a balanced ecosystem, I don't think it's necessarily true that they're /continually/ in decline, or that Fel Sadanis is representative of supports around the world. Fel Sadanis, only playing host to Watch and Guild, essentially has minimal organizational infrastructure/rich and powerful people who can hire supports. If you wanted to sell your services to a party of Silverplates or a Goldplate or such, you would likely look elsewhere, in the richer cities.

While the idea that the world is /still/ falling apart is admittedly interesting, my priors rest more on the theory that it /has/ fallen apart and is now in a stable equilibrium (where Fel Sadanis just happens to be on the sucky end of the scale) and will remain that way until the next big rise, which will set the snowball rolling again and bring platinumplates back to the fore. It's not implausible that the Adamant Empire has the potential to become such an event, at least if it isn't stopped.

*** One I would recommend that hasn't been yet, that fits the theme of this sub, is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach][Godel, Escher, Bach]]. It's an excellent set of dialogs, puzzles, and structural references that can only be done justice in hardback. It focuses on formal systems, communication, intelligence, and their emergent properties but does so in a rather approachable way. It tackles the question of AI.

Personally I think it pairs well with Eliezer Yudkowsky's Rationality: From AI to Zombies. Both have interesting structures, and they approach similar ideas from radically different directions (very roughly one as self help+psychology series of blogs, the other as history+math textbook with dialogs).

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_in_the_White_City][The Devil in the White City]] follows the lives of Daniel H. Burnham and others who designed and built the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The story delves into fascinating details about architecture, technology, American culture, and the burgeoning labor movement at the turn of the century. Juxtaposed with the Fair's shining symbol of progress, the story also follows the life of Dr. H. H. Holmes, a notorious conartist and serial killer who murdered most of his victims within the apartment building he owned just 3 miles from the border of the Fair itself.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Garden_of_Beasts][In the Garden of Beasts]] follows the life of the American Ambassador to Germany and his daughter during their stay in Berlin in the year leading up to the Night of the Long Knives. The story examines the reasons why so many warning signs of the coming violence went unheeded, and how even 'good' people got swept up in the seemingly glamorous early days of nationalist fervor in Hitler's Germany.

*** Normally I try to keep it at a ratio of 3 or 4:1 of fiction to non-fiction(I read a lot). Crucial to my effort is classifying it more broadly as just "learning" rather than non-fiction, that way I can count podcasts, articles, online courses and scientific papers in that category. I also tend to use audiobooks almost exclusively for non-fiction, so that I can listen to books while I walk my dog or do chores.

If you want a subreddit thematic rec, try [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25131230][Rationality: From AI to Zombies]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I'm always amazed at how Eliezer manages to make these dense topics so much more lucid and approachable than they might otherwise be.

Another good generalist rec is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow][Thinking, Fast and Loose]] by Daniel Kahneman. It condenses Kahneman's nobel prize winning research into human behavioral science, with an emphasis on cognitive biases and heuristics. It's not the best book on the subject, mostly because it can be dry and seemingly repetitive/overlong, but it's an excellent start, and you're getting it from the horse's mouth.

** Reposting this since people might not have seen this from last weeks thread. A couple recommendations if y'all like "political" style stories.

--------------

Here are a couple more politically focused fics that I've enjoyed. They're not solely focused on politics, but the background is political enough that it works. These are pretty popular so there's a good chance you might have read some of these. Hopefully at least one is something you're unfamiliar with.

*Long Fics*

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-live-live-ones-passions-to-survive-abandon-ones-passions-historical-si-three-kingdoms-era.688912/][To live, live one's passions; to survive, abandon one's passions]] - Romance of the Three Kingdom's SI. 3/5. Ongoing

#+begin_quote
  This Romance of the Three Kingdom's SI is a decentish fic that does a good job of scratching the political intrigue itch. SI is the eldest son of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shao][Yuan Shao]] (Benchu) and is thrust directly into of the most volatile periods of Chinese history. Its biggest flaw is that it's too short, but thankfully it's still ongoing and we can see how the story develops. Tthe story does a fantastic job of balancing between giving the SI the ability to have a significant impact with keeping the SI from being too OP.

#+begin_quote
  This is my favorite Code Geass fanfiction in existence. It's also high up on my list of favorite fanfics of all time. It does a great job of taking the simple premise of a Lelouch who didn't get himself exiled and runs with it. Lelouch does his best to use intellect to navigate the intricacies of Britannian court politics. At times it can get a bit Lelouch OP, but if you can get past that flaw, the story is a delight to read. Special shoutout to the Milly chapter. The author does a great job of capturing her essence and I always have a smile while re-reading that part. It's sadly abandoned, but what we have is beautiful.

#+begin_quote
  This story does a fantastic job of toeing the line between uplift fic and political fic. I have a healthy amount of cynicism regarding uplift fics since they tend to be extremely unrealistic. The SI often is greatest engineer/scientist to ever live who also has perfect memory of every useful piece of historical science knowledge possible resulting in what best can be described as uplift porn than anything resembling a story.

  Thankfully this story does a great job of being fairly realistic regarding what a single human with very little power in the grand scheme of things can accomplish. Skagos improves, but it doesn't become the center of all human civilization. The political storylines tend to be more background, but when they are front and center the storylines are quite well written. Abandoned, but worth a read for sure.

#+begin_quote
  This is a really fun fiction. The SI merges with the President of the Irish Free-States pre-WW2. With what power he has, he does what he can to prepare the Irish nation for what's about to happen. This includes basic war prep, implementing new economic policies, improving Ireland's development, immigration policies, ect. It toes the line between uplift and political. The biggest criticism of this fic is that it seems to stick to a historical deterministic perspective. That whatever the SI does, WW2 and the genocide of the Jewish people is inevitable and all the Si can do is minimize the devastation. Other than that, it's still a fun fiction that takes a perspective that's not often seen. You also get a really interesting view of Irish history and political issues of the time period. Author gets deep into the details.

#+begin_quote
  A really unique fanfiction that got abandoned way too soon. SI entered DC and became a supervillain. He was caught, served his time and after emerging from prison is attempting to reform and be a better person. That means running for Mayor. The overall plot is well written and the SI's thought process is a lot of fun to read. The biggest problem with this fic is that it suffers from a case of, "SI's MAGIC solves all problems." Sadly it was cut short just as the story was entering the most interesting arc, but it's still worth a read.

  I doubt there's much I can say about this since it's been recommended to death on here and anywhere fanfics get recommended.

Some of the omake's and sidestories are fantastic and do a great job of adding to the worldbuilding.

***** So, the usual problem with quests is that the audience just wants to do whatever seems shiny at the moment. Through some combination of an unusually good audience and unusually good authorial wrangling, the first part actually reads like a book - like an actual human would make these decisions, with one following from another in a way that is presented as sensible.

Of course, normal quests are the way they are because they can be fun for audience and author alike - though I like them less as a detatched reader. I think both the audience and the author are less character/narrative focused in the sequel.

Women are practically nonexistent in this story, and when they appear, it's as "females" whose looks /must/ be commented on and compared to the other "females" around them. There is literally a conversation in one chapter about how "females" only have value when men give it to them. Not only is the MC gifted a hot magical princess gf out of nowhere, but she's incredibly insecure and deeply in his debt because apparently his dad gave her a magic tree when they were babies.

****** One problem I have encountered is that even very well written polyamory falls apart once the author tries to move beyond a threesome. - Relationships are only interesting if they get some depth and heft to them, and if they are multi-lateral. With a threesome, you need to track 3 relationships from 3 points of view. This can be done, and even fit within the constraint of a not-wrist-breaking book length.

However, the graph of relationships gets just far to many lines in it at four and above, which means either earlier relationships stop being explored (and at that point, you might as well write about serial monogamy!) or everything becomes super superficial.

******* A harem isn't well-written if you don't have the involved members going at each other's throats, I feel. The very foundation of it is the age-old struggle and conflict for limited resources (in this case influence and access to the "owner", who is in a position of power to warrant a harem in the first place). To have the harem get along with each other and "share" seems so unnatural and forced, and rubs out an avenue for the writer to write about intrigue. Most real-life examples of harems end in some ridiculously gruesome stuff.

I also agree 3-4 members in a harem is optimal in terms of screen-time for each "party" to make their case. More than that and there isn't any space to get to know the characters.

**** Note to those who are interested, that webnovel seems to be translated from Chinese.

If you never had experience with translated novels, jumping into the deep end is going to be rough on your eyes.

Not the actual content of the novel. This seems to be pretty standard Chinese mass murder power fantasy. Nothing particularly innovative other than the lack of the more cringe worthy awkwardly injected romance side plots.

People read Chinese power fantasies for the murder, not the romance. Read Japanese light novels for the romance, Chinese for the murder, and Korean for a mix with varying results.

What they all have in common is the eye bleedingly bad translations to English. The grammar, phrasing, and occasionally even spelling might be lacking as most translations are not professional. Some of them might even be run through Google Translate or other machine translations and you won't be able to tell the difference to a human doing it. It's all that bad.

Combined with the fact the source material is often aiming for word count / paid by chapter / low quality in the first place, these novels aren't quality reads.

Still, they do scratch an itch you won't find elsewhere in the English publishing world. And with often 1000+ chapters with each having 1k+ words, you'll get your fill of these stories and more.

RI specifically seems to have angered the Chinese Government and has been censored off the Chinese publishing world. Last I've heard from Reddit rumor mill is that the author is attempting to self publish but nothing else came out. RIP.

*** I've read two of those and really liked them.

A series I have been really enjoying is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles]]. I think it does the treating women as human beings thing well. The start of the story is a bit rough writing wise. But after that it has the philosophizing of Worth the Candle as the cultivation of Cradle with some litrpg-ish elements, before it gets to the straight up VRMMO litrpg (that blends perfectly with the "real world" cultivation). All with great worldbuilding.

Also as a PSA with Paragon, the first arc is extremely slow, boring, cliche and mediocre quality. I was halfway through and was about to give up before I was recommended to just skip to the start of the second arc. If you feel bored/give up I highly recommend doing that.

The author gives a nice summary so you don't miss any crucial details. I love the story from arc 2 onward, easily my second favorite xanxia story after [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/][Ave Xia Rem Y.]]

** Reviewing a bunch of prior recommendations

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30737/the-humble-life-of-a-skill-trainer/][Humble life of a skill trainer[]] Interesting take on the litrpg genre. Clever and mostly believable protagonist, and the world seems self-consistent. I would have liked the protag to be a little more conflicted about lying and torturing but I guess that's personal taste. The stakes have been low up till the most recent chapter and while it hasn't got my blood pumping I am interested in where it goes.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30131/seaborn/][Seaborn]].I recommend. A combination of seafare, litrpg and davy jones. The premise is interesting though the characters haven't quite developed depth yet. The quality doesn't seem super high but the premise have kept me interested this far.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21323/twilight-kingdom/][Twillight Kingdom]] Really interesting seemingly consistent world. The protagonist is likeable and the conflicts starts believable. I dropped it after the first major conflict were deux ex resolved by spoiler(the protagonist using random runes to kill the big badey without the badey really righting back). I'll put it on hold for a while as I cope with my disappointment but will probably pick it up again because it's mostly well written and interesting.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/nexus-quest-worm-the-gamer-multicross.7046/][The Nexus(worm/gamer/skyrim crossover)]] ]A quest that follows a Taylor that grinds xp and abilities in skyrim. A few clever ideas but the whole concept of killing people for XP isn't explored until fairly late and then the exploration is handled mechanically and without exploring the underlying emotions. I dropped it after 30-40 chapters and find that it's too focused on grinding power and not enough on how to use that power. Weak characters.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/zero-requiem-lelouch-in-asoiaf.745138][Zero Requiem(Lelouch/game of thrones crossover)]] Kind of what you would expect from the crossover - lelouch stomping his enemies by political and strategic maneuvers. I find it refreshing that this lelouch recognizes that he is taking high risk gambles instead of being certain that things will work out, however it breaks a little disbelief that he never loses a high risk gamble. Overlal enjoyable read if tactical curbstomp is your thing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16927533/chapters/39772074][Alexandra Quick and X)(arry Potter series in the US)]] A long as series following a magical student in the US. The main character is very well written. I find the commentary on American culture hillarious and the protag has reasonable magical skills. If anyone have read through multiple books I would love to hear if the protag becomes more actively storydriving or if the pace picks up later. I read the first book and while enjoyable I missed clever optimization and stories that revolve around what the protag wants to achieve so I've put the next ones on hold.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time/][An Advance in Time]] A story that follows an uploaded protag that tries to build and uplift a kingdom in a simulation that is owned by a coorporation trying to make money on it.

Yes, very much so. Obviously in Book 1, she's pre-teen who has never had formal magical training before, so of course she's not very skilled. That changes throughout the series, starting in Book 2. And the more powerful she gets, the more ability she has to influence the story.

She never becomes "rational", she always remains stubborn and impulsive, but as her skill increases she gets a lot better at actually implementing and following through with her seemingly irrational plans. I read someone describe her character as "bashing her head against a wall until the wall gives way", and that seems pretty accurate.

#+begin_quote
  or if the pace picks up later

In my personal opinion, Book 1 is the weakest in the series by a pretty wide margin, so if you already enjoyed it you will probably enjoy Book 2 more. Book 2 is much denser than Book 1, and it also gives you a better idea as to the series' overarching story and what the later books in the series are like.

*** Comedy is subjective but I found these two fics funny. Both are self-inserts.

This Bites is a one-piece story where the author is an adrenaline junkie and absolutely loves how crazy the world is. A lot of running gags and weird situations that come from the One Piece world. In the story, the Strawhats find a piece of technology that lets the author's radio show reach a global audience and a lot of the fun is the world reacting to the craziness of the Straw Hats and the situations they find themselves in.

The other is What's her name in Hufflepuff where the author is a girl who is sorted into Hufflepuff and the everyday weirdness that is the magical world that is genuinely funny, seems to fit quite well with canon, and the children in the story actually act like children to the author's annoyance.

If it helps I was gonna ask for XCOM fics but I see now that there aren't that many and most of them aren't what I'm looking for, anything with a similar vibe to what you do in these games would be welcome.

As far as I remember, though, after the reveal, it slowly became more truly rational and it, somehow, made the story /boring/, at least for me. I definitely liked the earlier parts more than the later ones.

** I'm looking for stories where the MC is competent without being a Mary Sue.

​

It's a scenario I'm getting more interested in as I get older and my patience with seeing the Nth MC that has trouble doing basic things decreases. Less of on YA vibe and more of an adult cast.

​

Examples I've seen: Delve, MoL, HPMOR, Perks of Immortality, Eight, Forge of Destiny, Bobiverse, James Bond (?), Indiana Jones.

*** Sabatini's [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1965][Captain Blood]]. Addictive doctor-turned-charismatic-pirate adventure. Skip the movies, book is far superior. Captain stories in general are probably good at this, Hornblower, Master & Commander (have heard this had a good movie). Can highly recommend Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan as far as captain stories go.

Psycho-Pass (anime). Slow beginning, really hits its stride around episodes 12-13 (episode 6 in the extended?). The movie is also recommended. Think Funimation still [[https://www.funimation.com/shows/psycho-pass/][streams]] the Director's Cut free with ads, pick "Extended Edition" instead of "Season 1" (it doesn't say you need to subscribe anyways, may have to log in, extended puts 2 episodes into 1 so the count is right). Manly intellectual cop (sadly not the MC, but close enough) faces down elegant anarchist murderer in a surveillance state.

I haven't read any of it yet (closed bookstores and bad shipping times due to virus), but I've had my eye on the character [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raistlin_Majere][Raistlin Majere]].

** Looking for long web serials or fanfiction (100k+ words, or complete in the 40k+ range). Particularly like LitRPGs or Romcoms. I like things that:

- Focus on a smaller cast of characters, preferably spending the majority of the story with the protagonist.
- Puts characters over world building, I want interesting character development/relationships over learning some fantasy empire's hierarchy.
- Have educational tidbits. Nothing too heavy, but if a real science/history/psychology etc..., tidbit informs a character decision, that's interesting.
- Have good pacing, Rome wasn't built in a day, but I also don't need a report on every brick placement.If it has fight scenes, strategic and/or with emotional stakes.
- Have a sense of humour, preferably doesn't get bogged down with heavy drama, war or politics.
- If it's Gamer-style, doesn't go crazy with stat screens.

Worth the Candle is easily a favourite. Thank you for abiding my picky criteria.

*** I don't know if I'd classify this is as a romcom, but I find it to be one of the best romance fanfiction/or fictions in general I've had the opportunity of reading.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12027237/1/Breaking-Through-the-Bottom-of-the-Bottle][Breaking Through the Bottom of the Barrel]] by College Fool.

- great characters and characterization
- fantastic pacing
- amazing humor

Honestly at 42K words it's short and sweet. I've probably reread it over half a dozen times because of just nice of good of story it is.

** Highly recommend [[https://www.amazon.com/CivCEO-Lit-Accidental-Champion-Book-ebook/dp/B07YRTVLMZ/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=civceo&qid=1589214776&sr=8-4][CIVCEO]]. It's a series of four books about a person transported to another world where deities chose heroes are chosen to lead villages in their name. MC is the newly retired CEO of a company on earth and decides to create a nation focused on his strengths, trade.

The story is a mix of city/kingdom building and trade and merchant negotiation. The story is a bit of a popcorn fic where things happen a bit too easy for our MC, but if you like kingdom building/merchant trading/a splash of political intrigue, the books scratch that itch quite well. The books get better as the series progresses as well.

*** I strongly counter this rec.

For me, the first book was seemingly written by someone who has never played a 4x/city management game about a boomer who has also never played a 4x/city management game, transported to a world where everything just... works out for him. The idea has a lot of potential, but the application is worse than bad, it's soulless and anemic, it has no depth, no flavor, and zero sense of craftsmanship.

A glimpse into this worlds "mechanics": gold is the only relevant resource, so there is no resource management layer whatsoever, no supply chains, no tech trees, nothing like that. Everything and anything can be purchased with gold, including every building. There is no training time for specialization of workers, they just suddenly know everything their job entails. Production time of goods is completely arbitrary, as is quantity produced or the price of goods. A single level one farm is enough to pay for the upkeep of hundreds of mercenaries(possibly thousands? It's unclear, but it's enough to stave off an invasion by the antagonists, anyway) not once but several times over... How does that make any sense, whether mechanically or narratively?

A glimpse into the worldbuilding: there is an years long standoff between two cities, the first of which specced purely into war, with tens of thousands of well trained, well equipped warriors, and the second that went for "tall" archetype (i.e. high pop, production, culture, science, etc focused on one city). Somehow, over those many years of stalemate the war city is still able to feed and upkeep their many thousands of soldiers (with no trade or pillaging, apparently, as they were cut off from any other town), and the besieged tall city has tens of thousands of citizens that were able to maintain a comfortable existence while resisting invasion and assault. Again, does that makes any sense? Does it seem like the author put any thought whatsoever into verisimilitude?

In short, this is not even remotely a 4x game as it advertises itself to be. The mechanics are mind-numbingly simplistic, the MC is a (non-intetional) charicature of boomer, constantly spouting off trite aphorisms and cretinous truisms, and is not remotely relatable, the plot is thin and uninteresting, and there is absolutely 0 narrative tension, as every problem is well within the MC's capabilities.

**** Yup, I picked this book up (for free thanks to Kindle Unlimited) and dropped it within the first few chapters.

One thing I don't think you emphasized enough is just how /insufferable/ the MC is. If you've ever worked with an entitled, out of touch executive at a mid-sized company, that's the MC - and not only is /he/ unaware of his shortcomings, /the book/ also fails to realize that he's a terrible person.
