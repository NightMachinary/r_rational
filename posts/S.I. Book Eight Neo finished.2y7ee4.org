** The moderators at SpaceBattles decided that some of the content in S.I. has passed into NSFW territory. I'm trying to negotiate with them to see if it will be possible to make edits to bring the story into what's allowed to be posted there. (I've made a similar appeal to a similar ruling at a SpaceBattles spin-off board I was also posting the story at, SufficientVelocity.) While that's being hashed out, I've started to post the new chapters to another SpaceBattles spin-off board, at [[http://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/s-i-original-si.1134/]] . (I've just posted chapter 7.9 there, and expect to post new ones twice a week or so until the buffer's at a more reasonable size.)

** Is there ever a chance of the fictionpress version of the story being updated? I tend to only read web serials on my Kindle (reading novel length stuff on my computer screen kills my eyes) and prefer formats more readily converted to ebook.

*** There is a chance, yes. One of my beta-readers and I were discussing having them update it for me - FP has a truly terrible posting interface - and if that doesn't work out, I'll do it myself.

**** It turns out that the beta-reader in question has had to bow out. Is there anyone reading this who'd be willing to get S.I. posted to FictionPress for me?

(If I don't get a reply in the next couple of days, I expect I'll start churning through the process while watching TV.)
