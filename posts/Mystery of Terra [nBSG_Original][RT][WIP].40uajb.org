** I loved first contact stories. I think we should write more contact stories.

So I wrote one.

** There's another Trek/BSG contact story out there, but it doesn't have the language barrier and it has the Enterprise saving the twelve tribes during their exodus thingy. I'm curious how things will play out with this role reversal.

*** It is not a Star Trek contact story.

If you paid any attention to the details, you noticed the lack of artificial gravity, skyscraper configuration, no anti-matter drive, railguns, and the use of nuclear propulsion.

Terran humanity proper had only been an interstellar civilization for...twenty years proper, and that's being generous.

**** My bad, I read that the deck plates were oriented parallel to the engines and read the two-pronged spaceship, and thought that it sounded like a Trek ship.

  The starship wasn't certainly of any classical Cylon designs. It was completely different, and sleek looking, with unfamiliar weapon mounts sticking out of it and holes where missiles could come out of. There were two nacelles sticking out towards the rear that he couldn't figure out the purpose of. Whatever it was, it wasn't certainly a landing or launch bay. The design was all wrong.

I mean, this just /screams/ J.J. Abrams-influenced Trek warships.

  The magnetic lock on her marines.was still active, and that they were in a skyscrapper configuration. Specifically, the light was on, but there was no artificial gravity. Lastly, the floors was oriented parallel to the thrust of the engines. That way, the feets would be on the floor, and not the other way around.
#+end_quote

This piece is contradictory. In a skyscraper configuration, the plane of the decks is perpendicular to the thrust of the engines.

***** I got my geometry wrong in this case.
