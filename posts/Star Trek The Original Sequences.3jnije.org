** I enjoyed it. I remember another snippet with a similar chain of events but a different outcome. In response to the challenge on the sig figs of his percent, Spock quoted a huge variety of relevant statistics he had memorized to come up with the most accurate estimate possible.

** Nice riff on Eliezer's [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/go/why_truth_and/]["tragic fool" quote]], but technically, that fic is the opposite of correct. As Shalizi [[http://bactra.org/weblog/612.html][noted long ago]], an actual Bayesian would give you as many significant digits as you have time for.
