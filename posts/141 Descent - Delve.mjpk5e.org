** Delve keeps getting removed because people are (charitably) reporting it as off-topic in a good faith effort to keep the sub on-topic or (uncharitably) using the report button as a super-downvote. I'd like to keep our reporting threshold where it's at, since it /does/ help get rid of obvious spam and trolls if mods aren't continually camping the subreddit, but that means that Delve is a problem.

I don't read Delve, never have, and don't intend to. The story gets posted pretty much every single time, there's rarely much good discussion on it, the upvote ratio is quite bad, and there are frequent chapters which means that it takes up a fair amount of the subreddit's front page. IMO, all the problems are further exacerbated by the Patreon gating.

With that in mind, I think we need to make some kind of determination of whether or not it actually belongs here, because it's a source of some animosity between users. Again, I don't read Delve, and it doesn't seem like my cup of tea. I'm generally against things getting posted and discussed here if they are only kind of adjacent and disliked by a solid contingent of people. On the other side of the coin, it's typically not been the moderation policy to remove things strictly on the basis that there's some argument about whether or not they belong, since that would mean mods have to read everything posted to the subreddit, and those judgements are ultimately subjective anyway.

Take this opportunity to argue the issue, with as much civility as you can, and after discussion among the mods, we'll either ban it entirely or keep it for the foreseeable future. (Personally, as someone who occasionally dips into the comments, I'm in favor of it going, since the comments are mostly low-effort and/or complaints about the story.)

*** I have yet to see a good faith argument for why Delve isn't rational and I have been reading every chapter thread here since Delve began. I do think the quality of the story has declined quite a lot lately and I pointed out several of its failings on the last chapter's thread. That said, none of those failings have anything to do with not being a rational story which, as far as I know, is the only criteria for determining whether something belongs in this sub or not. As I also pointed out on the previous thread, more than a year ago no one was complaining that Delve wasn't rational and none of those characteristics changed. What changed was that a lot of people who liked it before, hate it now and instead of just dropping it or even doing some constructive criticism, they just want to wipe it off the face of the subreddit.

You can't predict anything specific that will happen before it does. The advancement of plot, and the discoveries the MC makes about the system are all by author fiat: there's no way to reason them out beforehand. The fact that the world has math rules and is self-consistent does not make it rational.

Or the way that Rain's slime magically managed to get into his soul when it died? Or how meditation allows building of mystical 'bastions' in your soulspace? Or that connecting to the forebearer artifact would allow Rain to program a terminal system for his abilities? Or literally any other development of the system that wasn't simply stated outright?

******* The thing with training with accolades wasn't the solution to a problem, so I don't see a problem with it being introduced. A bit arbitrary sure, but accolades hadn't been explored in depth yet so I feel like the author has some leeway there.

The slime entering his soul didn't surprise me at all; we already knew they were connected through Rain's soul, and that his soul had a hole in it. I found it ridiculous, but a fair development all the same.

The soul meditation thing is all mystical mumbo jumbo, I'll agree, but then again, there hasn't been any concrete benefits from it either. If he does get something from it, I expect it will be the same Reading ability we already know the Watch has, as well as being able to disguise his “emissions” from others like we saw one goldplate from the Watch doing.

Lastly, connecting to the artifact didn't “allow” him to program his terminal, it just gave him plenty of subjective time with which to do it, something he had already theorized was possible, but never had a lot of free time to try. And yes, I did think something like that might happen since he managed to force his IFF skill to work with blacklists, whitelists and to selectively distribute different aura intensities to different people (that's basically a program in itself).

It's pretty hard to lampshade stuff the MC has to invent, as you can't show other people having those things.

*** I think we should keep it around. I personally don't read it anymore, but I've enjoyed some of the discussions in here. I also think that, currently, this is a slow subreddit, and Delve isn't exactly blasting tons of great discussions off the front page.

In general, I think if there's a legitimate disagreement about including or disincluding something, communities should err on the side of inclusion. This is partly because getting rid of something that other people want tends to hurt those people more than it helps the people who don't like it. It's also because there's a bias toward more rules and restriction in general, partly because restricted things and people become invisible and at that point can't advocate for themselves. I think it also aligns with a general principle of tolerance, and understanding that, though something might not be for you, it might be for someone else.

I think this community and this sub might grow larger over time, and then these questions can be reevaluated in the light of different dynamics. But, for now, and though I would not be particularly disappointed if these threads ceased, I vote for keeping them around.

*** I'm still reading Delve. Is delve strictly rational? Does it raise to the standards of Mother of Learning, HPMOR, Worth the Candle and the other "best" works on this subreddit? Not really on both counts. I agree with several others here that the fiction suffers from impressively poor pacing. In addition, it started with a strong theme of "numbers go up" and "world discovery" in the first few tens of chapters, until the author realized that he couldn't keep those patterns up and had to pivot, which clearly irritated many readers.

Delve kind of lives in this limbo where its LitRPG status gives it a bad rap, but the formulaic nature and self-consistency make it more rational than almost any other story of its genre. I think that the story is still "rational" in the sense that the main character is making reasonable efforts to optimize his power and growth - that rationality simply does not extend to his broader spectrum behavior.

That said, I agree with other commenters in this thread that the debate and readership brought by Delve is good for this community. If we had 3x as many WtC/AtR/MoL/etc level stories floating around, I'd be jumping on the bandwagon to get it outta here - but that's not the world we're in right now. The story only pops up once per week, and as of this edit, it shows up as about 1/23 of posts which makes it something like 4% - not a dominating factor in the subreddit, especially when compared to its readership.

I support allowing Delve to remain on the subreddit, but potentially revisiting the topic in 4-6 months.

I do think that a lot of the negativity doesn't come from a mental space is not 'i don't like this anymore' is more kin to 'falling out of love with a story'. It has happened to me and is nasty, surprisingly so. There was this novel that I loved that went from excellent and fast pacing to even more glacial than delve, it became mostly self serving story going nowhere and milking the patron money.

By far the main complaint has always been that the main character's level isn't going up, which is a feature of the system, and this was explained repeatedly while the main character hadn't reached his cap yet.

If you're getting a bunch of complaints that this story is too much team-building and rules-discovery and not enough cookie-clicker, then the story is not the problem, but that we somehow picked up a bunch of people who aren't actually interested in rational fiction.

*** Personally I like the negative commentary, what is the point of discussion if there are no opposing views? Not sure why you see that as a negative.

To add to that, I think the fact that there are so many negative comments is actually evidence for it belonging to this sub more than not; Why would someone bother writing a negative comment here in the first place? I'd say someone who would bother going that far to share their displeasure must have already invested a lot in the story for their disappointment to actually matter to them enough to act on it (as opposed to just not reading the story). Each of these reports, negative comments etc are all people who at some point LIKED Delve or hoped the story would turn into something they liked, and were turned off as it progressed for whatever reason.

^I don't think a story should become off-topic because the latter parts don't fulfill the promise given at the start, or (the main criticism) that the progress is just glacial. This would only affect "live" readers and should not IMO affect how it is aligned with the topic of the sub.

​

For my more subjective opinion, I think [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Nick_named_Nick/][Nick_named_Nick]] hit the nail on the head with his comment:

#+begin_quote
  I think people who don't like the pace of the story mix that dislike into a big ol blender and when they pour it out on Sunday morning's they get “this isn't rational” instead of “I don't like the story anymore because nothing has happened since February 2020.”
#+end_quote

The criticism is valid and completely irrelevant to how on-topic it is.

#+begin_quote

Is unfortunately what I personally believe is happening in this case, and it would be a horrible direction this community is taking if the bullies are given a win. Especially in light of the recent conversations about the problems with gatekeeping and the general public's negative view of rational fiction, which this drama is just proving them correct.

*** I downvoted this week's Delve and hid it, as I have been tending to do lately.

As a consequence, I only stumbled across your comment here by accident, and am getting to the discussion after much of it has already been had. I feel like I'm probably not alone in this amongst the people not in favor of Delve here. I don't know what can be done about that though.

I will say that it seems there are a large amount of commenters here, some of whom I've had discussions with, who have expressed that Delve is the only story they're following on [[/r/rational]] and/or the reason they found [[/r/rational]]. A few weeks ago somebody made the (presumably false) claim that Delve had "likely brought more people to this subreddit than anything not on the podium (HPMOR, etc)". This worries me - you're probably more aware than I am of the subreddit stats - it looks like subredditstats claims that subscribers have approximately doubled since 2019-ish but let me know if that's misleading. I think that Delve is a powerful representative of the kind of value-drift we probably want to avoid, and I think with such recent growth that value-drift is something which could become a problem.

Right now, obviously, we have the amazing WtC, and also Pokemon: The Origin of Species, Animorphs: The Reckoning, and Need To Become Stronger as long-running and not-yet-complete flagships, and the unexpectedly good Pith as a newcomer. We have other less frequent ongoing stories like The Optimized Wish Project, the younger Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, and Avatar: The Last Rationalist. And we have some sporadically excellent one-offs. For anybody here to feel that Delve is representative of [[/r/rational]], is the only reason that they're posting here, or that they perceive it "gets the most discussion" raises some alarms. It makes me think of [[/r/gamedesign]], which once had a powerful draw but I abandoned 2 years ago when its mod(s) refused to strictly enforce the sub's rules and it became inundated with unity tutorials, questions about blatant game dev, game critiques, and various other clutter that made it unreasonable to expect for new users to understand what wasn't on-topic [looking there now, it may have improved 10 months ago with a new mod direction? I hope so.] I'm sure there are other salient examples of subreddits that have lost their ways when their userbase has grown too large and prior mod policies weren't adapted, and maybe we're not there now and won't be for some time. But I worry, anyway, that the ecosystem that has produced so many authors producing the amazing stuff that we have here might get lost.

The arguments for why this story isn't rational can often be rightfully applied to other more popular stories on this sub that most people would consider rational.

Take the recent Hagar fight: in a standard LitRPG, the result of this would be either that Rain uses some absurd exploit to win the encounter solo, or that he fails and pivots into a training arc angling for a rematch. Neither happens: Rain attempts to use an exploit, but is worried that the obvious downsides of his combo will bite him in the ass. This is followed by the obvious downsides biting him in the ass and him having to get saved by his higher level teammates, who are consequently more more willing to pressure Rain to take what they deem to be 'necessary steps' to prevent a repeat of this incident.

  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

You can quibble on 'intelligent' given that the MC has a very naive worldview and doesn't seem to grasp the enormity of the danger he is in. But in terms of creative use of resources, he has done pretty well for himself; coming up with novel-in-universe builds, correctly identifying a major systemic issue in society and trying to create an organization which will correct for that problem.

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

If anything, the problem is that Rain navel gazing about his own motivations is a major driver of the awful pacing issues that get people up in arms about this story. You might argue that too much waffling about the character's decision-making process is a failed execution of this feature, but I don't buy it - it just means that the failure is a failure to be a good story, not to fit into the rational fiction genre.

  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Very much the case here, especially if you are willing to consider Rain's struggle with soulstrain as a direct analogy for the cognitive distortions brought on by a chronic illness; Rain puts a great deal of his effort into routing around these issues and finding ways to better himself which do not aggravate his condition.

#+begin_quote
  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
#+end_quote

The background characters are more more rational than the on-screen characters, generally speaking; the worldbuilding does a decent job of extrapolating various models of running a society based on the existence of the personal power differentials brought about by the level system and how these social responses would subsequently evolve over time due to interaction with one another and lost purposes. (Looking at you, Adventurer's Guild). It doesn't talk about it in those /terms/, but if you're aware of the concept you can see them clear as day working in the background.

Overall, I think that Delve is not a great story, but also not a terrible story. It has several faults, but those faults are generally not the sorts of faults that disqualify a story from being rational fiction, and have a great deal more to do with the bad pacing and the inconsistent quality of the character writing.

**** You listing it out like this actually highlights something to me. I think that Delve might be written explicitly off of that list, with the author trying to hit every checkbox on the lineup of what is seen to make a rational story, without consideration for if that makes a compelling story. The way the narrative occasionally takes massive diversions into math, especially, feels like an attempt to prove to the audience that the world is internally consistent, without showing it. It's a cheat code for the kind of worldbuilding that a good fantasy story does early and often - establishing the rules, then sticking to them, then giving you a twist - but without the twist. Because math doesn't do that.

*** Ultimately I think the reason why Delve gets a lot of hate is pretty simple, it has bad pacing, really bad slow pacing.

Still it fits what you'd expect from a rational story, the world is consistent, the stats and numbers actually mean something, unlike most litrpgs where it's just padding to give a sense of progression, that's why it has a whole [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_C99jHLyw_ARFfKNPvmGAxUCrKbNWOXE0kTVIUDYH9g][calculator / character sheet]] to evaluate the MC abilities present and future.

Beyond that the actions of the characters make sense in relation to their internal motivations, lots of people whine about Rain being too soft, but you only get that impression because in universe time he hasn't been in there for that long and changing takes time and new experiences, again this is an issue with pacing, not the character.

Ultimately I get why some people are mad, but they take that one aspect and try to pretend everything about the story is bad just cause of that one aspect.

*** I personally think we should keep it around. I personally don't read it anymore, but I've enjoyed some of the discussions in here. I also think that, currently, this is a slow subreddit, and Delve isn't exactly blasting tons of great discussions off the front page.

In general, I think if there's a legitimate disagreement about including or disincluding something, communities should err on the side of inclusion. This is partly because getting rid of something that other people want tends to hurt those people more than it helps the people who don't like it. It's also because there's a bias toward more rules and restriction in general, partly because restricted things and people become invisible and at that point can't advocate for themselves. I think it also aligns with a general principle of tolerance, and understanding that, though something might not be for you, it might be for someone else.

I think this community and this sub might grow larger over time, and then these questions can be reevaluated in the light of different dynamics. But, for now, and though I would not be particularly disappointed if these threads ceased, I vote for keeping them around.

Heavily moderated subreddits have their use, because anything which isn't tends to evolve into a lowest-common-denominator scenario. This is typically the crux of the matter for me.

The issue is that there just isn't enough convincingly rational fiction to go around. If this subreddit held itself to lofty standards, it would probably just slowly die. I don't think we need to grow the subreddit, but as small and unloved a niche as this already is, I'd rather not chase away a story that at least a good number of people here are enjoying.

*** I agree with the other posters who suggest the criticism Delve gets is less because it is not rational and more because it is slow.

My opinion is that its slow pacing is an intentional, daring choice, and that in context it makes the story more rational. At its core, Delve is an uplift story. The protagonist is transported to a world locked into repressive, authoritarian social and political structures. As in our world, the powerful tend to grow in power with time and the powerless remain powerless. But this tendency is supercharged by the RPG elements of the world. Accolades and access to leveling support allow hereditary transfer of power on a level impossible in real life. The privileged class are not just wealthier, better educated and politically and socially advantaged. They have superpowers.

The protagonist feels this is morally wrong and should be changed. He starts from a position of moderate privilege (awakened with a decent level cap), but very little personal power. The plot is him trying to increase his power enough to lift at least his part of the world to a more just, egalitarian state.

This is an extremely ambitious goal both for the protagonist and the author, because any realistic attempt at achieving such a monumental task from that starting point is going to take a huge amount of time. Delve takes that time. It shows where the side characters start, and it shows them gradually change under the positive influence of the protagonist. The progression and payoff is less "numbers go brr", and instead "the powerful, reclusive, misanthropic, non-human smith apologized to a human he mistreated and took the time to fashion them a prosthetic leg." Then that human, a retired adventurer, took his new leg and joined a less experienced combat team in hunting down a monster that was causing problems to the community. This helped to secure the camp enough that the two most powerful members of Ascension could could leave to take the protagonist on a delve to increase his level without excessive worry for the safety of everyone else. All of this moved really, really slowly. But every bit of it was the rational consequence of the actions of the main character.

In most LitRPGs, the protagonists solve problems primarily through the increase and exercise of personal power. In Delve, problems (including those caused by the character weaknesses of the protagonist) are solved by people working together as a community, with characters helping according to their personal capabilities and motivations. Ameliah is overconfident and impulsive. She picks a bad fight. Rain is inexperienced in violent situations and places too much trust in his girlfriend. They get their butts kicked. Tallheart ex machina saves them from the negative consequences of a bad choice. Is that irrational? On the whole, I don't think it is. Each character (including the antagonists of the arc) is acting in accord with their previously established nature, motives, and abilities. Each changes and grows from the experience.

I believe the focus on soft power as payoff and progression is admirably rational, and close to unique in the genre (at least among stories I've read). In the real world, political and societal change takes a huge amount of time and effort. A LitRPG with a main character who is essentially a community organizer has the potential to say worthwhile things about rational decision making that are arguably deeper and more meaningful than those focused on an RPG munchkin looking for exploits in the game rules.

Does Delve actually say those things? That's subjective. I'm not sure it does. But it does at least try. I think that deserves a place in this subreddit.

*** Seems like discussion is very much in favour of keeping the threads around, but I'd still like to add my support.

I can understand the need to be harsh on what's allowed in big subreddits; otherwise you'll get a proliferation of karma farming and lowest common denominator taking over. But rational is not a big subreddit, and it gets only a handful of new topics every week. As others have pointed out, Delve is one of the few stories to get consistent upvotes and discussion, even if there are some downvotes and plenty of negativity within the threads. A small community like this should be capable of self-policing. If it had negative votes and hardly any discussion, then it would be a much better candidate to be exiled. The fact that it doesn't indicates it is still worthwhile.

That being said, I feel like some of the rancor around Delve could be managed with a slight adjustment. The suggestion to switch to once monthly Delve threads could work well to stop the feeling that it is clogging up the subreddit, and each week's chapter is quite small so wouldn't negatively harm discussion. Alternately, a brief hiatus could be effective - say til 150 - allowing some of the negativity to subside and the story to return to its most popular aspect of leveling.

We don't post A Practical Guide To Evil here so much anymore, largely because it was contentious whether it was rational or not. Besides, it made sense to focus on its own subreddit.

Pact, Twig, Ward, and now Pale are not posted here - it was argued that they were not rational, and even once a week posting wasn't necessary. Besides, discussion makes more sense in its own subreddit.

And there are various others. For instance, I count about 5 litrpg's which are popular with readers here, which do not get weekly posts here.

Those making arguments that there are so few things posted here that Delve /isn't/ crowding things out when it occupies 4% of posts are missing that that is partly because the other, much more popular but not-quite-rationalist works /intentionally are not getting posted here out of respect for this sub/ and its desire to maintain diversity and focus and have found themselves other spaces for discussion.

LightWaivers used to post pony stuff here and that was contentious, and similar arguments about volume versus sub-focus occurred. Breaking_The_Candle sometimes does, and posts other things too, but limits theirself to about 2 recommendations at a time, and while I downvote those, they are at no risk of changing what it looks like this sub is.

Most of the questions or details in the story are like this. The plot and MC's advancement are almost exclusively by author fiat.

I haven't read any of those. Mainly because they didn't seem that rational and I wasn't taken with the premise.

They aren't posted weekly, though. It's a lot more reasonable for an occasional posting that is more fringe.

****** Really? What are these other's that are of similar quality to Delve?

I can think of 3 recent-ish additions. One of which involves an office dungeon, one a spellbook, and one some new heros. I tried taking a look at the first two to assess Delve, and - the eveness of their writing may be less than Delve's, though the first of them is perhaps only because it is more ambitious. But if you look back a year, two years, three years - Delve does not fit in. Delve is a divergence from what this sub is, and many (though not all) in this sub have rejected it. Why does Delve need to be here and not elsewhere? Because there are maybe some pandemic-era stories that have started up that aren't as good as The Good Student (which, I think, stopped getting posted here amidst /significantly/ less contention about fit than Delve has inspired) or Pyrebound or Delphic or Aeromancer or The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere, all of which never really blew up here but offer a much, /much/ better representation of what [[/r/rational]] is (note: The Flower and Pyrebound are on-going, Delphic is ... on hiatus?, Aeromancer was abandoned a few years ago - so just going from what I can think of off the top of my head, this offers a pretty good swath of time extending into the current month). And all of that is without getting into all the other stories that are active RIGHT NOW, so many of which are getting ignored:

This story in particular does not have any puzzles to solve or examinations of motives that are more than a chapter or two long.

Just because something technically barely meets a criteria for what is rational doesn't mean it has rational merit.

This chapter introduced a problem never before mentioned or even hinted at, had an author provided ready made solution via an arbitrary math equation, and the main characters acted like an issue everyone had wondered about has just been solved.

**** For what it's worth, I read this chapter just to see if it was as bad as everyone says it is. Spoiler alert; it's really not. The most grating thing is the lack of leveling or anything to do with the system. I think the author really should've warned folk in advance that leveling was gonna be taking a backseat in this story in the later chapters. I mean....why would you make a LitRPG and not have leveling be the main focus?/ But other than that, the other complaints (cheesy memes, unrealistic decisions, etc) are no worse than other fics I've seen recommended here. If you don't care about the leveling, then IMO you don't even need to stop reading.

If you're looking for stories that can balance leveling with good plot development, I would recommend Salvos and Threadbare. Particularly the latter, as Andrew Seiple (author) has a lot of sequels. I would read those quickly, as he plans to publish them and possibly remove them from his site in the future.

** I tried doing some pre-production work on a Delve parody, thinking it would be as easy to do as it is with Worth The Candle. Very, very quickly... within three paragraphs... I realized this was not the case. I can't make it work. It's impossible (for me) to make something interesting and/or funny with the source material.

There are various reasons for this that weren't obvious until I actively bumped into them:

*The Skill System is Bad*

"Bad" defined as "for facilitating storytelling" and "for making an interesting game system".

It's somewhat similar to Diablo 2's system, except every single skill point yields a new skill. The main character's aura trees are designed to obfuscate this - almost everything is a utility skill. Even his attack auras, Heating Unit+Air Conditioner, double as utility skills.

But the illusion shatters once you consider what the optimal combatant skill sets look like - a fire magician would have around 10 active skills and 40 passive skills at level 50. It's not very interesting whether one kills monsters with fire, lasers, or an axe. Certainly not the multi-chapters worth of attention Rain does considering his multipliers.

Another arguable issue with it, is only a few types of skills interact with the greater world. You don't have to study or go on an adventure to learn a spell, you just pick it up off a menu. The most important type of reward characters can get in this world, and they have all the weight and drama of going to wal-mart and buying a burrito for a buck o'five.

You see some of the consequences for this in the official novel - you'll never have a hard list of all the skills in the skill trees (though it should exist and should be finite), you'll never have an in-depth character sheet of a high level side character's skill list. Which I think is kind of a shame - the guy who does /I Hate Being Wed In A Fantasy World/ has these absurdly huge character sheets of all the main characters. They're a mess, but they're a beautiful mess and I love them.

Additionally the skill bloat makes the individual importance of any single skill much less. Again, obfuscated (so far) by Auras having massive weaknesses, thus making it easy to make various "crucial" passive skills. But that can only work until they begin to scale into being good skills, after that point it's putting sprinkles on top of yogurt. This is why it's been so important to keep Rain from gaining levels - to give the skills he has a time to shine and matter, and to give the author time to figure out how he's going to make a complete ~50 skill long build where every skill matters.

The MC's leveling cheat letting him hit any level cap immediately is also an issue. If he lifted his level cap by ~20 levels, he'd double his skill list within a few chapters (by Delve's reckoning) and become a completely different character where it concerns his powers.

*The Core Characters Don't Have Unique Goals*

Rain's core drive in life is to make as many friends as possible. A boring version of Michael Scott. In my own opinion, the worst aspect of the character isn't his drab bog standard liberalism (though it makes it impossible for *me* to write the guy. 'He passes out after two sips of a long island ice tea' and 'he wears ninja turtle pajamas for the whole story' were not a good start to my efforts).... it's that /the guy isn't horny enough/.

I'm not saying he has to be thinking about boobs constantly, just that he'd be a little more human if he had a pulse. The guy is chaste to a cartoonish degree, and I'm not just complaining that he wouldn't hold the horny stance samurai girl's hand or explore if he was deer-sexual when he lived with a deer for months on end - it's about any kind of /desire/.

He has two of them. Make friends, and maximize the power of his aura skills through math. The text says he wants to snuggle with Ameliah, but I don't buy it.

The two other main characters, Lonely Girl and Lonely Deer, are basically the same person as Rain. This makes the core cast... not optimal for doing zany or new things. Make them sit around a campfire and eat potato soup together, and they're 100% happy with the universe.

They could really use a pernicious god giving them quests by edicts from on high, or something.

*In Conclusion, It's A Rather Rigid World*

About any idea I could come up with would be 10,000 times better with a custom setting, instead of being fanfiction. Rain goes into the sewers to kill slimes, screws up, and somehow causes the monsters in there to become The Blob, which wipes out the town? Maybe viable for around 12 pages. Change the idea to an MC who wants to feed everyone and everything to his "slime girlfriend" (the slime isn't a monster girl, it's just a slime. The MC is just a sicko.)? That's an obvious ~200 page horror story right there.

Rain without auras and trying to stretch them out for as many manhattans as he can isn't Rain. Changing anything important and keeping it still be recognizable as Delve is really, really hard.

If you want to write something like Delve, you're much better off making your own dungeon diving and/or tribe-building story.

Though I would expect that only a tiny, tiny number of people have the opportunity to map out an optimal skill set. Nobody's sharing information, and the ability to view the skills on offer for various trees is locked behind an EXP gate that nobody outside of Rain's Dynamo build can afford to open.

Most, I expect, would just take whatever skills are in the next tier of the tree they've already unlocked, active passive or otherwise. So the average level 50 fire mage (in as much as there can be said to be one when most people top out before 20) probably has every variation of 'shoot fire at enemy' skill topped out even if they're largely redundant with one another.

** It's probably fortunate for Val that he's never been able to beat Rain's detection. He'd inevitably have tried tagging along invisibly behind the group to tag the blue, and ended up getting ganked.

*** Val's invisibility is sadly no where near his father's level. It only works on eye sight, nothing else. Mana detects him. Divination detects him. Sound detection works. Smell probably works. I'm personally curious if he's detectable with heat.

** I feel like Delve would benefit from a thread once a month to discuss recent developments; it doesn't really progress far enough in a week and that leads to issues. Then again, the patreon gating is another problem which effectively divides the readers in two, and worse, means many of the readers apt to defend Delve instead of attack it are kind of segregated off from the main discussion by weight of foreknowledge.

In some ways, I've enjoyed the Delve threads because it undeniably dances on the line of what this sub considers acceptable, and seeing meta-fights about its acceptability and its rising and falling fortunes of this each week is an amusing minigame. It's kept fresh by Delve's neurotic tendency to jump between perspective and the extremely inconsistent quality this tends to produce week to week, but I can understand how patience with it is running thin.

As a third point, I used to like discussing Delve on its own Discord, but then that got phone-ID gated and I ditched it. So there might be something of a low-effort-commenter refugee community from that alone.

** I've kind of drifted away from Delve, which I'm guessing puts me in the same category as others in this subreddit whom I'm guessing also don't read it, and want to see these posts removed. I don't know, maybe there are some that are hate-reading, then hate-posting?

Anyway, with much respect to [[/u/alexanderwales]], and the tough and often thankless job of moderating that you do, I think that at least some of the reasoning at play behind the consideration to remove Delve posts needs to be examined.

"High" frequency of chapters is overstated. Judging by the topics, Delve continues to update once each week. Other works are not being rapidly buried under new Delve topics. Arguments to remove this story are from a purity of forum perspective - not from usability. Rationality is something subjective, and I certainly had the impression there was a degree of it present in the story concept.

The upvote ratio is a net positive, which I take as evidence that there is considerable interest in the story on this forum, this despite a significant minority of forum-readers that downvote the updates. It seems entirely reasonable to me that those who dislike the story can skip by it, and otherwise continue to use the subreddit unimpeded, just as I do these days. Well, mostly.

Months past, when I was regularly reading the story and posting to the threads, I found it very difficult to enjoyably discuss the work due to the avalanche of negativity present in the discussion threads. Note that the main thread itself tends to have a positive score in the double digits. If those who still enjoy the story are not commenting due to a perception of hostility - as I was - you end up with a handful of low effort threads mixed in with complaints.

I'd ask that those who dislike Delve have some consideration for those who do. There are plenty of other things to chat about, explore, enjoy, and share in this subreddit. If Delve comes up as a recommendation, of course de-recommend it as appropriate. But */please/* - let others who want to discuss the story - especially rational aspects of it - have their space here, too.

The algorithm is not, I think, entirely honest. For instance, isn't there some kind of vote decay in play? At any rate, Delve's ratio's are abysmal. It is hard to get anything significantly lower (e.g., to 40%) with basically anyone upvoting it.

Why not let these people make their own subreddit or post it to the litrpg sub instead? Why do we have to stomach an off-topic weekly discussion, and one bringing in outside users here just for that, when historically we haven't handled things that way?

This looks likely to be biased given your clear disdain for the subject. Does anyone have evidence that upvotes are being given more weight?

How is it that skipping over posts such as Delve - which I've done myself for a few months now - seems like such a chore? Relevance is in the eye of the beholder, and it looks like quite a few people like to see it here enough to upvote it. The "outside users" comment also concerns me. Everyone in this subreddit had to start somewhere, with some piece of fiction that interested them, after all.

Are you serious? Name any other Isekai RPG which is not mentioned or recommended on this sub which goes into deep detail about how the system works, the MC uses actual IRL math when interacting with his/her system and all the points [[https://www.reddit.com/user/AccomplishedAd253/][AccomplishedAd253]] made.

Sure, it may not be the best quality, but it absolutely is more in line with rational and rationalist fiction than 95% of other isekai's. And IMO as I mentioned in last weeks post, it is more on-topic than half of the other stories posted here.
