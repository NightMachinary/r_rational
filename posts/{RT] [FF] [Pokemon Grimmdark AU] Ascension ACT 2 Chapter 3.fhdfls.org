** I've read through the entire story now. Sweatdrops aside, here are some of my thoughts. Just going to preface this by saying that these are the things i DON'T like. I love everything else, but these specific points grates me just a bit too much.

The main focal point here is: This story is not grimdark. I keep waiting for the actual grimdark, but its just not there. What I see is a dark story taking place in an otherwise normal world. Its more realistic than grim, and dark only when its dictated by the story. If this story is going to be grimdark, it needs more grim. It needs the overhanging hopelessness, and a lot of the safety nets needs to be removed.

Baseline grimdark for Pokemon is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul][The Sun Soul]]. That story shows a proper grimdark world, where everything is well, proper grim and dark. Events, world, institutions and whatnot. Really give it a read if you guys have not already.

The other point is more of an annoyance, but it keeps showing up too often: There are too many references jumbled in, and it breaks immersion. Be it pop culture, references to other stories, songs, catchphrases and whatever. I cant pick out any specifics from the top of my head, but theres been one too many times where I went "Wait what? Why is that in here?"

If you compare it to the references you find in [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The waves arisen]]. You got references to Wu Tang Clan, an actual Panasonic TV and Monty Python thrown in there, some snide cameo remarks about other fanfictions, and even a bizzare outkast reference. All these references work because its something that could happen in that universe. You cant kill the Wu Tang Clan, so of course they survived and became an actual ninja clan. Or in good old HPMOR. The "Spoons +3" they come across in Diagon Alley. This is definitely something that could exist there.

The references peppered in Ascension is not something that could have happened in this universe, so it makes no sense that they would be there. They need to be more in-universe or self referential, if that makes sense. They need to have a reason for existing in the first place.

Other than the stuff I mentioned above, this is all solid work. I can definitely see the work that has been put into the unseen world building and the characters. It would not surprise me if you guys had prewritten character sheets and studies, and some minor historic lore of the world itself.

Im going to keep reading this to whatever conclusion it comes to, and with time I can see this catching up to both Origin of Species and The game of Champions in terms of quality. So keep at it, you can go far with this fic.

*** The grimmdark/horror tags were meant to warn the readers of dark themes. For example, the events in ch 14, and in the new act have several horror elements, and readers were glad to be warned. If you think there is a better/more suitable tag to express this feel free to suggest it In other words, what tag would you use for - Dark story in a realistic world. We do want to give some warning as a courtesy for readers, so they may avoid what they do not want to read.

We had a few references in the early chapters, but I don't remember adding ANY cross chapter 6. It would be helpful if you gave some examples, as well as how they were confusing. We will then re-edit those chapters. We don't want to break reader immersion either. (That being said, have you felt that in recent chapters, or just in the initial few?). Further, most reference's we did use felt (at least from an authors POV) that they could legitimately exist in-universe. When we go over the chapters for another edit, we will look at them again and remove ones that are not.

We are glad you enjoyed the story! Thank you for the review.

-----------------

I couldn't get into Sun Soul, but for different reasons.

I kind of felt like sun souls was more about the people and less about the pokemon. Like you could take out pokemon from the story and put in some other threat and it would make no difference.

And it also fell into the category of overly coincidential horror, which kind of hurt it for me. For example, Pallet town was fine for Ash's entire life, (over fifteen years) and the day he steps, out a gyarados destroys it. Like it was done to quickly establish a motive for him to get stronger, but I don't know... I guess when you take it to the extreme that everyone dies so commonly, death itself becomes a low-stake variable which makes it low-impact when it happens.

I enjoyed Game of Champions a lot. I couldn't really get into Origin of Species either, but that has nothing to do with the story and entirely to do with the fact that the author chose to write it in present tense. Somehow, my brain really hurts trying to read it in that format.

** Just finished the first chapter, and I'm liking this story so far! I agree with DvDCover that it doesn't seem to be very grim in setting so much as bad things tend to happen to Red constantly. Nothing wrong with that, just seems like a mishandling of expectations in your pitch.

There are some head scratchers in terms of the setting though. For one, Red is established to be second in his class, only barely behind blue (Gary, damn that's gonna be weird to fix mentally) for his trainer exams, yet he doesn't know about a lot of things that I would have thought to be common knowledge in the world--such as riolu evolving into lucario or what the ability snow cloak does (especially since he wants to be a champion and is an admitted smarmy egghead).

That twist with the starters was nuts! Red's trajectory in your story seemed to be mirroring the Red from OoS, so I figured we were in for something similar, but then /that/ happened. Still, I approve of his started choice, even if it's unorthodox. (It'll be even better if the *power of friendship* power ups make it into your canon somehow).

One last thing, it's pretty obvious you're going to be bucking established rules a little considering you gave a mawile the ability snow cloak, so is it safe to assume that game mechanics won't be a one-to-one transition to this poke-verse? (ie. hyper cutter functioning like huge power, ralts and mankey sharing a breeding group, etc.) If that's the case I'd like to know what kind of rules or guidelines you're using to make changes to things, just so that i'm not left wondering if that was supposed to be a typo or not.

Okay, the actual last thing. This Red is such a 14 year old trash talker that Ive mentally noted down as Asshat Red and I love him for it; he's smart, but also not a computer and that makes me want to see him run the gauntlet just to see how he makes it out the other end of all this.

*** Yes. Most mechanics are completely reworked in the AU. A lot of the moves and the way things function have also be reworked to account for the differences in power levels, physique, and common sense.

**** I just caught up to the most recent chapters, and you have me eagerly waiting for the next chapters! Most of the viridian forest adventure was fantastic, and I love the chemistry of the main crew. The evolution of magic in the story is also very cool and intuitive, and I am looking forward to see how it continues to develop with the hints toward greater power from beyond and whatnot. (Does it have to do with the unown? My bet is it has to do with the unown.)

It quickly became apparent that this story is much closer to the anime-verse with a good splattering of the manga-verse thrown in; it made for an interesting mix in tone. On the one hand you have a world where pretty much all of the creatures are sentient (not just the psychic ones), and on the other you have a society that is hugely tailored to keeping these creatures tamed and trained by humans for the safety of humanity. It feels like there's tones of strict hierarchy underlying the structure of this world that everyone just accepts (other than red, which seems to make it intentional). I hope this gets explored more deeply because it feels like a really interesting case study into classism and xenophobia, especially since in this world it seems that there are legitimate justifications considering how much power pokemon have over humans.

Ritchie's story is pretty great, and it definitely feels a lot more grim/dark on his end than on Red's. I think it highlights the biggest clash of the two types of tone you set up in the setting; on the one hand, you have an aspiring young trainer and his loving crew of friends trying to do their best and become pokemon masters, and on the other you have a world that operates in a believably real way and will not bend backwards to cater to good intentions. One could even say that it is a clash of Truth versus Ideals, hey? ;) (that gen 5 hidden deep lore) I'm looking forward to see what will happen if Red and Ritchie ever cross paths again considering how their lives changed the first time they met.

Can we talk about Ash(ley) (I facepalmed when i figured it out) for a minute? Is she a typical trainer in this setting? Up to the point where we are introduced to her the only other trainers we see battle use similar rules of engagement. What I mean is that they send out a pokemon and tell the pokemon exactly what move to use and when to use it but not much else; the trainers direct the battle strategy by dictating move choice, but leave the execution up to the pokemon. From the way Ashley behaves, this is the sort of battling she is used to and she is said to be a very experienced trainer. When Red throws this trainer-pokemon dynamic away, Ashley basically short circuits as though she has never come across a battler that DOESNT dictate pokemon battles move-by-move. And it's not even that Red is unique in this, or even one of the first, since you have Professor Oak touch on the subject and later Travers doing basically what Red did with his bug types. So it makes me wonder if it's just the upper echelons of trainers that figure out how to coordinate battle strategies with more custom commands, or if its just gym circuit trainers that are parroting this behavior. (One more thing about Ashley, she came across as a smug jackass and I want to see her suffer. Will she ever come back into the story and interact with Red again? I'd like to see a rematch between the two to see how their respective training has progressed comparatively.

Can pokemon learn to read/write? They obviously can listen, and psychics can talk (telepathically), so it seems like it should be--if not simple then at least possible--to teach even a small number of pokemon what letters mean and how to make them. Heck unown are pokemon that are letters so at least they might have some form of literacy innately. This opens a big ol can of worms in the pokemon-as-second-class-citizens thing going on here, but it also would solve the asymmetrical information transmission problem that a lot of the pokemon-trainer relationship seems to take for granted. True, it would break one of the axioms of the anime: that humans and pokemon cant speak directly, but it just keeps bugging me that SOMEBODY would have at least tried it in universe.

You mentioned that civilization has written history only up to 600 years back, and before then humans were basically cave dwellers. This time scale seems a bit too condensed to go from proto-bronze age tech to future tech with space folding in the span that it took our world to go from the printing press to digital storage and wireless transmission. What were the factors that caused such a huge leap in technology in the setting? Is it that psychic pokemon helped improve tech by leaps and bounds with their super brains? Did legendaries help at all? Are there government cover ups of the super old writings because civilization back then was actually involved in some giant cataclysm with pokemon like groudon and kyogre and many of the evidence of these events are being hidden from the public to avoid hysteria that there are beings that could end the world at a moment's notice?

There are several times where the point of view character changes mid scene and it can be confusing as to who is the new narrator. I think the most prominent of these was somewhere in viridian forest where it switches between several human and pokemon all in quick succession. You've been using the dash break as a formatting tool to show scene changes and time skips, maybe it would be a good idea to look into another formatting tool or symbol or something to show narrator shifts as well.

A couple of closing thoughts:

Are you planning on going back and fixing the typos in already written chapters? There tend to be a few throughout many chapters, and I'd be willing to make a list of what I catch if I ever reread the chapters.

You mention sweat dropping several times through the story, what did you mean by it? (ex. Red sweat dropped when ...)

How's Gary doing? We recently got an update on Leaf's and Ethan's badge count but not a word on what Gary's been up to ever since he started his journey.

Mia is a cinnamon roll and deserves to be protected >:(

That's my 20 cents on the story so far, sorry if it got pretty rambly. You've got some good ideas going here and I'm looking forward to seeing how things develop. I don't think I'd really consider this a rational fiction story per se but I'm glad to have found it. Til next time! Stay safe and healthy, best wishes.

***** > The evolution of magic in the story is also very cool and intuitive, and I am looking forward to see how it continues to develop with the hints toward greater power from beyond and whatnot.

One thing you have to remember is that people are unreliable narrators. All they know is that they think the power comes from somewhere else. This whole plot point is super important in the story. A small hint - Our story is titled Ascension.

> It feels like there's tones of strict hierarchy underlying the structure of this world that everyone just accepts (other than red, which seems to make it intentional). I hope this gets explored more...

Yeah, we will get into it, but not all at once. Reviewers have mentioned that we should take a more gradual approach to presenting the information so that they do not get lost while reading it.

> I'm looking forward to see what will happen if Red and Ritchie ever cross paths again considering how their lives changed the first time they met.

You just might get your wish in this ACT.

> Can pokemon learn to read/write?

True, it would break one of the axioms of the anime: that humans and pokemon cant speak directly, but it just keeps bugging me that SOMEBODY would have at least tried it in universe.

We have lore for the whole how language developed, why pokemon understand humans and why humans can't understand pokemon. It will be in later Acts. It is theoretically possible to teach a pokemon how to read, or baring that, how to recognise letters. This will be very tedious and will likely only be plausible in any reasonable time frame with pokemon with a high degree of sapience. As for unnown... We have a lot of lore there as well.

> You mentioned that civilization has written history only up to 600 years back, and before then humans were basically cave dwellers.

A lot of this will be explore in future Acts. But yes. /Written history and Records,/ only exist to around 600 years ago.

Another thing is, you cannot directly say that their world is more developed than ours. Development usually moves from necessity to luxury. From biomimicry to innovation. Planes were first designed from watching animals fly unlike computers, where a conceptual idea had to be created. The pokemon world holds materials far beyond our own.\\
An example of this--- In our world, scientists understood the genetic code, replication, how cells work and how stem cells transform. Then they moved to cloning. Knowledge spread and technology grew. In the pokemon world, someone found a ditto cell and used it for medicine. They are able to get the same results with much less effort. But the thought process, the /why,/ may be significanty worse than our world. That is why there is a skewed technology curve in the ascencion verse. Technology for military and development have been developed extensively, especially if it depends on material found in the Ascension verse. On the other hand, luxuary technology tends to be far, far behind.

> Are you planning on going back and fixing the typos in already written chapters? There tend to be a few throughout many chapters, and I'd be willing to make a list of what I catch if I ever reread the chapters.

I make fixes regularly. If they are minor changes, I update every month, major changes I fix immediately. We are already planning to go back to earlier chapters after this Act and polish them up a bit. For example, we used sweat drop ( a metaphorical verb) that many people didn't appreciate, and we were planning to change that.

We greatly appreciate readers pointing out typos and incorrect useage. We are also open to suggestions, if certain lines are written awkwardly/presented poorly and you tell us a better way to put them. Thank you.

> You mention sweat dropping several times through the story, what did you mean by it? (ex. Red sweat dropped when ...)

Sweatdrop is a metaphor for exasperation. It indicates /I can't believe this is happening. I/t is likely inspired by anime, as it is represented by a stylized bead of sweat. It has been used in the Pokemon show as well. That being said, we realized plenty of people may not recognize it and therefore we will change it in future edits to some other witty line when we get time or if a reader suggests a replacement dialogue.

> How's Gary doing? We recently got an update on Leaf's and Ethan's badge count but not a word on what Gary's been up to ever since he started his journey.

Well not too much about Garry at the moment. He isn't a main charecter at the moment, though he will have importance in specific Acts.

> Mia is a cinnamon roll and deserves to be protected >:(

Yes. Poor Mia.

> That's my 20 cents on the story so far, sorry if it got pretty rambly. You've got some good ideas going here and I'm looking forward to seeing how things develop.

I hoped it would be rational enough, considering we literally rebuilt the world to and created lore to ensure everything was logically consistent. We are sorry if you felt otherwise. That being said---Thank you and we are glad you enjoyed it. It was a long and nice review, worth much more than 20 cents imo.
