*** You'd probably want a team of people to be clued in onto the impending breach, armed with scripts and lists so that they can break into targets of high priority and mass-download information to be analyzed later. They'd move before anyone else got clued into the oncoming disaster.

To be honest, if one of the "Trusted Five" was compromised by anarcholibertarian ideals, letting themselves get burned on a temporary disruption of the internet would be a waste. They would be better off as a sleeper agent, covertly hiring similar minded staff and filling the ranks of senior engineers with moles or incompetent yes-men so that they could eventually introduce backdoors with no oversight and allow themselves as much access to sensitive data as they wanted.

**** I think we have similar ideas for what could be done with that level of access, but personally I discard those as extremely unlikely to be successful. Too many points of failure in the plans, as it were, mostly related to recruiting more than a couple other people (and even then they'd have to have my absolute trust in their reliability and abilities).

***** I agree that the complexity added by bringing in more people can be exceedingly dangerous, but even Snowden required the aid of intermediaries to help ensure success. Considering that you are likely to be brought down quickly anyway, even one other conspirator on the outside able to oversee the plan after you are arrested might greatly increase the effect of the initial breach.

That is also why I suggested bringing in incompetents or unquestioningly loyal subordinates to sabotage security: these individuals don't have to be in on the plan, but their lack of scrutiny might allow you greater freedom to act.

** I was going to post this because it's an interesting piece of worldbuilding and near-future scifi, but I realized to my surprise that it fits the definition on "Rational" on the sidebar.

It's also rather interesting.

** So, how many people upon watching this went to see what was actually available in their Google search history?
