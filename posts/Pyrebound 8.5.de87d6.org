The end of chapter eight. Thank as always to my awesome fans.

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/10/06/chapter-8-5/]]

Pyrebound is a high fantasy serial with thematic similarities to the Book of Job (I'm challenging myself to describe this thing differently every week; I realize this'n's a stretcher). The back-cover blurb is [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/][here]], and the story starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]].


** That metaphorical egg dripping down Piridur's face is comic gold.

** I have to admit, I don't see what the ensi's game is yet. However, having just binged the whole story maybe it has to sit.

*** Ensi's initial goal I think was the secretly appoint a successor while he held the pyre hostage unless he got his way and purged the corruption.

Now that his jig is up, it's time to do the same thing in a different setting. I think his goal is some shenanigans with the Enemy. The Enemy has shown itself to be thinking society based entities. We have seen what the humans can do with the Enemy's magic, now to see what the enemy can do with Pyre magic.
