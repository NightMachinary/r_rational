*** /Seconded./ The only thing I'd change would be to remove the phrase "kick their asses" which broke SoD, and replace with e.g. "save us". Everything else was great.

**** That's a much, much better summary than any I've come up with. Mind if I steal it?

*** [[#s][A degree of spoilers; attempting to keep to the jist/premise of the piece]]

I would enjoy seeing a full story about this I think.

**** I too loved this story. But I think most people will be disappointed with a continuation. It won't have the same thrill, the same unknown. It will be a classical "defeat the big bad" story. Which can be very good, but it won't be the /same/.

***** That seems like only one way of multiple it could go. It seems like it'd be a little droll if Chooser's prediction was /perfectly/ correct, after all.

** /Damn/, that was good. I got shivers from reading it. Nice and climactic and inspiring and interesting. Just lovely.

Alternatively you can piggyback off of this and create a following online.

** Hmm. Scout's report indicates that they can use the racial magic of the individuals they're possessing (I gained a level, in my first host...).

Why, then, don't they just possess Pilot and use [Linear Drive] themselves to fling the rock they're on into the Sun? They'd be trapped in this Universe (at least until the human Time Mages developed a way to bridge the gap), but the goal of saving the Earth and Chooser would be accomplished.
