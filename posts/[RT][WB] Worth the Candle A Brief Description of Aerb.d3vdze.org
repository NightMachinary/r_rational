** This worldbuilding doc was a [[https://patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon goal]] from awhile back that took a lot more focused time and effort than I expected it would, partly because there was so much that I wanted to add to it. You will notice a few omissions:

- Not all 200 of the mortal species are listed
- There's no complete list of exclusions
- Bloodline and specic magics are generally not listed
- There's no comprehensive list of magical flora and fauna

All of that would have made this thing about twice as long, and it would have taken three or four times as long, in part because it can be creatively draining to make long lists of things (even if I do have some extremely brief lists).

All of that might get chucked into a Part II sometime in the future, if I feel like it, though it might be after /Worth the Candle/ is finished, because I'm going to go ahead and not look at this thing for a bit (corrections or necessary changes excepted).

Note that there's no section on gods, clerics, etc.: this is deliberate, because they haven't been formally introduced in the story yet.

**** I think they're a lot of fun, but there are also canonically fifty-three of them (by a conservative count), and I tend to find similarly formatted lists to be really draining after about ten or so, and I would want more than a single sentence for each, covering what the magic/effect is, whether the place is livable, how you would be likely to die there, and its history ... conservatively three paragraphs each? Which would be one hundred and fifty information-dense paragraphs. I'm not saying that I wouldn't/won't do it, but it would nearly double the length of the doc, it would include things that are definitely spoilers, and this project suffered enough scope creep as it was.

(I'm trying to think of how many are namechecked in /Worth the Candle/ to figure out how much work is done:

- 13 Horrors
- Glassy Fields
- Blue Fields
- Parsmont
- Risen Lands
- Datura Desert
- Everblood
- Nightsmoke

Plus a bunch that are implied to exist, one way or another. My own list of excluded skills has 82 of them, but I would have to cross-reference that with the text, and I know some of them would have to at the very least be renamed, if not refactored.)

***** I would note that if you're worried about scope creep---there's a certain point where this stops being a hobbyist “worldbuilding document” and becomes a freestanding, commercially-viable RPG campaign-world splatbook. So the ROI graph kind of trends down for a while, then spikes way up.

(Obviously, it'd only make sense to commit to a project like that until after WtC is done, once there's nothing more to spoil and you don't have any other active projects immediately calling to you. But such a project would be---like this doc is---a nice byproduct/outgrowth of your working notes, and yet still wouldn't require the sort of heavy game-design + QA work that actually making a fully-fleshed-out RPG out of WtC's---not necessarily wholly existent---mechanics would.)

Ever increasing scope creep, check. Byzantine bureaucracy that nobody can actually change because all decisions require an unanimity vote, check.

  “It's complicated, Juniper,” said Amaryllis. “The Empire of Common Cause operates under a legal framework that's meant to govern interaction between polities, and which has slowly crept into everyday life -- lots of parallels with your own United States, actually, minus the Civil War.

#+begin_quote
  When people said “the empire” they meant something akin to the United Nations, in that it was a rather toothless organization whose real power came from member countries agreeing to impose standardized laws or make global (they said hexal, for obvious reasons) sanctions against one another.
#+end_quote

in the text, and the EU does sit somewhere in between on the toothless/not-toothless scale. Overall, I'd say the EU is the closest analog, with a couple of caveats.

- The legislature appears more similar to that of China, the National People's Congress. They have in common both that they're very large, and that they are only rarely in full session, instead delegating legislative power to legislative subcommittees. As far as I can see, while western legislatures do delegate a lot of power, it's almost always to departments under the executive branch.

- The EoCC clearly isn't always toothless, and there's been references to the organization as whole declaring war or taking similarly extreme action, which is beyond what the EU has ever done.

- I'm not read up on the Court of Justice of the EU, but I think that on balance, the concept of a powerful judiciary that often rewrites the legal reality, with limited recourse by the traditional legislative process, is more prevalent in the US than the EU.

** u/Ristridin1:
#+begin_quote
  In the naive case, a velocity mage will increase their own velocity at the expense of mass, conserving power. This allows for much faster movement, at the expense of an ability to affect the world. A velocity mage at ten times speed will punch with one tenth the mass.

  The big problem with speedsters is that velocity is extremely powerful, since power equals mass times velocity.
#+end_quote

I think the above still has some issues. Momentum equals mass times velocity, but energy equals 1/2 times mass times velocity squared. If you're at half the weight and twice the speed, your punch is still effectively more powerful. This means that as far as damage is concerned, increasing speed by some factor at the cost of reducing mass by the same factor.

The basic example would be one billiard ball hitting a second of the same mass (head on, and assuming the collision is elastic). If the two have the same mass, all the momentum and kinetic energy of the first is transferred to the second; the first ball comes to a complete stop. If you halve the mass of the first and double its velocity however, conservation of momentum and energy work out to the second ball receiving 8/9 of the kinetic energy of the first, i.e. 16/9 times the kinetic energy (meaning 4/3 times the velocity) it would have received without the change in mass and velocity of the first. The remaining 1/9 remains with the first ball, which bounces back at 2/3 of its original velocity. (I hope I did the math right)

In other words, while velocity mages have to worry more about recoil, their punches would actually be stronger. A more even trade might be increasing velocity by a factor x at the cost of reducing mass by a factor x^{2,} preserving kinetic energy rather than momentum. In the billiard ball example, that would mean only 16/25 of the original kinetic energy would be transferred to the second ball (i.e. it would move at 4/5 of the original velocity compared to the case without mass/velocity adjustments), while the first would recoil at 6/5 of the original velocity (which makes recoil an even bigger problem compared to the first case, and actually seems to reduce the ability of a velocity mage to interact with the world (obviously the math would be more complicated compared to the billiard ball example, but I'm fairly confident things would work out in much the same way)).

I'm not sure on this one, because "how they *were* practiced" seems like it would indicate that they're no longer practiced that way. Compare:

#+begin_quote
  My wife and I were a natural fit because we share a similar sense of humor.
#+end_quote

That intuitively seems perfectly fine to me, because though the tense isn't consistent between the two clauses, it doesn't have to be, and breaking it apart would be completely fine:

#+begin_quote
  My wife and I were a natural fit. We share a similar sense of humor.
#+end_quote

It's mostly a question of connotations. (And I don't particularly like putting those two verbs in line with each other in this case.) Usually in cases like this, I would just rewrite the whole thing so that the problematic structure isn't there at all, but I'm not actually sure that it's wrong, or if it is, /why/ it's wrong.

Not a typo as such, but folded steel is only folded a few times, maybe a dozen or so at most, because each fold doubles the number of layers. Folding 100 times would make the steel completely homogenous. This is in ch2.

You use this word a number of times, but I think you're thinking of a sigmoid function.

I explicitly noticed it in the water magic section, but saw the word a few other times as well. A sigmoid function increases quickly at first then levels off, which is what I think you intend.

  A throw apple will follow a parabola through the air, and when altered by the entad's magic, will follow a different, likely shallower parabola. If a revision mage revises the apple, the apple will not go backward through the air following the shallower parabola, but rather, follow a parabola which the apple would have followed if it were not affected by magic. This backward path will have the apple end up in a different position than the one it began in, sometimes radically so, though often it will be stopped in its backwards, ahistorical journey due to inconsistencies or ambiguities that cannot be resolved.

At the beginning it needs to be "A thrown apple" and near the end a space is needed between "a" and "historical".

Shimmerplate: Currently held by the Empire of Common Cause (specifically, Imperial Affairs), shimmerplate is not an entad or entad set, but rather, the result of the action of a single *enatd*, the Armoring Rifle, which encases anyone it hits in armor. This armor, presumably dubbed shimmerplate because of how little it reflects light, is strong, breathable, nullifies minor damage, and resizes to anyone who wears it, all common on entad armor. Aside from allowing the mass production of entad-equivalent armor, the Armoring Rifle allows revocation of armor from a distance at the wielder's command, though it gives little information on who is wearing each specific armor and where they are, which must be corroborated and tracked by a small department within Imperial Affairs responsible for that in the event revocation is required.

Although a theoretical description of Passion magic remains a futile endeavour, it was empirically determined that peak magical output resulted from not a single intense feeling but instead a repeating series of transitions between four distinct emotions. The first such set to be discovered was the Lust-Hunger-Anger-Fear loop, which led to the erroneous belief that only primal emotions could form the vertices of these "carnal cycles".

First of all, Aerb is a shitty place. I thought Warhammer 40k was shitty, but Aerb is on a whole other level. It's not as grimdark, but it would be so much worse to exist there.

Are there still elves on Celestar? It sounds like there still are. So for all the bullshit on Aerb, there's even more bullshit there (Is it smaller or bigger than Aerb?). And considering the type of stuff that goes on on Aerb, there should be stuff happening there that threatens all life on Aerb, cue star quest.

The magics are so arbitrary. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised to see mist magic, snow magic, steam magic or ice 2 magic.

I wonder if the powers of the Ice Wizards or Apocalypse Demon are going to get explained. I'd like to get a feel for the type of threats Arthur faced. I don't really have a sense of how powerful he was atm. Ice Wizards are mentioned 3 times, the Apocalypse Demon 6,

Do Infernals reproduce or are there a set, finite number of them? Is it possible for the mortal species in the Hells to fight back against the Infernals? Do they just not because there's no magic available and the Infernals are much better fighters? If that's the case, I can imagine a scenario where you industrialize the creation of souls and swamp the Hells with overwhelming numbers of mortals so that they stand a chance.

Seeing this document, I can see how Juniper is constantly reminded of his own world building. Aerb feels both more (seeing more details) and less (seeing more hackey obvious simulated and inconsistent elements) real now.

An animal corpse wouldn't be a direct threat, but if there are a bunch they could quickly rot and cause problems. A spy could teleport vital materials to their own army. Transportation of otherwise stationary weapons would be practical. You could also swamp an area in propaganda, causing demoralization.

Is "Closest available" just a distance measurement? Because it seems like that would lead to lots of elderly renacim choosing euthanasia in the attic above a pregnant queen's bedchamber.
