Something I was thinking about the other day is that I've been noticing recently that the general character of the powerful competent rational protagonist reminds me of something. . . It took me a while to put my finger on it, then it struck me -- the rational protagonist is the hyperconfident, hypercapable science fiction leading man of old, all dressed up in geeky new clothes!

Remember the protagonist of old science fiction stories? The man who could out fight and out shoot any other man, who, when he had to make a will save, powered through the effect while all the women and children and lesser males were lying helplessly on the floor, pulled himself upright by sheer willpower and clocked the villain or pressed the button to fire the nova bomb. Who could look at a complex situation and instantly figure out a solution which solved problems perfectly. Who was a master of many fields, an expert in darn near everything.

He was a superhero whose superpowers ran on the overwhelming essence of raw conquering manhood (plus !science!, sometimes). He was popular for years. Then he fell out of favor. For a while science fiction heroes lost their mantel, became more like protagonists out of Henry James, flawed, necrotic, indecisive, scared, even * gasp * /women/. (Okay, okay, some of the old breed were women. Still, it was rare.)

But that old longing for a hero who knew what to do, who didn't spend his or her time waffling around failing and feeling sorry for themselves, wondering whether it's really worth it to try, that old need hasn't faded.

And so now he's back. More powerful than ever, capable of taking over an entire universe with the raw power of his mind, now running on pure distilled rationality rather than manhood! The rational hero!

I almost made a post that preserved the other thread's OP, but he didn't seem prone to deleting, so I didn't. Shame.

**** Might be a reference to the "can you recommend anything about a badass" thread that went through a little while ago. I never saw the actual text -- the OP deleted it before I got there -- but apparently it was to the effect of "literature has been getting feminized and we need to bring back the awesomeness of men".

That wasn't my point, but it is interesting. I would think that while that poster got "hyper capable competent protagonist" mixed up with the class "males", males probably weren't exactly what he wanted.

James H. Schmitz wrote some terrific stories with extremely capable and competent protagonists in the old sci-fi tradition -- almost all of them women (I quite like his stuff -- he could really write what you might call "strong yet believable women" extremely well. But he was an exception.).

I emphasized the masculinity element in my OP for the humor value, but I do kind of think that "rational protagonists" are a new way of bringing back that old hyper capable character, whatever zer gender, just like super power explanations over time traveling the timeline of Electricity > Radioactive Waste > Genetic Engineering > Quantum B!X?ZH[B]A{Q}F > portals to other universe allowing for different laws of physics and other weirdness.

***** I saw the post, it was slightly more extreme than that. It was essentially saying that a large number of positive traits were inherently masculine, and definitely not feminine.

**** Another poster made a thread that expressed some unpopular opinions. After realizing how unpopular these opinions were, he deleted the thread. I believe it would be rude to link back to it.

** A correctly written rational protagonist need not be smarter than others, nor possess more skills, nor more willpower. A correctly written rational protagonist /must not/ be able to look at a complex situation and figure out a solution that someone properly weighting the in-universe evidence would not reach. Sherlock Holmes, Tony Stark, Kimball Kinneson, Lazarus Long, and Spock are not rational protagonists.

Of course, we can get at least a little bit Byronic, here: A rational protagonist does not dither indecisively, waiting to make a decision is only rational if there's pending evidence with a high enough expected VoI.

** Yeah I buy that. I feel like there's been a backlash against that character archetype in favor of supposedly more complex or realistic characters, but that the pendulum is now swinging back the other way. Competence porn can be a lot of fun.
