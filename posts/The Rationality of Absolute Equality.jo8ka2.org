** This really sounds like a dystopia. Like, it's not even subtle.

Not being able to reproduce sexually? Many people believe there's a special bond between a parent and their biological child and wouldn't like not being able to experience that. Also, how does this remove nepotism? Unless you're having the kids raised by faceless robot entities -- I shouldn't have to explain why this is a terrible idea -- then /someone/ has to be raising them, and they might give their children unfair advantages.

No education is equal. Teachers are of varying level of skill and temperament, and some students will react better to different styles of teaching than others. If you have two students of equal intelligence, one a visual learner and one not, then the visual one will do better if the class has a teacher that likes teaching that way.

Constant surveillance by robotic entities? That's some 1984 shit.

As for 'equal contribution'... why? Literally, what's the point of this? Any of it? To say that a person should have to pay a price to feel comfortable in their own skin, to receive an education, to /be born/ is wrong and stupid at best, possibly outright offensive.

That's not even getting into the fact that you apparently have AI complex enough to be judge, jury, and executioner; why would anyone work, when machines could clearly do it much faster, easier, and better? At this point, just institute basic universal income -- if someone wants more than enough money to live comfortably, then they can get a job doing something not easily done by machines, like acting.

The reasoning behind this form of 'equality' -- speaking of, how on earth would it bring any sort of actual equality? -- also feels a lot like this society is trying to brainwash its citizens into feeling indebted to it so they won't dissent. "You owe us for making you. You owe us for giving you basic rights. You should be grateful. If you aren't, you're a bad person. You don't want to be a bad person, do you?"

Newsflash -- the earlier law about free education? It's not free if you have to pay for it.

*** Alright, point taken about Universal Basic Income. It just felt sort of unearned. But, you are right, a society advanced enough to be deathless is advanced enough to not need its members to work.

About children and education, I talked about how they should be given as wide a range of experiences as possible. Why have a limitation in the choice of teachers? They can experience different styles of teaching and just choose the teachers and subjects they like best.

**** How does a kid know what teacher will be right for them? Will they just be lucky they found the right one? they made the right choice? Did someone choose one for them? Unless its the same someone who chooses for everyone, and everyone is the same so the choice will always be the same that isn't true equality.

I think you will find there will never be "true equality" unless everyone is identical and lives identical lives.

As I mentioned in my main comment below, "true equality" isn't feasible or even desired (in fact, personally I think it is one of the most morally abhorrent things that you could fight for). You should look for a better goal. I personally like attempting to maximize "freedom" and "equal opportunity" together (the together part is important, because they are both mutually exclusive, increasing one necessitates decreasing the other by definition and human nature.) If you maximize equality you have to remove all choice and all differences between individuals. If you maximize freedom you get anarchy. The absolute of either one of those is catastrophe.

** Yikes, I would not want to live in this kind of society, and in no way do I see this a rational one.

A rational Actor and or Modus operandi is to persue one's objectives in the most efficient manner possible while adhering to a given set of internal rules.

The goal here appears to be an equal basis to start life from before striking out, by some technicalities this objective is being met with the proposed solution but the more efficient method would be to simply copy brain states / souls / AI patterns for a given specimen raised in this, horrid, manner. Using a master copy create as many of these, equal entities as are needed for the society.

This Society, would be bland tasteless, emotionless, stagnant entity. Diversity breeds strength, and Unity lets it endure.

True Equality enforced on every individual is a dystopia nightmare. For a society to flourish, Equality of opportunity should be available.

** Equal at birth doesn't work in general. If all humans were exactly identical, and especially if we had no genetic diversity, we would have no will to do anything. If I were born with no desires, no specific genetic traits then I would want for nothing, never make any choices because of an inability to make a choice, and pass the rest of my life without doing anything. If we /had/ specific drives, then all the clones would end up identical. Realistically, if they are all given the same education, and grew up with the same traits and drives, they would make the same choices, which technically fulfills equality of choice but makes it useless.

The problem with equality is that it boils down to people ending up the exact same. This is a classic equity vs. equality situation. We need equity, because the differences between people are important and a key part of humanity.

That's all I can think of for now.

*** I grew up as friends with a pair of identical twins. They lived in the same home,studied in the same school, did the same things... yet, they had diametrically opposite personalities.

I can't explain why this happens... but, I think you would be surprised by how /unequal/ these vat-grown clones would be by the time of their graduation.

**** No, its not hard to explain. Subtle differences in upbringing, (e.g., lets say people are "designed" (as in their genes encourage them to) take one of two personalities: Extroverted or introverted. They are also designed to take the one which seems less common. (so in a pair of identical twins, if one becomes an extrovert, the other is likely to become an introvert) So now, whatever super subtle differences in their environment encourage one twin to choose their allegiance fist will become one, while the other will become the other.

Now, being an extrovert or introvert is VASTLY different, they have completely different *unequal* lives, by no choice of their own. How is this any different from genetic differences?

**** Identical twins are fundamentally different from what you're implying. Twins in real life experience an incredible amount of stimuli. It is literally impossible for the stimuli to be the same. Most of the stimuli will be different, leading to different twins. The cause of difference between the clones in your ideal world need to come from somewhere, and if all the clones are the same at birth(which let me just say is an incredible loss of diversity, this would constrain them to specific modes of thinking and modes of life since a lot of personality traits and choices are completely set by genes and unchangeable in real life) then the only way they could be different is from a different education, which would invalidate the equal education initiative.

True or absolute equality does not exist. Except maybe on the Platonic plane or at the heat death of the universe. You can only approach justice, but never reach it. The closer you get, the more things have to regress because our spacetime doesn't allow absolute equality of results and opportunities in an organic way.

** Nothing about this is rational. It is irrational to remove our genetic diversity. It is irrational to try to perpetuate the notion that everyone must contribute to society when we should push for things like Universal Basic Income. AGI controlling law enforcement? Likely going to require a lot of privacy violations, not to mention the security risks.

Your only half-reasonable proposals are equity in education and a deathless society, except of course, what do you even mean to balance age related inequality?

*** Under 'Equality of choice' you get your diversity back.

As for 'Equal contribution'... well, what is the origin of that universal basic income you propose? If it is generated by the other members of society, why should they give up the fruits of their labors to these unrelated young-adults?

About privacy, there can be restrictions on the AI to not share the data they have gathered. I believe the advantages outweigh the risks.

In the interests of 'absolute equality' I wish to avoid the formation of a gerontocracy where the elders, by dint of their greater age, gain undue authority.

**** You don't get genetic diversity back, you can't get genetic diversity if every member of your species is born a literal clone.

Because noone should have to work if they don't want it? If you don't want to work you get to live on the bare minimum of conforts, if you want more go get it.

If there's no data sharing there's no trust to be given to them. I mean, that's kindof why law enforcement is supposed to show evidence of crime, otherwise they could just punish whoever they wanted (even more)

Welp, that's just straight out impossible. If a person is alive for a longer time they have more connections and possibly more knowledge.

I stick to what I said, I'm afraid your ideas are just not rational, you are just trying to present your own version of a dream society, where you get all you want without compromising anything

You can gene-sculpt yourself your dream body. Everyone can choose what they want to look like instead of it having to be an accident of birth. There, diversity right there. No two people will have the same ideal of beauty, ergo, no two people will look the same.

I concede. A response from another member convinced me of the merits of UBI. I have edited the post and struck through the 'equal contribution' argument.

The law enforcement here is a highly advanced emotionless AI. What incentive would it have to be corrupt and sabotage its own objective of upholding the law?

Yeah. I can't think of any nerfs for them either.

Well, 'absolute' /anything/ is supposed to have no compromises. The society presented is a dystopia. As they say, too much of a good thing is toxic.

****** Who made the AI? Who made the laws? Laws are not perfect, and the fact that they are not perfectly enforced can often be a feature, not a bug.

For example, laws take time to change, and often aren't good. E.g. drugs; we want to discourage drug use and keep it from being accepted in public, but arresting every college student who has a smoke doesn't help society. A counterintuitive solution is to keep it illegal but not enforced strongly.

^I am not saying this is right or wrong, just want to put add more perspective on how a "god" AI can go wrong.

That doesn't necessarily imply a lot of genetic diversity. That just implies genetic diversity in the genes that involve appearance or ability.

For a couple examples of why genetic diversity is good: there is a genetic mutation which, if you inherit it from both parents, gives you sickle cell anemia. If you inherit it from only one parent, though, it gives you protection against malaria. The Gros Michel cultivar banana was bred to have no seeds and could only reproduce by cloning; it fell victim to Panama disease and had to be replaced by the Cavendish banana, which, also being a cloned cultivar, is in danger of being devastated by another strain of the same fungus.

If everything is based off of the same clone body, then we're eventually going to be hit with something that is exactly the worst thing against those clones. And then it will clear its way through the entire population, because, like the Gros Michel or the Cavendish, every clone is equally weak against it. On the other hand, if enough people are rendered different through genetic mutation and sexual reproduction, then there will probably be a few people with a minor bad traits, or a whole bunch of people with a neutral trait, who, like people with the sickle cell trait, will have protection against the threat, and that protection can then spread to the next generation.

The more genetic diversity you have, the more threats your population is equipped to face.

** Unlike the other commenter [[/u/JullianWyvern]], I think this is much closer to the eventual outcome of true equality than he thinks, but I would say that actually, *true equality is evil.*

I still think you aren't looking broadly enough though; the only way you can achieve "true equality" is by each person having *no* differences what-so-ever. e.g. you said that at age of maturity, they can "choose" what they want to do. Ok, so what if someone "chooses" something more profitable/fulfilling than another person? -> How did that person come to a different choice than the most optimum one? -> Their upbringing must have been different, hence inequality.

You cannot have anyone's life experience being ANY different than another person's for true equality. Choice does not exist in a truly equal society.

So IMO, true equality is completely unfeasible, and undesirable even in a post-scarcity civilization.

Since you mentioned them though, I wanted to comment on the two last points: First, Equity before the law; I agree this would be the only way to attempt to enforce "true equality", but I would also say that if actual true equality is achieved as mentioned above, there should be NO law. Anyone treated (let alone punished) differently than others is inequality.

If we look at it in a more realistic perspective: the problem with one entity having all the power is that if that entity somehow does the "wrong" thing, there is nothing that can be done. The only solution to this, is you have to have power be spread as much as possible. The issue with that is that as long as one entity with power wants more than their fair share (or just *perceives* another entity being unfair) you have conflict, and unfortunately you cannot solve this by centralizing power because of the above point.

I would also want to mention about the deathless society point; the old people don't need protecting. They would have the most power in a deathless society, think of an MMO, the weakest players are the new ones not old ones. If you are interested in equalizing this you would need to give the young something and take form the old. In our society that's Taxes and public education (plus parental obligation), and in a post-scarcity society I would actually solve this by countering your "equal contribution" point; Everyone should start (and be forced to keep) a minimum amount of "resources" which are enough for comfortable subsistence. The rest they can do whatever they want with.

​

I think what you are looking for is actually: how to achieve true "equal *opportunity*", and I think you will find it looks very similar to many developed countries in modern society with a few tweaks.
