** I haven't yet seen anything based on it. There haven't been all that many high-value points of departure, seriously long waits between chapters, and ending, and it doesn't have Worm's magic fanfic spawn of alt-powers. In other words, I think it doesn't (yet?) lend itself to fanfic.

*** Honestly I think it's more that Wales' imagination is so vast and off-the-wall that it fulfills the fanfic writer's itch of "what would happen if..."

The only real departure point I can think of that wouldn't just end up with "still WtC but worse" is re-spec'd Juniper. And since only Wales knows the specifics of the stat system, even that would be difficult to write.

I'm not usually a fan of fanfiction anyway (with a few exceptions that are usually pointed out as the best works in the genre), but it seems especially redundant for WtC.

***** The only ones I've liked enough to finish (or keep up with) are HPMOR and Pokemon: Origin of Species. I was enjoying Donjon, a Worm fanfic that took place before the events of Worm and didn't intersect with them, but it seems to have been abandoned.

******* Besides the excellent writing, I love deconstructions of settings that originally didn't have a lot of internal consistency. This is also one of the reasons I love Worm and Ward so much. I enjoy the rationalist protags of HPMOR and OOS, but I think I'd like both of them just as much if nobody ever mentioned a cognitive bias.

It's also why Sanderson is one of my favorite authors. Say what you like about him, the man /thinks through/ his worldbuilding.

******** Wth This Ring comes to mind as an example of imposing structure on an irrational (comic book) setting. Not everyone likes the protagonist, but if you liked HPMoR, you can probably look past that. It's longer than HPMoR and OoS combined, though, and still updating (daily).

*** Points of departure is the key here, I think. WtC is too structured in narrative to create good fanfic without reworking the entire story. If joon does almost anything significant different canon immediately goes off the rails because of how much he affects the plot.

Compare this to other stories with major fanfic presence: Harry Potter has the events of Sorcerer's Stone almost assured to happen no matter what house Harry goes in, Naruto's chuunin exam will happen no matter what team he's on, Leviathan and Coil will usually do their thing in Worm, and so on. I think a strong external conflict that (initially) cannot be affected by the protagonist is a key factor in how popular a series will be for fanfiction.

***** You could definitely write a fanfic for A Wizard of Earthsea, in fact it would lend itself readily to the ratfic format.

Rationalist protagonist worries about the problematic world of the dead, takes up quest to end/improve death, character drama in their eventual dismissal of Tehar/Tehanu's desire for an abolishment of the world of the dead and resumption of natural cycle of life/death. The shadow Ged releases is a good lead in to an HPMOR style dark side.

Easiest way to write it would probably be to make tehanu or the prince the rationalist protagonist, but I think it would be more nostalgic and endearing to make it ged, tehanu, or some other character from earlier in the books.

**** There's also the factor of the DM fairly actively maintaining the status quo (or perhaps the first derivative of it), plus the whole "story element will come back in another form if it's bypassed or one-shotted" issue. You might get slightly different versions of the main cast, or slight variants on the quests, but they won't diverge anywhere nearly as easily as in most universes.

The DM /might/ even be able to spot, in-universe, the usual kind of variation-on-the-main character fics, and act to either burn out the discrepancy, or forcibly keep the story on track.

*** On the other hand, I've had maybe a dozen people tell me that they're taking stuff from /Worth the Candle/ for their own tabletop games, so that's something, it's just personal rather than public. I would generally agree that it's not fanfic bait; if someone were going to write fanfic, I would assume it would be character-driven shipping stuff, which is extremely popular for certain franchises, but not really in the demographic that usually reads WtC.

*** Another part of it is that Wales frequently does the Sleeper thing (to a lesser extent) where Proper Nouns are referenced frequently but they are not exposited about for the reader's benefit.

Now this is a perfectly fine style, but it's not one that lends itself well to fanfiction.

While the story is in progress, it gives would-be authors fewer interesting things to play with, can lead to one's fanfiction becoming outdated, and can make them feel as they don't yet understand the world.

*** I disagree, but the total absence of fanfic would suggest you're right. Aerb is so bizarre and vast, it would seem to invite a ton of "I wonder what's going on over here?" or "I wonder what Uthers adventures were like this time?" or whatever.

**** No, fanfic explodes with reasonably defined settings. The median author wants to change one or a few linked things, and extrapolate how canon changes in response. For WtC, that would be something like "How would things change if Amyrillis was a Sailor Moon?" Or "What if Joons power was being Naruto?" And then following the Stations of Canon.

Actually having to extrapolate the /setting/ is a much more limiting factor.

**** It's almost entirely unexplained, though. A fanfic wouldn't be borrowing much from canon, because aside from the exact places Juniper's been, there's not much to work with, and most of the attention has been placed squarely on the party. You can't really go off and do another thing without inventing things wholesale, at which point why even use this setting?

Other works with a great deal of fanfiction, like Naruto, Worm or Harry Potter, have some well-established settings and frameworks to work with.

***** That's another good point. While WtC's setting is defined fairly well, it is also very, very shallow in how much its fleshed out compared to other more fanfiction-ized stories. Joon & Co pretty much speed from town to town trying to stay ahead of their problems, which is very appropriate for an RPG session but doesn't let itself well to derivative fiction.

To elaborate on those examples, Harry Potter only has a handful of settings that are explored very deeply: Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and Diagon Alley. You also have character's houses but those are more minor. Then in Naruto, virtually all of the story pre-shippuden takes place either in Konoha or Wave, the latter of which's setting is pretty much glossed over beyond "oppressed fishing village". The thoroughness and minutae those settings are given is far beyond Barren Jewel, Comfort, or even Li'O.

[[/u/sfinebyme]] I think you misunderstand what most people want to write fanfic about: they don't want to work with almost completely-blank slates like Uther's adventures, because at that point you're practically writing original fiction with stolen characters. What people like to do is lean on deeply-defined settings and plotlines to support how their change to the story propagates.

Yeah imo that's the a reason why a lot of Naruto fanfics sputter out and die during the Wave arc.

****** Naruto's also has shallow settings that... Implicitly draw on anime/generally japanese tropes, which gives fanfics more material to work with. Hot Springs isn't super fleshed out, but you can draw on n Yojimbo and a million anime to give it depth in your fanfic, and it fits with the Naruto setting well enough.

The thing is, Alexander Wales is the kind of author that writes works that you want to take inspiration from, but that aren't super easy to actually turn into fanfic.

Like, I would love to write a video game based on Glimwared, or a political series set in WtC, but that's /a lot/ of effort and I just don't have that kind of free time.
