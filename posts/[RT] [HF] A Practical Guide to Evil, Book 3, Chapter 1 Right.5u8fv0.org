*** While I won't bet anything except my reputation as a good guesser, I'd wager that It's going to be a too much change too quickly = opposition from almost everyone since your making a lot of people at least somewhat mad(Like Joseph II.

The last thing I can think of is Heiress gaining too much power or support, but I don't think that's it, though I'd say it's possible if combined with the first.
