Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Okay, now I'm curious, AutoModerator.

What /are/ the sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league?

*** Mysterious. I assume he's not out as anything or there would be some discussion online but there's also no mention of him having a wife. Unsurprisingly there's not a ton of media coverage about the guy.

** I accidentally fueled an existential crisis in a friend of mine last night. I thought we were having an engaging and thoughtful philosophical discussion until she started to repeatedly ask how she knew I was real; being completely serious and increasingly worried.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? What happened after?

*** Its a thing we also see with certain other mental hazards (rokos basilik etc). Mostly hits people who are prone to anxiety anyway, its more a symptom of anxiety than anything else. For most people it goes away after a while but a small number of people are affect /heavily/ for months.

** Remember Charlie the Unicorn? A new episode came out yesterday. The previous episode came out like seven years ago. Here's a link to the first episode, because it's probably been a hot minute since the last time you even thought about its existence:

And while we're here, here's a reminder that Llamas With Hats exists, in case you haven't thought about that in a while (or possibly haven't yet had the pleasure of seeing it):

  That was... like the complete opposite of everything this sub is about.

Hmm, maybe that's why I posted it in the Friday Off Topic / Open Thread and didn't give it its own thread like people do when they're recommending a work of rational fiction.

#+begin_quote
  That was absolutely terrible
#+end_quote

It's sort of an "lolz so random XD" strain of humor, which isn't everyone's taste, but it's a piece of internet history and I feel like the release of the first new episode in /seven years/ was noteworthy.

Also, Llamas With Hats is /fantastic/, better than Charlie The Unicorn imho.

**** Yeah, maybe I should've linked that, but then I figured that it might be better to link to the beginning of the series for people previously unaware of CTU's existence. I also figured that, since it's been seven years since the last episode, it's probably been a hot minute since the last time most people who know about CTU have seen it, so rewatching the older episodes would be better than just jumping straight into the newest one.

Eh, what can ya do, right? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

****** Llamas With Hats is vastly more enjoyable, but it's not as much one of those "famous early internet things." The whole thing is only 18 minutes long, and the link is in my original comment.

*** Music. Whether the music itself is sad or not varies. Single-sitting games like 2048, Captain Forever, or Slay the Spire tend to cheer me up. If I'm playing a game like that I listen to upbeat synthetic rock or other fast-paced music.

*** Consuming media often doesn't actually help deal with the reason for being sad, it only pushes it out of my mind for a bit. What has helped me much more was usually talking to people, whether in real life or on the internet.

That said, for pushing sad thoughts from my mind I like violent games like DOOM, or complex games like Into The Breach.

*** When I'm wallowing: An endless cycle of my YouTube homepage recommendations until I'm angry enough at myself to switch to wordless music(Slow techno, video game soundtracks) and try to get small things done. Or lots of Facebook and Reddit if I'm away from my computer, similarly stuck on a loop of checking them repeatedly for "one more thing" that will motivate me.

When I'm trying to feel better: I listen to pop science podcasts or fiction audiobooks, avoiding anything "productive" or requiring focus, and go on a slow run away from home until I've made a plan and relaxed. If I'm panicked or angry on top of the sadness I run fast, I find being very out of breath gets rid of more intense emotions temporarily (you go from wanting/thinking complicated things to just wanting to catch your breath, and you can achieve that goal!).
