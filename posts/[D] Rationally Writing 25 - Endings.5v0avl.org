**** Couple of things here, I enjoy the podcasts quite a bit.

First, #25 is not listed here: [[http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/]]

Second, can you try using each other's names once in a while besides at the start of the podcast?

Honestly, I would say you do.

Edit: You guys seem to talk the same, have the same style of speech and even dictionary, so it can be hard to tell each other apart.

******** Hah! You could try practicing a radio voice instead. Perhaps try inviting a third person into podcasts occasionally for additional discussion?

It's actually a thing that radio personalities will do during their show. While they're having a conversation, they'll say a joke, making fun of so and so

"Ha, then Taylor spilled her drink all over the guy she was trying to woo at the bar"

And then she'll say something like "HEY, I tripped, and he was with a girl already, serves him right!" That way you as a listener can always know who is who. I don't know if it's deliberate or not but it happens frequently enough that I'm pretty sure it is deliberate.

** For a podcast about rational fiction, you sure talk about Stephen King a lot.

*** I've probably read more books by Stephen King than any other author. Which makes sense since he's so unusually prolific. He's just an amazing writer, even with his flaws :) His characters and dialogue tend to be consistently amazing.

** Hey everyone, be sure to check out the show notes to avoid the episode if it's going to spoil something you plan on reading/watching!

Here's [[/u/alexanderwales]] 's book recommendation for the week:

This week I'm recommending the [[http://amzn.to/2kC4YGt][Merchant Princes]] series by Charles Stross. The story starts as a fairly standard portal fantasy, but it's a heavily deconstructionist take on the genre. For one, Miriam Beckstein is a thirty-something tech journalist rather than a teenager or author stand-in. For another, there's a heavy focus on socio-cultural matters rather than raw exploitation of technology. The ending, which I'll leave unspoiled, was my favorite part of the book, but one of the thigns I really appreciated was that in terms of exploitation, this was a lived-in world, where the clan of world-walkers had already tried all the obvious stuff, and where strategies and counter-strategies had been deployed back and forth for years by the time the protagonist finally shows up. Stross, as always, shows a heavy attention to detail in the way he writes, which sometimes verges on being detrimental to the work, but for me, strikes just the right balance.

There are six books in the series, or three if you're reading the condensed versions; the Merchant Princes series has the benefit of being complete, so you can race straight through it if you'd like.

If you'd like to listen to the first book, The Family Trade, go to [[http://www.audible.com/t1/30trial_at?source_code=PDTGBPD060314004R][Audible]] and sign up to get a free book credit and help support the show.
