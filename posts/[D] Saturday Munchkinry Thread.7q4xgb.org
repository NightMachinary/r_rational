Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** TL;DR you have super strength via short-range telekinesis. Try to find clever applications other than punching things really hard.

You have very short-range telekinesis. Specifically, you can sense the location of and exert force on anything within one centimeter of your skin. The telekinesis isn't particularly strong, but it does give you a really good grip on surfaces that you otherwise wouldn't have a grip on (allowing for very steady footing/Spiderman-style climbing skills). Hair, severed body parts, and grafted body pieces don't count for the one-centimeter rule. The strength the telekinesis can exert is peak human level, so no ripping apart metal cubes with your mind (although you could manifest some sort of cutting edge/drill).

You can form arbitary telekinetic constructs so long as they're within one centimeter of you, up to some precision that is high enough to let you manifest cutting blades but low enough to not let you reforge molecular bonds.

I'm pretty sure this doesn't let you fly by pushing against air- you don't have that much air within a centimeter of your skin, and you'd need to push that air awfully fast to fly - although I'd be happy to be proved wrong.

*** - *Telekinetic gun:* Imagine a telekinetic tube 1 mm in diameter going down the length of my right arm with a telekinetic storage chamber on my right shoulder. Fill the chamber with air by creating a chain of telekinetic discs which move backward from the mouth of the tube. Assuming I'm limited to about 100 lb. of force, I can achieve a pressure of 155,000 PSI, or about 2.5x the maximum chamber pressure of a browning .50 cal machine gun. Switch that 1 mm tube to a â‰¤1 cm tube, place an appropriate projectile inside, then release the gas chamber to fire. Assuming I can produce about 909 watts of power (sprinter equivalent), I can produce a shot equivalent to a .50 BMG once every 22 seconds (though obviously I'm limited to 10 mm projectiles, I can use heavy projectiles at ultra high speeds).

- *Flight:* Assuming sprinter levels of work (909 watts), it would be possible to produce 909 newtons of thrust, or about 13 newtons/kg for an average healthy male. Achieve this with constantly moving blades/waves of telekinetic force forming near your head and rapidly moving down over your body until they're fast enough to achieve peak thrust. As long as you're not overweight, you'll be able to fly straight upwards, though you'll be limited to sprinting distances.

- *Scuba diving:* Create a large pressurized air chamber and then surround yourself with enough rocks/dirt to become neutrally buoyant. Drop the dirt/rocks as you use up your available air to maintain neutral buoyancy. Create telekinetic fins/flippers around your hands and feet to make swimming easier. Don't go more than about 50-100 ft. deep to avoid nitrogen narcosis.

- *Burrowing:* As with the flight example, you can use blades of telekinetic force to turn yourself into a drill to slide through dirt. As with the scuba diving example, you can take a pressurized telekinetic air tank with you for breathing while underground. Ideally you'll want a very large number of relatively small blades so that your body almost acts frictionless as it glides through the dirt.

Edit: Corrected my math on the flight section.

I wonder how arbitrary is arbitrary.

Molecular bonds are on the in the couple hundred picometer ballpark, so if you only had resolution down to the 1 nanometer ballpark (eg 1000 picometer range), then you'd be good enough to construct computers from scratch.

Which is where 'how arbitrary' comes in. Because if you can start building arbitrary, purpose built ASICs then you've just become a one man singularity engine with rapid fab times. God help everyone if you can make the leap to carbon based electronics or 3d chips.

This changes the nature of the threat from 'guy who can telekinesis things' to 'robot apocalypse and also some guy with them'.

*** Random thoughts: You can float (in water) and keep yourself warm by creating forcefields to keep air in. Likewise, you can probably swim faster. What qualities do telekinetic constructs have? Are they green lantern types, forcefield types, can I dictate materials for them to imitate? You would be an excellent melee fighter- one inch punches hit as hard as roundhouse kicks from a centimeter away. Also, peak humans can rip apart metal cubes, at least small ones, so similar feats may be possible.

**** Telekinetic constructs are invisible forcefields. They can bend/curve, but don't have volume. They inhibit movement in both directions, so you can't use a one-way setup to compress gas. You can wrap your body in one large field, (Glory Girl), or wrap your body in many small, sharp fields (Narwhal). Multitasking probably limits the number of small fields to a couple hundred, and you wouldn't have anywhere near perfect micromanagement.

If pushing against something bearing down with more force than the forcefield can exert, the forcefield doesn't shatter but moves with some inertia. Parts of forcefields that would be pushed inside your skin or further than 1cm away disappear without causing you harm.

Floating in water is a very good point - a 1cm bubble of air creates somewhere between 15-20 litres of air, which is more than enough to make the human body buoyant. That's also a bit over two minutes of relaxed breathing - although I haven't crunched the numbers to see if "ideally applied human strength" could , it's probably enough to bring a bubble of air might function in vacuum?

That seems surprisingly large, but I checked the math and you're right. Taking an average healthy adult male (70 kg, 180 cm), the standard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area][body surface area]] formula would yield about 1.9 square meters of surface area. Multiply by 1 cm and you get 0.018 cubic meters, or ~18 liters.

** You are a study group of five that stumbled across the secret of magic. That was your first mistake.

It turns out the global flow of magic is finite, it is already in use, and the Immortal Arch-Wizards of Earth are not interested in you burning through mega-thaums of mana figuring out how to light a candle.

Fortunately, summarily murdering you is socially unacceptable. (most new mages are friends or family to an arch mage that fucked up the secrecy protocols. So killing out of hand is not on. You do not fit this category, but you still get the standard courtesies. Such as they are.) The standard protocol is instead to toss you into a time line that has a viable biome but no indigenous toolusers.

"Resources" you are getting courtesy of... Lets call her Morgana.:

120 people that will not be reported missing. She mostly procured these by rescuing them from durance most vile and healing any health problems. So, 120 sex trafficking victims, drug addicts written of by everyone and oh yhea, one petrochemical engineer being held hostage by the cartel up until five minutes ago. Yes. She left a major trail of bodies rescuing these people. All of them had it coming. If you want food for a horror novel, I guess you could interview your new tribe.

All in literally perfect health, but also you know. Kind of traumatized.

A container of hand tools, a lathe, five computers and enough solar cells to run them. Not gaming machines, but magically indestructible, loaded with a vast collection of reference works compiled with no regard whatsoever to copyright law and locked to you personally.

Most interesting, also contains a series of manuals on sorcery. A very /long/ series.

30 geared compound sports bows for hunting.

So: Morgana will point the cross time gate at any set of coordinates on planet earth equivalent you ask her to. The timeline she has in mind is in an iceage. You also have 9 days and 9 hours to collect any additional crap you want showed through. If you want more stuff from earth, you can get it when you chew through enough of the manuals on sorcery to open your own gates. That will take a approximately 300 years. You are under magical compulsion to not say anything to anyone not in your new tribe..

If not, why the heck are the immortal archmages not coming to this timeline to use the magic here for their magical experiments and what not? It clearly doesn't cost them much to do so, since they are willing to waste whatever it costs on you and 120 other people.

Also you are screwed. Not only is the ice age a literal hell on earth, you're stuck with 120 other people who have no compulsion to obey you or not murder you in your sleep, and many of whom have made horrible life decisions like taking drugs or getting involved in criminal cartels.

I have no idea how you are even going to handle the heating problem. (I assume that by iceage, you mean the entire planet is covered in ice. Otherwise you can just pick the parts of Earth that are still warm and the iceage wouldn't really mean anything.) You can hide underground or in a cave somewhere, but then your solar cells would get no sunlight and you wouldn't be able to use your computers and would be wasting your time not learning any magic. You can try to bring over as much burnable fuel as you can, but that's not sustainable.

You will have to somehow build a power plant for heat/electricity on the other side, but what would it be? The easy one, hydroelectric, isn't available since all the water is frozen. Wind and solar are unreliable, and since they are outdoors, where falling hail can regularly damage them, they will need frequent maintenance. Good luck forcing the 120 people out to work on them in the freezing climate. As for coal/gas/oil, where would you find them?

Jokes aside, I kinda ignored the hunting bows part, because food really isn't a problem.

Its not snow-ball earth - There are still places that are outright tropical, but its also not the most fantastic place for farming because the weather patterns are not all that stable.

Gates take nine days and nine hours of continuous casting to open. You have to enchant yourself quite heavily for the sleep deprivation to even be survivable - Its not worth it for casual use, tough yes, the very most magically intensive experiments and projects do take place on empty earths. (Also, this is for safety. Major fuckups can have nuclear bomb level consequences at the high end. That typically will not kill a wizard warded up to experimental standards but... well, that wouldnt help the town it happened in. ) and anyone inclined to emigrate permanently already fucked off thousands of years ago.

Earth prime is universally considered the best place to live because it is the place with the most advanced "Muggle" civllization, the place where the best 1200 wizards live and study and also because it is the shelling point for cross-world commerce.

Morgana is not setting you up to /fail/ - she completely expects you to come back in three hundred years and offer her a cut to facilitate you trading anything you can scrape together that is valuable for updates to the Codex Sorcerous and 40 tonnes of assorted crap off future amazon.

Killing you bricks that computer.

Anyone at all can become a wizard. The world you are being sent to can support about 4-500 of them before running into mana shortages.

That was mentioned as a warning, because if you teach everyone you will absolutely hit that limit before the 300 years are up barring a heavy commitment to birth control.

Build a structure out of gold/jewels/other valuable materials. Maintain it and just keep extracting the material as it refills. If that doesn't work on solids, melt it first. Make a tiny "lake" of liquid precious metals, and maintain that while an endless stream of metal flows out.

#+end_quote

If you're paranoid, you really shouldn't be trying to make money. You should be trying to hide and/or build an impregnable fortress. Here's a list of items to check for a paranoiac:

- Can you maintain your body so it doesn't need to eat/sleep/breath/etc.?
- Can you put a bag over your head and maintain the oxygen in it, thus generating an endless supply of breathable air?
- Can you maintain a lake of drinkable water? How small can you make it? What about other drinks?
- Can you build a structure out of edible material, like chocolate or biscuits, and maintain that structure while periodically taking bites out of it? If so, there's your endless supply of food.
- Attempt the same test with medical supplies and nutritional supplements.

If these tests work out, great! You now have the ability to keep yourself alive and healthy for the rest of your lifespan without needing to refuel or move from your spot. If you can maintain your body, you can even become ageless. Which means you can now construct a hideout to protect yourself. You have four alternatives, in order of increasing safety:

*Land Hideout*: Build a 1 kilometre radius labyrinth around yourself and maintain that. Fill it with all sorts of impenetrable walls and deadly traps.

Advantages: * Lots of available space. * Easy access to materials. * Can easily hire people to help you build your hideout. * Stable: Nothing short of an earthquake will dislodge your hideout.

Disadvantages: * If you hire people to help you build your hideout, then they know where it is. * Can't move your hideout: once it is discovered and publicized, everyone will know forever after. * People have a strong incentive to attack your hideout: you used great building materials for its construction no? Extracting them is sure to be profitable, especially since they regrow. * People have easy access to your hideout: it is just sitting there on the ground. They can just walk up to it.

*Air Hideout*: Build a floating island! You will need to get it in midair using something like a massive Zeppelin to carry it, but it is doable!

Advantages: * Hard to reach: humans can't fly. * Difficult to harvest: Let's say they chop a block of material off your hideout. How are they going to get it to the ground? They can't just drop it, it will break apart on impact. And once removed from your hideout it will regain its heavy weight since you are no longer maintaining it's floating nature. * Easy to kill intruders: Stop maintaining the part of the floor an intruder is standing on. Goodbye intruder!

Disadvantages: * EVERYONE CAN SEE YOUR FLOATING ISLAND! Secrecy = ZERO! * Fairly difficult to build. * Weaker defenses: the heavier the hideout, the bigger the Zeppelin needed to carry it to the sky. You will have to settle for whatever lightweight defenses you can bring.

*Water Hideout*: Build your hideout deep underwater, far far away from any landmass or other humans.

Advantages: * Awesome secrecy. * Actually not that hard to build: just build a large boat as your labyrinth, sail it to the middle of an ocean, and then sink it into an ocean trench. * Awesome defenses: thousands of miles of water pressure will kill any intruder before they reach you.

Disadvantages: * Did you check if you can survive the water pressure? This is kinda hard to check. * What about your ability? It maintains a hideout by regenerating it, not making it invulnerable. It is possible that the water pressure will just break it apart faster than it regenerates, and then you die.

*Space Hideout*: Spaccee! I'm in spacee!! Space. Launch your hideout out of the solar system. This is going to be very hard since you can't maintain the rocket while it is moving. You have to launch yourself off the planet, then wreck the rocket with some kind of self destruct to the moving parts in order to make it count as a wrecked vehicle that you can maintain. On the plus side, you can replenish your rocket fuel by maintaining a small fuel lake, so you won't need to carry a lot of it and can avoid the horrible exponential Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. Space.

Advantages: * Leave the earth and all the self-destructive humans behind. You will be safe even if they blow up the planet with nukes. * Ultimate secrecy: you are a speck of dust floating in the vast reaches of space, it is easier to win every lottery on earth than find you. * Almost unreachable: even if humanity somehow finds you, they will need to launch their own rocket, and it has to be much better than yours to catch up with you. * Movable hideout: repair your rocket and move if you are somehow discovered.

Disadvantages: * Hardest to build. * Risk of rocket explosion by accident/sabotage before you reach space. * Not secret while you are building it. Rockets are kinda visible. * Let's hope there are no aliens that can detect your hideout and find it interesting.

*** Defend a massive pharmaceutical and rare elements warehouse? As a pharmaceutical reseller or delivery service, you could sell everything for 5% off of current market prices and make an absolute killing. When prices go down, you drop yours as well and keep selling at 5% below market prices until profit margins are gone and we're down to just the cost of manufacturing and delivery - at which point your competitors go out of business and you keep the prices fixed at the most affordable they've ever been while still massively profitable for you.

On the rare elements side of thing, you could sell copper, gold and silver, but if you really want to make bank, sell refined uranium, plutonium, or thorium to nuclear power plants. Once you've got enough money, build your own power plant(s) and power lines and provide effectively limitless energy at low cost.

**** After thinking on this would that really help humanity? I know it would make you a lot of money but I understand the price of pharmaceuticals is heavily dependent on research which you can't get round. So no new drugs would be invented. It would make you a lot of money but only if you have no morals. Another option that I just considered would be that it states that a refrigerator could be maintained as cold which implies that energy and matter can be deleted as well as created. This opens up options of starting a disposal service by creating a small pile of substance and maintaining it at that size causing any additional material to be deleted. Also while nuclear reactors seem all very well and good, what about maintaining a electrically charged capacitator which is constantly draining into wires. You might be able to produce more power that way, the only downsize being if you left the area it would need to be restarted. In addition questions can be raised about the difference in mechanics between fluids and solids which cause a floating building to be held where it is and a floating pool to flow down. This may present issues living on other planets without disturbing everything unless it can be toggled. Also fun fact: I originally came up with this power to help create a dungeon theme park filled with impossible biomes and structures which I suppose another option if you just want to have fun.

Pharmaceutical companies spend [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/big-pharmaceutical-companies-are-spending-far-more-on-marketing-than-research/][more on marketing than on research and drug development]]. On average, [[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/how-much-drug-companys-spending-allocated-research-and-development-average.asp][18% of their revenues]] is spent on R&D. Since you've got manufacturing costs down to $0 and you can skip drug marketing, etc. you can do the R&D for peanuts, comparatively. Don't forget limitless supply of chemical compounds for research either - that will make some of the R&D exceedingly cheap.

You can't have all the power needed in the world coming out of a single capacitor. Power produces heat - put too much in one place and you've got melting cables and arcing electrical discharges over plasma. Also don't forget about transmission losses. You're better off supplying uranium or thorium to thousands of nuclear power plants so that power can be produced locally.

Can you clarify a bit more on these limitations? Especially the part about conservation of momentum, if we can't change that then it doesn't seem like we can change anything. Also, even if we can't stop or kill a cell immediately, can we slow it down bit by bit until it stops?

**** Basically, the cells presently have linear and angular momenta, some energy, etc. but you can set a goal state that doesn't alter these quantities, and the system will evolve towards that goal state, with the speed being influenced by how much momentum, how much energy, how 'large' the system is in a holistic sense.

You can promote goal states that naturally tend to have energy bleed off as they return to a natural state, but you won't have control of where that energy goes, since generally two cells aren't directly transferring energy between one another.

***** Oh! So your ability is some kind of future determinator, locking on to future timelines where random chance events just happen to shift the cell into the motion you want? Hmm...

You could probably get massive power generation by building wind power in an area and making the air currents constantly flow in that area, or by building hydroelectric dams and making the air currents pick up water from the ocean and drop it where your dam is.

You could also destroy any settlement on the coast by making the ocean air/sea currents move in hurricane-forming patterns and keep sending them in the direction of that settlement. Inland settlements may also be possible with tornado formations.

But actually it is probably best if you never use this ability. After all, altering large-scale earthly convection cells tends to drastically alter the biosphere, turning forests into deserts and submerging large chunks of land underwater are all very likely side-effects. Throw in the fact that you can't even control where the excess energy goes, and you're pretty much playing with fire in a house full of hydrogen balloons.

Storing all incoming energy would allow you to move without sound and nullify any impacts. Conservation is preserved because the energy does not dissappear and becomes potential energy.

Store heat to cool down in hot weather, use the stored heat to survive freezing temps.

Store incoming light to become a silhouette in the background. Release light as a flashbang or shoot off concentrated bursts of coherent light.

Eat everything whenever you want, get fat, use the stored energy for later... wait... no.. everyone has this one.

Use your reality warping to to "destroy" energy by teleporting it far away, which conserves it and doesn't involve extradimensional sources of energy. Similarly, "gain" energy by teleporting it from far away to where you need it.

#+begin_quote
  Conservation of Momentum (Linear and Angular)

Just make all matter teleport around instead of moving via conventional physics. They still have their momentum, it's just now irrelevant because they will always teleport to places according to the new rules of reality you wish upon them, regardless of their momentum.

#+end_quote

The first law is almost exactly the same as the law of conservation of energy, so just do that.

The second law "states that the total entropy can never decrease over time for an isolated system", so just make the system not isolated. Warp reality to allow energy and matter to enter and leave.

Now all the laws you listed are still conserved and not violated in any way. They have simply been rendered irrelevant in the face of your almighty reality warping powers.

I'm not very familiar with the physics beyond newtonian ones, but I'm assuming this is because of some laws that say the faster something moves the more energy it takes? You could just break those laws instead of the energy conservation one.
