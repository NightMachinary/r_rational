** I'm not surprised Cordelia got to the Chamber before them, but I am somewhat surprised she didn't greet them with a hail of arrows.

  The Holies, in particular, remained unconvinced that the Chosen would not embrace their cause.

Lmao how delusional are these people. White's sworn to Judgement, and they blatantly lied about Cordelia summoning demons and are trying to overthrow her for political reasons while the Dead King's invading. And White and the Witch just got back from the Northern front.

  “As for the second, it is stolen imperial property currently held in a Silver Letters warehouse,” the Webweaver said. “Which is why you will help me, Louis de Sartrons.”
#+end_quote

For a moment, I was like "Holy shit, Cordelia actually got her hands on a Hell Egg."

Edit: nvm, it says CH has soldiers with her. This is fine.

*** Her ordering a summary execution would cement the belief of her being a power-hungry Tyrant. Her having a formal, law-biding discussion under the watchful eyes of the White Knight (and by extension the Choir of Judgement) cements her reputation as the rightful ruler of Procer. Especially when the Priests try to fuck with Hanno and Judgement strikes them down as the heretics they are

**** Yeah, but I was worried about something along the lines of Balthazar immediately stabbing her and them burning the body. Probably would've been a good idea to do that from the beginning actually, just assassinate her in secret once the Augur is out of the way and elect Rozala. Actually kinda funny how badly they botched the coup all things considered. Anyways, soldiers being there should negate the risk of them immediately killing her though.

***** I was really hoping that Scribe would get offended when he implied that this was her work. That or she's playing both sides which is still plausible. At the very least, that would explain why her Hatchets are burning things to the ground without worry for the Goblinfire. They already know where it is of course (Unless that was a lie).

Also, Balthazar is /fucked/.

From the very moment he /monologued/ instead of grabbing Cordelia.

** The really disturbing thing is Malicia instrumentalizing the goblinfire munitions of Black's lost legion into harming the Accords through the narrative association of said goblinfire with the Black Queen. She's literally hacking the 4th wall to her interests.

** I'm calling it now - Balthazar is going to relate the goblinfire to demon summoning to defend himself. It's unlikely the Holies will be able to use the same excuse though.

Yes I know "nobody knows" about goblinfire being demon/devil essence - I think this is how the secret gets out - which will cull Cat's ability to use goblinfire in the future.
