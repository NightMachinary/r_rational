Disclaimer: I too spend a lot of time reading rational fiction (this is a throwaway account, I've been here since the beginning but I don't dare to post this with my main account)

I mean, some of these works are really, really long and even reading them takes a lot of time, and even more if you are writing them. I see these works more as a form of escapism, and not so much as something that would improve your rationality. This same question could be asked on any subreddit focused on fiction, but since this sub is about rationality, it's kinda ironic to adore rationality, and spend so much time on something which is kinda useless.

I get it that you can't act optimally 24/7, but I think there's a middle road somewhere.

How do you deal with this problem?


** Part of acting rationally (for me) is maximizing happiness. So on that front, I think creating and consuming rational fiction is a win. I could probably make some other arguments in favor of rational fiction, but they're tantamount to post facto justifications. I think that simply, "because I enjoy it" is enough. (I also think that in comparison to my other hobbies, writing is probably the most productive, given that something of at least marginal worth is created in the process.)

Edit: I also receive money through Patreon, but that's the lesser reason for writing (for me). If I /really/ wanted to make money from writing, I would probably work on polishing up my superhero erotica novel, since that's where the money is at. (I am aware that saying "money isn't really a motivating factor" is a really terrible way to get people to voluntarily give me money, but it's the truth. I /like/ having patrons, and I smile when I see an e-mail come in, but that's much more for status/ego reasons than utility-of-money reasons.)

I mean, I know I'm just parroting the sidebar, but having things happen for rational reasons instead of because of the force of plot, having conflicts and partnerships defined by beliefs and values instead of "good" and "evil", having the characters behave intelligently according to what they're aware of (or at least having narrative defense for their behaviors if it's something the reader would see is foolish), and having a consistent world are the defining characteristics of rational fiction.

And honestly, these values applied to erotica could work VERY well.

As soon as I read that question, I immediately thought of a candidate for an existing set of stories, [[http://pendorwright.com/journals/][The Journal Entries]] by Elf Sternberg (admittedly more rational than rationalist, and while science-fiction, extremely soft SF); plus the start of the background for an original story.

(... Okay, fine: Lowered robot costs and better conversational software leads to increased automation in many jobs, a not-very-successful job-protection measure mandates robots in human-replacing jobs must be 'clearly distinguishable' from humans, 'think of the children' morals leads most such robots to be sexless, one company experiments with a line of humanoid-animal chassis that include more anatomy, the protagonist manages to get hold of one that would otherwise be destroyed, and gets to work on jailbreaking the OS... and contrary to many other similar stories, this would /not/ a story about 'conscious' AI, but more about pareidolia and various of the basic drives that humans have evolved to have. ...

Customer service is also not all that it could be -- I've submitted multiple tickets and never gotten a human response in less than 24 hours. It's also not complicated, so a replacement would be relatively straightforward to build.

Right now I'm working out a requirements doc and evaluating whether I want to put in the effort to build it. Given that I'm a Patreon creator, I could dogfood the product.

***** You know what I think internet REALLY needs? Universal and convenient micropayment system. There should be a universal way to pay for an article/video in one click(embeddable button on any page). It could be a paywall that gives you access to the article, or a tip-jar kind of donations. Imagine there could be a system that everybody uses, like patreon, and a person has to enter his credit card info only once, and he can pay/donate to his favorite articles all over the web. These could even be microdonations, like 50 cents, and function similar to a like button.

Now that a lot of the people use adblock, ads are less and less viable, and this kind of system could be a solution. And it could totally compete with patreon, without straight up copying it's functionality. What do you think about that idea?

I am working on a fiction hosting website, and I'm thinking about a perfect way to monetize the content for writers(that would be benefitial and convenient for both writers and readers). So far I figured that an ebook store and an Apple-music kind of subscriptions are the best way to go, but I am very curious about the alternatives. If you have some clever ideas on how to monetize writing or how to improve patreon - I will probably be an early adopter.

Peter Singer or someone else from the effective altruism group might say that you could have saved dozens of lives with your earlier job if you had given something like 10% of your salary to charity. Then he might say, is your personal well-being really more important than the lives of those people? What would you say to him?

edit. If you're interested about Peter Singer's opinion on this, [[http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/magazine/the-singer-solution-to-world-poverty.html][this is a good article to start.]] His views have gotten milder and more pragmatic on this issue, but at some point he said that if you want to be maximally ethical person you should work so hard, and give so much to charity that you're suffering at least as much as those you're trying to help.

Well, the monk still has to do business with the economy. If the monk is completely self-sufficient (growing own food, etc) then he's not a drain on the economy. If he's not self-sufficient then he somehow has to be putting enough value back into the system to support himself. The one exception to this would be if he was on welfare, being supported at state expense, but typically you're only eligible for welfare if you're actively looking for work.

My experience with capitalism has been that this is not entirely the case, especially in the corporate world. It is very difficult for someone to get fired for laziness or incompetence, while at the same time, it's difficult for someone who works hard to get promoted. More than any other factor, it's /politics/ that gets people raises (and promotions) and /politics/ that gets people let go. The reason for this is largely that it's difficult to accurately evaluate performance, especially given human biases.

(This is without going into the other failures of capitalism, like its tendency towards local maxima instead of global maxima.)

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/2po/selfimprovement_or_shiny_distraction_why_less/]]

I'm gonna quote the relevant sections, you might as well replace "Less Wrong" with "[[/r/rational]]" in the text and it would still apply relatively well:

#+begin_quote
  Less Wrong is explicitly intended is to help people become more rational. -- Unfortunately, I think Less Wrong is a failure at instilling abilities-in-practice, and designed in a way that detracts from people's real-world performance.

  Work: time spent acting in an instrumentally rational manner, ie forcing your attention towards the tasks you have consciously determined will be the most effective at achieving your consciously chosen goals, rather than allowing your mind to drift to what is shiny and fun.

  What is the enemy of consciously directed attention? It is shiny distraction. And what is Less Wrong? It is a blog, a succession of short fun posts with comments, most likely read when people wish to distract or entertain themselves, and tuned for producing shiny ideas which successfully distract and entertain people. As Merlin Mann says: "Joining a Facebook group about creative productivity is like buying a chair about jogging". Well, reading a blog to overcome akrasia IS joining a Facebook group about creative productivity. It's the opposite of this classic piece of advice.

  Unfortunately, in this framework, Less Wrong is probably of negative value to those who really want to become more rational. I see it as a low-ROI activity whose shininess is tuned to attract the rationality community, and thus serves as the perfect distraction (rationality porn, rationality opium). Many (most?) participants are allowing LW to grab their attention because it is fun and easy, and thus simultaneously distracting themselves from Work (reducing their overall Work time) while convincing themselves that this distraction is helping them to become more rational. This reduces the chance that they will consciously Work towards rationality, since they feel they are already working towards that goal with their LW reading time.

So with that said ... no, it's not rational to spend time reading here if you're trying to optimize for becoming more rational. It's probably the best place to be if you were going to read /anyway/, and want to optimize that reading for thoughtfulness and science.

I responded with that research. I got more regurgitated stereotypes. I got annoyed at it and suggested that people should maybe do some research on their own.

** I agree with other commenters in the thread that rational fiction is mostly about entertainment.

"Rationality" part makes it more fun and enjoyable, but the goal here is to have fun, not to learn. Of course real textbooks in your field will always be better at teaching you things than fiction.

But besides rationality, I also value new interesting ideas and creativity. And this is where rtf wins.

You seem to be conflating "acting optimally" with "constantly doing something that other people would think is productive" and are making some assumptions about what people should value.

Short answer: rational fiction can be used to set up a self-sustaining reaction of motivation and energy that can THEN be turned toward actual, real progress in the larger world. Like all things, you can go too far with it, and it can turn into navel-gazing, masturbation, and lotus eating. But done in moderation, it can make you a better and more effective person than you would've been without it entirely.

** It's only irrational if you believe that a person should, let alone is capable of, being engaged in actively productive things at every waking moment.

Most people believe that there is room for leisure time in life - to do something solely because you find it enjoyable to do, whether or not it does anything at all to benefit you or expand your mind. If leisure time is an accepted thing, it is no better or worse to read enjoyable fiction, rational or otherwise, than to do any other form of enjoyable leisure.

** Having one's brain primed to take advantage of "munchkinable" opportunities in real life seems like something that is arguably high-value (provided those munchkinries are likely to be used for altruism, which rational fiction usually primes you for as well).

That said, I haven't convinced myself of this being the most-optimal use of time. My reason for spending time on reading seems to be addiction/enjoyment/escapism, which seems to be time that would probably go to other less productive activities if I didn't spend it here. At the margin, I should probably cut my Netflix watching time first.

***** I have not. I've done a little research, and it would be very inconvenient right now, especially since I still feel irrationally immortal because I'm young and healthy. I live in Sweden, and the laws here make it pretty difficult to set things up so your corpse gets released quickly. Wanting to hand your head over to a company to be taken abroad is not something the laws were designed to handle.

Also, it's expensive. And the companies I've looked at won't preserve you until the money clears, so life insurance isn't fast enough.

I'm currently spending between $3000 and $4000 for two people, but we could be spending a third of that. (I preferred Alcor over the Cryonics Institute for various reasons, but they're appreciably more expensive, plus I'm paying for more life insurance than needed.)

I'd like to get /everything/, to rewrite life in ways our ancestors would have considered acts of God Himself, to smash the things they thought were everlasting truths of the universe, to live lives with horizons that always expand rather than contract, to abolish the darkness our ancestors feared and fill the universe with light.

But there's really no hard guarantees, chances are difficult to forecast due to missing information and yet-determined causal links. Really my hopes and dreams are no better than escapist fantasies at this point: I can't live in them or plan on them, so what good are they?

** I think part of the appeal of rational works is that a careful reader might be able to figure out in advance what is coming. Even if they don't know exactly how the scenes will be delivered.

The closer the reader gets to figuring it out, the happier they are at the end. Like a mystery novel where all the clues are actually present, or a many-piece jigsaw puzzle with no reference picture.

If the writer manages to write an entertaining story that is also predictable in at least some of it's elements, it makes the rational reader happy, because they saw what was coming!
