  I had a heavy magnet in each hand, powerful neodymium ones from Earth courtesy of the backpack, with handles and padding on them so that I could maintain a good grip and muffle the sound of them as I slid them forward.

**** /Far/ weaker.

I work with industrial magnets in my day job, and for something like this, or like the Mythbusters example, you have both magnetic poles in direct contact with the steel so that the fields don't have to go through any air.

A layer of powder coating 6 mils thick reduced the strength of a 200 kg magnet to 80 kg. We tested the theory with a few layers of paper.

There's an exponential decrease in strength as you increase the distance. Thick padding, even with huge magnets, would not work well. Especially if his Anyblade ring contained steel; it's closer to the magnet than the train roof and would take his finger off.

What he wanted would be electromagnets and a battery pack. Place them silently, engage the magnet, move up, wait for the field to collapse, and lift silently. That would have been a good test of Amaryliss' engineering abilities, actually.

He assumed that handmaid should feel gratitude or they have some kind of contract which oblige handmaid to behave in most convenient way for him, or that most convenient way for him is the one most beneficial for handmaid. That is not how handmaid may see the situation. She is desperate, don't value her life much, and don't feel any obligations toward Juniper. He is just a an element of lucky circumstances which should be exploited to maximum. So she don't care about acceptable risks for Juniper or whatever. Juniper deserve it because he didn't paid much attention to handmaid motivations. If he had more empathy he may have got it and being more careful in his approach.

** I thought this was a decent chapter, although I admit I was initially disappointed we only got a single chapter. I like having 2-3 to read... I think I got spoiled, haha.

- Grak and touching butts... isn't that kind of the case? As I recall, the cloaca is an all-purpose organ for sexual activity, excrement, and laying eggs (at least in birds). So "touching butts" seems actually somewhat accurate.

- This was an interesting way to perform the heist, but not where I had hoped the story would go. I was soooo ready for a murder mystery interlude, especially since I recently finished relistening to /The Adventure Zone's/ "Murder on the Rockport Limited.

- If Joon hadn't been shifting his Level priority lower with essentialism, I wonder if he would have been having so many moral issues about killing those guards. On the one hand it fits his character and his past... but on the other, hey, cheap exp and plenty of rationalizations for it (like some of those mentioned in the D&D flashback).

- Not sure what the guard's deal will be. My guesses are, in order of what I think is likely, would be... handmaid's lover; handmaid's pheromone-slave; princess in disguise.

#+end_quote

The problem for me is. All those things happened in the past, so it actually doesn't build anything. It only displays something that was similar to current situation and often the information presented and Junipers moral struggle or thought process is already obvious from the story itself.

Like, this past chapters and guard fight in particular is clearly the author addressing complaints people had about "murderhobo ways of Juniper and the Party" or "not having interactions with non party members". That's fine on it's own, but with added D&D segment it felt like that point was hammered to intensely.

For example. Did the number of Tuung guard and guards in D&D story really needed to match, so Juniper would recall that particular time? We already had Aumann's guards and Juniper almost killing a kid at that point, he already had that moral struggle and as far as i remember he didn't recall the D&D story when. That struggle to kill frankly was forgotten for a good chunk of chapters and now resurfaced again with the same premise. It's not a bad thing, just shifts are to sudden at points. He goes from killing everything that stand in the way to the goal, to not killing when it would actually put him at huge disadvantage or in danger, morality seems to jump to extremes.

****** Well, currently how many people that don't know anything about tabletop or games are actually reading the story?

I don't mind the segments themselves, but they are placed at points there they are not really need at times. For example in this chapter segment about guards and morality served almost no purpose, because it was almost 1-1 recreation of what was happening in the story anyways, we even had the same number of guards in his D&D story. It wasn't a metaphor or Juniper remembering something similar under the circumstances it was almost like "Hey guys do you understand that this is a moral dilemma that is happening right now."

When they are told is also crucial, they seem to just be "shoved" into the story at times. If Juniper remembered some story after or before doing something it's one thing, it would feel more organic. But it was happening during action and disrupted the flow, it's not only this chapter that it happened in.

Joon thinking to himself.

After the D7D segment it was:

#+begin_quote
  “Mary thinks that we're the most important people in the world,” said Fenn.
#+end_quote

Which led to a whole separate conversation. So i felt confused. Did time pass, did Fenn talk to Mary, did the scene even change, what brought up this unrelated and sudden conversation? The last segment was them deciding to eat quietly, but after D&D insert the conversation jumped into a whole different topic.

**** Whoever did the pointing should get a pad on the back, it was pretty much the genre I was looking for.

I've been exploring [[/r/litrpg]] over the last week and have been largely unimpressed with what I have stumbled into in terms of plot/world coherence and a liberal use of the idiot ball. Maybe I've been spoiled by [[/r/rational]]. It's been a small sample though so I'll keep digging a little longer.

***** Good luck! I keep being tempted into reading serial fics (mostly from around here) but yeah, my impression from glancing through [[/r/litrpg]] is that while some of the features of effective litrpg are appealing to people who enjoy rational stories (per this sub's definition), often the authors aren't quite so conscious of the same ideals...

** So besides this being an actually interesting and good chapter.

Last time somebody said this to my points about Anyblade transformations.

#+begin_quote
  No. There is a DM around and he manages what the backpack gives. Seems obvious that he would say no to getting whatever with the sword too. Would be stupid anyblade anyway if you could just make a hammer with a blade somewhere. Or a nuclear bomb with a blade stuck in it.
#+end_quote

My response was that "Hammer with blade is pretty tame and doable."

Well, now we have this, so frankly it seems even more doable.

#+begin_quote
  I had the Anyblade as a ring

** It just occurred to me: if Gold Magic is such a problem, why hasn't anyone Excluded it? I mean, if excluding is easier than literally reclaiming all the gold in the world, then it's a way cleaner solution.

Would excluding Gold Magic (and therefore, in a sense, taking away /all/ the gold) count as completing Grak's companion quest? It'd certainly make robbing gold mages much easier.
