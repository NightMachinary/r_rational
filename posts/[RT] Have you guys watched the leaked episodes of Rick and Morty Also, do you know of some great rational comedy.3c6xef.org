I'm not sure if it's rational, but I *am* sure that you will love it. It was terrifying how good they are. I mean my god, Dan Harmon is a genius.

 

Since, as people discuss [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3c3oj6/meta_what_yet_unmentioned_qualities_of_rational/][here]], this subreddit is more about "the kind of things a certain kind of reader will like", I wanted to discuss this stuff. RaM and the last season of Community(also by Dan Harmon), are the only 2 things that I loved as much as I loved HPMOR.

 

Maybe these things are not so rationalist, but they have some quality about them that makes me think they belong here, and it would be pretty fun to talk about. They definitely deconstruct the hell out of the common tropes, and exploit unexpected consequences of events in some crazy ways.

 

When I watched it I felt some sort of a "cultural shock", because of how *new* and "fresh" the ideas and jokes are. You know that stale feeling that many movies have, like "I have watched this 1000 times already"? Well, RaM is the complete opposite of that, it is so much more /new/ than I could expect.

 

Also, do you know some other great "rational" comedy?


** I absolutely love Rick and Morty, and I do think it's the sort of thing that people here would like. Not just because it's good in general, but because if you're well-read as far as fantasy and science fiction go, you'll appreciate the deconstructionist elements. It's "rational" in that it takes some of the absurd premises of science fiction to their ultimate conclusions, but not rational in the sense that the world makes sense.

The Meeseeks episode especially. It deals with the so-called House Elf problem really well, and I think if you want a comedic take on that, you can't do better.

** I haven't watched S2, but I just watched RaM S1 and Rick (aka "Doc Brown from Back to the Future, if he was a drunk cynical jerk") is just amusing. I don't think it counts as rationalist but as more of an absurd parody.

"Not many people realize it, but science is more art than science."

Also, the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7HmltUWXgs][You pass butter (video)]] joke was amazing.

** I like that Rick is already a Munchkin Rationalist's wet dream in his insistence school makes you dumb because it teaches you how to blindly accept facts as "learning," along with some of his crazier escapades... [[#s][Spoilers for Various Episodes]] But even with that figured out, he really has no clue how to handle himself socially or emotionally. His relationship with Summer is tepid on a good day, Beth keeps him around mostly because of she kicks him out, she'll be without him again. Rick and Jerry wrote each other off a long time ago, and Rick is setting up Morty for a big falling out when Morty stops putting up with his adventure crap. [[#s][Spoiler for Penultimate episode of the season]] As much as he gives to science, it only gives so much back.

***** They're not formatted correctly. On this sub, spoiler tags follow the following format:

#+begin_example

Reddit is stupid, and doesn't have a standard site-wide spoiler format (though we use what I believe is the most common one).

*** Make sure to also check out Community. It is just as good =)

It starts out as a regular sitcom, but then goes nuts and meta(starting from the 2nd season), and turns from just good to freakin' brilliant.

** Binge-watched the first season a few weeks ago, and it's incredibly well done. The dialogue is amazing. Tons of great tropes and satire of said tropes. Rixty Minutes is just a masterpiece of an episode, and the Meeseeks one was also fantastic.

** I've never watched anything on Adult Swim, but I know some friends who loved Invader Zim (which I imagine may have a similar style to Rick and Morty, based on a 10 sec synopsis I read on Google?)

Initially I was excited to hear that Community was on Yahoo, but the first episode was underwhelming. Are you implying that it becomes the 'best evar' and I should pick it up again?

Re: other comedy... Dress to Kill by Eddie Izzard is a bit hypomanic in how he tangentially jumps from topic to topic, but I felt like I learned stuff about the Church of England and world history from his comedy. He's got a deconstructionist bent.

*** Yes, yes, absolutely, it does become the best thing ever.

I have almost stopped watching it during the first season, because it seems like a regular(but good) sitcom. But during the 2nd season and forward it becomes one of top 5 best things I have ever witnessed.
