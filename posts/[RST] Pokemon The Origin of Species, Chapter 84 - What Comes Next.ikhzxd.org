**** Yeah, at first I thought he was going to try to get ahead of the backlash by apologizing about the failure of the Mewtwo project before it was even found out, but turns out he was just going to sell them Hard Decisions on the premise of existential threats.

UPD. Another thought. I have only very fuzzy familiarity with Pokemon canon, mostly just osmosis, but it's my understanding that in the source material Red and Blue are rivals. I figure this may be the first step to how it comes to pass here, as Blue enthusiastically signs up for Giovanni-jugend.

I figured this would be aimed more towards establishing support for doing a Manhattan-style project again, except this time in the open and with international support. Get a Mewthree. Or a Mazda MX-3.

Or maybe laying the groundwork for pushing towards the Oak/Bill/Raiko reforms of science publishing.\\
Or pushing for human storage, again. [remember, that he executed a valuable researcher with a pokeball..... which I figured was definitely suspicious]

Mostly because, come on, how absurd is it that he loses to the player there? In a gym match at least there's the excuse of limiting his team to be as strong as the badge number or something, but if he'd used even the same team he uses in his gym battle there he would have wiped the floor with the player.

Not enough games do the "you can't win this fight" thing, imo, or worse they let you win the fight then have you lose in a cutscene. It acts as a very powerful experience when done right through gameplay, like in Megaman X.

As opposed to if he had apologized /on behalf/ of the people of the present who didn't do more, or try to provoke the people of now by what people of the future would think of them, a personal apology reads more like he fully expects to be found out eventually and wants to be seen by history as having been appropriately contrite.

Of course, he deliberately obfuscated the specifics for which he was apologizing to people who don't already know because he doesn't want to face the punishment by law and in public opinion yet.

** There's so much to unpack in this chapter! I think people have covered most of the big story bits so how about some appreciation of the writing?

I really love how the first scene break has an implicit “Red gets shooed out from the room because he 100% didn't consider following the nurse's instruction.” It's like a Noodle Incident except without voicing over-the-top silliness that would disrupt the tone; we're free to imagine as much silliness as we want, and what would otherwise be a pretty minor detail becomes a fun little pause for imagination :D

I don't know if it's intentional but the way Laura interrupts Leaf's thoughts was perfectly jarring. I think by having my own train of thought (reading) suddenly interrupted in the same way by the grammatical weirdness was a great meta way to help me identify my experience with Leaf's, counterintuitively improving my immersion.

The way that we've been lacking Red's narrative perspective is great; I enjoy reading his perspective a lot but it's associated with anguish that can get a bit too heavy. Plus, in this case we can already imagine some of the thoughts he must have had so, again, instead we get to see even more from what other people are experiencing relative to him (especially from MG's and Lizzy's perspectives in the preceding chapters).

** I hope that psychic trick of turning a pokemon against their trainer only works on pokemon that lost their conditioning (or never had it). Fighting against mewtwo is going to be difficult otherwise. Although fighting against any legendary tier is going to be difficult directly. Probably not how the story (could) end anyway.

Also with the worlds view on renegades Red probably should keep his ability to himself. Renegades turn their own pokemon against humans and people hate them for it. Turning other trainers pokemon against them? I guess that would be viewed as Super Renegade or something.

Maybe this ability is known in some psychic circles? Some of them might even kill to prevent this ability from being known before it starts a witch hunt against psychics. Makes the apprenticeship with Sabrina potentially dangerous.

/edit: As people have pointed out I forgot that the renegades pokemon turning against them was a lie. Red might be in big trouble.

** We finally get a chapter with the trio back together after, what, a year at least! I liked that Red and Blue seem to have ironed out their fight and are on the way to becoming friends like they used to.

Interesting that no one (except MG probably) have realized Red's involvement in killing the Renegades. 2 Pokemon suddenly turning on their trainers while you're being guided by a psychic who's known for /sakki/ should raise some alarm bells.

Excellent introduction to the Silph Scope. With it now in play the story can move on according to the games just fine. Blue's injuries seem to have put him off anything for a long time. Maybe a visit to Lavender Town for a bit of down time to recover?

Blue's monologue about how these major, earthshaking events can just happen and the whole world can be put in turmoil is an accurate representation of the corona crisis too. Completely blindsiding the world and all its leaders, leaving behind a lasting impact, fear and panic being spread. Whether it's a virus or weather gods, you can never plan for everything so it's hard to know exactly what to do.

Which makes Giovanni's speech much more interesting. Claiming that we have grown complacent might be a fair charge to a certain degree, but where's a successful alternative? His attempt to prevent the awakening by dealing separately with Teams Aqua and Magma failed, since we can't always trust human nature to do the right thing (Archie going off on his own). Even his psychic legendary-killer has now escaped, meaning that another option for humanity's protection has vanished into thin air. He says that he "will do better", but what /can/ he do?

A last point about Blue's "I'm not the main character" line. It's nicely meta, but also shows just how big the world is in the face of your ambitions. There'll always be a Brendan and May, people out there who started before you and are far ahead. There'll always be Ethans and Lyras who come after you with even greater potential. It's important to note how to deal with this, and it'll be interesting to see how Blue gets over his new "inferiority complex".

** Thoughts:

- Ugh, I totally missed that MG was actually lying about the magmar to cover for her vulpix (as opposed to the magmar actually being found to have done the deed on investigation) until I read the comments here. Learning that Red did cause the sandslash after Lizzy to turn on its trainer made MG's scenario more plausible in my mind...which was the whole point, wasn't it.
- On another note, Red's properly turning into a character with good battlefield presence like Taylor and Zorian. But I wonder how many other psychics in-story have done similar... It doesn't seem like it should be hard in terms of skill needed, but I haven't seen any hint of a similar strategy being implemented as a matter of course (e.g. one of Surge's gym's lectures mentioning it as a possible formation if a psychic is present). Then again, even Red isn't advertising that loudly what he could do - or what he actually did. Seizing control of pokemon to attack trainers /is/ kind of iffy.
- I definitely get the sense Blue is trying to over-compensate for being bedridden by jumping onto Giovanni's bandwagon. Before, he usually tended to be the kind of character to lead the pack. I hope this change in character isn't a sign of anything too bad.
- Kind of unrelated, but I wonder how Bill's doing. His house and lab is near enough to the ocean to have been affected, I think, nevermind the earthquakes and deluge of rain. I'm not sure if any of the tech he put into them had anything to do with defending his house against natural disasters. Man, just imagine if on top of all the bad news in this chapter Bill lost significant research progress on stuff like the tangela regeneration capabilities he wanted to give to humans.

*** Yeah, I think Lizzy also lied about the Sandslash killing Maddie.\\
If Red could have done that, why wouldn't he have killed Roark with his Golem as well?

He probably used Lizzy's Mareep, as that would have been the last thing she'd use against the Sandslash and she probably really did run thru her whole belt slowing it down.\\
Though.... maybe that was the first pokemon, as she used Flash to blind it at first.\\
Come to think of it, I don't see how you could unleash the killing instinct of a.... sheep.

And then Red coordinated psychically with them after the fact, without involving Leaf, whilst the three of them made their way out.\\

** a bit late to this chapter, but felt like I wanted to say stuff about it anyway, because I haven't really commented on the Titans arc here before, and despite not being titled as part of that arc it's hard to read this chapter as anything other than the encapsulation of its themes. Some stuff that jumped out:

#+begin_quote
  "I had all these goddamn /plans,/ Red... and now I'm stuck in here while the world spends who knows how long recovering from shit no one saw coming!"
#+end_quote

the climate change allegories in this chapter in particular have already been commented on, but this line in particular snapped the whole thing together for me in light of current events. Makes me wonder how much of this stuff was planned in advance, and how much has been swayed by things that've happened in real life

#+begin_quote
  "It's like finding out... I feel like, I look at those videos, those pictures of them riding those pokemon... and it's like realizing I'm not the main character."
#+end_quote

this line really landed for me too - most of the criticism of the Titans arc has revolved around the fact that it focuses so heavily on characters we're not invested in dealing with events that have received zero foreshadowing, but I found that to be the arc's biggest selling point. I think I'm on the record as really praising the Stormbringer arc for managing to be on the same level as Worm's Leviathan arc (which is its main point of reference, right?), and obviously it's hard to top that, but these last few chapters have had a lot of standout moments (everything with Mewtwo in particular is the icing on the cake). In spite of the Worm comparisons, I still think this story is pretty much entirely unlike anything I've read before, and I can't wait to see where the heck it's going from here

  Blue winces in sympathy, then turns back to Leaf with a wary respect. She put a lot of trust in Red, using her pokemon on a stranger because he told her it was a Renegade. That's even less clear cut a justification than the last time she did it, but luckily they could check this one's pokemon to verify...
#+end_quote

I don't remember if it's been on-screen. Maria was shown, though.

It feels like:

- Blue remembers something
- Blue wasn't always unconscious
- They did directly attack a renegade nearby

Argument pro is this line in the previous chapter.

#+begin_quote
  There's a sudden surge of /horror-fear-despair/ and then the presence retreats for a moment. Maria stops running, trying to sort through what she felt, assuring herself that Lizzy can't be dead, that she's not too late.
#+end_quote

But it can be that Nidoqueen. Or Blue losing consciousness.

And things just continue to adds up.

- Maria never mentioned someone guides her and reassures her it's not her fault that the renegade was killed
- Lizzy never mentioned this guiding thing either

It looks like Red just make them all forget this. All except for Blue. Notice how Red asked if he remembers anything.

So, my thoughts on what happened: Red killed that renegade. They all meet at some point. At that point there is no multiple reds, as seen in this chapter, where he's always gaunt. He just killed a man using a pokemon as a weapon.

Yet even unpartitioned Red don't want to die. But he's Red, and I'm not sure he will just make them forgot at one point unwillingly. And I'm even less sure everyone else want him to be branded.

So they allowed to temporary/permanently block their memory. Mostly because police psychics.

But! All of these from a single line based on an event I don't remember happened, and confirmation bias. Did I forgot something?

EDIT:

I also like how it's obvious for Laura that Leaf actually could've done something fishy.

#+begin_quote
  "No, Leaf," Laura says, voice firm. "You can hand him the containers to look through and all that would lead to is him asking about other containers you own, then checking your PCs to see what you might have transferred recently. You have rights for situations exactly like this." She stands as she turns back to the detective. "Get a warrant if you can, or take her word for it. Either way, we're expected at the hospital to relieve my son from a bedside vigil."

**** If Maria and Lizzy never tell anyone about voices in their heads, maybe he doesn't. But come on, they've met at some point and I bet they do talk about it. Red should talk with Leaf how he guides them. Even if he omitted he sakkied Magmar, Leaf is not dumb. Lizzy is aware about killer intent, and she's not dumb either.

Yet not one of them mentions this. Leaf never mentions Red guides remote party to safety, Lizzy and MG don't mention about mystery psychic help. Especially MG don't mention about relief that it wasn't her fault.

OK, maybe with all the stress they didn't have time to talk, and Leaf was distracted with her own lesser crime. Maria may not be aware about Red's ultimate move, she wasn't in Blue's group when it was revealed. Red is miserable enough to brings this and just waits while some of them figures it out. Also, it's not like he know how to block someone else's memories, even if he knows well enough how to block his own.

So, stressed everyone, private-y Maria, distracted Leaf and exhausted Red. Still not in character for Lizzy not to share this or not connect the dots. It's plausible she understand it all and hide as well, because, again, it saved MG and Glenn. We didn't see their thoughts anyway. Red might hope they didn't guess they know and definitely won't bring this up first.

So, yes, OK, it's plausible Red didn't wipe their memories. And late arrival thought, mind block may as well be quite visible for are psychics.

You know you're a good investigative journalist, when you don't even need to publish a story to completely cripple the global underworld's recruitment ability. Detective Hirai can now check the timeline and see for himself, whether Leaf forced Giovanni's hand, making him even more of a suspect. It should also be a matter of public record, that he was the one that secured a renegade's right to a private last conversation. [unless Giovanni lied about that to make himself more sympathetic to the Weedle-killer]

If Hirai then asks Leaf again, she's likely to bring up, that he illegally used a psychic on her to protect that secret. [which leads to what psychic you could hire for that job, if not a Renegade]

​

Oh.... Giovanni is in trouble :)EDIT: Actually, that warning probably didn't impede the process much. Not sure, why I was thinking that.\\

*** “The renegade, I caught, have they been executed yet? I haven't gotten any messages after the sentencing.”

Should be "has he been executed yet". Unless Leaf sometimes uses genderneutral pronouns at random, just to mess with my head.

-------

This one is actually quite evil, since I was thinking the entire time, that the gender was ambiguous, and didn't notice that there were *three* renegades actually killing people.

I was confused, because Leaf used Joy to subdue one renegade and then a renegade's sandslash.

But I jumped on that "they" and thought that Sandslash-Maddie was the one that got captured and since it was a "they" and it was a Sandslash staying at "her body" was apparently transgender.

So I looked up the first Mewto-Interlude and thought..... aha, Maddie used to go by the name Darin and worked as a (probably psychic or sensitive) comforter, and was implied to be a closeted transwoman ten years ago! Giovanni is such a tolerant employer!

So I patted myself on the back, thinking I finally noticed something!

Then I finally properly parsed this line and had to do a double take.....\\
“No. Just... this organization that employed renegades might find out one was taken alive, right? Even though he's dark, they might try to kill him before he can give anything away.”

This can't be Darin, since Darin couldn't possibly be dark!

Then I reread the Ramin-chapter and Leaf's account and finally figured out, that Joy put Roark to sleep, Maddie's Sandslash killed Maddie (or a saki'd Pokemon of Lizize did) and then Joy put the Sandslash to sleep.\\
Archer either died during the cave-in or managed to escape.\\
[The dark renegade can't be Archer, since Archer can "pull strings", therefore must be a public figure of some sort, which Interpol would have mentioned]

---

So please, don't use genderneutral pronouns. Or at least not at random. They make everything bloody confusing.

  “I'm alright, just... trying to make sense of all this.” He looks between them. “Red says each of you fought a renegade... what happened?”

  “No exciting story for me, Joy saved us,” Leaf says with a shrug. “Again. If it ain't broke, right? Red could feel his pokemon coming, so I had her sing just as they opened a hole in the wall to get us out.”

  Blue blinks, then glances at Red, who's staring at the ground. “How did you know?”

  “I could feel it, killing other people,” Red murmurs without looking up. “It was... pretty bad.”

  Blue winces in sympathy, then turns back to Leaf with a wary respect. She put a lot of trust in Red, using her pokemon on a stranger because he told her it was a Renegade. That's even less clear cut a justification than the last time she did it, but luckily they could check this one's pokemon to verify...

#+begin_quote
  She was here just yesterday, before she went to visit Blue in the hospital, and even though that was to testify in the justified use of a pokemon to stop a renegade, even though Red's mom wasn't with her, it was still much less nerve-wracking defending herself against a potential Renegade charge than it is being called back in for something else.
#+end_quote

The renegade, Leaf captured was dark. Red didn't tell her to use a Pokemon on a stranger, but on a Pokemon which could just have been a rampaging wild for all Red knew.\\
So why would Leaf even have to justify Pokemon use to stop a renegade, when she had no idea, there was a trainer controlling it?\\
But Blue doesn't know that the renegade was dark and just assumes he wasn't. [which is fair, most people aren't dark, therefore Red can sense them]

But then again, Ramin announced himself before "rescuing" people, so it would make sense that Roark used the same tactic.\\
And that's what must have happened, because otherwise Leaf wouldn't have to justify Pokemon-use against a renegade at all, since it would have been unintentional.

But then Blue couldn't know about that tactic either nor could he have known that it was possible to shout through the wall, since he was unconscious for the whole adventure.

So Blue was right, but only by complete accident.

*** I'm not sure I follow the confusion, but in case this is it... Blue's guess is based on what he knows would have happened afterward; even if Leaf just had Joy use Sing on a pokemon, a person was affected too. After that the person would have to be tied up and presented as a Renegade, which Leaf would have to explain the justification for. Does that make sense?

**** This is just quibbling and wondering about the legal situation and how Leaf and Red would have described the situation after the fact, for which we also don't fully know, which of our merry group of friends coordinated to get their stories straight (it that happned at all) to protect Red's ability to turn Pokemon into deadly weapons. I also don't think that Maddie's sandslash turned on her, since it probably likes its trainer just fine even without conditioning [unless Maddie never fed it Pokepuffs or whatever].\\
I think it's more likely that one of Lizzies Pokemon was saki'd and Lizzie and MG both collaborated to lie about it. And if they collaborated to minimize legal hassle and suspicion, why not do the same with Leaf.

So..... it's not clear that she'd have to defend herself for "justified use of a pokemon to stop a renegade", since she was using Joy against a dangerous, seemingly rampaging Pokémon, not against a renegade.\\
There just happened to be a surprise renegade behind it falling asleep, which wasn't apparent before she used her pokemon. [unless Roark loudly announced a fake rescue like Ramin and announced himself]

You wouldn't have to justify an unintentional AOE attack against someone, who you couldn't have possibly known was there.

And then seeing that the person was obviously the trainer behind the rampaging pokemon (what pokemon, by the way?) hence a renegade, you'd tie him up without any help from a pokemon, which you'd also not have to justify.

****** Yeah, I figured that would be the case.\\
But Blue really shouldn't just assume that tactic, he's never seen.

And I think the scene shows that Red and Leaf didn't coordinate their story at all. Whereas Lizzy and Maria did (possibly with Red telepathically). Because there was no reason to admit of intentionally attacking a renegade here, when you could have sold a plausible story.

I guess, I'm just really pointing out all the (possibly unintended) story inferences one can draw from scenes like that.

Maybe I'm overdoing it, but I'm trying to pay more attention to details when reading, instead of my default of just skimming over numbers, forgettable Japanese names (does Japanese only have like ..... five consonants?!) and Pokemon past generation 3.

It's a lot of fun.

#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure you /would/ have to justify an unintentional AOE attack against someone, if only with just "I did not see a person there and could not reasonably have forseen that a person was there". If the unintentional AOE hypothetically happened, the attacked person could probably accuse the attacker of being a renegade as soon as they recover, so a Ranger inquiry to get the sequence of events straight would probably be made as a matter of course.

I think a fair comparison is if you set some traps in a forest covertly and a person ended up being hospitalized for it. There probably should be a police investigation to make sure it wasn't an actual murder attempt.

That said, this probably isn't the case here. From the quote you initially posted:

#+begin_quote
  “No exciting story for me, Joy saved us,” Leaf says with a shrug. “Again. If it ain't broke, right? Red could feel his pokemon coming, so I had her sing *just as they opened a hole in the wall to get us out*.”
#+end_quote

And also consider Ramin's own pattern of calling out to trapped survivors, talking to them, and getting them out before killing them. So in this case Leaf should have known that there was someone there to ostensibly get them out, the guy probably even talked to them, and still hit them with Sing, putting her trust in Red's side of the story. That absolutely would have to be justified to the Rangers.
