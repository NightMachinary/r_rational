** I appreciate getting an inside view of the Spirit Block. We've heard a lot about it from the Principians, all about how it was a masterstroke that won them the war, so I like seeing a Shenti man who had his heart ripped out by it. Not that it sounds like Han Yong was a very good person even before the Spirit Block, but still. It's the principle of the thing.

More creepy First Scholar weirdness is always welcome too. One of the things that I find really compelling about the world of Pith is that it combines the grounded feeling of its realistic political dynamics and rigidly constructed magic system with weird, unexplainable shit like "Oh, yeah, that mountain is totally cursed, you can tell by the red fog and the fact that nobody's ever come back alive." I love how everyone just accepts this stuff and moves on, because what else can you do? And when people /don't/ just accept it, when they decide to climb the cursed mountain, I love that too, because it brings into focus the vast, strange inhumanity of this stuff in a way that verges on cosmic horror.

And on that note, I noticed something that, well, I'm not sure if I'm reading too far into this, but...

#+begin_quote
  And all the plants had Piths.

  ...

  Tian looked at him. “/They're all headless./”

  Han felt around. /She's right./ Among all the ancient skeletons nearby, none of them had a skull. There weren't even decapitated craniums, or bits of jaw scattered around the area.

  It was like their heads had all vanished. Not a typical way for people to die in battle.

I really hope those two things are completely unrelated, because if they're not then that's absolutely horrifying.

*** It's not really paced for a web serial. I loved the hell out of it when I binged it on first discovery, but it's not easy to keep motivated for new chapters. I think this will do better once it's complete.

**** I think in general any web serial that has a high level of anxiety, dread, and suspense tends to suffer a little bit from the sporadic release. I had to drop Pact about halfway through when I had caught up just because anxiety it would induce. Once it was released it felt much better.

***** Thank you for explaining why I dropped Pale despite enjoying it as much as (if not more than) Pact.

****** Pale's not as bad, but I'm starting to get a bit of that dread as well at this point. So I'll probably finish it once it's done.

** I can't help but feel like the fact there's a height limit on the world as well as a depth limit might be starting to come into play now.

Also the whole oracle snake thing...well, it was always suspicious, and I have no idea what EXACTLY to make of it now, but having one show up here is probably bad.

** This story is as good as Worm with respect to worldbuilding and character development. Better even, because its not as grimdark and hopeless. I never understood why people like grimdark stories, unless they enjoy torturing themselves.

*** People don't like grimdark necessarily. They appreciate a realistic take on existence, where everyone is doomed to die, no matter what.

And then the author gives us characters like Chevalier, and we feel good regardless of our fate.

It's basically like The Road. Existential purposeless, but with a dash of fleeting grace.

But isn't that just real life? Why do people go out of their way to read something that is representative of the worst parts of real life? Idk about anyone else, but I read web serials and fantasy genre to escape from the monotony of depression of the real world, not have it rubbed in my face. It just doesn't make sense to me.

***** I've never understood it either. Just read some non-fiction accounts of real life, or dramatized real life stories if you want grimdark. The only thing reading things like The Road has given me after the fact is rage and listlessness.

****** I don't mind grimdark, but I think a lot of problems I think people and myself have with it is when a novel is grimdark purely for the sake of being grimdark. That being said, even then some people just find it too depressing or numbing.

For example, Pact is a very grimdark story, but even though there are reasons for it, it will still bum people out because the MC is getting fucked for nearly 80% of the story. But I like it because it can lead to some really interesting characterizations with how they overcome their world.

Blake isn't my favorite character, but of all the books and series I have read, there are not many that I respect like him or well, the idea of him. He is sheer determination, refusing to give up in a world where everyone, including his family, friends, the universe, and even himself are out to fuck him.

I think that's the payoff. But it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea.

** I just started reading this last week and I've binged all the way to the end and went looking for discussion. Holy shit. I haven't had a reading experience like this since /Worm/ (and, later, /Unsong/). /Pith/ actually feels polished, too - I could imagine this in print with just some editing. Time to badger everyone I know into reading.

The only upsetting thing is that I didn't realize what the update schedule looked like while I was reading... going back and seeing one every two weeks/once a week makes me so sad. I know, I know, people have lives and jobs and can't just write nonstop for me to consume their story, but /god damn/ I need more.

I think this might be one of those things like Kill 6 Billion Demons where I should forget about it for a while and come back when it's done, or I might just go crazy. Speaking of which, been about a month since I checked over there...

** really late but I've been catching up and this chapter was worth commenting on, even if its just for me.

the peak is so fucking bizarre. everything to do with the great scholars is so fucking bizarre, and I love it. I hope Han didn't release some monstrosity here, either with him breathing out the gas, or him getting infected by the gas, or whatever the hell was in those balls... speaking of the balls, how did the tortoise know that these will be important?
