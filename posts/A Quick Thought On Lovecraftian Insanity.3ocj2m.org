** If a pattern of floor tiles has ever made you dizzy, you should understand this idea. But it isn't mentally processing the physical shape that does the long term damage--though it surely doesn't help. It is an effect from the beings themselves, disrupting the functioning of your physical brain, as it gets worse when they turn their horrible multitudinous gaze upon you.

My explanation would be higher-dimensional electromagnetic effects scrambling your brain like an egg in a microwave when they use their Old One 7-D radar on your very being. Long term effects are obviously to follow even with a brush with such multidimensional horrors.

** Lovecraft was writing mostly for himself, and based heavily on his own phobias- fish, foreigners, old buildings. So a big part of the horror was based on his personal phobias.

There's a telepathy issue too. It's fairly common for these entities to contact humanity via some method, pushing alien landscapes and values and feelings into their brains. This discordant telepathy causes many issues.

So, if your brain is aligned right or wrong- due to science, genetics, alien influence, whatever, these aliens push their brains into yours which predictably drives you insane.

The situations they put you in are often horrific too.

Just imagine that the cave is your mind and the train is alien thoughts.

To fill the gap, and join the rest to Man, Th'Olympian host conceiv'd a clever plan. A beast they wrought, in semi-human figure, Filled it with vice, and called the thing a Nigger.

When millions died from causes no-one could comprehend (and which obviously didn't understand us), when Aristotelean or Newtonian physics were the norm, both being outliers/vague allusions to General Relativity. Stuck in a universe where logic is provably unprovable.

Not to mention some of us here are trying to create the closest thing to a Lovecraftian God that fits in our universe - a post-singularity AI - to prevent the summoning of a merely apathetic one which would kill humanity or worse.

There is exactly one way the real world is. Lovecraftianism is an /attitude/, not a coherent space of counterfactual worlds. Literally everything can be taken as Lovecraftian if you just apply the /attitude/ to it that /anything slightly different from you, the author, is A HORRIBLE XENO YOU JUST CAN'T SHARE A FUCKING UNIVERSE WITH/.

I mean, for God's sakes, if they can turn /My Little Pony/ and /science/ into Lovecraftian horror, then I think that's solid fucking proof that Eldritch Cosmic Horror is actually just the choice to scream and cry at the universe for not being optimized to your particular personal liking.

****** Most people who believe in a god, believe it's theirs, like the cultists who summon chuthulu. yes, if you asked them, objectively, if each of the actions their god does are evil, without context, they might call them evil, still they delude themselves it's good. If they are a good person, the good afterlife awaits, with their all powerful god or gods that does things that they'd curse mortals for. Woe unto those who mistake evil for good.

[assuming psudeo-abrahamic god now. not getting into massive pantheons or reincarnation cycles]

the others don't care. might makes right, and God is the mightiest of all. if you follow his rules, you're safe. old testament, it was probably terrifying, but now, the rules are actually plausible enough to ensnare people. He promises everything people want, immortality included, and if God were real, serving him might be the most rational action for a sociopath. He's irredeemaly alien and mostly malicious to humanity, but if you play by his rules, you can have eternity for yourself, and he's the monster protecting you.

Part of the lovecraftian fear is it doesn't have rules, really. there isn't a way to escape, isn't a way to protect yourself. not like demons, with circles of salt, or fae and cold iron, vampires and (sunlight, OCD, holy water, fire). not like god and angels, who if you follow his rules, you'll get the afterlife, even if it doesn't protect you now.

Lovecraft's gods are unpredictable, and uninterested in ruling. That's the difference, if there is one.

******** My family is Hindu - I'll give you some examples:

1) if you bother a sage who has spent years meditating, their gaze turns you to ashes (not as punishment, just because they've had their eyes closed for so long that their gaze holds tremendous divine power).

2) Shiva and Durga both have "chaotic" forms (Bhairava, Kali). I've heard one myth where she's angry that a guy saw her naked, so she destroys the previous universe in a rage. (and there's an entire story of how she was made to calm down and not destroy the gods themselves)

3) I definitely know a few - not many, but a few - people who have a superstitious fear of not doing puja (because they think they'll be punished by god if they don't)

4) Holy men, Hijras, and other "magical" people can both bless and curse you.

Those are just the examples I've personally been in contact with. If we delve into academic links on Hindu, Greek, Norse, the various surviving hunter gatherers, I'm sure the number of examples will expand beyond count. Pretty sure Magic is not safe (which seems to be a default human perspective) usually creates Holy is not safe. Although I suppose Christianity has a more rigid good-magic vs evil-magic perspective than others.

When one of his appointed kings refused to finish a genocide, El stripped him of his rank and then had his prophet finish the genocide himself. Holy is not safe.

Anthropomorphisation is in the map, not the territory. That we've managed to make humanoid gods out of natural events beyond our comprehension, and even a single one which does literally everything even when a sane person would consider if to be working at odds with itself, is a testament to our ability to anthropomorphise and deal with things even when it doesn't fit and we don't understand them at all.
