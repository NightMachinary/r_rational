Hi! Recently I've created a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/37bzof/what_features_should_a_perfect_platform_for/][thread]] asking for your ideas on developing a great platform for hosting fiction/fanfiction.

Now I want to give you an update on my progress - I've created and deployed the first version! =)

You can check it out here: [[http://fictionhub.io/]]

It is still an early version, and there's a lot to improve, but I would really like to know what you think about it. I want it to be the best place for people from this subreddit to post their stories, so any ideas/suggestions/questions/feedback would be very welcome!


** I would suggest a very strong line between fanfiction and original fiction, if your site is specifically designed with writers in mind. Some writers won't touch a fanfiction site with a ten-foot-pole. Separate domain names would probably be best.

**** Fan fiction, at it's very core, is fans encroaching on the intellectual property of authors. Some authors don't care. Some authors care a great deal. Most authors only care when it's shoved in their face, or used in an x-rated manner.

However, quite a few authors with hopes of eventually publishing, wouldn't want their names associated with a fanfiction site. Imagine it to be something like having stupid things on Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, or other media when you are looking for a normal job. An editor poking around on the internet seeing what you've written in the past might come across your work on a fanfiction site, and plonk your name into file thirteen, just by association.

If the editor is reviewing your submission, and it's the most awesome story since sliced bread, they probably won't /plonk/ you. But if it's a typical first novel, with warts, that they are not quite sure about, /plonk/ might happen if they see you were active on a fanfiction site.

** Also, the top level of the site being devoted to actual content is a bit irritating. I want to choose what I look at. IMHO, the top level, the entry page, should be news, search options, and utility options.

** I would say to take a look at Archive of Our Own as you continue to develop this. There are little flaws (usually relating to particular functions, like the inability to send PMs) but the basic layout is great and it's easy to navigate.

Whereas this... Well, as it stands it looks like a clunky Wordpress-styled site. Sorry.

EDIT: Some Googling for "sites based on Archive of Our Own" just let me know that it made TIme's 50 Best Websites of 2013. Interesting to see that it was on their radar.

*** To be explicit: Ao3 is open source.

Somewhere there's a note about a major developer who was burning out on device compatibility. I.e. getting demands for perfection across too many devices. I suspect you'll see very clean frontend code (html etc).

** And one last comment.

FIRST. Understand that the content of the following site is heavily non-rational. I actually post Set In Stone there as well as in Wordpress.

Take a look at [[http://www.royalroadl.com/][Royal Road]]

IMHO, The navigation in some parts is painful, and the editing features are painful (I no longer edit anything there, once it's posted, it's done), but the basic structure of the site is just about ideal for fiction writing and reading.
