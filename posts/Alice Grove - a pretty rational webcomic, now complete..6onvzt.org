*** Oh shit, he wrote something besides QC? I loved that comic for years, still do, but ultimately just stopped following it since its storyline, while amusing, was not compelling enough to survive the Natural Purge of webcomics that I couldn't remember to check up on at least once a week after I started writing again.

If he's written something else though, and with a completed story at that, I'll definitely check it out, thanks for posting it!

**** I did the same thing. At some point my daily webcomic routine got eaten up by Reddit and I stopped following QC. Always enjoyed it though.

Sounds like this one is binge worthy, so that's exciting

** Oh sweet, didn't hear about it until now. It's just the right length for casual bingeing too.

If Jeph Jacques happens to read this, I'd like to congratulate on a story told well. The story itself is interesting and only enhanced by the chosen medium of a comic.

I managed to pick up on the influence of Banks' work on the comic right from the start, so kudos for pulling that off so well too.

*** It's annoying to read on mobile, yes.

The only way I found was going on the archive page, and opening each strip in turn (new tab, or using the Back button).

The desktop theme has better navigation.

*** I think that's intentional. This is a story that wants to drop you into the world and slowly reveal its facets to you as the plot unfolds. I can confirm, all your questions get answered and everything makes sense. There's some comedy, some drama, some surrealness, some character study, and some transhumanist sci-fi that all becomes clear after a while.

** Great comic, but I disliked the ending. Why did Alice find the AI intervention (or was it the phrase "humanity is going to awaken"?) so amusing? There's something missing here - maybe just one strip.

*** Alice has been "serving" humanity to atone for her actions in the war. She deliberately does not share technology with them because she fears it will be bad for them.

Recently she found out that 1) some humans really don't appreciate her anti-technology policy 2) the AI that she thought were completely apathetic to humanity has been doing more for humanity than her and 3) they did that by undoing all her efforts to keep humanity in the dark age.

Basically she worked so hard to prevent Ardent from fucking up a delicate status quo, but it turns out there are already hundreds like him all over the world.
