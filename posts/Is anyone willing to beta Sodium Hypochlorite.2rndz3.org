So I've got to the stage now where the first story arc is plotted out and I'm starting to write chapters.

Unfortunately I'm fairly new at this so my writing leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically, I need someone to read through the chapters as I finish them and tell me what they did and didn't like.

Any of you up for the job?

EDIT: okay I now have 3 betas. I think that's probably enough.


** Nooooooo! I missed out on being a beta for a new rational story? Obviously the solution is to obsessively-compulsively check [[/r/rational]] even more!

Good luck with your story.

*** Bleach is filled to the brim with stuff that would make it perfect for a rat!fic.

Mod souls, Zanpakuto, Hollows, Quincies, afterlifes, Scientific study of spirits, take your pick.

And then we have people like Aizen, Urahara, Ichibei, Uuryu, Mayuri, Barragan, Juha Bach, Xcution, and Yamamoto, who could all /easily/ be turned into rational antagonists.

To be honest, it was hard to pick a small enough number of plotlines that the story would be coherent.

**** Oh! I thought you were suggesting someone "beta" the /drinking/ of Sodium Hypochlorite. This makes significantly more sense.

***** For anyone else like me who had to look up the common name for Sodium Hypochlorite, it's the chemical name for bleach. Drinking bleach is probably a bad idea.

P.S. Does anyone know why the manga is named Bleach? I can't see any connection to the title...unless the author is thinking of brain bleach?
