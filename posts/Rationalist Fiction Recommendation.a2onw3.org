What's some good rationalist fiction to read for someone who has already read HPMOR, Metropolitan Man and the entirety of the Sequences?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The Reckoning]]

The single best ratfic I have ever read. Alien technology (including The Ellimist/Crayak) have logical, internally consistent rules, Visser Three is competent, and the Animorphs are actually trying to win.

Some parts are extremely dark, but it does an amazing job of staying true to the spirit of canon and the characters' core personalities.

*** Thanks for saying why you're downvoting. Would you have downvoted if I had explicitly asked about audio content in the op?

*** [[https://www.audible.com/series?asin=B01M1RDL6W][The Bobiverse]] is a fun series about a uploaded von-neumann probe. Think passages of the void, but add in a heavy dose of programming humor. I found it hilarious.

**** I never thought about this as rationalist, but it's a rollicking good time, and I basically read each book in its entirety the day I bought it. They're not hard to love.

Also, nobody ever holds the idiot ball, and implications are taken seriously.

You didn't specify what kind of stories you were looking for (which settings? Which genre?) so I just went ahead and named the best one :>

In all seriousness though, you should check out the rational reading list on goodreads: [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/100705.Rational_Fiction]]

There's also useful overview sorted by media on tvtropes: [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic]]

If you want more specific suggestions, you'll have to tell us what you're looking for exactly.

*** I have a strong bias in favor of things available in audio book format. As a consequence of various lifestyle factors I have limited time for reading from a screen.

**** Maybe try The Martian? I've heard it has a good audiobook, and it at least counts as rational if not rationalist
