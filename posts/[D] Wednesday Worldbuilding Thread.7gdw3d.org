Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So I made an [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/193mUyuiNWJxGYWQw9GS4yX-gGMJle5WFe_1iXxWx6AY/edit?usp=sharing][alignment system]] to be used to replace alignment systems in game systems that use them (mostly D&D and Pathfinder come to mind).\\
How functional do you think this is? and what other ideas have you seen (or come up with) for how an alignment system can work in games that are pretty dependant on them, to replace the existing alignment systems which are generally godawful.
