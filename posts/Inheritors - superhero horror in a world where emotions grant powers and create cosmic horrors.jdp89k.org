Hi [[/r/rational]], was encouraged to post about a reboot of my old serial that launched in the last month. You can either read it on [[https://inheritorsserial.com/][Wordpress]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35915/inheritors][RoyalRoad]], or [[https://tapas.io/series/Inheritors][Tapas]], or listen to it on [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyFvYSft4IWVtbH7wOH8ACtKg7l1RgZB4][YouTube]].

One paragraph synopsis: Follow Gabe, a clone of the greatest hero ever, as he struggles to survive a world where emotions grant fantastic powers and create cosmic horrors. When he stumbles on a senseless massacre, he sets out to clear his name and help the one survivor - the young Mateo - in finding justice. But as he fights for what he believes is right, he starts to unravel a mystery that could topple the capes forever.

Some context: I originally wrote Inheritors from 2018 to 2019, but ended up shuttering it for a variety of reasons. This September, I launched a remake that I felt addressed criticisms of the original serial. I focused more on the worldbuilding and internal consistency of the setting, which resulted in a stranger, and imo, more intriguing world. I don't know if it's strictly rational fiction, but I have taken care for the characters to pursue their goals with all intellectual agency available to them, as well as explore how a world where emotions are tangible can impact their minds.

We're currently up to Episode 5, with many more to come. If you end up enjoying it, I always appreciate a subscription to my channel, someone joining my discord, or a boost on TopWebFiction. Thanks :)

**** I mean, that's kind of a major element of the setting, and it's classic comic horror. Extra-dimensional beings go about their inhuman design, largely uninterested in the insignificant lives that crawl about the Earth. When they take interest to further their designs, it is through the lens of madness and trauma, and their regard varies between indifference and malice, with rare exceptions. Humanity is largely powerless to do anything about it except to try to use the scraps of power that fall of their table to turn against its origins.

If people dressed up in robes instead of spandex and if more people than the Fallen had a worshipful attitude that was less "KKK faux-Christianity," it'd be more obvious, but the trappings of the superhero genre obscure it.

***** The genre's not *horror*, no matter how much grotesque pregnancy stuff occasionally appears, nor how true it is that there are inhuman entities largely beyond our power. Different works can share common elements and be entirely different things depending on how those elements are used.

And the cosmically mighty space worms just aren't used the same way they would be, in, e.g., Lovecraft, nor to achieve disgust, horror, terror, fear, revulsion, alienation, isolation, dread of the unknown or unknowable, or anything adjacent. That's just not what Worm is about, as an experience or thematically or in a big picture narrative level. As Taylor says, it wasn't ever about [the space worm], it was always about /us/.

****** It kind of depends on whether you think "us" can fall under the umbrella of a cosmic horror. I think it can: imagining humanity as its own mass that causes isolation, horror, and alienation is not very difficult.

****** To be fair, it's pretty difficult to /effectively/ combine true Horror (victims largely powerless in the face of overwhelming force and terror and mental instability) with true Superhero (empowered people overcoming impossible odds with ultra-human abilities and willpower and courage).

Not saying it can't be done, it just often isn't.

****** Well, even in that case, most of the agents, especially the Titans from /Ward/ would apply. I mean, an entire extradimensional space that cracks into reality, from which spawn gigantic figures often with eyes everywhere but where they should be is definitely an "eldritch" demeanor, as are characters like Crawler and Cryptid.

But cosmic horror is more than just tentacles, old books, and people in robes, at least IMHO.

******** If it's isn't the setting and mood or the type of conflict or the visual aesthetics of the horrors, that pretty much just seems to leave too much use of words like "cyclopean" and "squamous," and I think that really misses the heart of the genre for its most shallow trappings.

********* So I think the way you described worm, while being accurate, is a bit of a stretch, in the same way that describing the avengers as 'a giant steals a magic necklace from a wizard' is accurate but doesn't really point in the right direction.

all the stuff you said about interdimensional horrors is cosmic horror, but the meat and bones of worm is superhero drama, and that is where most of the fic spends its time, with super powered people doing stuff and having feelings.

in my mind cosmic horror is, yes, about interdimensional beings that don't relate strongly to what we understand to be life, though i think it is even more about searing enigmas and unknowable truths that drive people insane, but more than that it is about the horror aesthetic communicated through writing, which I have a hard time describing but outside of the cosmic horror genre I would relate it to the tone of the novel 'the haunting of hill house'

but i'm no expert, i'm not looking to get real deep into this, i just thought i should try to flesh out my point a bit

********** Well, to be fair, I only stated that specifically the agents (or as the person I responded to described them, "the invisible space brain worms"), "a major element of the setting," are classic cosmic horror.

I never said that the entire story was. Mostly it's a rational, morally gray, and increasingly grim superhero story -- but one with a cosmic horror background setting that comes to the fore on a handful of occasions.

*********** Man, I really wish I liked wildbows writing more than i do. I got through a decent portion of worm, the last stuff i remember is a bank robbery or maybe one of those giants attacking and flooding a city, but reading it always felt kind of like work. From what I've gleaned about the deeper plot from comments on here it does sound cool.
