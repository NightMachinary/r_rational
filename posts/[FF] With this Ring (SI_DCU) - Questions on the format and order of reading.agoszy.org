SOLVED! And thanks for the help guys, I'll leave this up in case anyone else ever wants to find out.

Hi, so I'm looking into reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With this Ring]] since I heard its a good and long FF (and the only other Reddit thread I found about it was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yxxop/ff_with_this_ring_moving_threads/][here]], so I figured this was the subreddit to post this on, please correct me if I'm wrong) and I can't help but be a little.... confused with the format it should be read it.

So, when I tried to just start reading from that Megathread I link and which seems to be the 'hub' page for the story I found that the post immediately following it was definitely not the beginning of the story, so I had a look at Revised Story Only, and Original Story Only. And while the Revised Story Only appears to have been updated very recently its only about 100k words if the index is correct for that thread, but then I clicked on one of those random Thread Xs and noticed that the story in one of those was over 200k words!?!

So my question is, does anyone know how I should read this? Do I just started at Thread 1 and work my way up to thread whatever and ignore those to 'Story Only' links at the top? And if so what are those story only things for?

â€‹

Sorry if these seem like stupid questions, but I really am not sure on what to do and couldn't find anyone else having asked this question yet.

*** It's nonobvious but fairly straightforward. To read only the renegade sections of wtr, do the following.

Go to the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/][main discussion page]].

Scroll down to the boxes labelled "Spoiler: Episode number, Title". Click these to expand a list of posts for that episode. They don't actually contain spoilers; Zoat is just using the feature for formatting.

Some posts will be labelled "(supplementary, Renegade option.)" Those are what you're looking for.

If an episode is entirely focused around the renegade, then instead there will be posts labelled "(supplementary, SI option)". In that case, you want to read every other post within that episode.

*** scroll through fairly quickly and use the primitive parts of your brain to spot the scary red bits

hard to say otherwise, maybe a Tampermonkey script that deletes all the posts that don't start with a red color? that'll miss any that are renegade that don't immediately start with the timestamp, of which there are at least two

*** Just FYI, the Renegade part really depends upon you knowing the events that happened in the other timeline, as he'll assume you have the information when he's coming at a similar scenario from a different perspective. I feel like you won't really get the full gist or experience without it.

And honestly, one of my favorite scenes, where he dresses down the Justice League for their incompetence by ripping apart each superhero's method of doing things (like why doesn't Superman carry a radiations shield any of the green lanterns could have made from him easily, or Wonder woman for her impractical armor, etc) is on the regular timeline.

ergo I conclude he's up to date and just wants to read the renegade stuff fast for some reason

*** If you are using chrome, then you can find all the text on a page that's red by right clicking the page, selecting "Inspect" and searching "color: red". As the Renegade parts begin with the usual (date, time) headings colored red, that should work for finding all of them on a page. If you want a faster search, then after story details diverge, you can use keywords based on the differences >! !> like Father Box, Boom Tube, Grayven, Darkseid, Apokolips, which start working before page 16 (according to the URLS) .<! !<

Additionally, it's possible that when it got moved to a new site, the 2 stories didn't get bundled together. (As I read it through, I tried to keep track of the Renegade parts, but I haven't finished reading the whole thing yet, so that list is incomplete.)

This is the beginning of the story-only thread that Zoat updates every day. It has links to the discussion threads at the bottom in his signature if you're logged into the site.

It can be a little confusing because sometimes Zoat jumps around but paying attention to the color of the timestamps is a good indicator for whats going on. The story splits between paragon!paul and renegade!paul (who refers to himself by another name). Occasionally alternate versions and perspective come into the story but reading the posts in order is the best way to follow it.

To explain the discrepancy, Zoat began writing this story on SpaceBattles until the new Star Wars movies came out. The mods there declared no spoilers for SW anywhere on the site and Zoat made a post that passingly mentioned the Millennium Falcon in it. He was then arbitrarily banned for a day, told them to eat shit and took his story over to SV instead, where he currently updates it once a day.

Not actually the case. He commented with a question of why you'd continue to call yourself a rebellion when you've become the legitimate government (or something to that effect), with no other context. I didn't even know what he was talking about until other posters replied with star wars specific comments and everyone involved got banned.

** The Revised Story Only thread is how I read it. The word counts for the Story Only thread will appear misleading because only the first post in each chapter is threadmarked.

*** Yeah, I don't think that there's any easy way to get a full word count. SpaceBattles doesn't seem to do word counts at all. I've come across an ebook generator that would work on Sufficient Velocity, but it relied on threadmarks, so it couldn't download the whole Story Only thread. There have been estimates of the total word count, but I don't know if there's an authoritative count for the SB portion.

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][The Story Only Archive]] has the entire thing in one thread without other people's posts interfering with the reading experience. You can just read that entire thread and be up to date - the author updates story-only and main threads simultaneously.

The threads with discussion in them have exactly the same story content but also people discussing every update; this discussion can be interesting at times but is definitely not required to understand the story, and most people will read the story-only portion and then join the the thread discussing the recent updates. The threads run into number-of-post-per-thread limits for the server occasionally, so they're actually spread over ... thirteen threads, right now. If you want to read all of those long threads full of comments, you can. But again it's completely unnecessary.

The current [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/][thread full of comments]] also has a table of contents and a FAQ. The FAQ is probably good for new readers to check out. In particular, /the bit about a secondary 'renegade' AU storyline delineated by red-text time in the start of a section/ is good to know about.

** I've dipped into the comment threads, and there's some additional contextual information (e.g. why there will never be a plot line in the Teen Titans Go! or Titans universe), so if you have a /lot/ of free time, you might want to find Thread 1 and go from there, for the full experience.

That said, I have been following the Story Only thread almost exclusively, and if there's information I've missed out on by not reading the Comment threads, the work doesn't suffer for its omission.

There's a short bit about a Red Lantern Paul that's set in the Titan's universe. It only lasts a couple of posts and is part of another storyline though.
