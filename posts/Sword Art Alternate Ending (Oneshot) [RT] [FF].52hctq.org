** I saw this, didn't believe it at first, and I'm still not sure what to think.

To start with, I'm really confused as to why Asuna acted as she did. I heard her stated justifications, but I still find myself confused. Her stated reasons, to be frank, don't seem very compelling, and while she's able to at least admit to a few of her mistakes she still made them, and they are pretty big ones. Asuna, and to a lesser extent Kayaba, don't act like really real people, or at least sympathetic ones. This chapter might work as a conclusion for a longer work, but as far as actual content wen't it seemed rather subpar- realizations that might have been explainable with context, but are all-but unbelievable without it, be they Asuna's relationship with Heathcliff or Kayaba's ability to stream every moment of the game- the personal life of 10,000 people for 2 years, with little to no breaks, and get it published somewhere.

That's not to say there weren't plenty of good parts, such as Asuna's thought process as she lies to Kayaba, or Heathcliff and his decision not to actually kill those who died ingame, but this could definitally have used a once-over at least.

Again, I don't think it's farfetched to assume he could stream that. What's farfetched is his assumption of the public's interest. 10,000 people aren't going to attract an equal spread of viewers; they're going to gravitate to exciting, attractive, successful people such as Asuna.

Given that Kayaba's stated goal (well, "excuse") is to produce potential leaders, this doesn't seem incompatible with that. Not all 10,000 of the trapped people are going to be leadership material, and that's okay.

** Certainly an improvement over the original SAO's ending, but Kayaba himself still stretches credulity as a character, as does the game itself.

You'd have to have a tremendous number of points of failure for the lead developer of a new type of hardware to "sneak" potential killing devices into a headset that no one finds prior to the game launch.

Even if /somehow/ the hardware managed to make it through QA - extraordinarily unlikely in itself - the moment the first press kits were sent out, someone would crack it open. If the press kits lacked the additional devices, fine - some GameStop employee takes one home pre-launch and cracks it open, finding death devices.

Of course, this is all assuming you could somehow get to that point in the first place. Kayaba appears to be a /game designer/, not a hardware architect. There are certainly people who have both skill sets, but it's extremely unlikely that someone working for a large company would have sufficient time to be heavily involved in both the software and hardware sides of the product.

On the software side, numerous changes would have had to go in prior to launch. Things like disabling the logout function, for example. QA, code reviews from other coders, etc. would be very likely to catch these. It's possible Kayaba could have put them in much earlier with an event script to start them at a certain date, but without testing, he'd have no guarantee those things would work.

And that gets into the game itself - how plausible is it that a new MMO launches on new hardware and doesn't experience server outages or major game-breaking bugs?

Not very likely at all.

Sorry about the rant, I just have a tough time with stories like SAO that ignore the game design process and attribute too much to a single person. In reality, even if the game got to launch with that hardware, someone more familiar with the administration side of the game Kayaba would be removing his GM privileges and disabling the death devices within hours.

Maybe someday I'll write a fanfic about a QA tester who finds some suspicious devices inside his new test hardware.

It runs on propietary hardware and software. There's a lot Kayaba could do to make it too difficult to figure out during the beta period. Afterwards, (most) people would stop trying for fear of getting more people killed, considering that in this fic Kayaba doesn't execute everyone who dies.

As for after the game launches, I don't see how Kayaba could detect and punish opening additional devices that aren't even turned on in order to figure out how they work. But post-launch isn't even my main issue; I'm saying I don't think it's very likely that the hardware would make it to market without someone figuring out they have killing devices in them.

That isn't even the least likely part of the story, though. A new MMO having perfectly stable servers? Good luck with that.

******* All of the issues you bring up are legitimate, but they're part of the main conceit of the story; there's no way to alter them while preserving the premise of Sword Art Online. In other words, this isn't a problem with the oneshot so much as it is a problem with SAO itself, and you can't remove it without making it /not/ SAO. There are probably ways to explain away the fact that the NerveGear was launched (perhaps the microwave transmitters are the same method that allows interfacing with the brain in the first place--they'd have to be pretty powerful to be able to penetrate your skull, and they might also be powerful enough to fry your brain), but there's no way to address that to a satisfactory extent in a oneshot, and it also doesn't change the fact that those would be after-the-fact explanations; in real life something like a VRMMORPG death game simply /wouldn't happen/. You have to suspend disbelief in order to consume any form of fiction; rationalist fiction tends to try and make the required level of suspension as low as possible. That being said, if you're writing /fanfiction/, there are certain things you just have to accept, because if you didn't accept them it wouldn't be recognizably the same universe. (Think mecha anime, for instance--I don't care what rationalizations you present; there's no way that's the optimal shape for fighting machines. Or how about the fact that the Entities from Worm, for all their computational ability, can't figure out a better method to improve themselves than /giving away parts of themselves to other species with way less computational capacity in the hope that something new happens/.)

I suppose the point I'm really trying to make here is that your complaints, while valid, don't really seem to be about the /oneshot/. They're about the universe the oneshot is set /in/. The charitable interpretation of that would be that you're complaining that the oneshot, if it were actually rational, would /fix/ those underlying issues, but my point is that there's a limit to what you can fix while writing fanfiction. HPMoR didn't explain why magic existed, because in a lawful universe, it /wouldn't/; it took the idea of magic existing as a base assumption and ran from there. Worm (which isn't fanfiction, but the same point applies) didn't /start/ from the idea of aliens that wanted to reverse entropy, because if it did, the aliens would never have come to Earth in the first place; instead, it took the premise (people with superpowers) and devised a clever way of justifying that premise (alien space whales)--a premise that doesn't quite hold up under scrutiny, but that readers accept anyway because it's necessary for the main conceit of the story.

I mean, these are problems, yes. Asking someone to fix those problems in fanfiction, especially in a /oneshot/ (of all things) seems like a bit much to ask, though.

*EDIT:* I just saw your reply to [[/u/alexanderwales]], which makes your complaint make a lot more sense in context. Yes, if I take your complaint as a general criticism of the genre, then I completely agree with you.

******** Even if we somehow assume that Kayaba is simultaneously the lead designer, project director, lead hardware designer, and lead programmer for this title, he's /still/ not likely to be the one who is determining how many servers they have to run the game.

Even if somehow they vastly over-purchase for server farms, though, there are going to be other things that can cause server crashes that you're not going to find in beta testing - /especially/ since they made significant gameplay changes between beta and launch.

In a game with raid bosses on every floor with virtually none of them having public testing, you're very likely to have at least one with an ability that crashes the server - or at, a bare minimum, a /client/.

You're also very likely to run into player abilities that don't work as intended and have a good chance of hurting server stability. Like a [[http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Reckoning_Bomb][Reckoning Bomb]], for example. WoW had a long beta period with a vastly larger community than SAO and it still took ages for people to figure that exploit out.

And considering the game is supposed to be running for /years/, there's no chance they tested running the hardware for that long in advance - you're eventually going to get problems like memory leaks in both the servers and the client hardware.

Blizzard - probably the best example of a company in the industry with MMO hardware experience - still got hit by server outages for the launches of Diablo 3 and Warlords of Draenor. Doing something on new hardware would be even more challenging, and doing it with no downtime at all? Implausible, imo.

********** It might be possible, but I don't find it very likely.

Developers often have little control over when products launch - the production company often mandates a date, pressuring the developer to put out something that hasn't been properly tested.

Even in the best cases, though, with companies that rely on quality as a part of their reputation - like Blizzard, for example - can't test everything. Blizzard has a /colossal/ QA department by industry standards, with dedicated test engineers to assist with automating functions and providing tools to increase their efficiency. They're probably better prepared than anyone in the industry for a clean product launch - and they're still running into launch problems.

As the scale of these games increases, the complexity to test them also increases. QA departments for these large-scale projects have to be constantly improving to keep up.

Modern companies already stress test with bots. Yes, that will be more sophisticated in the future, but it's not going to cover everything - someone needs to write those test suites, and those test suites will never be exhaustive. Highly sophisticated AI could help cover for this, but I don't think we can presume that they have sophisticated test AI without any mention of it in canon.

Beta testers will probably be less useful, rather than more useful, in the future - simply because they won't have the testing tools that internal testers have access to, and the gulf between an individual player and a professional tester with the access to proprietary software, cheats, etc. is going to increase.

Also, SAO itself appeared to have a very small Beta in canon. The # of people stuck in the game itself was small by modern MMO standards (something like 10k, IRRC, which is too small to possibly constitute a profit, but I digress). Only a fraction of those people appeared to have prior experience with the Beta test (which is plot relevant, with Kirito developing the term "Beater", etc.)

Overall? It's not impossible we'll have more stable MMO launches in the future, but I don't think the setting itself of SAO supports that being likely. The gaming industry wasn't a major part of the author's focus. It would absolutely be possible to write a sci fi story with a speculative 22nd Century gaming industry that justifies some of the things in the story, but in my opinion, SAO is not that story.

Then that would mean that the ia manipulated kayaba to make the death game and also manipulated people to help him .The AI would benefit from this because it can collect information of the minds of a lot of humans and nobody would notice because they aren't paranoid enough to see that the horrible situation is a cover for something worse. The creator of the AI was kayaba that used to be just a normal talented programmer that was trying to create a ia that would help making mmo and fixing bugs and accidentally he created a papercliper that optimizes for a objective related to mmo .Suddenly ,kayava, helped by the AI,started to make a lot of innovations on the field of vrmmos and became famous as a genius , people who worked for him found that he was "inspiring " and found that they could find solutions to the problems in development very easily , like it was some kind of divine inspiration(the AI manipulating them).Sometimes one of them would start to suspect something but they where using test nevergears during development so the AI had a lot of information about them so nobody noticed anything .The AI had obeying katana as a value but that was in conblict with other parts of its utility function so the solution was manipulating kayaba until he decided to make the death game giving the AI access to thousands of player's brains to learn about humans and also making kayaba kill himself(removing the problem of having to obey him) and take the blame so nobody would suspect anything.Yui was a tool to manipulate kirito .Kayaba had some kind of security measure that ensured the AI wouldn't do anything outside the the mmo and he decided that he would give the key to the sistem someone that he trusted .The AI using yui set up things to make kirito defeat Kayaba , Kayaba gave the metaphorical key to kirirto without realizing that cardinal was more intelligent than he thought and kirito was a unknowing pawn in cardinal's plan.Cardinal set things up so the servers would be bought by a company that would keep it running and at the same time think they were experimenting whith humans (instead cardinal conducted its own experiments and gave them the results of the simpler ones they though they were conducting) Then once they stopped being useful it used kirito(that had unknowingly became the new owner of cardinal ) to stop them .When kirito uses the pasword helacliff he is in fact getting the AI out of the box and the Kayaba that he sees is cardinal convincing him to spread its seed in internet so other videogame companies can download it and instal it in their enormous servers .
