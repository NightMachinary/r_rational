Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Which sites or resources do you use to learn more about self-improvement?

Subreddits like [[/r/getdisciplined]] and [[/r/selfimprovement]] mainly contain people who, understandably enough, have far to go regarding self-improvement. Thus every such community I've found sucks. Lesswrong was decent, but it has limited high-quality material, and the actually clever people seem to have left the site now.

*** MOOCs on logic, [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking][math,]] statistics and probability, neuroscience (brain 101,[[https://www.mcb80x.org/][^{[1]}]][[https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurobiology][^{[2]}]] [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain][its vulnerabilities to addiction,]] etc), metalearning, etc. If you want to give them a try, and if your priority is self-improvement and disclipline, start with the [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn][metalearning one.]] Which will also help with the process of gradual introduction of MOOC-based learning into your daily (monthly, yearly) schedule.

Also Duolingo for languages; Khan Academy, artofproblemsolving.com (too expensive, unfortunately), and brilliant.org for math (still looking for additional good math learning platforms that would have non-paywalled interaction with human tutors). And [[/r/booksuggestions/]] when I've already determined what specifically am I looking for.

There should also be a good CBT-related self-help resource listed here, but I haven't found any yet.

*** lesswrong has improved a lot, honestly.

I use complice, and find it useful. There's a "chat room" there where people are productive together and post their goals. You get out what you put in: i.e. you need to sort of volunteer what you're doing and ask people for help, but then you get a lot of help (someone once debugged an issue I was having with LaTeX/BibTeX!). The chat room runs under the pomodoro technique: 32 / 8 minute cycles.

If you want to sign up I can rustle up a referral link that gives you an extra week of free trial, but the chat room itself is free/open.
