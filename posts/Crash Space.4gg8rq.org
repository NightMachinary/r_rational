** A story about one possible outcome to emotion regulation and transhumanism.

Warning: disturbing.All the things you probably can't see on network TV make an appearance.

**** Yeah. Bakker is great at hitting you from both sides. The Rigged are really creepy, but there is something suboptimal, animalistic and pathetic about Glenn

You can easily see why his kind is going extinct.

There's no easy answer. The status quo isn't inherently better or more pure,we're just used to it.

Oh, my sense of visceral horror isn't unthinking it's that a marketing analyst smart enough to presumably understand the concepts of and massage the data of a neural network, and thus falling into the mental bin of potential in-tribe members, is believable depicted as a wire-header.

If your argument about status quo extends to wire-heading, I'd direct you to the Prime intelligence series.

** Damn that was intense. Even with those risks, damn. I'd gladly take the implant. The ability to dial back emotions would be godlike.

*** Right. And that's how it starts. Because, the main argument to not have a little tweak sounds like Ludditism and fear mongering.

And then off to the races we are!

*** Well, we can do so without the implants. It's just quite difficult to do. Just need to build a strong awareness of what you're feeling/thinking, and practice controlling your reaction/emotion.

Not that I recommend nudging it too much. Our emotions/reaction does serve a purpose.
