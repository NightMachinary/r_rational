I'm not suggesting you quit. There's a section about two-thirds of the way in that is deeply satisfying (for me), but the rest was either a slog or I enjoyed character development.

(Sorry, that was irresistible. The Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer was downright painful for me to read. I devoured it. But I would call the books terrible. I do prefer to not bash on Twilight tho, because something about it clearly worked for me. Luminosity gets more leeway because it's not published by a publishing house, so I can't expect editing for things like pacing. And the MC is no longer painfully whiny. So I like Luminosity better. )

I really enjoyed Luminosity + Radiance, but I don't really recall the beats or the details of my experience of reading it. I do remember feeling really weirded out about reading a twilight fanfiction, even more so than an HP ff, but I managed to get through it and was glad I did.

Those of us who upload (or whatever it exactly ends up being) will be faced with many temptations to alter one's own mind after it becomes easy and convenient to do so.

I could easily see myself starting down that path, and ending up totally different in a short amount of time. If at all possible, I'll likely make at least one copy of myself, one of which is allowed to optimize, and another which will try to stay as human and unaltered as possible for as long as possible.

I still expect values drift and significant disagreements with myself, but I hope my optimized version will retain at least a little nostalgia and sympathy for my human version.

******* So in The *Quantum Thief* the idea of a Marovic upload is presented: One neuron at a time neurons are replaced with a non-bolocial processor, until the product is software running on a standardized processor that due to the ubiquity of the processing substrate (I'massumina lot of out of band processing for analysis and modelling here that is implied but not explicitly stated). The idea being to make a .flakk or vector art ("loss-less" analog representations of sound or shape respectively, as equations stored in digital media) of from as high a resolution of a scan.

​

If it's all just physics , and we understand all of the physics involved, the question is not if uploading is like dying, but how many nights sleep uploading is different from the you that uploaded<chose to be a software instead of a meat robot>, and if the divergence is significant along "choices" you might makes ( recently posted a thread on Watt's Sunflower series, lets not get into the physics Tarpit *Hotshot* makes cross-pollinating free-will and the analytic ability of the subconscious).

******** If I can choose a upload means for myself, it would be the one-neuron-at-a-time approach. I actually envision at least a two-step process, where the first round of replacements are artificial neurons which can interoperate with biological ones, but also have high-speed electronic signalling protocols too. These artificial neurons would be the same size as biological ones, and by default would not operate any faster.

Then, when the first round is complete, you'd then convert over to electronic signaling.

At that point (assuming things are stable), the first round neurons could be replaced with an only-electronic version which would then be much more compact.

After the second round of replacements is done, it would be much easier to run at a higher signalling speed.

******** It's a little different, depending on the method of uploading used.

I would say that we aren't necessarily our bodies, but our stream of consciousness which (we're pretty sure) is a result of the neurons firing off in certain patterns in our brains. It doesn't matter that cells in our body are dying and being replaced daily so long as that stream of consciousness stays consistent. Yes that stream of consciousness gets interrupted with things like sleep, but this isn't a permanent interruption like death.

Now if an upload method basically just analyzes our brain and the patterns of neurons firing in them, then destroys the brain after it's done analyzing it, I would argue that's more or less the same thing as just killing a person and cloning them.

Because your stream of consciousness is copied and then terminated. It would be basically the same thing as copying and pasting a file, then deleting the original.

If the method was similar to what [[/u/Empiricist_or_not]] described, then the question becomes more interesting. Because in that case you're not necessarily destroying the original stream of consciousness, but instead replacing the hardware that the consciousness runs on bit by bit while there's no neuro-activity in the places that are being destroyed/replaced.

There is never a point where there's both you and a copy of you simultaneously existing and there's never a point where you completely cease to exist either.

That's all I'm saying. I think there is a difference between brain death and something like going to sleep.

Also to comment on what you said earlier: "that thing is what you copy, not just the thoughts and memories".

I think this statement is actually incorrect. Because if someone created a perfect clone of me without harming my original body in any way, I wouldn't expect to be both experiencing my own life and that of the clone at the same time.

I wouldn't have access to the experiences that the clone would have access to if we did different things. (For example, If the clone went to the store and I stayed home, I wouldn't expect to have memories of the clone buying milk). For all intents and purposes we would be considered two separate entities.

I don't see why that would change if my original body ceased to exist during the copying process.

At the beginning of the process you get to choose whether at the end the person in the booth you are standing in gets an additional 10 million dollars or the person in the other booth.

Identity consists of your (socially) important characteristics. e.g in rhw case of people it is your ideas memories, values, ideals, behaviour and so on. It is also a spectrum based on degree of similarity rather than a binary. I share more of my identity with the person I was yesterday than the person I was six years ago but not all of it because every conscious moment parts of my identity change.

I think you're altering the perameters of the problem with this statement. In the hypothetical situation described above, your personality would be completely intact and unchained from how it was when you were in your original body. Everything would function exactly the same and you would have the same memories. The only difference would be that your thought process is run by a computer instead of your brain.

I have a thought experiment for you as well. If someone didn't destroy your brain, but instead "froze time" then made a complete copy of your body and brain would you consider the copy to be the exact same person as you?

If you were put in separate but identical rooms and told by an identical recording that "Only one of you may leave alive" would you think there was no consequences to you being the person who died, since technically having a clone of yourself means that in all important respects you'd still be alive?

Edit: for the sake of clarity, let's say the recording that you review states that pressing the button will kill you, but not your perfect copy. In your case the recording is telling the truth, but in the clone's case this is a lie as it will not be killed regardless. Neither of you are aware of that. There is a mechanism that you can activate which will carry out the destruction of yourself painlessly. But if you never press the button to kill yourself, you and your clone will be fed and allowed to live in the boring room for the rest of your lives.

Also let's assume that your experiences within the two seperate rooms are 100% identical. Meaning since you're the same person with the same memories/body and you're in the the exact same situation, you'll make the exact same movements and come to the exact same conclusions. (if you push the kill button, then the other version of you is pushing the kill button at the exact same time. If you trip over your feet and fall, so is the other version of yourself). For the sake of this experiment ignore the fact that it's likely physically impossible to create a situation 100% identical.

Edit2: Also the video states that if you and your clone both press the button at the same time, one of you will be chosen at random. So you don't have to worry about the possibility of both you and your clone dying.

*********** Of course I changed the parameters. What would be the point of parroting your words back at you?

The argument was that if continuity of consciousness is what determines identity then you can be Adolf Hitler. You being Adolf Hitler is absurd so continutity of consciousness can't be what determines identity.

In your time frozen copies example both copies would be equally me at the moment of duplication. After that each would begin to diverge from the person I was before the split at different rates depending on their experiences.

I press the button. I would press the button if I knew it killed the copy. I would also press the button if I knew it killed the original. Both the original and the clone value each other the same because we are identical in all important respects.Each cares about the other for the same reason I would care more about a person that shared my values than a person that opposed them. There isn't any particular reason to prefer a particular version other than maybe some kind of irrational selfishness. Whatever version gets out is likely to achieve at least twice as much personal utility as both of me could achieve in the box.

Consider an alternate scenario. i'm living my life when I get a magic button. I know that pressing it will annhilate my body. It will then spawn a copy of me that shares my values but is significantly smarter, healthier and wiser. I don't have to press it but I would anyway.

I guess I just don't agree with the idea that a copy is the same as the original, since there doesn't seem to be any concrete way to prove that it's actually you.

I don't get what you mean about proving a copy is the same as the original. Identity is a human social construct not something present in nature. The copy shares almost all of its charachteristics with the original. The only actual differences would be the location where the copy is, the matter it is composed of, and how it was made.

The location doesn't matter for identity purposes. You are still you if you are teleported.

The matter it is composed of doesn't matter. You are still you if your cells die and are replaced by new ones.

The origin doesn't matter because it is easy to imagine scenarios where the Me I am right now would consider the copy more Me than the original even if the original diverged because of natural processes e.g if the original body got brain damaged, addicted to drugs, brainwashed by a cult etc whereas the copy didn't.

************** I'm not sure exactly how to explain it. But at least from a purely empirical point of view, it feels like I am the presence or perspective (Or whatever you want to call it) that is experiencing my consciousness.

It feels as if my thoughts aren't just some bit of information that exists in the universe, but instead is something intensely personal that only I can experience.

If you create a perfect clone of me and didn't kill either of us, I wouldn't expect that to change. My perspective would still be only of this original mind and body. I wouldn't expect to be both experiencing my own thoughts and the thoughts of my perfect clone (which would quickly diverge and differentiate themselves from my own thoughts due to differences in experiences).

In that sense, I believe that we are separate consciousnesses/perspectives. Because we can diverge and experience different things.

Whereas any changes that happen to me alone, even something huge (like my right brain being disconnected from my left brain due to some accident) would still be viewed from this same perspective. I would still be the person experiencing that wildly altered consciousness.

I have no way to prove that my observed feelings on this are accurate. Perhaps we are just only information, instead of observers of that information. In which case, you're 100% correct.

But I would fear that creating a clone of myself and then dying would be killing the perspective through which I've viewed myself throughout my life. And perhaps you've studied things that I'm unaware of, or maybe my theory is based in more mysticism than I'd like to admit, but I've never seen any evidence which proves or disproves this idea. And until I do see evidence that's contrary to what I observe and feel, I won't take any risks that might unnecessarily end my perspective/POV/Consciousness/whatever would be a good way to describe the poorly explained concept I'm trying to get across.

*************** I'll try to be as obvious as I can since I don't think you have fully understood my position. Each perspective / moment of consciousness your body has is destroyed in moments. Your body is repeatedly destroyed and replaced by a slightly different copy through a process called time. Mental continuity is an illusion. You can't perceive the past or future only the present, you can't know that e.g Last Thursdayism is incorrect.

Both the mind in the original body and the mind in the clone are different people after the duplication but they are both equally descended from the mind in the original before the duplication.

Consider the scenario where half of your brain and body is cut into two groups. Each half then has the other half copied onto them so there are two people. Which would you be?

If qualia exists in a meaningful sense then it would be something experienced / observed by every computational process though obviously non-human processes would not experience qualia in the same way we do.

But I would argue that from experience, it never feels like the you from a second ago is different from the you of right now. It feels like a continuous thing, even if it is constantly changing.

I admit I have no idea what would occur in this situation. I imagine realistically any process that attempted to do this would result in brain death. But if you could hypothetically do this without meaningfully ceasing brain function... then I'm not sure what the result would be (from a personal experience standpoint).

I guess the main difference in our thought processes is that you believe the temporary lapses in conciousness and changes overtime are more or less the same thing as a death of an individual perspective.

Whereas I believe that the perspective persists throughout all those changes, only ceasing to exist when the person's thought processes have fully stopped. Things like going to sleep are more like how a computer pauses a process, or runs it in the background, while other processes take priority. The process is never completely gone, just on standby. You could copy that process and run it on another system, sure. But it wouldn't be that same process, even if it behaved the exact same way.

I'm not sure how either of us could actually convince the other of the opposite point of view.

I think from a practical point of view... it probably will never matter in our lifetimes who is right and who is wrong. I enjoyed having this conversation, but I don't think I have anything more useful to add.

** I know it's what you asked, but "it gets better" or "it gets worse" seem like really unhelpful answers to me because Luminosity has some pretty distinct stylistic choices, and people who dislike them will say "it gets worse" when they read more, while people who like them will say "it gets better".

Despite the fact that it's been out for ages, I only read Luminosity recently (having watched the first Twilight movie for comparison's sake). Maybe it was discussed to death in the past, but nowadays the most it gets is an offhand mention in a recommendation thread or reading list every now and then.

For me, Luminosity (intentionally or not) averts or deconstructs many rational fiction tropes. Despite what appears to be a slow start and some meandering sections in the middle - this never really becomes an action-driven story - I think it's got some pretty strong economy of narrative, with all of Meyer's characters and worldbuilding having important roles to play in the themes Alicorn presents. It's about the conflict between wanting to do what's right for the world and what's right for yourself and the people you love; it's about the conflict between Bella's introspection and the strongly interpersonal interactions she has to navigate throughout the story. Twilight is generally pretty bad, but it's one of those stories that's frustrating because it feels like it's just a few tweaks away from being a really good and interesting one - and for me, that's Luminosity.

Luminosity doesn't really show its hand until very near the end, I think. So, basically, if there's things about the story that are bothering you at 5% of the way in, they're unlikely to have gone by 95%. Unless you really, really like Luminosity, I wouldn't recommend continuing through into Radiance.

** It does have a somewhat slow build, but it really picks up the slack later on. In my opinion, at least. It's been a while since I've read it, mind, so I can't tell you when.

** fwiw, i actually enjoyed luminosity the most at the beginning with the focus on bella and her obsessive introspection.

** It didn't thrill me when I started it back when HPMOR had just finished, either. I put it down, but I was thinking of trying again since I recently watched the Twilight RiffTrax.

** The strongest arc of Luminosity is towards the end, and Radiance is strongest towards the beginning.

** You could try skipping to the sequel /Radiance/. It has a different protagonist, and I personally find it much more fun to read. While reading /Radiance/, you could periodically Ctrl-F /Luminosity/ to fill any holes in your understanding of /Radiance/'s background.

*** That... seems like a pretty terrible idea? Maybe I'm just more preoccupied by the idea of spoilers than most, but it sounds like a great way to be confused and bored out of your mind trying to read a book about people and events your don't under stand.
