Hey guys, you might remember me as the author of [[http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/][Tales From Aeria]] and been wondering why I stopped working on it. I'm not sure how many of you actually read that, but I wanted to assure everyone that its not a dead project.

Fall of Oso is kind of at a weird point. I know where the story goes from here, but writing it is proving to be a challenge. I'd welcome anyone who wants to help me brainstorm for things regarding that, if you don't mind spoilers, send me a PM and we can discuss my plans for the plot.

The other thing is that I have a completed(ish) manuscript for another story in Aeria already finished. It needs some editing and tweaking, making sure things are consistent and such, but its nearly ready to go. I just need a few beta readers to help me iron the whole thing out and I'll be ready to start posting it. I really need help with that. Its an already completed story so its very long. What I'd like are a few people interested in doing a full read through for me and giving a more generalistic commentary on the plot, characterization, and things like that, and then have a few others who'll read through chapter by chapter with me prior to each chapter's posting and help me check for grammar and sentence structure and other more nitty-gritty details. Once I have things in swing, I'll post one a chapter a week, though I may break some of the chapters up a bit as some of them are quite long. All in all there should be at least six months of serial content that is ready to go aside from editing and fine tuning.

If you're interested in helping with any of those things and get a early view into the world of Aeria, hit me up via PM.

Cheers o7

** I never started your story because of lack of an .epub. Is there any chance of having that anytime soon?

*** I don't think Fall of Oso is polished enough for me to convert it to .epub. When I finish editing and begin posting chapters for the new story, it will feature .epub links. I just need to finish the polishing and editing and having it gone over by a few betas (once I find them)

**** You don't need to publish it, just make it available on patreon like everyone else, or, dunno, have it as "first draft" or something.

Regardless, I think you're limiting yourself by not providing such an immediate way for users to read it offline on their devices.

***** I hear you, but I also don't want to supply readers with a version that's crappy or full of grammar errors. Once its in .epub form, I can't edit it further unless I go back in and completely remake the .epub, and that doesn't do anything for the people who already downloaded it. That's all I mean about wanting it to be polished first.

Fall of Oso will be getting an epub version as I edit it. I'm going through chapter by chapter and I'll be adding links to pdf and epub versions when I get that done.

Songs for the Revolution will probably start coming out before the .epub versions of Fall of Oso though, since I'm putting that a bit on the backburner right now. Songs for the Revolution will feature pdf and epub versions available on initial posting, I just need to complete the editing first.

If you're interested in helping edit, I can convert the first few chapters of SftR to epub and throw them at you.

Also, i have no idea how to patreon.

****** Sure, do you have skype?

Though keep in mind I'm not a native english speaker, so there are some things I might miss.

******* I do have skype, and that's cool. The project honestly too big to have any one person edit it anyway, myself included, so even if you were a native english speaker, I would expect some stuff to slip past your radar. I'll PM you a link to the converted file. It'll just be the first few chapters and it will get rougher after you pass the point where I've been making edits.
