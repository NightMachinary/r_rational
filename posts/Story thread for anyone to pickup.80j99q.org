Just had an idea:

In the future, we have defeated aging (in some form of method where it must be continually applied and aging is reversed), however, there is still a stigma associated with aging, and there is still pushback against transhumanism, as we see today.

So, a group of people, all who appeared to be in their 20s, but were actually all over 100, managed to take over the government and turn age into a currency. In order to pay for things, you had to give up years. (It would basically be a reverse of this movie: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Time]])

Unfortunately, I have basically no interest in writing. The story can pickup wherever, but I suggest beginning with a random person who lives in a society where paying for things with age is common and accepted and normal (at the market: walking around in the store for a few seconds to make sure that you have enough at the checkout counter, which is basically a de-ageing machine).

** You probably would get more feedback or discussion if you post it to the weekly discussion threads. In fact, there used to be a lot of "brain-storming" threads similar to yours where an idea is proposed. The Wednesday World-building thread was the very first weekly thread to be made which is meant for prompts just like yours.

** it's not a reverse of that movie, it is that movie, except the aging shows instead of being tracked in an account.

*** OP is proposing that you get younger when you buy things, to overcome widespread stigma against de-aging.

**** u/wren42:

  there is still a stigma associated with aging

I think OP may just be confused. why would people PAY with de-aging? it would be shitty commodity to use economically.

anyway, op as 'no interest in writing' and the idea is uninteresting.

** 1. Does giving up years make you older, or younger?
2. If it makes you older, it is exactly like "In time", except peoples age is visible in a different way.
3. If it makes you younger, than we must also have a way of prematurely aging people. The "aging" effect would have to produce something valuable, to be used in the "youthing" effect. 4.Since, from what it says you actually pay by becoming younger, that means that the "group of people" would have little to no money, and you are trying to design a ruling class that cannot pay for a loaf of bread.
4. Your idea is actually just a slightly modified universal income. To reword it in a non aging way, "Everyone basically use bitcoins, and everyone accumulates bitcoins at a constant rate, and bitcoins are destroyed instead of moving around"
5. If someone somehow got "rich" would being a millionaire kill you?
6. If we can perform instant medical procedures more easily that we can produce a loaf of bread, which would be a requirement because anti-aging medical procedures would be a side effect of someone buying bread, or a sandwhich, then we are definitely in a post scarcity world.
7. If "walking around in a store for a few seconds" is enough to pay for groceries then you would have to do the equivelent of buying a new car once or twice a week just to break even. The more I look at this, the less sense this actually makes.

** I think the base point is weak. Pushback against technologically eternal youth is specious at best; most old people I've ever met would love to feel young again.
