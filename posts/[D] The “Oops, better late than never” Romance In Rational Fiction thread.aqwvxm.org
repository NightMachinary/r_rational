I was distracted on Valentine's Day for reasons, and forgot to make this thread. So I'm making it now.

As is often the case in these discussions, there has not been a large of amount of romance in rational stories this past year. The best by far is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][/Worth The Candle/]] by cthuluraejespen, which contains a variety of romances people of various species and fantastical mind or society-altering abilities.


** I think rational fiction has a more general problem with (or at least a tendency toward) characters with inhuman motivation. Most are community/society/world-optimizers rather than satisfaction-pursuers - they're bent on changing the world and institutions around them (and willing to make heroic sacrifices to do it) rather than evaluating the options for how to live within their current society most enjoyably.

The biggest departure from that I can think of is Pokemon: Origin of Species - Red and Leaf want (relatively) mundane lives as a researcher and journalist, Blue is admittedly more ambitious, but level-sets his ambition against the achievements of his grandfather and other Champions. None of them, say, thinks that the whole League system is a corrupt pile of bad incentives that needs to be swept away and replaced with a new paradigm for how humans interact with Pokemon in the way that Harry did with Wizarding Britain in HPMOR. Compare/contrast the Practical Guide to Evil where Catherine seems to continually seek out new and better ways to give up her humanity in order to keep her ambitions alive. In Mother of Learning where Zorian uses a variety of methods to allow his friends to transmit research data and memories through instances of the Loop, but uses the Loop more to avoid emotional engagement with potential romantic partners at least in part because it would distract from optimal use of the loop.

It'd be interesting to see a rational fiction written about a protagonist who is rational and exacting in pursuit of their goals, but those goals are selfish and amoral - a satisfying love life, high status, power and resources,

*** Definitely. Though, I still like the society changing ones, because there's a dearth of (good) ones in general. They're very satisfying, but it's hard to write a global plot while focusing on characters (the interesting part) at the same time.

There should 100% be more rational fics about love. Maybe a fanfic of Kaguya-sama? As far as I know, that more deconstructs/parodies anime tropes rather than remaining rational.

**** I got up-to-date on the (translated) magna a week ago. It does a fair bit of deconstruction, but the characterization /mostly/ remains solid, and pretty firmly centered around the core concept of "two people want the other to confess". I'm not quite sure what rational fanfic would look like, except perhaps one or both of them understanding that they're in a deadlock (which also kind of happens in the manga?). The biggest sin the manga commits is hitting the reset button a few too many times, or having interruptions that stall out plot development, but they're not that egregious about it.

***** I actually think kaguya-sama did a fairly decent job at avoiding the romcom reset button trope. I was originally planning on writing a quick blurb about it but it turned into a character analysis through the entire series, so I'll put it at:

While the reset button is hit situationally to keep their relationship from changing too quickly, their characterization and dynamic does not stop evolving and makes what look initially look like a typical reset actually have significant differences in their attitudes towards each other and the "goal" of their mind games.

The pace being slowed by the other StuCo members having their own chapters and arcs is a valid complaint, but it helps keep the story well rounded and the rest of the cast from being a plot device to help/hinder their plans.

I have slight complaints about it seeming to happen a little too quick but overall, pretty top tier. I definitely have to praise the usage of point of view you've done. In a bunch of web fictions, there is the issue where POV changes result in the same voice being expressed in different characters but the thinking style and personality that you expressed in each POV worked well to fit with each individual character.

I wouldn't expect this community to be all that interested in romance. The reward for being rational in romantic situations... is better odds of romantic success. While that is very nice, and of great importance to those directly involved, romantic success seldom has world-altering implications. There are reasons it usually goes on in the background of the story.

**** The True Love's Kiss idea was mentioned, but there is another potential option.

The Harem Anime, the rational protagonist somehow becomes aware that if they don't get all their paramours to cooperate bad stuff will happen, so you've got a story where navigating relationships is the means to success. Any hook works, gotta get the kids working together to stop the capitalist business owner demolishing a park, party of fantasy heroes who will need to cooperate to have a chance to defeat the dungeons, crew of a sci fi ship you've got to stop breaking in chaos. There's lots of ways to require people working together to get a goal, while having the goal such most of them aren't motivated enough to put aside their disputes. The protagonist has to figure out how how to develop both romantic and non romantic relationships with a group who all want something to keep it going.

The real issue with any premise is that romance just isn't that rational friendly, you can't so easily optimize others emotions so it'll be less friendly to the kind of stories more popular here.

*** bit of an aside, but I watch a show called the Magicians (currently in its fourth, excellent season) that recently introduced a situation where romance (or at least a love life) did have significant stakes.

One of the characters gets infected with sexually transmitted lycanthropy. As a consequence of that, during an event called the Quickening, he must have traditional sex with a currently uninfected partner, or he will 'wolf-out' and rape/murder the first person he finds. Furthermore, if he does something like lock himself in a cage, he will 'wolf-out' and murder himself. The Quickening also causes him to have increasingly violent/sexual thoughts as he gets closer to wolfing out.

As he was currently single, didn't want to coerce or infect anyone, and had several other very important (as in 'the lives of him and his friends hang in the balance' important) things going on at the same time, this was a significant problem. I think the situation would actually be ripe for a rational exploration in securing romantic success that would have actual stakes, since one of the better ways for him to solve the problem permanently would be to secure a nice, stable, long-term relationship. Extremely contrived, true, but also one of the more interesting takes on werewolves I've seen in a while.

What are the chances that the new person becomes infected? If it is at all likely that he will spread the illness further, it would be reasonable to let himself perish instead. Even delaying past one Quickening event to pursue other goals seems unwise, since the newly infected will face the same issue and might choose to spread the illness further.

Werewolves are probably ruthlessly killed in that setting.

***** It seems like doing something as simple as using a condom is enough to prevent transmission in this setting, so werewolves aren't all ruthlessly killed (especially since magic can probably make 'protection' even more air tight). Plus the whole thing was presented as an allegory for aids/other STDs when it was first introduced, so there are now limits on how 'rational' the show can get on the issue.

And while letting yourself die would be 'reasonable' in the bigger picture, I don't think it would really be rational for most characters. Rationality is all about pursuing your goals in the best possible way, and 'staying alive' is a pretty important goal for most people. Still, that would add a bit more depth and moral nuance to the plot of this hypothetical story.

It is kind of addressed in the story however. In the setting, magic is a secret kept by magicians (who are implied to be the top 1% of the population, brains wise, because magic is absurdly difficult to use/understand properly). Most magician werewolves we see manage the condition with relative ease, because of how magic can alleviate most problems. It is the non-magicians who get infected, and so don't know about magic/the wider magical world/what the fuck is going on during their Quickening, who are presented as a major problem, and I wouldn't be surprised if the setting introduces a squad of magicians who roam the world killing/capturing those poor suckers, despite how whimsical the show can be. As whimsical as the setting is, it is also one the spent a good deal of time presenting fairies as the classic, human-hating, ethereal beings we're all used to seeing... and then later revealed that faires only hate humans because, since fairies are literally made of magic, magicians used to hunt them down, kill them, and grind their bones into a magic enhancing powder (fairy dust). It's one of those weird shows that tends to have its irrational elements actually have been vaguely rational all along; the world is just so secretive/layered that the protagonists were operating with incomplete information the whole time.

***** Oh yeah, there's been quite a number of departures from the source material. The books are amazing, but if the show followed them exactly it would have been cancelled after one season. The books work because we get an inside look into Quentin's head, and Quentin is very introspective. He works as a character precisely because we get to see his inner thoughts and feelings; trying to get the same depth from the outside (as they would have to on a medium like TV) just wouldn't work. So instead the show chose to expand the rest of the cast to 'match' the depth with which they would portray TV Quentin, and all the other changes kind of spiraled from there, in my opinion.

Also a bit off topic, but how do you feel about book Quentin? A lot of other fans I've met seem to hate him, especially in the first few books, but I while I kind of get that, on a very real level I don't. A lot of people cite the way he thinks about women as why they hate him, but I feel like those people simply don't understand that Quentin in book 1 is essentially a repressed teenage boy, and a big chunk of what they hate reading is simply a natural consequence of how deeply the author choose to portray him. If, in the Harry Potter books, Rowling decided to really go into depth on what Harry was thinking whenever he was really feeling his crush for Ginny (or Cho Chang before her), then I don't think many people would like the character of Harry Potter either.

In fact, I think that if you changed the point of view to any other character in the Magicians series, and kept the writing style the same, that character would instantly become 'the worst character in the books', just like people think Book 1 Quentin is.

The author himself said he was in a pretty bad place when he wrote the first book (and maybe the 2nd?) and that's clearly reflected in the series. I still read it and am happy I did almost purely because book 3 really brought it home. The Quentin from book 3 is such an amazing character and book 1/2 Quentin is responsible for that, as part of what makes him amazing is his growth.

It's been a while so I can't give the fairest opinion but book 1 Quentin, from what I recall, was a snobby, arrogant, entitled prick. He had that sort of issue that I personally don't respect (but can understand) of having too much and thus being unsatisfied. He also cheated on his girlfriend. Alcohol/drugs was involved but still; his reasons were cheating were pretty basic and self centered and shitty and don't get me wrong; that's good character design in a sense. Quentin definitely felt like a real character; a real person. He was just a person I didn't like. I wouldn't call him a bad/boring/flat character; I'd call him a bad person though.

******* Oh I understand your point of view perfectly. I just feel like that is as much a part of the writing style, as it is the characterization. Almost all of the characters in book 1, judging from some of their actions and dialogue alone, don't come off nicely, to the point where I think, if they were the point of view character, they also would have come off as a snobby, arrogant, entitled prick. Essentially I don't really think Book 1 Quentin is actually a bad person, relative to the other book 1 characters. I think he just gets a bad rap because he's the point of view character, so he's the focus of the narrative. Basically, I think that if Alice or Margo or Julia or Eliot had been the protagonist in Book 1, people would say the exact same things about them, as they do Quentin now. That's one of the reasons I think the show is so much more liked (by the 'mainstream', and even by a lot of book fans) than the books. Season 1 (or at least, early season 1) plays out pretty similarly to the novel, but nobody is the main character. Nobody is subject to the ultra close, super personal examination that made Quentin such a good character but also so hard to root for. And Quentin's actions, divorced from the ugliness of his inner monologue, are a lot more bearable. With that degree of separation he just becomes one character among many, with problems just like anyone else's.

To give a clear example, in the books Quentin cheating on Alice seems a lot worse than Alice cheating on Quentin, because we got to see Quentin's internal monologue during the act, and after. We don't get to see any of that for Alice; we don't get to see any of the jealousy or anger, or resentment, so her 'transgression' seems a lot more 'innocent', if that makes sense. In the show the whole thing plays out similarly (with important differences, but similarly), but with both characters being seen from the same 'distance', there's a lot less perceived imbalance (at least to me) in how they behave. The good guy and bad guy in the situation is a lot less clear cut; they just both look like two young, socially awkward fools trying to handle their first relationship.

******** Oh I should've mentioned; most of the characters had that sort of same air to me. The snobby, entitled type thing. Alice seemed to be one of the few exceptions.

And you're right; the POV thing does make a big difference. I remember when I read the chapter where Alice cheated, I felt a lot more emotionally impacted. With Quentin, I was like "well this is consistent with the sort of shitty entitled person he is" and also there's probably some bias as I'm a male so I more easily relate to Quentin by default. When Alice cheated, I found it "hurt" a lot more despite the fact that I could objectively say she had more valid reasons for infidelity, though I still wouldn't call it right.

Like I had the same issue with most of the magicians characters, esp. most of the students from brake bills, that I had with Quentin at least initially; they were all spoiled brats. They had all of this magical prowess and education and they figured the best thing to do after graduation was....go to a fancy apartment and mindlessly party? Seriously guys?

I think the metaphor the author was going for was clear; it was meant to directly mimic the all too common story of rich kids becoming adults and having too much and so having difficulty finding fulfilment. But I guess I just don't empathize with that sort of thing and as a result, I ended up hating a lot of the cast.

*** I think there is another reason why rationality features little in romance, beyond the lack of stakes; while a smart approach does increase the odds of success in reality, the success or failure of a romantic move in a story often has very little to do with prior odds of success, and much more with the requirements of the story - while we on this subreddit share a dislike for unlikely, against-the-odds successes and approve of our protagonists using their intellect to achieve their goals, common romance tropes are basically the inverse of that. Applying rational thinking to romance is probably rather difficult to write if the romance is supposed to have tension and be narratively satisfying. That is not to say it isn't possible, as others have noted, WTC and other works have done it, but it seems pretty difficult to me.

I really like rational fiction as a vehicle for teaching people how to be more rational in their daily lives. I think the genre started primarily as an attempt to teach people how to reason more effectively. The exotic situations make the story entertaining, and the lessons are therefor better received. But then, there is a bit of a paradox--if people are to use what they've learned, they've got to see how it can apply in the everyday. An extraordinary setting puts extra distance between the reader and what they are supposed to take away from the story.

A story with an everyday setting makes the lessons more immediate. I'm glad you still found it entertaining.

I'm hoping to revive it - it /is/ in my google docs almost complete bar some infill that needs to be done - but I need it to be edited properly, and have my coauthor run her eyes across each chapter and give me her blessing (I feel like the writing quality will be irreparably harmed by not having her write it "properly", but the perfect is the enemy of the good, so here we are).

That said, I'm going to be moving to Paris for 6 months this year, so realistically expect one or two chapters total. Maybe 2020 will be the year for it to work out :|

(If anyone wants to beta read, let me know and I'll invite you to the google doc)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death][Fairy Dance of Death]] does a /really/ good job on the romance between Kirito and Asuna.

It's cute and really sweet and there's this one scene between them that was just so /eeeee/ that I literally, physically squeed because it was /just that cute and sweet oh my gosh/.

Also the rest of the story is seriously well done too. In particular, it scratched the itch for me that the end of the Log Horizon anime left.

** I missed noticing that the thread for Valentine's Day was posted, so here I am posting all of my romance/sex positive recommendations two days late. At least I'm living up to the "Oops, better late than never" part of this thread's title.

I'm too lazy to write up summaries for each rec, so I'm just copy-pasting the summary descriptions even if they aren't the best.

These are all of the stories that I can find or think of where the characters deal with romance and sex in intelligent and reasonable ways (even if they don't necessarily do the same outside of relationships).

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.916/][Amelia]] [Worm AU] - Amy Dallon is pushed by the S9, hard enough to actually *fight back*. From there, things diverge from canon.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]] [Original Fiction] - Everyone is born with a birth class and a gift, and everyone with a particularly dangerous class gets monitored and registered. Everyone gets a career class once they start working, but Artificer became more popular than Adventurer years ago. There are dungeons, but they've been sealed. There are dragons, but they were nearly hunted to extinction and now the nature preserves are well guarded. Prostitution isn't illegal, which is good, because Cinnamon Wallace likes being open about who and what she is. The gods left the world years ago, it is said that they will never return, not until all the world is dust, and the stars rain like fire from the sky. And so, when an Oracle prophesied that Cinnamon Wallace would one day meet a god, and be judged for her sins, the Oracle's words were dismissed. Surely, if the world was going to end, someone else would have also foreseen it?

** Speaking from experience, it's a challenge to blend rational fic tropes with romantic ones. Rational fic is usually focused on a character's ambitions, intellectual gains, and social machinations. The type of style that favors that tends to be more detached and focused on the plot, rather than the emotional arc of the characters. The tension comes from the characters solving complicated problems while the odds are stacked against them, and seeing them pull it off in a clever way is usually how the story resolves.

Romance as a genre has a different conflict/resolution scheme. The characters are usually struggling with something (loneliness, ugliness, fear of intimacy) and they have to find healing/happiness through the romantic relationship. A romance will also have an immediate, close writing style, because that helps us relate to the characters and build tension.

To somehow blend rational characters with romantic storylines, you really need to develop skill in building romantic tension and making the reader want the characters to be together, because they need each other. The romantic conflict should dovetail with the rational fic conflict, so that one affects the other. For example, the character winning an intellectual challenge will either lead to progress or regression in their romantic goals, in a way that fits naturally into the storyline.

In all likelihood, you'd have to choose whether or not you want the rational or romantic plot arc to take take center stage in a particular scene or chapter. Not just because the writing style will be different, but also because sometimes you have to switch mental gears to go from reading one or the other.

EDIT: On second thought, Practical Guide to Evil addresses this a little. Cat is often too busy to truly pursue romance, and justifiably paranoid at times about what the story-rules of her universe may do to non-Named love interests. She still finds value in those relationships, and has on a few occasions gone for them anyway.

********** Aren't romantic relationships built on the premise that said relationships will progress in a positive direction? The healthy, long-terms ones should be, at least.

Anticipating a downturn in the relationship is, in itself, a part of the downturn. It's more or less, "All romances work until the moment they don't." I doubt serious relationships are formed when someone involved thinks, "Wow, this will go down in flames!"

I think, in the context of fiction, a character who eschews romance after betrayal will be interpreted as an expression of the writer's political ideas, because the notion of such beliefs are so radical compared to social values that the model of a normal, ordinary person wouldn't do such a thing unless it's on purpose. And, well, I anticipate a reader dropping a book the moment its protagonist leans in the direction of that thinking, even if that thinking is completely reasonable, as the thought may not sit comfortably with readers without some extraneous rationale involved (sexism, racism, etc.).

***** I would argue fearing enemies targeting partners is usually unrealistic. The prevalence of family killing in fiction is more evil for evils sake than realistic. Enemies that don't have an issue with the partner alone = killing them gains nothing besides hardening your real enemy. If the partner is fighting the enemy they'd be trying to kill them regardless of the relationship. Exceptions to this would be things like bloodline or emotion based magic.

Betrayal is also very paranoid barring certain settings, if the enemy can turn your partner against you who can't they turn?
