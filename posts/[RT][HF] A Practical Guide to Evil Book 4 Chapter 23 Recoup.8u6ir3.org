** The power lies in *all of them*, each according to its kind.

Power isn't one thing, an arbitrary and yet somehow quantifiable force--an abstract distilled into a number by which one thing can be said to be more powerful than the others.

It's like asking "What is more powerful, the Rock, the Paper, or the Scissors."

***** Not even that. It's is not about the son and making him think, and is probably apocryphal anyway. Who was there to write their conversation down? Why write it at all if it was a lesson for the son?

No, this is a *teaching story*; it's intent is to make the reader/listener of the story being retold in the present "think, ponder and understand the relations between concepts". Hakram even said it's one of great many "conversations with her son" stories that used to exist; it's just a framing convention for imparting the lessons there in.

******* To be honest, it sounded like a parable or one of Aesop's fables. Not meant to be taken literally and the point is to impart a lesson/concept. Flows pretty well with that in mind considering how convoluted a lot of folklore and fables are

** I love how black is invading procer. He is throwing narrative weight on his side, because the evil army destroying bringing the good kingdom to it's knees before a brave band of heroes rises up in last minute defiance is such a powerful trope. If he plays his invasion right, the story favors him temporarily and we have already seen how all-powerful the story is in this world.

** The answer to the riddle of power is socialism. Seize the means of production.

Sounds like Warlord believed power springs from the masses, which works with what we know so far - cultures make stories, stories crystallise into Stories (through repetition? Proliferance? Faith?), people that fit those Stories gain power.

*** Two things from Game of thrones come to mind. The first is Varys' riddle:

#+begin_quote
  In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it,' says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.' ‘Do it,' says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.' ‘Do it,' says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.' So tell me -- who lives and who dies?”
#+end_quote

The answer he gives is that power lies where we believe it lies.

The second is in this [[https://youtu.be/zdRJybJ047I?t=1m19s][scene]]
