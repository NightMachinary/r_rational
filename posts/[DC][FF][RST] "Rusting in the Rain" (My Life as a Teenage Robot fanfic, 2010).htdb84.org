** This started out with an interesting premise, posing interesting questions about the nature of human-like AI and its integration into society, and getting me invested in the character and her problems.

The second half... was a long lecture on a myriad of philosophical ideas mainly about... the potential for human progress, I think. It didn't really engage with the premise posed in the first half and left me feeling disappointed.

*** Yeah, the second half didn't feel like someone on a journey of self discovery, it felt like...well, like a teenage girl being lectured to by someone who has taken /two/ sociology courses.

I mean, it fits the theme. It just didn't connect with me.
