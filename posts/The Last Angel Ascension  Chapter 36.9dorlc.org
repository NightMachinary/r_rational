*** New to me :/ But I've been out for a couple of weeks, so. Mostly, I haven't seen any of The Last Angel posted here in I think over a year.

*** The whole series is pretty decent and while the uploads might be fairly spaced out, there's a decent backlog and some other well written stories by the same author.

*** It's been a while since I've read this, so some of the details may be a bit off.

Humanity figures out how to make AI that doesn't immediately go mad. They get a few warships running, but their military apparatus is broken by the enemy, who then enslaves them.

Not having any supply lines, or the industrial capacity to make new ships, humanity's remaining AI warship harries the alien forces. In between battles it spends decades dormant gathering enough fuel and material to repair itself. The last battle was particularly damaging.

The AI is /terrifying/, an eldritch and unnatural monstrosity.

It's been about 300 years, and humanity is being allowed to enter into military service. For the first time, a boarding party including humans enters the apparently-dormant mystery ship...

**** I'm kinda confused how you jump to "the enemy".

I'd think AI would be nice, not Eldritch.

Thanks for the summary though.

***** The AI is pretty nice to humans (and a bit more) but is extremely hostile to the enemy forces, and frequently uses extreme terror tactics. It is seen as something like an eldritch horror to those trying to fight it.

*** Gradually-expanding humanity encounters a substantially large and more advanced conquering civilization that's race-caste based and very reminiscent of the aliens from Halo.

In the ensuing conflict, humanity is all but exterminated, save for one accidental colony ("Rally") and the one super capital AI-controlled warship (Red One, aka, The Last Angel) whose crew perished to the man during the war.

This ship has waged a guerrilla war of retribution ever since.

There's lots of details I've left out so you can read about them (why did humanity warrant extermination over conquest? why does no one else use AIs? how did the conquering civilization go from idealists to tyrants? why was rally spared? why did humanity's tech base fall so far?)
