** Hey you. Yes you. Cynic. I can hear you sneering.

"The Erogamer? Oh no. Not more anime highschool romance dating bullshit. I get enough of that cancer just by proxy of being someone interested in web fiction, thank you very much."

Well, no need to worry, this isn't it. A while ago someone tagged this as a "Lovecraftian sex comedy". And man, does this go weird places - story wise and LitRPG wise.

Look. Grit your teeth, figure out how to work a registration form, and read the first two arcs. Personally, that second arc (Charles) is the most entertaining thing I have /ever/ read. If you're not sold by then, you can have your money back.

*** I clicked myself a QQ account and am going to read it today. If it dissapoints me, im going to hold you responsible!

In any case, you should write reccomendations for books. I would not have touched this at all without this.

Fingers crossed. Please report your findings.

Edit: I'll add in that you should use the epub's linked around here. QQ isn't exactly easy on the eyes.

Even taking into account both of the hints in the beginning i am still surprised by what i have found. Far from catching up to the current update, but man this... dfuq.

***** Really? I find the epub to be a significantly worse reading experience than QQ. QQ's dark theme is basically my preferred visual experience for reading /anyway/, and the epub conversion breaks all the formatting on spoilerboxes and colored text and so forth that feature in the original.

Money? Why this fantastic story is completely free! And I have to completely agree with you, anyone who gives this story flac for being erotic fiction or an anime style ecchi Knockof is insane, it is likely the funniest thing I have ever read, and it's references to other Rational fiction are just as hilarious The first time I read the line "BREEDING? AGREEMENT." Had me in stitches for minutes. The fact that a story this well written, well thought out and well executed, about a girl who's life is slowly becoming an erotic visual novel, and the existential horror that such a thing provokes baffles and delights me on a daily basis.

I was sarcasm.

Personally it's the tangents that get me. Debunking Star Trek's prime directive or The fall of the old school Republican party or the exclusion of old people from media, and by extension, society.

Good stuff.

***** I know, I was carrying on the joke, being the straight man is a classic role of comedy.

I like those bits as well.

*** The Charles part was good, but I just got to the Mom Quests and literally had to close my eyes and force myself to start breathing normally again so that I could continue.

**** I'd say further on it varies in quality. Some of the stuff is a bit cringey, for my tastes. Meanwhile Charles' arc is not that far in, and is a great sell.

  Mom Quests
#+end_quote

I know, /right?/ I forgot those bits. God /damn/ that blindsided me. I was expecting the usual "arguing with mom about this shit" or "mom being oblivious to everything" arcs.

Instead Mom goes "Sounds great. I want in." Refreshingly rational. And hysterical.
