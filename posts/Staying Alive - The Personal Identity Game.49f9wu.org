** The game does not reward changing your mind based on new evidence. If you suddenly learn that you have an immortal soul, isn't it expected that you make different decisions than before, when you assumed that you did not?

(Incidentally, I still /prefer/ the Freezing outcome to the Reincarnation outcome. But I think my reasoning is less "my memories are the thing that's really me" and more "I care more about keeping my memories and personality alive than about keeping me alive", suggesting that by the rules of the game, I should ignore that reasoning and go with reincarnation.)

Also, obviously my soul survived teleportation in question 1, if it's still around to get reincarnated in question 3. But maybe, if we allow that reasoning, we also have to allow "I take the spaceship, because the game has three parts, so I know I'm not going to die in part 1."

*** That's fair, but it's an immortal soul that has no impact on your personality, can't form memories, hold emotions, have skills, or make decisions, but exists. Question 3 is mostly there for people who already think an immortal soul exists. I'm not a soul, though-- I'm a pattern of memories, thoughts, and actions. If a soul has no impact on that, it's not important to who I am. I suspect the question is in part there to make me admit that.

I don't /think/ that's how it can work; I'm not even sure that this is a coherent claim about souls. But I'm not 100% sure how personal identity works, so I should be willing to assume this kind of soul for the sake of the thought experiment.

Then again, I also can't imagine how we'd establish that that's how the soul works. So even if that's what a soul is, hypothetical me wouldn't be convinced of it.

Answer? Was that in the game for you? I wasn't shown that.

If not, I'm confused. There was /no/ evidence to suggest this in the scenario. For all we knew these soul things could have been some kind of extra-dimensional parasite that goes from brain to brain, feeding on excess voltage.

It's actually kind of amazing that anyone would assume that the strange ghosty thing that was described here was The Real You, with so little to go on.

**** Well, we don't have a lot of information about this supposed soul. Knowing it has just been discovered and we can be almost sure there is still a lot unknown about it (considering it must be very difficult to study) and we would be silly to assume something which such a strange mechanism of action definitely has so little use/meaning. It could well be that whatever they have managed to study is just one piece of the puzzle and the soul actually does retain memory somehow, just not in a way that can be expressed in the body it is reborn into.

It may, then, be possible in the future a soul that survives its many reincarnations could be somehow freed from the restrictions of body and remember all of its instances. In that case avoiding freezing is not just about saving myself it is about saving a near infinite multitude (all of which could be considered myself and are linked inextricably to it in some way).

***** Say I told you there was a being in a higher plane, reading your memories, and that you couldn't stop it from doing so even if you wanted to. When your heart gives out, it moves onto another human and starts copying their memories as well. Eventually, it will take all of those memories and do something with them. Let's say it decides what the truth of the world is, and generates some kind of goal function by combining approximations of all of the goal functions of the humans it has known, and it lives according to the result.

This is equivalent to the ghosty thing you've just described. Or, even closer to being an immortal soul than the ghostly thing you've described.

It is almost certain that the goal function it compiles is going to end up to some extent in conflict with the goal function you currently operate under, it is not going to be exactly the same, it will want different things, however subtle, it will disagree with you. You do not know what that being is going to be like, or how it's going to desire to live.

******* Ehh, although it's probably the case that humans arn't born with their goal function fully specified, that they're made by their culture (it seems obvious, but there are a lot of objections that can be raised), I don't think the goal function necessarily has to change in any way after the age of 20. You can get more information and dramatically change your behavior accordingly without any of it necessarily changing the formulation of your aspirations.

Racism for instance is often integral to the racist's identity, but it could often be said that it's only a consequence of a more reductive goal function, 'defend your family' → 'keep the gene pool clean' → 'subjugate blacks'. They may later learn that A: subjugating blacks is not really going to help their cause, or B: Many blacks have good genes. The consequent goals will fall away. They will seem to be very different people. They aren't. The core of their being, their purpose and aspiration, 'defend your family', hasn't been touched by the information they've received.

But sure a person's goals /can/ change over time as a natural process. That doesn't preclude using your temporal advantage to sabotage your future self's plans :P

*** Yup...a proof that the universe has souls /should/ cause massive re-evaluations. The psychological-reductionist view is /premised/ on no souls. What if the soul has some unknown purpose? Which traits, exactly, are soul related? Am i messing up a delicate balance involving a finite number of souls by taking mine out of the cycle? What happens to the person who would otherwise get my soul? You can't just drop the "there are magical souls" bomb on me so casually!

Also, even though I did choose the same one we probably all chose for conceit of the philosophy game, it occurs to me that when probabilities are not held constant between options it /should/ distort consistency. If i value the soul component at n = (n-1)*chance_of_cryo_revival_success it becomes even.

Also come to think of it the game is kind of inconsistent - if souls existed wouldnt we have noticed amid all that teleporting and silicon-ing? They already said the teleported version was identical, which given their claims that souls have real effects and apparently arent teleprted is false.

I /think/ the idea is that you've already teleported, so you only "win" if you already believed in souls. The aim is technically to /not die/, not be philosophically consistent.

The "soul" they talk about, which might slightly influence personality but basically does nothing, sounds essentially like persistent qualia, a metaphysical epiphenomenal dead-end.

Once you come back from being frozen, you're literally soulless, but as far as we can tell this has no actual consequences. You yourself are unable to determine that you are now a p-zombie.

I remember "playing" this game as a kid and making choices similar to what I made this time around. I went for Teletransport, Silicon, and Freezing. It seems I still primarily identify with having a consistent pattern of memories, preferences, and personality that changes in a contiguous way, rather than a particular body, physical brain, or immortal soul.

**** Yeah, this subreddit has an unusual number of people who think a certain way. When I was younger, I was somewhat uncertain about the Silicon decision. I thought that even if the output of a pattern was the same, the internals are more important, and felt there was no good answer to "keep the meatbrain and be replaced by someone else" and "cyborgize your brain and potentially be no longer the same".

Basically, it's like, imagine if my brain is =f(x) = 2x= , and if I cyborgize my brain it becomes =f(x) = x^2=, and the only test I have to run to see if things are the same is evaluating =f(2)= to check that it is =4=. Sure, the cyborgized brain has a similar output, but who knows if it is actually the same on the inside? Still, better to take a risk there than to 100% die by keeping the meatbrain and becoming not-me.

I'm less concerned about that now, since I think a pattern basically IS DEFINED BY the outputs it produces, and I imagine any such technology has a lot of data points, but it was something that made me hesitate.

That feels like treating consciousness as a "magical fluid" that has to be very carefully and slowly poured between vessels, lest it be spilled and not transfer properly. If you ask my intellect I don't believe I'm made of anything other than atoms so a process that arrives at the same arrangement of atoms (just /faster/) should be effectively the same ... but still my gut says there's a difference between the two.

So then I go back and forth between "There's no difference; clearly if a gradual replacement is fine then so is a one-off", "There's no difference; clearly if a one-off replacement means death then a gradual replacement means a gradual death, it's just that gradual deaths didn't exist before so I don't have good intuitions about where to draw the line" and "Maybe gut is right after all and there's a magical fluid involved".

********** Anesthesia is a difficult thing, but sleep most certainly isn't a break in consciousness.

I think a lot of people who make this assertion, that sleep is an interruption of consciousness, are just using the pre-packaged sleep 1.0. Sleep 1.0 is a cut-off of sensory input, followed by a rest state in the mind where sensory input is analyzed by binary yes-no wake functions while the consciousness moves to higher wavelengths (delta, up from alpha and beta), and while the brain implements a file/sort function, the consciousness prances around in a memory-space constructed by a uncontrolled procedural generator using data files linked to short and long term sensory data storage. Once a yes-function is called by the wake subroutine, either after a pre-programmed amount of time has passed, a strong sensory input is detected, or something else, the consciousness descends to lower wavelengths and returns to real-time processing.

The problem with sleep 1.0 is that, during the file/sort function, it sometimes dumps files. Basically, during sleep 1.0, memory files aren't stored in long or short term storage, but rather in a temp directory. A book I read years ago referred to these as "Shadow Memories", and I like that term, so I'll be using it here. These shadow memories occupy some limited space in the memory buffer, and are dumped if you don't commit them to short, then long, term storage. Shadow memories are typically the contents of actions taken while not fully awake (sleep walking, sleep talking, or those conversations you grunt through when people try to disturb a deep sleep), and dreams (the afore mentioned frolic through procedural generation gone mad).

If you take the time to learn meditation, you can actually open up the config menu of Sleep and start making your own distro. For example, if you clear your mind, enter a trance, and issue a command to your brain of "I will remember my dreams in detail" before going to sleep, you will, with practice, begin to recall your entire sleep cycle. Do so continuously, and commit the dreams to physical storage (for example, keep a written journal), and you will begin to recall hours of dream content. Practice sleeping and meditating properly, and you will develop the ability to regain lucidity during sleep, and alter your dreamscape. Most people have actually done this reflexively a few times in their lives, typically when the dream was highly sexual. Hell, I had a reflexive LD recently, where someone propositioned me for sex and I declined because I wanted to be faithful to my girlfriend (wasn't fully lucid because I wasn't able, at the time, to determine that I wasn't in objective reality, but still).

Or, you can issue the command of "remain aware", and slowly train yourself to be asleep, but aware of things around you. I don't recommend it, since it can get really boring to listen to your computer fans hum or a clock tick instead of dreaming, but you can do it.

Anesthesia is really weird, though. I've had surgery a few times, and while I can sort of remember some hazy memories, I cannot be sure that those are real and not just fake "fill in the gap" memories my brain generated. Unfortunately, I wasn't in the right state of mind right after the anesthesia wore off to grab pen and paper and record everything I remembered.

In almost all cases not involving physical laws, there is going to be at least some uncertainty in the odds of anything.

You can't ever really do more than estimating the odds of something, and you can only estimate based on the information you have.

In my mind, the basic premise of consequentialist utilitarianism is that if your estimate, based on all of your information, leads you to think one thing has better odds multiplied by expected utility than something else, then you should choose the option that maximizes that value.

This is the lesson behind the phrase 'shut up and multiply'.

** One of the frustrating things about this is that since it establishes the existence of a soul, but you still don't /know/ that before the last question so if you did it again you would /maybe/ give different answers. For the record I chose spaceship, silicon, death. If I knew about the last question before the fact, I don't actually think I would have answered differently, since I don't think there is actually good reason to think the transporter necessarily means you reincarnate into your new body, as opposed to it creating a clone. The second question is also tricky in light of the last question as well since the silicon might force you to be reincarnated whereas that seems less likely with the virus. I think that because if the soul can't survive a bit of cold I suspect it wouldn't survive me turning to silicon. If I somehow knew the silicon would force reincarnation I would pick the virus since I would retain more identity than if I was wiped and shoved in a new baby body. But as it stands I don't know enough.

The second question is somewhat problematic because wouldn't actually think /either/ result would mean death(assuming I don't know the soul thing before the fact), I generally care more about continuity of experience than about retaining personal identity but since I think neither would result in death I would take the option that keeps me with more of my identity. Of course whether I would pick that option in reality would depend on the details of the silicon replacement tech, also once I was replaced with silicon I probably wouldn't have chose to change back to a biological brain, so that it /assumes/ I would that bugs me.

**** So here's my question: how do you know you aren't already a clone?

Imagine that every night an alien force disassembles you in your bed to analyse your brain and body. Then it puts you back with some nebulous memories of dreams.

For the purposes of the hypothetical, assume that any people who might be able to contradict that version of events are /also/ abducted and disassembled.

How could you possibly know? By definition, it is impossible for you to experience a discontinuity of consciousness.

If the universe had been created wholesale 5 seconds ago with your exact pattern of thoughts and memories in progress, you would never know. If time was travelling "two seconds forward, one second back" at all times, you would never know.

Continuity of identity and consciousness is an assumption. A reasonable one, certainly; even if my hypotheticals /were/ true, they have no practical consequences, so there is no reason to dispute it.

The point, however, is that it only makes a difference to your decision-making because you were given the word of god that it's happening. If you were told that it wasn't a "disassemble -> reassemble" teleporter but a genuine "wormholes or whatever" teleporter, you would have absolutely no way of telling the difference from your own experience.

You would probably assume, in the absence of external evidence, that you /weren't/ being disassembled and reassembled when teleporting.

You cannot experience a discontinuity of consciousness, only be told about it. So if that continuity is what determines your identity, you must be /told/ whether you are the original you or not. You would have literally no way of working it out for yourself.

This isn't an argument to convince you or anything, merely more food for thought.

***** It's a good question, but from my point of view, it doesn't matter if I'm a clone, or if I were created wholesale five seconds ago. Given that I exist, and that I experience the world, I would like to continue experiencing the world.

So I don't have to be told that I'm the original, because if I'm there to be told, I have an identity that merits preserving. Post-transporter me is just as real and interested in continued existence as pre-transporter me.

Suppose aliens had a plan to kill you and replace you with a perfect clone. That clone would have all your mannerisms and memories, up to and including the moment of your death. The clone, therefore, would not have experienced a discontinuity of consciousness.

To my mind, the only difference between using the transporter and agreeing to die and be replaced by the clone is that the transporter spawns the clone on Mars instead of in my living room.

So it's not about "Was I killed as a result of going through the transporter?" As you say, the person who arrives at the destination will not remember anything amiss. It's about "Will I be killed as a result of going through the transporter?" Because persons who have been molecularly deconstructed are not capable of further experience.

As Arizth says, a wormhole transporter would not pose any difficulties. The person who departs can expect their own future to contain the experience of arrival. The person who takes the deconstructing transporter, meanwhile, expects that experience to be in somebody else's future. Just somebody else with the same memories.

Incidentally, this is also why I am not bothered by sleep. I expect that my own future will contain the experience of waking up tomorrow. From the inside, there is no way I can distinguish this from the alien disassembly. But the evidence I have from the world suggests that the alien option is unlikely.

If somebody told you it was a wormhole transporter but it was actually a deconstructing transporter, you wouldn't have that expectation. Even after using it a million times, you would never have a memory of being deconstructed.

I would be pretty pissed if someone I trusted told me it was a wormhole transporter when it wasn't, though. Just because I didn't know I was dying doesn't mean it didn't happen.

You could disprove it if they say you died, though; just open up the transporter to see how it works. If it's a wormhole transporter, you have your disproof.

The thing is, after using the transporter a million times without noticing bad effects, I discovered it was actually a deconstructing transporter, I would be just as adamant about not using it the million-and-first time.

To go from a cryonically preserved brain to an upload, however, only requires a scalpel and a very good microscope. (And a very fast computer.) As such, persistence of identity across uploading reduces the amount of technological breakthroughs necessary for future revival.

****************** Even then there's a difference.

With teleportation the question is, "Do I have myself disintegrated in the prime of life for the chance that I might survive in an identical body on the other side?"

With cryonics the question is "Do I have my body preserved after I die for the chance that either I, or at least a version of me, can be resurrected as a functionally immortal upload?"

While persistence of identity would be the ideal, I'd be willing to settle for the immortality of a copy of myself if that was the best I could get. But risking immediate death by teleporter for no benefit except traveling a long way to be in the same squishy organic body? No thanks.

*** Perhaps continuity of mind is rather vague, but it's certainly "continuity of the algorithm by which your decisions are made".

If everything is copied exactly (which in practice we might worry about), then what comes out of the teleporter will still remember the same things you remember, value the same things you value, and make the same decisions you would make.

********* Hm...

To see if I'm understanding your point correctly then, let me propose an additional scenario.

Teleporters have recently been invented. The method of FTL has a starkly limited volume capacity for each discrete jump, so those who travel through are disassembled, sent, and reassembled (fortunately, computers that utilize physical phenomena that also lead to FTL make the process of perfect reassembly well within reason).

A long-cycle comet, previously unobserved, is on a collision course with Earth. Its mass and velocity are sufficient to, using current impact models, sterilize the Earth down to around 9 miles below the surface, making survival via bunker unlikely. Given its high velocity, escape via physical craft seems impossible, due to construction time.

Am I correct in assuming you would prefer to send a 'copy' of you, to whatever safe destination has been chosen, through a teleporter?

*********** (<nods> Best would be if you could be scanned as a backup, then that used for teleportation if you didn't survive. I got criticised at the end for choosing both Spaceship and Silicon, but Silicon preserves (or at least stands to preserve) a lot more bodily continuity than Teleporter does, assuming that bits could be swapped out one by one while maintaining a continuous existence. Then again, through 'sleep=death' or the nature of brain organisation it could be that the idea of continuity was a doomed fantasy from the start, in which case Teleporter would be no worse than normal life (and thus better than Spaceship). For now, with Spaceship trying to leave myself hope on the off-chance that I do have a meaningfully continuous consciousness that I stand to lose.)

--Hmm, I just noticed I can separate my impulses there into 'altruistic' and 'hedonistic'. Altruistically, I'm fine with dying if copies of me can do the things I would have done in my place. Hedonistically, I personally want to eat delicious things much more, play many more computer games that haven't been released yet, and read entertaining fiction that hasn't be written yet even if it weren't intellectually stimulating at all--and those things (unlike learning things, preserving my memories, or doing good in the universe) are things I don't care at all about copies of myself doing, as they're things that I personally want to enjoy doing under the assumption that I'm a continuous experience that is going to get to do again things that I remember doing... hmm.

  Perhaps you made these choices because all along you thought that the continuity of the soul is what counts? If so, there is still a puzzle. How could teletransportation or replacing your organic body with synthetic parts ensure that your soul continues to exist? After all, the teletransporter transmits information about body states. Why would the soul follow this information?
#+end_quote

Why wouldn't it? It's a soul! It's literally a magic extradimensional me-marker! Of /course/ anyone who believes in souls is going to believe they'll follow whatever they view as "me".

(Although admittedly, a soul that's killed by freezing a strange soul indeed. But I didn't know about that!)

In general, I think these sorts of test assume far too much; they basically only test for a handful of specific positions the author already kind of agrees with, leaving the majority of the population irritated rather than persuaded.

Anyway, they should've told us that what matters is /consistency/, not specific choices.

I guess that's for the better, because it would be frustrating if author of the 'game' assumed that 'bodily continuity' is what matters.
