Irrational fiction, A.K.A "all fiction other than rational fiction." You know, regular stories, by regular authors, that you just happen to like! Post 'em!

This is not quite off-topic enough to belong in the weekly off-topic thread, I hope. I have a feeling a lot of the top-level responses in this thread will be /almost/ skirting the line of being rational fiction, just because that's where this community's tastes lie. (But they don't have to be! If there's this one idiot-ball story so well-written in other ways that you just can't help but love it, please share that, too!)

Also Warbreaker is a good (free) entry point but I think his writing has improved significantly in some of his later books. I don't think I would have liked it as much if I wasn't already fully invested in the Cosmere by the time I got to it. /Mistborn: The Final Empire/, /The Emperor's Soul/, or even diving right into /The Way of Kings/ might be the best hooks to start.

*** Man, I have such mixed feelings about the Prince of Nothing series.

I've only read it once several years ago but I remember having real trouble getting through it. The constant namedropping of all the fantasy terms felt clunky and the characters - while somewhat realistically portrayed - weren't likable, at all. It got tiring reading about ruthless scheming all the time.

At the same time, the sheer amount of philosophy in the text was staggering. It was intertwined with the story and the metaphysics so well that you couldn't help asking questions. It had the best magical system of any fiction I've read.

I didn't know there was a followup. Does it have similar problems?

*** Just recently finished the initial Prince of Nothing trilogy. I feel very weird about it. I feel like if you asked me if I liked them? I'd say "No. The wording was a bit too dense and pretentiously abstract for me. It also suffered from showing too much while telling too little. Very easy to get confused and turned around; especially because the author created this rich, realistic world and setting but very rarely are there expositions or conversations explaining the world. We all know that too much exposition is a bad thing but too little is also bad, especially when you have a rich, diverse world with a huge amount of back story."

And on the other hand, I'm very curious about the continuation and possibly getting the second apocalypse continuations soon so clearly some parts of me got invested enough to enjoy it enough to finish three decent length books and want to read more.

Well, I really didn't want to keep linking the same author, so I stuck to one book each. On reflection, perhaps I really ought to have listed /A Christmas Carol/ for Dickens...

Regardless, these are sorts of books that make me despise /rational/ fiction. Not because it's bad, just... less developed and refined in comparison. Maybe we'll get there, eventually. The other day I was reading /The Mosquito Coast/ and I was blown away by how dense it was (as in more ideas and clever lines per page than I've come to expect.) In my head I was going "Dear rational fiction writers: please be more like this."

***** You also should consider that here you're comparing absolute literary giants against mostly amateur fan writers. That's a bit of a high bar :). HPMOR might be one of the best fanfics out there, but it's still a fanfic written by a scientist who entertained himself with writing - not a professional master of the pen.

Elsewhere in this thread I mentioned Umberto Eco. As an incredibly erudite connoisseur of the letters, he may not have been as good a writer as some of the names mentioned above, but he was /very/ good, and his novels show off all of his knowledge and smarts. "The name of the rose" is probably his best known in the English speaking world - and yet possibly his lesser work. Perhaps his most "rational" work is "Foucault's Pendulum", an incredibly elaborate (and ponderous! Most people don't have an easy time finishing it) takedown of conspiracy theory mentality, the story of three friends who craft out of thin historical evidence a fictional theory about Templar knights, Freemasons and who knows what else trying to take over the world - and the theory is so good, it gets them in trouble by convincing the crazies a little too much. It's incredibly rife with historical detail, and the amount of consistency and referencing the three protagonists put into their fictional world-building (as they craft their alternative history of the world) is stunning.

That said, now I'm disappointed in all other fics, because I really want a Xianxia/Cultivation fic where the protagonist progresses because of relevations about how magic works, instead of just popping pills or deus ex machinas in the form of macguffins.

Cradle is actually really good because in comparison to those other Xianxia fics, it deconstructs the genre, and is definitely more satisfying.

However, Cradle does not go far enough for me in the whole revelations about magic thing. It is far better than any other xianxia fic I've found, though.

If the cast of this story were a couple in a relationship, a couples' counsellor would be telling them that they have communication problems. (And, despite the protagonist being "full of questions", they just completely ignore these particular questions. I've counted exactly one instance so far where the protagonist asked "why" a person they're talking to made a particular decision.)

***** If you don't mind quest-style works (works that are written with the main character acting as voted on by the readers - kind of a realtime choose-your-own-adventure/roleplay kind of thing), there's [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]], on Sufficient Velocity. The pacing is kind of weird because of the format, and the main character's time in the sect is very drawn out. It makes it have kind of a "magical boarding school" feel to it, made even stronger by the fact that the main character is very focused on the friendships she makes with her peers and the ways internalizing techniques affects her personality.

I don't have very much to compare it to since I haven't read other Xianxia, but according to people commenting on it in the thread, it stands up very well compared to other stories in the genre. From what I understand, the main character is in some ways very much like a traditional Xianxia protagonist (shes a highly talented commoner who attracts the attention of the powers that be and has very good luck as far as finding loot), but in others very much unlike a traditional protagonist (she makes friends fairly easily and is very dedicated to them; she's next to useless in a straight melee or fistfight; she focuses heavily on intrigue, politics, and often infiltration). So - to the degree I am familiar with either genre - I think the best way to describe it is Xianxia meets boarding school fantasy, both structurally and thematically.

- /Division by Zero/ by Ted Chiang
- /Fragments of a Hologram Rose/ by William Gibson

Longer Things, in order of somewhat increasing seriousness

[I went with my fairly irrational tastes]

- /Guards!, Guards!/ by Terry Pratchett
- /Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency/ by Douglas Adams
- The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson
- /Cat's Cradle/ by Kurt Vonnegut

/Focault's Pendulum/ by Eco which was brought up here as one of the monthly books a while back was also a lot of fun.

Feel free to ask questions about any of these! Also does anyone here have any good horror recommendations? I've really enjoyed most things by Lovecraft (sans the racism and terrible dialog) and /House of Leaves/

** The Magicians trilogy by Lev Grossman? Maybe?

I hadn't ever read them, but I've been aware of their existence for a few years, so I recognized the second book when I saw it at a thrift store, and it was only three bucks, so I bought it. Then I went on Amazon and found the first book, used, for less than two bucks (plus shipping, of course). It only just came in the mail a few days ago, and I've only done one reading session with it so I'm only about 70 pages in, and I'm hesitant to recommend something I haven't fully read, but from what I've seen so far it seems to be at least skirting the line of being "rational adjacent;" it's very clearly a deconstruction-type-thing on Harry Potter and Narnia. From the limited amount I've read so far, it seems fun and enjoyable and stuff, and I'm quite sure it'd be my favorite thing if it had existed when I was like 15ish.

And I'm surprised I haven't seen the His Dark Materials trilogy recommended in this thread. Those might literally be my favorite books, if I were forced to rank all of the books I like.

Sounds right. Not skirting the line of being rational fiction, and not rational adjacent, but skirting the line of being rational adjacent.

** My favourite Irrational fiction likely goes to Mushoku Tensei, a Japanese web novel, it follow the main character, Rudeus Greyrat, as he is reincarnated from a NEET in his 30s to a babe in a fantasy world.

His death was less than peaceful and his life in our world a tad despicable, so he vows that he will live life to the full in this world, putting in the effort where he lazed away in ours.

The story is part fantasy adventure and part slice of life, it has action in it but it is never the point of the story, the main theme of the series is basically that of coming of age as Rudeus grows and gains experience we (as he does) realise that he was never really and adult in our world, and that he still needs to grow in order to be one.

It is a story that holds a special place for me as it got me through some very hard times in highschool, it has remained one of my favourites despite parts of it being machine translated, and it's questionable sexualization of minors.

Kumo desuga, nanika? (Yeah im a spider, you got a problem?)

my death flags show no sign of ending

Some similar quality as mushoku:

** I'm not sure how to qualify this, but José Saramago's "The Gospel according to Jesus Christ" is one of my favourite books ever. It's extremely well written and extremely deep, and a savage tearing down of Christianity's fundamental myth. In a way, however, it might not qualify, because you could as well describe it as a rational rewriting of the gospels. Just one with prose and craft so fucking good it won the author a Nobel Prize.

Another favourite of mine is Umberto Eco's "Baudolino". Though that one too has some "rational" elements - like a certain murder mystery that is solved through applying limited Medieval knowledge - it mostly is a story told by an unreliable narrator containing fantastical elements, so I think it's irrational enough for the purposes of this thread!

** I really love [[https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force][Legacy of the Force]], in spite of presumably having a lion's share of idiot balls. Two caveats, though: i) it's not so comprehensible without knowing at least the broad strokes of 1990s/2000s Star Wars Expanded Universe (although it has been to some degree promoted as a potential jumping-on point) and ii) it is widely hated by fans of the old EU (primarily for characterization which is incosistent with previous series, and, of course, for the idiot balls).

Why do I like it? Well, it's very much how a sequel to Star Wars would look if written by fans of the prequels (and I consider myself to be one), compared to the current movies which are clearly OT nostalgia. Expect a lot of politics, decision making, and a lack of a clear focus on the protagonist (a significant number of minor characters really shine during their brief POV moments). It may not be to the taste of everyone here, but I end by mentioning that last time I read it, I enjoyed it kinda in the same way I enjoyed HPMOR.
