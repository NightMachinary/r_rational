** Good writing and I was pleasantly surprised and lol'ing at the Midichlorians explanation - I would not have expected such a lovely excuse to be findable. But I really hope the horribly wrong invocations of Vinge's principle and Graham's Number were meant as humor.

** Wow, this is really interesting. I enjoyed everything about the story.

My only issue is that I just wish it wasn't posted on space battles. That place can be so shit to navigate and follow stories.I understand its appeal, but it's not a format that's suited to what is being used for.

Edit: space battles-> forum format site

*** There's the threadmarking system now, which basically provides an instant index. And if you make an account you can fiddle with the preferences to only get story posts in your notifications.

**** Yeah, my mistake. Regardless, the same criticism applies. I will concede that from what I've seen sufficient velocity writers are better about indexing their stories.

*** It isn't hard to navigate assuming you're a member.

There's even a function in alerts now so you only get a message if the OP posts something over 500 characters(?).

But, yeah, it is hard for guest readers.

*** Seconded. I prefer Fanfiction.net, Archive of Our own, and the like for one simple reason: it's really easy to convert to a format readable on my Kindle with Calibre. I just vastly prefer to read stories on a black-and-white eink screen; it's more like reading print.

** u/Nevereatcars:
#+begin_quote
  The program Nove had wanted him to run was right there; lightsaber training.

  He loaded up the porn instead.
#+end_quote

10/10 bookmarked favorited right there.

** It has the common above-average fanfic disease of furiously jerking it to its own detailed altered world and world history instead of telling a good, clear story in the here and now.

I don't really care enough to dig through that much "tell" to get to the good parts. There are those, I assume. But they didn't exactly make me care enough about any characters in the critical first chapter for me to want to continue.

Then right into more world-building through encyclopedia entries? Blah. Hell, I care more about the Master we see for two paragraphs, and why he hands out drinks to the failed students, than I care about this born loser of a protagonist or the AU changes the writer has painstakingly worked out and is now typing up from their notes.

*** It is a factor, although there's a section of readership which gets off on the history as much as the characterization. Being able to balance it is the mark of a great author. And you could even say that Tolkien, for instance, was more about the world-building than telling a story which showed it off.

**** And yet The Lord of the Rings barely brushes on the mythology of the world - most of that is in the supplemental texts. Instead, it's an epic story about the end of an age and a very English hobbit thrust into adventure and misadventure.

** Not bad as far as rationality in MC goes. Would be better if the emotion descriptions were cut back a little bit, maybe a quarter of what they are now.

Sensible goal behavior by Jedi, and what I assume is a Sith Lord (no confirmation on that). Culture seems a little outdated for people who can live a long time, why no mind drugs and VR? Great use of future sensing by everyone so far.

The lore bits would be better as a in story clue than what they are now, but I like the rationale behind the scientific lack of progress, as well as scientifically accurate methods(or at least the ones I know are accurate)

Would benefit from more character descriptions, so far only the boss and Twielk man get some semblance of appearance (I could be wrong on this, i can sometimes forget or misread the details)

Bonus point: aliens that come from vastly different eco systems need vastly different arrangements for living.

** It's an interesting story with an interesting premise, and I'll definitely be following it. But I can't help but think that it's so AU that it might be better off as an original story. Change the proper nouns a bit, add a little more detail for the jargon as it's added, and you have an original SF work.

** Ouch, that was evil. "Ooh, a Rationalist approach to my favourite fictional universe! Just what I need to make waiting for the new Episode bearable. Especially since all the other good stuff is either finished or on hiatus." (after 5 chapters) ...oh you've got to be kidding me.
