/Dynasty's Ghost/: A sheltered princess and an arrogant swordsman must escape the unraveling of an empire. ([[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19159/dynastys-ghost][Contents]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19159/dynastys-ghost/chapter/237928/chapter-8-consequences-of-a-single-action][Chapter 8]])

/Rebels Can't Go Home/: A hunter-gatherer on an alternate world becomes involved in the fate of space-faring refugees. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8yvx4a/rebels_cant_go_home/][Chapter 1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/91v7xt/rebels_cant_go_home_chapter_12/][Chapter 12]])

/Rebels/ has been updated daily since the beginning, /Dynasty's Ghost/ gets two chapters/week. /Rebels/ is currently hosted on Reddit; /Dynasty's Ghost/ is currently on Royal Road.

Additional Recommendation: In case you missed a comment where I mentioned this one--Brandon Sanderson's [[https://brandonsanderson.com/books/warbreaker/warbreaker/][/Warbreaker/]] (completely online), in part because I think the [[https://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-warbreaker-dedication/][annotations]] are fascinating.
