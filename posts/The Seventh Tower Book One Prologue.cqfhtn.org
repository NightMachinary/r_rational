I've decided to narrate one of my favorite childhood series as it doesn't have an audiobook or ebook available online, other than pirating a poorly done ebook series. This is a warm up to narrating Pokemon: Origin of the Species, if I don't fuck up narrating too horribly.

I would like some feedback on my first blind read through, as we have many people in this community who do podcasts and narrations themselves.

Some disclaimers:

Still learning about how to use Audacity and editing within it. Have yet to get a sound mixer. Also I recorded this while getting over a strep infection because if I didn't start I would never get around to it.


** Oh man, I loved those books as a kid. And never finished them, I believe. I don't usually do audiobooks but I'll give this a listen.

*** Thanks! I plan on releasing new chapters every Friday. I'm aiming at 5 or so chapters a week, depending on how much better I get at editing and recording it may go up to more.

** Whoa, props to you for doing this!

I auditioned the opening minute or two, a couple paragraphs in the middle, and the last couple minutes. Here are some thoughts, in order of significance:

1. Your enunciation is quite clear to me. There's a little room for improvement but I think it wouldn't be a high priority to do so.

2. Your pacing is very stable! This is good, except where it may detract a little bit from dramatism/emphasis. I'd absolutely prefer to err on the side of steady, so great job here too!

3. As suggested above, you could use some more dramatic tone/dynamic shifts; the recording is a little monotone.

4. I think the slight amount of /timbre/ change I heard at the end (for the shadow?) was good, and sufficient in magnitude. If you're good at the latter, feel free to expand on it, but I don't think that's necessary.

5. This one's fairly minor, but I noticed a difference in volume between the middle and the end; this is a slight editing or mic placement/usage issue, and may not be of significant impact. It's /maybe/ enough to make someone want to adjust the volume on their device while listening, which isn't great.

6. On the subject of editing, I noticed a slight jump in the last minute or two where you either stumbled or perhaps edited two cuts together a bit too suddenly. This is also quite minor.

Overall, great job! This sample is far better than I could expect from this context!

*** Thank you!

Yes enunciation was my biggest priority. I have a doc of words made up for the story and their phonetic pronunciations. I hope to stay as consistent as possible with that.

3.In what way would you say it is monotone? Dramatic shifts as in speed of reading or my pitch? I definitely do not want the book to sound the same the whole way through. I thought I was getting the tone down but perhaps it was all in my head.

1. Thanks! I was actually very nervous about how that would come off. I'm glad someone liked it. I plan on attempting different voices for each character, we'll see how it comes out.

2. Yes, I'm still struggling with making everything sound the same on audacity. That's something I hope consistently improves as I record. Once I get it down pat I plan on rerecording this first prologue.

3. Thanks for the heads up! The last couple of minutes took me a whole hour and a half to record, as I kept stumbling over myself due to anticipation of almost being done. I think it is composed of over 35 separate recordings so I'm not surprised the spacing is strange.

Thank you for the critique! I found it really helpful while reviewing my recording!

**** Glad you found it helpful! It was not at all obvious (i.e. I didn't realize) that you stitched quite so many takes together; good job on that.

Re: monotone -- it wasn't quite to the point that I would call "monotone" but overall you might want to try some /extremely/ dramatic swings of emphasis and get some feedback (including your own) on how extreme it sounds upon playback. I think it might be one of those things that is much more obvious to you as the performer and much less noticeable to the audience; I have had the same issue while playing piano :)

*** No. This is not rational at all. It's just a story I enjoyed. I know there's been a clamor for a Pokemon: the Origin of Species audiobook and I want to do that.

But I dont want to mess it up, not having done audio narration before. So Im doing this and posted it here looking for critiques.

I trust this community's judgment on quality. I didnt really know how to label it or where to post it otherwise.

** I don't listen to audiobooks, but here are two quick comments as follow up from my mic recommendation. Mostly, I would suggest fixing whatever is causing the background noise in the first 2:50. The audio quality improves a lot after. Mic position and background noise matters quite a lot to overall sound with any mic. Second, [[https://www.audacityteam.org/download/]].

*** Yes I had a fan going on for those first few minutes of recording. I turned it off afterwards and that's probably what that is.

I'm an idiot and wrote audible instead of audacity in my post. Thanks for helping me figure that out lol
