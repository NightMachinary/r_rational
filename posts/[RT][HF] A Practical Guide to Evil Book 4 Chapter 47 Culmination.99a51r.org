To be fair that was Archer. The ones Cat killed didn't have time to properly surrender.

Did Malicia forget to Speak to the people around her in this vitally important mission? Is this a bluff and there's another puppet, or even the /real/ Dread Empress, still in Keter?

** Can someone explain how this worked? Masego has shown time and again that sorcery can beat aspects, and the dead king is as good as it gets with that; notably, he made this good enough to keep out /ranger/, but aomehow a shadow of akuas name, which wasnt even meant for fae, is enough?

I also didnt think that was what call did, either; im pretty sure an akua chapter said what if did, and it was something to do with control?

*** It is extremely likely that wards, like everything else in Creation, are based in application of narrative. They are boundaries, meant to enforce the will(s) of a caster or collective casting group.

Because of this, I would theorize that far and other such beings are naturally more susceptible to such bounding, being creatures /created of narrative/. Similarly, humans, bring life created by the gods to escape the eternal question, are inherently less susceptible to warding schema.

Now, Cat is something else entirely, a demigod, and the whistle she holds is narratively extremely powerful. On top of that, the Dead King is literally allowing her to do as she pleases. It is entirely possible that the passive actions of the story actually cause his warding scheme to be permeable to any summon that Cat makes, as it is done with his tacit permission. It is also possible, given Cat's travel through Arcadia to Keter, that he has never bothered to ward against fae. Or that he has simply removed fae wards in light of Catherine's presence. It could be any of those things and more besides. We can only speculate.

*** Option 1: The wards didn't anticipate portals being created from inside Keter. When Cat made her portal in the Threefold Reflection, the exit emerged in Keter, which means you can enter Keter by Arcadia /sometimes./ It seems like an oversight on Neshamah's part, but he did have a named elf standing guard, and it's possible he assumed it wouldn't really matter how mobile a fae incursion was once it was already in his walls. It might have just been an engineering challenge that wasn't worth the effort at the time; we know he didn't anticipate Cat's apotheosis (at least, very far in advance).

Option 2: The whistle is a summons, and not a normal one. It bypasses the need to actually /travel/ through Arcadia at all. And consider: the Wild Hunt is formidable, but unlikely to topple a major city on its own, provided it's not caught by surprise. Perhaps the most dangerous things that can be summoned are angels and demons, and Neshamah subdued an entire Hell, and has since grown in strength, so I doubt he's worried about the latter. It could be that summons aren't a major concern to him.

Option 3: It happened because Neshamah let it. It's mentioned several times that many of the oversights that permitted their plan to work have been incredibly improbable, and Cat has speculated that Neshamah was politely, indulgently looking the other way. He could have quietly permitted the summons.

*** She summoned Fey outside of the ward, entirely bypassing it. Ward was just made to keep her and Winter contained within (plus some obvious additionals, like blocking physical projectiles, I figure), not to keep her from interracting with the world in general. Call wasn't a Winter thing, so it's action could go outside of the ward. If she had Kilian in a pocket that could shoot normal non-Winter fireballs that'd have worked too, I think.

EDIT: oh, you mean that they opened gates within Keter. Yeah, dunno what is up with that.

** At this point, the excursion to Keter was worth it purely to stop Malicia's deal. Even if Cat doesn't cut a deal with Neshamah like she originally intended, she has successfully stopped a significant expansion of the Kingdom of the Dead without any real cost to the Woe other than time. Stopping this deal was a win for Callow.

We also know, though, that the original deal she came to make is a bigger gamble than ever. If Cat ultimately decided to provide Neshamah his invitation, Malicia could very well report it to the Grand Alliance. Regardless of the potential military consequences of that, we have to remember that Cat's primary goal is the signing of the Liesse Accords, and she just won't have the political standing to push any kind of international agreement if she's seen cooperating with the Dead King.

I think her best bet now would be to give up the negotiations in Keter, instead reporting to the Grand Alliance that, "Hey, I just prevented an alliance of Praes and the Dead Kingdom from sweeping down into Procer." Given Procer's long history as beings of pure bitch, they wouldn't credit her, but it definitely couldn't /hurt/. Callow would be proud of Cat, too, which helps with the whole civil unrest thing.

Honestly, though? I expect the deal to go through, and I expect the Pilgrim to use as leverage in his quest to redeem Cat to death.
