** I think Red Axe legitimately has a pretty good point. The T&T does in fact protect absolutely hideous people from the repercussions of the things they've done - and it means that they will face no punishment, even after all of this is over. This is a world based on story logic. Do you think that the conscripts that helped in the war to kill the Dead King will be punished at the end of their duty? No, they'll get off scot-free. That's the end of the story. The end of one era and the start of the next necessarily means the creation of a blank slate - and stories crossing between the two are going to be far and few between. Cat never really grapples with this; to her, the only thing that matters is killing the Dead King, even if it involves letting a rapist live. Cat's new era and blank slate have real costs and the costs are all the people, usually villains, who have killed or raped countless people getting away with it in the end. The T&T don't ask for heroes to make compromise with Evil, they ask for heroes to make compromise with evil, which is of course a much harder ask.

**** because the world is built on stories and the end of the dead king's story is the end of an era - there is no punishing people for the stories that happened before the end of the era.

***** Wat

Literally nothing about Calernia or Creation suggests that is the case. No one becomes immortal or unpunishable because a shift in the overall narrative has occurred.

The end of the DK's story is just that, the end of the DK. It would usher in alongside it a new era of limited Named conflict if Cat gets her way, but nowhere in the Accords nor in Cat's mind does that say Named cannot be punished for their actions.

Cat herself would be the first one behind Red Axe to stab the Enchanter once the Truce was over, even under the accords.

There's gonna be a fuckton of Named conflict once the DK goes down or is put back in his box. Old greivances will be executed the second the T&T is declared null and void. I give Cat even odds of getting out of the declaration without being wounded by someone on either side. And a 100% chance Cat proceeds to gank at least one villain.

They are literally asking for heroes to choose the lesser of two evils, /for now/.

The Dead King has done far worse than the Wicked Enchanter did; sure, it's not fair to let the Wicket Enchanter get off scot-free, but is it any better, in any sense, in /any universe/, to let the Dead King get off because you can't /delay gratification/ until the Dead King is dealt with?

**** The PGtE world is based entirely on stories. The end of the story of the Dead King and the start of the new era that Cat envisions is essentially offering a blank slate to the rapists and murderers that some Villains are. Like, the T&T is the foundation of the Accords and the T&T is a blank slate for all those villains in question - so when all this is over, those villains will get off for free because that is how a blank slate works. Cat can say all she wants that she wouldn't care if they died after the fact but the reality is that she is completely ignoring the story momentum of the T&T and the fight against the Dead King and what that would mean if it all works in the end.

***** "Having to face consequences for a wrong committed a long time ago" is also a story trope, often one that leads to a "Redemption equals death" story. The absolute /worst/ that could have happened would be that the Wicked Enchanter survives the war, completely redeems himself and became a good person, never raping or torturing anyone after that, in which case the Red Axe gets to become the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist][Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist]], an archetype that /often wins/ (despite being an /antagonist/ archetype). Much more likely, the Enchanter will die in the war against the Dead King, or, if he doesn't, he'll revert to his previous behaviour fairly quickly and the Red Axe will get to hunt him down completely scot-free.

So, the Enchanter will be either be dead, or legitimate prey, fairly shortly, and all the Axe is being asked to do until then is /prioritize the war against the greater evil/. Not to let bygones be bygones, not to forgive and forget, just to put the grudge on hold /until the existential threat is dealt with./

****** Let me know how Cat would have reacted if she was raped and then told that she mustn't seek retribution against her rapist because it would be too inconvenient. It is simply a fact that the blank slate of the T&T will create a blank slate that the Accords are based on - absolving people of their crimes from before it. Cat created a world where people like the Wicked Enchanter will get away with everything that they ever did before - and the only hope for justice is that they get caught doing it again, in the future. Cat's expectations are that people should ignore whatever injustice was done to them - you must of course think of the greater war effort and do whatever is necessary. The whole sum of Red Axe's point is that the T&T weren't actually the only thing she could have done, it was just the easiest solution and the one that would give her the largest number of soldiers. There are flaws to that approach and to pretend otherwise is absurd.

I suppose "inconvenient" is one word to describe "The Dead King is given free rein over a large portion of Calernia."

And I certainly can't think of any character who has an arc of "she horribly wronged Cat and uncounted other people" and passed through "Cat stopped seeking retribution against her because it would just be too inconvenient to not have her around on Cat's side."

I've been thinking about the literary concept of redemption a lot recently. What would it really take for me to say the good that a person has done really should be remembered more than whatever atrocities they've committed? I can't say that "risking their life to save the world" would be /enough/ (certainly not if they went right back to their old habits), but I'd at least say it would make a good /start/.

Named, in this universe, are tremendous force multipliers. Losing the Wicked Enchanter (and, almost certainly, the Red Axe as well) won't single-handedly lose them the battle against the Dead King, but having two fewer Named could cost /thousands/ of non-Named lives. How many /more/ people than the Wicked Enchanter ever harmed are going to die because the Red Axe couldn't prioritize?

#+end_quote

I wouldn't say "ignore" (more like "live with"), but /yes/. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few: it's a concept that any "hero" should be familiar with.

Sure, they weren't the only thing. I'll throw you a bone and say that they might not have even been the /right/ thing. But, in the situation Cat was in, it was the best solution that she could come up with.

And if the Red Axe had /offered/ a better solution, one that allowed both a non-Pyrrhic victory against the Dead King as well as a more sturdy moral ground to build upon when the war was over, I could respect her for that. Instead, she's just trying to burn the Truce and Terms to the ground and tell Cat to "do better or be cast aside."

And the cost of that, of discarding the Truce and Terms without replacing them with something at least /nearly/ as acceptable, would be heroes and villains turning on each other and all of Calernia falling under darkness. Would that be justice? Would you and she /then/ be satisfied that the debt to her had been repaid? Because /that/ is the price she not just was willing to be paid, but was /trying/ to be paid. And that sounds more like the act of a villain than any hero I'd name.

No one is "pretending otherwise." I've used the idea "lesser of two evils" several times in this conversation because it is an illustration that yes, Cat's method of solving this has flaws. It /is/ an evil to sweep the harm that people have done under the table, in the name of fighting a different evil; who could possibly deny that? Letting someone like the Wicked Enchanter skip merrily away from the deeds they've done is /absolutely/ evil. But it's a /necessary/ evil. And I would like to see any sort of argument that you have that it's not the lesser one.
