** I'm excited about homestuck 2 too, but does this really belong here? Homestuck is pretty solidly irrational, imo.

*** Despite the sub being nominally for rational fiction independent of genre, in practice it seems pretty common for people to post works with themes that people who like ratfic tend to also like. Time travel, AI, multiple universes, multiple timelines, metafiction, exploiting the rules of a setting to "break" things, apotheosis...I don't know if it's rational, but thematically Homestuck is crack for at least a subset of rational fiction enthusiasts. And I don't want to spoil it, but the premise of the epilogues and sequel may be even more so.

*** I mean, I was confused to see this here at first too, but actually upon closer inspection, I think it might count as rational?

The rules of the world are complex, but fairly consistent. The characters don't usually behave irrationally, unless it's explicitly a part of their personality...

I can't think of why it /shouldn't/ be here?

**** I feel like it's similar to Unsong, because the world it takes place in is very irrational. Things literally happen because they need to for plot reasons. Time travel exists with fairly strict rules, but retconning exists and breaks all those rules and doesn't appear to follow any of its own.

Also, a lot of the foreshadowing seems like it's retroactive, ie it literally didn't mean anything at the time but then did later, which kinda goes against the idea of the “fair play whodunnit”. Can't think of any examples though.

Might just be simpler than that and it's just that Homestuck isn't particularly rational, even if it's not irrational either.

***** I wouldn't say that retconning doesn't follow any rules, but those rules are much more abstract than typical stable time loops. I'd say "isn't particularly rational, even if it's not irrational either" is a good summary of my view as well, but I think the deconstructive and meta-narrative nature of Homestuck's 'pseudo-canon' or whatever we're calling everything after Act 7 makes for some interesting rational-adjacent discussion.

Maybe Homestuck^2 shouldn't get linked for every update like an ongoing rationalist work, but I'd love to see occasional discussion threads about particularly interesting and relevant moments. Heck, I've been thinking of something comparing how genre savviness works in Homestuck to how it works in PGtE, both being works where at least some characters have explicit knowledge of the narrative nature of their reality and who attempt to exploit this knowledge for their own goals.

#+begin_quote
  Things literally happen because they need to for plot reasons.
#+end_quote

That part, at least, doesn't seem too dissimilar from PGtE's universe running on story logic.

****** I would even argue that in several cases, "things happening for plot reasons" WAS "characters making rational decisions which serve their interests" when it was the author, as a character, nudging things in person to bridge gaps.

Conversely, there really weren't any plot holes that were truly ignored, only parts of the story that the villain deliberately destroyed because a) he had that power and b) using it allowed him to achieve his goals. If we don't get to see the part that could make certain developments really make sense, at least it's an intentional cop-out EVEN IN-UNIVERSE, rather than a mere fluke.

It meets the spirit, if not the letter of rational criteria, since the author's effort and attention shows through the gaps, rather than a lack thereof

**** I'm not the OP, but for me, it was the retcon stuff, the finale, the epilogues, and the epilogues. Fuck epilogues.
