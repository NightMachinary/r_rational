** I think there's something to be said for ditching a large portion of your audience right off the bat because they aren't like you.

#+begin_quote
  Our reader is, in many ways, unknowable, because we have no idea of who will end up picking up our work. We do know some things, though: Their background probably won't match ours. Their tastes will be different. Their age group and education will be different to an unknown degree. And, there's a 50-50 chance that their gender will be different, too. In fact, it's unlikely that we and a given reader have all that much in common.
#+end_quote

This isn't true. If I write a story and post it to somewhere like [[/r/rational]], then I know a great deal about my average reader; I know that the average age will tend to be a bit younger, that they'll tend to be a bit better educated, and that they've been exposed to certain concepts before. I can generally assume that they're not religious. They'll be male /far/ more than 50% of the time. (Assumptions like this generalize to all publishing, which is intrinsically tied to marketing and word-of-mouth.)

So why would I want to write for the ideally anonymous reader, especially when this is almost certainly going to make things worse for the people who already have the appropriate background? If I want to write a book that's steeped in videogame tropes, I'm going to make the book /worse/ for people who don't share that cultural knowledge. I mean, I'm not going to go out of my way to alienate readers, but if I'm writing what amounts to a commentary on effective altruism, then I don't think that I'm well-served by explaining effective altruism first, because the commentary is going to be largely lost on someone who has only been introduced to the concept a few pages back. (I feel like this idea is really central to fanfic, where writers are often offering their own variation/commentary on canon.)

We already know that there exists a set of "people who will read the book", and we know that there are differences between that set and the set of "people who will not read the book", so why constrain ourselves to imagining that those sets are both evenly distributed throughout the population?

The larger point of the article is just "show, don't tell", which is fairly old (and good) advice.

** This article is really weak.

#+begin_quote
  The trick isn't to make our work universally accepted no matter the reader's background. It's to make all readers the same.
#+end_quote

This is simpleminded. You can't write something for an audience of literally everyone on the planet. You'll end up with a watery sludge of excuses and explanations that few will enjoy and that vastly underrepresents the original ideas simply to make them accessible to anyone living in a cave with a 4th-grade reading level.

#+begin_quote
  What we need to do is to make our reader become our protagonist.
#+end_quote

This is so wrong I can't even really get a good grasp on it. It ignores things like missing context for tension, hidden character knowledge, and gradual reveals. It ignores anti-heroes and characters who grow and change in ways some reader, somewhere might disagree with, and thus fail to identify with.

#+begin_quote
  Do that and you avoid the impossibility of making the writing universal. Instead you'll make your readers universal. And with that as our goal, let's see how we can accomplish that.
#+end_quote

And what follows is /English Comp. 101/ advice, with no special secret to making all readers fall in line with your magical, universal, single protagonist fictional narrative. Because an author can't accomplish this.

It is rather a set of instructions on how to make an unpresuming, freshman-level, Mickey Mouse every-person protagonist that the reader puts on like a pair of pants and wears as they are lead down the path of your plot. Not something usually considered the height of literary skill. And also, impossible. Not even a pants-character can fit every reader.

If two readers can hold different opinions on what a character should do with a set of knowledge in a specific situation, it definitionally /isn't possible/. This is trivial to prove as the reality of readers as a group.

Showing someone who isn't /exactly/ like everyone might expect, someone with a different take on situations who makes unlikely choices (that are then explained and examined) can result in a far richer character than one that tries (and inevitably fails) to please everyone. Sometimes, challenging readers with an unlikely, unrelatable, unreliable character leads to a much better /story/. Ah yes, that. What a novel is supposed to be about.

This article reads like a burnt-out, ground-down author trying to say what they wish was true, not what is actually possible. It over promises and states a very poor set of goals initially, then fails entirely to deliver.

An author should have a good grasp of the usual audience of the genre they're writing for, otherwise...they aren't doing a good job as a writer. And they need to be able to accept that they can't please all of the readers, all of the time.

This would have read much better as a POV-focused tutorial, not some cure-all for reader engagement.

** I found the associated link to "writing the perfect scene" alternating between 'Scene' and 'Sequel' with 'Motivation-Reaction units' to be quite compelling and illustrative. Scenes are story structures comprised of Goal-Conflict-Disaster. Sequels are story structures comprised of Reaction-Dilemma-Decision. The author suggests that writers alternate between these structures link two different links in a chain, scene, sequel, scene, sequel, etc.

For example, Wildbow uses this technique very nicely in Worm.

Take Taylor's first fight, for example. (I'm going to strip it of its context so it remains recognizable but overall, spoiler-free.)

1.3 Gestation is the Scene. Her Goal is to become a Cape by fighting some baddies so she ventures out into the Docks. The Conflict is the ABB gang -- she stumbles into a meeting between the kooks and their boss. The Disaster is that she overhears someone snarl “...the children, just shoot. Doesn't matter your aim, just shoot. You see one lying on the ground? Shoot the little bitch twice more to be sure. We give them no chances to be clever or lucky, understand?”

Gestation 1.4 is the Sequel. The reaction is that Taylor thinks the gang is going to murder children. Her dilemma -- "do I call for help, retreat or attack?" Her decision is prompted by the advancement of the gang. And she becomes Skitter.

The motivation-reaction units is basically alternating between external-objective-description and internal-subjective-reaction... with each sentence or paragraph. This draws the reader directly into the mind of the player character. This dynamic seems to mirror the role playing game structure of a Dungeon Master/Storyteller describing what happens and the PC reacting (not reacting only with actions, but emotions and instincts as well.)

I was going to use Skitter's fight with Lung as an example, but it became too laden with early spoilers. Just read the article, it's given me a lot to think about, structure-wise!
