** Holy. Shit.

I ... I've gotten so used to seeing The Grey Pilgrim as just Gandalf if he were a human instead of a maiar. His hypocrisy regarding the "greater good" back when Cat approached him with terms I took to be a significant, but not unrealistic character flaw.

This, though. Goddamn. I can't really call him a hero after this. It might be that the Gods Above and Below are pushing "Good" and "Evil", but it's pretty clear at this point that those words don't mean the same thing as "good" and "evil" at /all//

**** This version of Good is, at least. The point the Pilgrim was making is that Good isn't a monolithic one-size-fits-all kind of thing. There are heroes who operate by protecting the innocent without crossing moral lines, and there are heroes who unleash Biblical plagues. Black's whole problem is that he's optimised to fight a certain type of hero that plays by a certain set of rules.

That's been a major point in the story from the start. The beginning of the text quotes the Book of All Things framing the sides as god-directed verses god-independent. The Hashmallin's plan for First Liesse is the first time it's big and obvious -- that's the end of book 2, and it's only gotten more obvious since then.

  I don't recall ever stating that. *The Gods Above and Below do roughly correspond to “lower case” good and evil, as far as entities that far removed from mortals can be understood.* That neither side of the equation intervenes directly means there's a lot of room for interpretation in the respective philosophies they preach, but the bare bones are there.

Can't you?

I can kind of understand his perspective, honestly. He knows that Black is planning to loot cities (and sack them if they fight back) to undermine Cordelia right when she's about to face the Dead King.

He used an incredibly efficient weapon to make sure that didn't happen, and made himself feel the pain of everyone the weapon killed. I mean, sure, in the big picture he's working to sustain entrenched power structures that favor the powerful over the masses, but overall his actions are consistent with that of a really, really ruthless hero.

**** I get his perspective, and maybe I've just been drinking the wasteland kool-aid a bit much, but killing 2000 soldiers and ~100 civilians with what amounts to biological warfare isn't what I'd call heroic behavior.

It's unfair/asymmetric that the heroes have to not just win, but win in a way that upholds their ideals and vision for a world that's better for those around them, but that's also why they get the balance of Creation itself tilted in their favor.

Yeah, it's definitely a great way to get Good to win the present conflict, but if that's to be worth anything, I have to imagine the result of the victory has to be something other than "those in power use whatever means necessary at their disposal to ensure their dominance and control". Sure, we can kinda hope that the government/world vision that the Pilgrim would prop up would be somehow better than one run by villains, but at the same time, I can't really imagine Cat killing a hundred Callowans as collateral damage to kill off an expeditionary force. Hell, she deliberately pulled her punches against Procer to ensure they wouldn't be too resentful of fighting her to consider peace terms.

Cat's maybe not a fair comparison since her villainess status is more a label than a descriptor at this point, but I gotta be honest in saying that given the choice I'd rather live in her Callow than the Pilgrim's Procer at this minute.

The Grey Pilgrim does seem to think Names can be stripped by Gods, so maybe it has been, and he is gone. Be a good story if the former villain, fighting for a future for his people, found himself attacked by heroes, cast overboard and survived with an entirely new (and neutral) name. Or even a heroic one, though you'd need to twist the Pilgrim's acts pretty hard to make it work.

That's what gets me. We already know he is able and willing to use body-doubles to escape otherwise unwinable situations. What better way to accomplish this goal than to put a green-eyed soldier in his armor after having his mages make him somehow immune, then swim to shore himself? He could also have used Alaya's body double trick to do it.

It's worth noting that he's still accomplished his stated goal of controlling the location of the heroic response. Tariq is probably days from anywhere important, and the majority of Black's force is still alive out there. This could all have been a feint to misdirect a dangerous foe.

  “Planning too deep will be seen through by the Augur,” Amadeus reminded her. “We stay a step ahead so long as we make short-term decisions backed by superior pace.”
#+end_quote

I'm glad the Augur has finally been addressed. Her powers are the sort that they loom over most every conflict, and the fact that no one but Black seems to think about her will, I assume, bite a lot of people in the ass sooner or later.

But I still don't know how she failed to see that Black had spent months rigging a mountain to explode onto the Crusade.

#+begin_quote
  “I can think of few things more foolish than to underestimate Alaya,” he quietly said. “Even now. She's never been one to act without a plan, and that we do not understand her moves should be source of fear and not contempt.”

  “Odds are she's the one who made a pact with the Dead King,” Ranker said.

  “It could have been Catherine as well,” Amadeus frankly admitted. “She thrives in chaotic situations. It's led her to the bad habit of creating them knowing it improves her chances of victory even if it significantly increases collateral damage as well.”

  “The Black Queen,” the goblin mused. “There's another trash fire of a situation. One you've stepped lightly around.”

  “The Conquest was a way to achieve objectives,” Amadeus said. “The annexation was ultimately a consequence, not the purpose itself. I hardly mind surrendering unnecessary gains if the actual objectives are met through the gesture.”

  “The arithmetic holds,” Ranker sighed. “It always does with you. But there's more to this than the numbers, old friend. We made an order of things, and now it's crumbling.”

  “And now you wonder what will replace it,” Amadeus said. “And if in that new order, we will still have a place.”
#+end_quote

I figure this is full of foreshadowing. If the story turns to Cat vs Alaya with the Liesse Accords as a centre point, which very much seems to be happening, then this segment will be good to keep in mind.

The entire Black and Ranker talk is great. I'm quite sad to see Ranker go.

#+begin_quote
  Then dawn came, and with first light came the realization that the Praesi were gone.

So the Iserre plan failed, as absolutely everyone expect Cordelia knew it would. Interestingly, it would have failed even if Black, barring heroic intervention.

Still, she has the Grey Pilgrim there to clean up her messes.

#+begin_quote
  Crafting the plague had been easy as snapping his fingers, and mayhaps that was the most distressing part of it. The Enemy delighted in displaying its power, raising massive contraptions or weaving elaborate schemes to praise its own cunning and cleverness. Like it was the only side capable of doing those things, like it wasn't a choice to turn away from the unsightly means of the Gods Below. The Grey Pilgrim could have birthed diseases and disasters that would raise the hair on the Warlock's neck, if he so wished.
#+end_quote

And the Pilgrim, it turns out, is quite terrifying. The Army of Callow should be grateful that he didn't birth any "diseases or disasters" against them. I'd worry about the possibility of him having set something into motion during his short stay in Callow, but most everyone else who was there is dead now anyway.

And we learnt more about Heroes and the Choirs, and Mercy in particular, which was quite cool. Actually, there was a lot of fun little lore tidbits through this chapter.

#+begin_quote
  The Black Knight, Tariq thought, was not a stupid man. But he'd been arrogant enough to think he saw all the rules of his world, and arrogance was ever the death of villains.
#+end_quote

Well if anything was ever going to kill Black, it would be his own arrogance. I'm a little surprised that his blind spot is "other cultures exist", but I guess that's what you get for crushing the same enemies again and again for decades. Still, you assume he would have learnt from bard pulling a similar kind of trick with stories rooted in Levantinian culture (although that was wordplay, rather than a different breed of hero).

Still, I'm not going to complain too much about heroes /actually achieving something/ for once.

#+begin_quote
  “Let's see,” Amadeus of the Green Stretch said, “if I can at least leave a mark.”
#+end_quote

And that's the end of Black, unless he pulls a serious deus ex machina out of nowhere. Which is possible, I guess, especially considering that there's unresolved weirdness around him being brought up in the chapter and that it'd be a little sad for him to go off-screen. But I think he's gone. Which is a big shame, considering he's consistently been one of the characters I've been interested in watching, far and above the Woe. He'll be missed.

** well shit. An unexpected place for the end of the Black knight, but I suspect this move and the pilgrim himself needing to come down and deal with him will leave a shit ton of headaches for Cordelia to deal with. The use of the plague, taking heroes off the dead king's frontline, the major part of the legions and grem still being in one piece... even after he's dead Black will continue to cause his enemies problems.

Also wondering if the knife wound Cat gave him had maybe a sliver of winter in it... considering the whole talk about the "ways of the younglings" and how they must earn the right to shape the world...

oh

Ok so here's a hypothesis... from the beginning of the story, the Black knight was an oddity in that he was pragmatic and practical in the way he did things. He did not slaughter people "just for evulz". Right from the start of the story, he was shown to be having less Name power to draw from compared to his predecessors because of him not sticking to the role. The further you stray from the role, the weaker your Name becomes.

And now, after breaking with the Dread Empress, his reserve is at an all time low. The Black Knight role was never meant to exist solo, it always had someone it swore fealty to, someone to eventually betray. Till the last moment Black went against Malicia's wishes at only one crucial point, and arguably that was the height of his pure Name power.

But it wasn't followed up by climbing the tower, deviating from the role even more. Resulting in his Name power becoming so small he couldn't even directly do battle anymore (see Vales defence).

Remember that, near the end of Book 3, Black had already prepared to die and have Catherine take up his position as the Black Knight, but it was narrowly avoided.

I suspect (and the story hints) that Black very much knew his time was coming to an end. This whole expedition was simply to do whatever damage he could do to the principate while he lived.

BUT he also has unfinished business. The story of the Black Knight is linked to that of the Black Queen, as an observer. Black wants to /see/ the "Better World" that Catherine comes up with, even if he's not there to /experience/ it.

So here's what I think happened. Black has given Scribe his soul in a jar. That's why he wasn't recovering, using his aspect, or showing his Name at the end. So when he "dies", Scribe will get back to Catherine and Black will join Akua as a fellow soul-in-cape.

However, this is slightly less plausible since he doesn't have a master wizard with him right now. Thus, another alternative is that, along with being his "One last ride", this is also his way of testing Catherine. He has been branded with the weight of watching Catherine "make a better world" and then decide if he wants in or not. He knows he will die sooner or later, so along with doing a lot of damage, he wants to test how much "Weight" Catherine carries in the story. Whether that weight will prevent him from either dying/disappearing, either with a last minute save (unlikely) or the preservation of his soul (plausible). Black's plans, and their generation's plans in general, have almost always been win-win type plans. So this plan, centred around his eventual death, fits very well.

Back when Cat stabbed him, she was high on emotions and holding Winter's power. So I suspect Black has a small fragment of winter inside him. What it will do, we will come to see.

I'm pretty hyped.

*** Great theory, and I'd like to add that Akua was still able to use her Name despite her soul being kept far far away from her. Granted, she is a master mage, but Black might have asked Warlock to do it before shit hit the fan.

Either he becomes a Soul-Cape or Cat gets ahold of his body somehow and resurrects him as a Winter Fae

***** Wasn't on screen; when we leave off captain is dominating the fight completely and utterly, even after champion whips out her aspects, and then bard talks her to death offscreen via an ill-defined story mechanism. It's slightly better of an example of heroes accomplishing stuff onscreen than, say, the defeat of triumphant, but /only/ slightly, particularly given that it required Bard, a specialized monster killing name, and sacrificing a different named to pull off.

****** Her death was foreshadowed at the end of her interlude though. Yes she was dominating the fight, because she had control over her beast form. We know how, in any fight vs a hero, it isn't really a good idea to slowly beat them down, because they will eventually reach their lowest point, where heavenly intervention along with narrative can basically ensure their victory.

Remember how that interlude ended, Captain whipping the crap out of Champion, but slowly and steadily... and it ended with the beast starting a charge against the champion while "Sabah watched". Which sealed it.

******* I'm saying story supporting heroes in general is ill-defined, since that's literally the only case where we've seen it work for the heroes- except no, we didn't even see it work. Any other time where you'd think it would help a hero, it doesn't, like when pilgrim was in his iconic story and not only couldn't touch cat he couldn't even save the younger heroes. It's essentially a deus-ex-machina for that one fight that doesn't even have the decency to let itself be shown on screen.

******** yeah but the problem during cat's fight is the law of conservation of ninjutsu, where multiple heroes were fighting one villain, which made it equally matched. In Champion v Captain, she had the story support because she was a hero fighting a monster who killed 72 virgins or whatever that levantine story was. What sort of story did the Pilgrim have to wield against Cat? He was part of yet another proceran expedition force wanting to subjugate callow, and she the rightful defender of her homeland, and doing so after multiple offers for peace were rejected. Which is why she avoided stuff like wide scale massacre until they were desperate, and when they did try it, it lead to both Cat and Masego being out of commission for a significant chunk of time. This, and Catherine being kinda-sorta peace oriented was the reason that ultimately the Pilgrim decided to try a redemption story on her.

I also kinda feel that, because of being sort of Fae-ish now, Catherine isn't as affected by stories set in creation, though this is unproved.

** I'm holding out little to no hope of Black surviving this but what are his resources here for causing as much damage as possible?

*Goblin fire.* Filling his barge with goblin fire seems both the most plausible and the least likely as yet another trap and/or plan involving copious amounts of goblin fire in a single location would be seriously lackluster. I would also expect Pilgrim and co. to check the hold of the barge and those of the surrounding barges as the whole 'blow shit up with goblin fire' idea doesn't take a genius to come up with it.

*Warlock, Assassin & Ranger.* Going from least to most likely - *Ranger:* Apart from requiring an ability to cover huge amounts of ground in very little time it would also require him to have a way of contacting her without the help of anyone to scry. We've been given no hint that either of these things is possible so far. It would be petty much deus ex machina. Very unlikely.

*Warlock:* Him being able to travel vast distances in a short amount of time would be not entirely contrived bullshit. I could maybe, sorta, kinda see him having something like that in his bag of tricks that he could pull as a one off. I could certainly buy that Black has a way of contacting him over large distances. I don't buy it on a doylist level because a) separating Warlock and Black many chapters ago for no other reason but for Warlock to swoop in during his moment of need is lame and b) Warlock has his own plot over in the Wasteland that involves Masego and who knows what. That entire side plot becoming stillborn or simply existing as a way of separating and then rejoining Black and Warlock for dramatic effect would be some poor writing and i don't buy that EE would go for it.

*Assassin:* This seems by far the most likely. It's eminently plausible that he has been traveling with Black this entire time. He's been an enigma, linked to Black and the Calamities, and if there is going to be any pay off to his mystery then it's likely to be now before both his links to the story (Black and the Calamities as an entity) disappear.

We could spend time fruitlessly theorycrafting ways that Cat could save Black but the chances she up and takes a detour from her plot over with the drow is so unlikely that i'll let the more optimistic spend words on that.

Assassin + a Black with no Name and little to no resources is still supremely unlikely to come out of this alive but it is the sort of combination to do some damage before they go and I think that's probably the most we can hope for :(

*** I think Black knew that he was going to die soon either way. But I suspect that he will live on, as either undead, a winter court member or a soul-in-cape.

Deus ex machina isn't really erraticerrata's style, so I suspect that this is really Black. Assassin has been conspicuously absent for the entire book, likely helping Cat behind the scenes since thief isn't really much good against Malicia. I suspect the reason Malicia hasn't been able to destroy Callow even after all the murder, and Thief having second thoughts, is because Assassin is working behind the scenes.

** I know I've said it before that the Wednesday cliffhangers are particularly depressive as a general rule, but /holy shit/.

Black Knight still has an opportunity to survive, even narratively - fourteen thousand legionaries and Scribe are not the kind of assets the Story would just leave lying around until the heroes come for their heads - yet from his narration we know this isn't something he would (or had time to) plan for. Sure, the rest of the army is marching towards the same coast he's been sailing for, they have at least one (regretfully vulnerable to heroes) flying asset, and Amadeus had a couple of days to recuperate, but the best preparation he could have managed would be to raise as many corpses onboard, maybe a few snipers on the neighbouring ships, and mine the prospective battlefield to high holy hell.

We've all been optimistic for the Capitain, when this happened the first time, but this is the same setup she died from: going in blind, losing access to their powers (disobeying Black for Sabah, losing everyone under his command for him), getting cornered by Bard-assisted heroes armed by an unforeseen story. That might be it for Amadeus.

Edit: I mean sure, the hints are there. GP is playing the roles of at least 3 kinds of archvillain and attacks in a group while BK is the underdog, which guarantees a win for BK and BK has all kinds of unusually flawed reasoning behind his actions in this chapter which hints that they're really excuses for something he doesn't want to reveal but it still feels like only disappointment can come of this setup.
