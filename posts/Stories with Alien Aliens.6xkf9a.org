** /Blindsight/ by Peter Watts

/Solaris/ by Stanislav Lem

To an lesser extent, /Pandora's Star/Judas Unchained/ by Peter F. Hamilton. They aren't as unknowably mysterious but still different in a very interesting way.

**** The travel itself plays absolutely no role in /Solaris/ as the entire plot takes place on one planet that is far off from Earth. So if you want you can pretend it's without FTL and just a close neighboring star, IIRC it's never mentioned how long it took them to get there.

You're missing out on Hamilton though. While there is a super conventient FTL method at the very central of the setting he goes out of his way to stay away from usual Space Opera tropes.

***** Hmm, well I'll check out Hamilton, then. From the description I was a bit worried it was very Star Trek-y, which is not really my cup of tea.

The whole sentient ocean generating hallucinations thing on /Solaris/ seems a bit implausible, though. If the ocean can understand them well enough to bring up repressed memories it can surely understand well enough to communicate, at least a bit. Or does it make more sense in the book than in the reviews?

#+end_quote

This is discussed a little bit in the book.

Solaris is a one-of-a-kind entity. It has not had to evolve the buttload of communication protocols we have as a social species living on a planet full of animals. Its only known interaction with the outside world (before the event of the book) is tidal manipulations to stabilize its orbit. Forget communication barriers, it's not clear it would understand /communication itself/ with an external entity as a concept.

Complex "geological" constructs regularly emerge from the ocean, stick around for some time, then disperse. The scientific community's best guess is that this is how Solaris's thoughts are produced and/or stored. But they have no idea, really.

One character compares the things that Solaris is doing to, what if we scanned one of those structures, built an exact replica, and dumped it in a random spot in the ocean? Just because we could do it, doesn't mean we have any fucking clue how that would feel from the inside (or if that's even a sensible question; Solaris may not even be sentient).

The culture humans had then is practically it's own alien culture, just as repugnant to us as the other two are...because it's Three worlds colliding, observed by an immortal with no investment in any of them.

I guess I've read too much history to really consider the humans alien. None of their values seemed as different from the norms of the modern monoculture as slavery and paederasty, and those are both well within the sphere of what I'd consider as normal human values. Baby Eaters were definitely a bit different, though.

/Mote/ is an excellent first contact book, and Ringworld is a classic in general. I find the Puppeteers to be a really interesting alien race.

** Karl Schroeder has a number of stories with truly alien aliens.

Ventus - a human-created artificial ecology that has assumed its own goals and rationality, in which humans are now merely one more species to be managed.

Permanence and short stories like Solitaire - consciousness is simply a stage an intelligent species goes through. Humans come late to a galaxy that's had generations of interstellar ecosystems layered upon each other.

The Virga series - Artificial Nature is not conscious in any real sense, but its method of simulating reality to plan for its goals works at least as well.

** Love the Crystal Triology, I'm thinking of re-reading it. Can't wait for the third book!

Just realised that nobody has recommended Dragon's Egg yet, and given my flair, I should probably do it.

Now, I'm not going to lie - the aliens in Dragon's Egg aren't as alien as many of the others shown. They have a society broadly similar to ours with some notable exceptions (no pair bonding, different method of raising children, no taboo about cannibalism), but those are exceptions that I wouldn't be surprised to read were commonplace in an Amazonian tribe.

The really amazing thing about Dragon's Egg is that the life forms exist on a neutron star and use neutron physics. The novel was written by a neutron star physicist so it contains a LOT of detailed things about the magnetic field and how the aliens interact with that.

And even more amazing is that the aliens make First Contact with humanity, but they live 1,000 times faster than we do: so a Cheela lives and dies in 15 minutes. This means that the humans who are on a space ship orbiting the neutron star get to watch the society literally go from hunter-gatherer to spaceflight within the space of 12 hours. It's really, really cool.

Again, the Cheela are not altogether that alien, but I think they're still very alien because the physics they operate under is so very different to our own. I believe it's available for Kindle though I might recommend the paperback if you can get ahold of it because there's an appendix in the back that is very helpful when you read it (so you can flip across to see how much 30 seconds means to a Cheela).
