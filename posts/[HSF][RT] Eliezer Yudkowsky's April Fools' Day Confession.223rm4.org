** There's the important point that digging tunnels is /hellishly expensive/; even for short roads or cabling (fiber-optic internet basically only exists where they didn't have to dig it in new places, either aboveground or in old conduits). A single large tunnel in a city might cost a few billion dollars; calling it a few million per person would be /very generous/ for this kind of scenario and still impractical - yes it's physically possible, but there's no way it's a value proposition. Similar problems apply to the overhead cables - it'd be cheaper to use big helicopters I think, and still very expensive. Modular skyscrapers sacrifice a large proportion of their volume in unusable structure if you want swappable units.

Not using public transport is a bizarre American blind spot, caused by the sprawling cities. Everywhere else in the world, where cities are more compact (as seems to be proposed) uses mass public transport in urban centers.

Not when you can pay the diggers in pig-mole steaks. /snrk/

****** Why do plagarists make poor comedians? They always take jokes - literally.

Also check with your local council or planning body before digging, my local park was flooded by a broken sewage main a while back and it was a good experience for nothing but the grass.

*** It's not very expensive to dig tunnels, particularly using cut-and-cover, when there are no pipes, cables or other infrastructure to consider. That's how all that junk got there in the first place - it was relatively cheap to put stuff underground until they made it into an obstacle course. Hence the 'test city' concept.

** As one Facebook commenter put it, Eliezer obviously grew up in a city and therefore values closeness. Whereas some of us value wilderness and the isolation the outdoors can offer. Cookie cutter houses and endless suburbia isn't my utopia.

  I'm still calling it that because it's a direct translation, but it didn't /look/ like a great city at all. You stepped outside and you saw a green landscape full of trees, dotted with houses decorated as vegetation
#+end_quote

Cookie cutter houses is pretty much the exact opposite of what was described.

**** Still not wilderness :) and I'm also going by "modular foundations". There may be a lot of options in cookie designs, but Ikea is still Ikea. Modular foundations with modular rooms. Could be nice I suppose but I appreciate architecture and the uniqueness of architecturally designed houses. It is an art form for me.

*** That's exactly it. There was something bothering me about this story, but I couldn't put my finger on it and you crystallized my thoughts! As a slightly introvert person who sometimes gets anxiety attacks while in the midst of people, the feeling of not being able to "escape" anywhere is really distressing. But if growing up in a city really does make you value closeness (true?) then wouldn't that solve the problem?

btw. this is a shared experiential account, the password is "library" and you can post whatever you want where ever you want

*** He lived in a city and was talking about his own experiences.

"Cookie cutter houses" doesn't seem necessarily accurate. Centralized organizations create houses, but there's nothing that says they only offer a limited number of house models. Maybe it would cost more to get a custom-designed house, maybe they're sufficiently modular internally that you can arrange it as you please.

As for external appearances, plant whatever you want on your house.
