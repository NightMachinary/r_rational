Since Mother of Learning's ending was well received, and I personally think Chilli and the Chocolate Factory's ending was perfect (although the first ~third of the work does kind of drag), I figure this is a question that could generate some discussion since works that come somewhere under the umbrella of rational fiction are more likely concerned about ensuring the plot is tied up sufficiently.

That said, I specifically started this thread because the manga Chainsaw Man just finished after running for 2 years (probably only an epilogue left now, and an unspecified announcement by the author that could potentially be an anime adaptation). And while the work as a whole is about as rational as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, the tone is like if you replaced half the over the top comedy and ridiculousness with gore, brutality and depression (and kept the other half), and the character design is basically swapping the portion of the cast that's ridiculously manly men for attractive women in suits, the ending was incredibly fitting. The ending tied incredibly well to themes and topics that came up repeatedly throughout the work, grew from the way the characters developed over the story, tied off the main plot threads neatly, and (heavy spoilers) was explicitly planned from the beginning, as the penultimate scene was already shown on the front page of the Shonen Jump issue that contained the first chapter of Chainsaw Man, minor style and pose changes aside.

This thread isn't specifically for recommendations (although finished works do receive less frequent recommending than active ones in the weekly threads, even if for understandable reasons about already being known), but more asking the community about how much value do you place on endings, what are good examples of endings you've seen (in rational work or otherwise), and how detailed should a good ending be (and how rigorous in closing off plot threads not explicitly tied directly to the main story?)

But that's all undercut in the epilogues. My headcanon is that epilogues don't exist and the story ends at the last chapter. It'way better this way.

**** If you don't know (and if you're referring to it), the epilogue with Taylor is specifically written to be ambiguous-- it could be showing an afterlife, a coma dream, or it actually happens that she lives a normal life on an alternate Earth.

***** I actually think Ward is better, but it has a very different story and thematic focus from Worm. Wildbow does a lot better at exploring the internal psychology of his characters in Ward, but worse at consistent worldbuilding and power mechanics. The prose is better, the pacing still lurches aimlessly from villain arc to villain arc. The thing he does where superpowers are a metaphor for trauma doesn't really make sense in either, but in Worm the trauma side doesn't quite fit together, and in Ward the superpowers side gets the short end of the stick.

And while I enjoyed it, I think the whole thing was probably a mistake, as making a sequel that's very different from the original means it'll only be enjoyed by people who like both of those different things. It needlessly narrows the audience that'd enjoy it

I can't help but think it'd be better as a completely separate superhero setting by the same author - it'd still miss a lot of the people who liked Worm, but it'd at least have more of a chance of being read by people who didn't.

****** I can see this. I just don't know what people would think the themes of any sequel could be. Worm practically hits you over the head about escalation leading to bad outcomes. Maybe as someone who's experienced trauma I think that ward has to be a different type of story and had to confront what healing looks like. I do think that the idea that a sequel can't be different is a bit puzzling, a sequel of more worm would make the first story pointless. The natural follow up to escalation being a bad idea is asking what is, and I think ward does that fairly well. I'm some ways I wonder if the deeper inspection just brought the subtext from worm into just straight text is a change, but I did appreciate actually talking about those problems upfront instead of the normal winks and nods. I was extremely satisfied if it is wasn't clear.

I do get how it's a different type of story and if you enjoyed the wow cool powers it does down play that. It also it's a harder book to follow, if only because Taylor's sense of awareness combined with TT's explanations means that worms action were just inherently clearer than vic in ward. I just didn't feel like worm needed more worm in the end

**** I stopped enjoying worm around when clockblocker died. The weaver arc was so half-baked, like one mission and suddenly she's back with the old crew for a kaiju mission. It was very rushed, and wildbow so clearly just didn't want to take the trouble to write up another fun gang with actual interpersonal relations.

Then I started noticing the plot ramifications of wildbow's system of "I roll dice and kill characters randomly" (not a figure of speech, he literally did that). Interesting characters get created and get killed too fast, others have unsatisfying and unresolved plotlines. Cool for an experiment, I guess, but it really rubbed me the wrong way after such a strong first half. Almost felt as if it was only good by chance; one errant dice roll and he'd have killed skitter and then we 'd have to watch him struggle to make bitch into a protagonist or something.

He did that exactly once, for the Leviathan fight. Every other character death in the story was chosen on purpose, there were no other dice rolls.

Also, he is on record saying that if he didn't like what the dice said for Leviathan he'd have re-rolled, and if Taylor had died there the next protagonist would have been a Brockton Bay Ward (maybe Aegis if Aegis lived, if not then somebody else).

******* Talking about a protagonist swap...

I was reading the Legend of Randidly Ghosthound, which is not the greatest LitRPG ever, but was mildly interesting, though very very strange in some parts. At any rate, not seemingly at a "book" boundary, the PoV character changes along with a large timeskip. I didn't get the sense that the protag's story was over or anything like that, it just stopped in the middle of him traveling to another location. Some plot points were resolved, others still open. Possibly an unrequited love story too. And then the next chapter is some completely different character who hasn't been previously introduced, and it turns out there is a large timeskip as well.

Spoilers for the part I did read: So some of the things in that story bothered me. Mostly you could consider the protag a "good guy", but then he cold-blooded murders a caravan guard to go to prison, because the prison itself is a good training ground. Up until that point, sure he had defended himself from attack, and had indeed killed people. But not murdered anyone. I found that very strange. And to have an entire society devoted to... spear fighting. OK, so a magical society with poor technological development is a common trope, but they even know of other weapons and other fighting styles, but they just don't care. Also, I'd think that being able to teleport between worlds would have much more impact on society.

******** I've currently caught up on Randidly, and while nowhere near rational it's a good LitRPG in general. The parts in your spoiler text all get revealed/expanded upon in time, like the exact reason of why the society of Tellus is so focused on the spear and eschews every other weapon - you might not like or agree with the reasoning but at least it is consistent with the world the author has built. Also he introspects on his "bad" side like killing off innocents like the guards (and other similar situations in the future) many times in future chapters, and changes his philosophy regarding his goals as a result.\\
Teleportation between worlds is pretty limited actually even if its possible and known to the society at large, although we see more of that in the future chapters and the reasoning of why it's limited.\\
PoV changes happen quite a lot randomly between chapters without being marked as interludes - not just one or two chapters but sometimes multi-chapter arcs as well although never extremely long like the MC's arcs, but till now Randidly has remained the MC and the focus always returns back to him.

***** Had he let people in ward die... It would have been a better story.

A central theme of worm was that all of these people wore silly costumes and didn't fight to the death with their very destructive power s because the endbringers kept everyone to afraid and the passengers limited the combat.

In Ward, the endbringers are docile, the passengers are uncontrolled, the world has ended... And everyone still wears silly costumes and doesn't fight to the death.

And no one dies or even get injured.

Reading the 18th chainsaw fight where no one gets hurt... There was the woman whos power is making rooms that forcibly rape and impregnate you. She does this to our protagonist who has to pull a patented wildbow body horror growing fetus out of her face...

And then our hero doesn't kill this woman... Her power is literally making rape babies which she has deployed against innocent people .. And wildbow doesn't have his characters kill her when they have the chance... Because ...It's never clear.

I interpreted it as Contessa using her power to determine where to shoot to completely disable Taylor's mutated power, and then smuggling her into one of the parallel dimensions they were cutting their connection to as a form of reward for her contributions in the final battle. Which sounded plausible but a bit too powerful and convenient for me to enjoy it. I'm also not a big fan of coma scenes in fiction, but given Contessa's power it's at least more plausible that she put Taylor in a permanent coma so I guess it kinda works.

It all escalates the superpowered pew-pew lasers stuff, but has no impact on Taylor as a character. None of it is even really thematically tied to her overly self-sacrificing, self-oblivious, compartmentalizing self.

**** If I may suggest, most of my knowledge that allowed me to enjoy that book came from /another/ novel, one you could also arguably call rational: Umberto Eco's "Foucault's Pendulum". It's a great send up of conspiracy theories of all sorts that also works double as a compilation of esoteric and kabbalistic knowledge. The story is basically centred around this conceit: three rather geeky (in the humanities/history sense) friends work for a vanity publisher that makes money off deluded cranks who write books about magic, Templars, freemasons and so on. One day, some guy shows up to them with a small scrap of medieval parchment that could literally be anything, but through high level mental hoops, he interpreted as a fragment of a secret message passed between an order scheming for centuries to take over the world. They don't believe in it of course, but they take it as a challenge to actually build a /truly/ believable conspiracy theory around that fragment and spanning the entirety of medieval and modern European history. Cue hundreds of pages that are just them literally geeking out over the tiniest fucking details as they basically plan out historical fanfiction. That's it, that's the novel (ok, there's a little more plot than this but I won't spoil it). It's ridiculously niche and something that I don't think I've ever heard anyone else outside of me managing to finish, let alone enjoy, but personally I love it. The gematriah? Heard about it there. Using computers to recombine letters and find the Names of God? That book did it. The Tree of Life and the sephiroths? You bet. I learned so many tidbits of obscure lore from that book it's ridiculous.

It's genuinely one of the most well earned badass moments in fiction I can think of. Parts of it felt a bit iffy to me namely the Uchiha + Uzumaki bloodline thing, but it was from the canon and I think they also foreshadowed it a bit so it didn't really bother me

** Endings are incredibly important. It's where the story is forced to stick the landing, stumble or fail utterly.

Personally I didn't give Chainsaw Man much attention past the bombgirl arc, because the author's previous work, Fire Punch, taught me not to trust the guy. I might give it another shot now that it's over, but all the manga I've read that ended this year have had terrible rushed endings. Then again, maybe Fire Punch would've benefitted from getting cut short.

I personally don't think it's the ending's job to tie every plot thread together. That's just a responsibility that ends up there because it's where all of the expectations end up after being kicked down the road. Ideally, stories should reach their endings with little baggage, though I do think it's impressive when a story manages to wrap everything up right at the very end (I wouldn't risk it, though).

Read Hoshi no Samidare if you haven't.

** Personally I'm a little ticked off that Akoja didn't get a date re-do at the ending of MoL. For that matter, it was a little annoying that she rarely showed up despite the spectacularly well-done failure the two of them had in the beginning, which to be honest was the entire reason I decided to keep reading. MoL was like that- it teased the harem/romance elements but rarely indulged them in a satisfying way. It felt like Novelty got the most screen time on that front. To be fair, there were attempts at closure, but it needed some more attention. Ako's response to Zorian's early delinquent behaviour seemed to set the tone for the whole story to me and felt like it was forgotten too easily. But that's probably just me being weird.

That said I can't say that I care too much about endings. I tend to like stories that attain some "high point" anywhere in it while ignoring all the bad elsewhere.

My favourite rational story (Origin of Species) isn't finished yet, and I can't say I've had any strong feelings about the endings of ones I have finished. HPMOR was a slightly anticlimatic end to a great story. I guess you have to be [[https://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/30rpqn/if_chapter_104_had_been_written_by_someone_much/][someone much stupider]] to end that story well. Metropolitan Man's ending was about the same as the rest of the work, ie. perfectly competent.

For bad endings, I'd say that the worst ending of a great work I've seen was Drunken Angel's pedantic last line, which was something like "Just follow your reason!" It kinda ruined Kurosawa's otherwise-masterpiece. So I guess endings do matter a little.

As for good endings, the most memorable (it seems, because I remember it) was the film Nightmare Alley's rather haunting fate of the protagonist- noir endings are often great, perhaps because there's no incentive to lie about how it went down. The Judas Contract had an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_U4MykT20c][ending]] (obviously spoilers) that I felt made the film. The most objectively well-done ending I've seen has to be Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

It technically doesn't count, but the ending of the Earth: Final Conflict episode [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn8k9rUujdQ]["Atonement"]] (seems to be the full episode, lots of spoilers) is a favourite. "What an inhuman world we live in." -Ronald Sandoval

You would think that being not-so-subtly told that you're a resentful and rude idiot /please be nice to me/ right before you fail to save anyone would be a significant memory as Zorian slowly realizes that, yes, he was an idiot. Its a great story anyways but you just don't do that to such a sympathetic pair.

"It's not that," Zorian interrupted her. ”It's not like I wanted a date, anyway. I was going to come alone to this thing."

She stared at him in shock. She seemed emotionally crushed, and Zorian didn't understand why.

** The manga and anime /Kanata no Astra/ has a really neat and well self-contained story. It starts in a futuristic setting with a group of kids leaving for some kind of survival camp on another planet and, because of a mysterious accident, finding themselves orbiting another world thousands of light years away. It goes on to follow these kids' trip to return home through multiple alien worlds with decently creative (if not very realistic) biospheres, all the while slowly unraveling the mystery behind their accident.

It's not perfect, but the amount of details and foreshadowing that go towards building the ending is still impressive. There's a number of things starting from episode 1 that will likely make you go "haha but that doesn't make sense!" and will turn out to be actually very purposeful later on. Fair warning though, it's a very optimistic and upbeat story overall, sometimes to the point of stretching disbelief a bit. But it'll give you a lot of fun and likely leave you with a smile on your face. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vfN190quJI][Here's the trailer]].

And by the way, since the anime is made by studio Lerche, that makes me think about /another/ very optimistic series they made about a group of kids overcoming great difficulties together, /Assassination Classroom/. That one too had a great ending, though in that case it was less from an intellectual point of view (that show's lore doesn't make much sense) and more in terms of emotional payoff.

** Quick note on the final question before I have to head off, how detailed the ending to a rational work should be seems like an interesting question. On the one hand, rational work does want detail and specifics, by and large, rather than leaving the reader/watcher/etc with only guesswork for determining features of the world/setting/characters. On the other hand, rational work does encourage characters acting in ways that fits their motivations over what is narratively convenient, so it can be hard to fit in explanations of everything that was going on (on non-essential plot threads mostly) without having to shoehorn them in or just have a character infodump whatever was going on "offscreen". It seems like an interesting balance to have to strike.

** I guess thinking the ending of MoL is its worst part is not a popular opinion? MoL got way too big in its scope for its capacity by the end, as new actors and new powers were just being thrown on top of each other with much less foundation than in earlier sections, so the action sequences were just a lot of shiny stuff coming off the page. Red Robe turns out to be...this guy the protagonist has never met before? Who was a lawyer once? Uh neat I guess, shocking reveal it was not. And most importantly, characters arcs are there but are given minimal room to breathe - in particular the epilogue spending no time on the main duo's actual post-plot life seems like a misstep. Note that "worst" isn't "bad", it had its moments and maintained its consistency, but I definitely thought the seams were showing at that point.

**** I would agree with the realism, I just think narratively it lacked payoff - and its all about how a story is constructed. Its fine for someone's secret identity to not be a Big Reveal, but the story put a lot of groundwork into making it the Big Mystery (many sections spent on the puzzle and the speculation), so you are expecting said reveal. Of course given the story as is there wasn't going to be a satisfying candidate - you would have to rewrite the story itself in notable ways to make it work. It was a structural problem with the story that revealed itself at the end, as it were.
