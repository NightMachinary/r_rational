  Drinking just a sip of water can prove fatal to her, as a bully in her class replaced the orange juice she drinks, with water.

But... orange juice is mostly water, as is all other juice. How on earth could she possibly drink that?

And the human body is mostly water. She'd be "allergic" to her own /blood/.

I'm honestly doubting that this is a serious post.

**** Well, damn. I looked it up and it is indeed a real thing.

The issue here, I think, is that the cause of the disease isn't even known. The explanation that her body is allergic to the water molecule doesn't hold water (heh) because of the obvious questions I asked (and someone else asked about saliva which is an even better question).

It clearly /is/ a thing, but it is pretty damn incredible. If you do write about it, I suggest not delving too deeply into the mechanics of it because they just aren't known, apparently, and it's really easy to be wrong or unbelievable in your explanations.
