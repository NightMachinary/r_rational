*** What's up with this in rationalist fiction? Is this a thing that people normally need to learn?

Normal children usually "lose" in public a large amount of times before they become old enough to make larger decisions. Is it because of speculation that special children like HJPEV or Blue Oak don't, and therefore need to be explicitly taught to lose?

**** Needing to learn to lose isn't unique to special children. Children that lose in public don't always take away the right lesson.

It's sadly common to find adults that shift the blame onto anyone but themselves when they fail. It's an instinctive and rational defense that protects the ego.

I mean sure, Blue is a talented kid that wouldn't lose out to his peers often and therefore hasn't had the chance. But regular people can be prideful and mentally defensive too.

***** Fair point. Kids assigning blame to others instead of oneself for things that are your own fault happens all the time, most famously in League of Legends matches. However, the appropriate HPMOR lesson here is [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/75][Heroic responsibility]], that when you do lose, everything is your fault.

Quirrell-style getting beaten up in public seems like a cure for very specific HJPEV quirks only (cannot fathom losing, keeps escalating, "intent to kill").

There's another failure of accepting the loss, which is learning to accept when you are wrong; but again the cure for this is the Litany of Tarski and not getting beaten up in public.

I see no way this could possibly backfire.

Also, loving the reasoning for Red to pickup all 3 starters despite the impracticality of it in the game. I always thought it was odd that such strong and distinctive critters were basically limited to you and your rival. It speaks to the quality of this fic that I can think of several reasons you wouldn't see them in Gyms in this universe, though!

*** I vaguely remember at least one Lass in pokemon leaf green who had like to Ivysaurs but I'm not about to go through every route's trainer encounters to check.

It's also kind of debatable whether say all of the trade exclusive pokemon from the first generation or the two gifts not including the fossils are actually native to the region considering that they aren't actually able to be encountered in the wild. That list is Far'fetched, Jynx, and Mr. Mime for in-game trade exclusives. Then the gifted pokemon which are the three starters, Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, Eevee, and Lapras kind of counts there's only encounters for it in the Sevii islands.

That's only if you're not counting like the safari zones or the fact that most of the previous pokemon are made much more available in the Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee remakes.

The overall rarity of the starters is kind of explained by their unbalanced gender ratios, which with such an unbalanced male to female ratio with only in-game procreation would mean that the 1 female would have to not only survive and be able to reproduce, but that they'd have to do so a bunch more than a comparable species that had a fifty/fifty split or the in game 50.2/49.8 would have to. They would however probably be good for overall gene survival if there's anywhere near the in game intergenetic compatibility, but even with a fraction of it having males that pass their genes down more often than say the normal coin flip gender ratio might lead to certain populations kind of breeding themselves out of existence and into a broader expanded recessive type existence.

***** Gender and breeding only showed up in Gen 2. Probably to keep it rare - species passes on from the female parent. Having a high male ratio forces you to get a Ditto if you want more.

As to why 7:1? Lots of things in the games revolve around a base 2 number probably due to coding and space on the cartridge reasons. Examples include IVs (32) and EVs (256)

As a side note, you may have seen it, but my favorite abuse of data limitations in the games is the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDLpbFXnpeY][system for Pokémon cries]]. It's a case study in clever ways to do procedural generation.

***** It's because eggs are always the same species as the mother, so having a pokemon be mostly male makes it harder to breed more. You can get a ditto of course, but dittos don't let you pass down egg moves and egg moves are a major way of getting pokemon to have good movepools in the games. (Less so in the games with lots of tutors, but there's always some good moves you can't get any other way)

Now Pikachu is Red's emotional support animal, he has an eevee (->Espeon) from Aiko, he's getting copies of his friends' starters so he has an extra tie to them, soon you'll come up with a reason for him to be emotionally attached to a snorlax, and [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_(game)#Pok.C3.A9mon_Gold.2C_Silver.2C_and_Crystal][oh look there's an entry on this in Bulbapedia]]. In conclusion, I find this very amusing.

As for the current chapter, I feel like the new character sees through Blue a little too much, too fast, to be believable. Though the surrounding culture of the gym is believable, I've seen this exact same mentality at parkour gyms before.

Duncan also could have talked to other people who saw through him. there are probably a lot of psychics who are familiar enough with how human beings think and feel in general that they can read his face and body language even though they can't read his mind.

****** All stories teach their readers what to expect from them over the course of reading them. That so many of her readers disliked the final chapter so much tells me that it probably came out of left field with no foreshadowing whatsoever, that it broke from established style and thematic patterns in the story she was writing. i haven't read the original animorphs, but that's my impression from reading the letter from its author.

It sounds kinda like what J.K. Rowling did with the Harry Potter series in reverse. Where Applegate seems to have taken her readers by surprise by pulling an unhappy ending out of thin air without sufficient in-story buildup to it, J.K. Rowling took her readers by surprise with a neat wrapped up happy ending out of thin air without sufficient in-story buildup to it.

I haven't read the original animorphs, but the fact that its author even felt the need to write this letter feels a bit damning. Unless its ideas and themes are culturally taboo, a story should be able to stand on its own without the help of clarifying author's notes to explain what the author really meant. A novel is a form of expression meaning communication. If your story's main ideas and themes require an author's note for the reader to understand, that means you failed to tell the story that you were trying to tell, that what the readers saw was very different from what you thought they were seeing. Meaning you failed at communication.

****** Colloquially it's okay to skip "about" there, because the context makes it a clear comparison :) Similar to saying something like:

"It's more afraid of you than you are it."

Technically it's proper to say "of it," but this is just the way people often speak.

** Well, that's an explicit MoR shout-out at the end if there ever was one. I assume Duncan is the cameo character, and not Koichi? It's not actually clear.

You're right about one thing, and that's that I need to get onto reading animorphs the reconing. I read as much of it as was available some time ago, but fell behind on updates after a while. As an animorphs fan I feel I owe it to myself to catch up again, especially if it's ending soon.

** This was a fun chapter. I'm glad we get to deal with the Glen situation a bit since it was apparent that he'd eventually fall behind Blue, and Blue has to figure out how to tackle that situation when it occurs. Both Red and Duncan emphasizing that Blue has to learn how to lose in the public eye sometimes is an important lesson and necessary if he wants to be the best Champion.

Fun cameos from Kiyo and Koichi, both named trainers from the actual [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fighting_Dojo][Dojo in the games]]. I usually head over to the Bulbapedia page whenever new character names are given to see if anybody of that name is from there and there are usually these great surprises there too.

One interesting thing for me is that you've chosen for Blue to do Fuchsia first and then Saffron rather than the other way around. Most people tend to do Saffron first since we already need to be in that city anyways.

Also Hitmonchan/lee incoming next chapter I guess, but looking at Blue's teams from HGSS it might be a Machoke as well. Either way, it's great seeing them slowly building up their in-game teams.

"spend money that I have a lot of, to save time that I don't"\\
No idea, in what way those two save Red time.
