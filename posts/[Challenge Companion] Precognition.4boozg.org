Precognition is one of the earliest of the superpowers, going back to at least the Greeks and Romans (mostly in the form of soothsayers). I think that's probably because it's both obvious and elemental; it doesn't take too much imagination to think about someone seeing the future, because we're all trying to do that all the time. Precognition is just the upgraded form of prediction.

Because it's information from the future, most precognition falls into the same general categories as most time travel, split between mutable and immutable; either you can change the future or you can't, and this determines a whole lot about the shape of the story you're telling (and since lots of stories realize this, a lot of them play with this ambiguity).

I don't have many examples of precognition done rational, though it's closely related to both Groundhog Day loops (where precognition comes as part of the package) and self-inserts (where precognition is part of the conceit), and there are lots of examples of that.

If you have any recommendations, rational or otherwise, leave them below.


** Shameless self-plug: /[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3808279/chapters/8485900][The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake]]/ explores the ramifications of a number of abilities, one of which is near certain intuitive knowledge of the immediate future in the form of a very high-powered danger/outcome sense.

Examples include: dialing phones without knowing the number, constructing technological devices without prototyping or even planning, social-fu, coming to correct conclusions in the absence of evidence, and much, much more.

** There was a short story recommended somewhere nearby (can't find it, sorry) in which a group of 12 (I think) people got each a unique power. There was a love-inducing woman, a person who did anything with perfect efficiency, a punch-harder, etc, and a person who could see a month into future.

The last guy built himself an information tunnel through time up to the end of the universe, where his future self's civilisation had ran out of energy. This information was sent back to his past- (present) self through all the relay points as being of top priority; and they started looking for ways of how to answer the Last Question.

edit: Here's another relevant bit from a [[http://royalroadl.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=37098][recent web original.]]

#+begin_quote
  I place my hand on the door to the ballroom and stop. Images of my death flash through my mind and all my senses howl that something isn't right. Retreating my hand from the door I step backwards. My prophetic ability isn't without fail, but it kept me alive until today. I turn left, but a shiver runs down my spine. Next I attempt to walk back the way I came, but an image of my twisted and broken body appears there. In the end I take the corridor to the right. What's wrong with this place? Normally it's enough to change a single decision in order to influence the future and avoid the bad end.

** The protagonists of loop-centered stories /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ explicitly get a lot of mileage out of using trial and error to find and exploit "patterns"--long chains of consistent inputs from the protagonist that are able to force equally-consistent outputs from non-looping characters. The process of discovering these "patterns" is like navigating [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape][a fitness landscape]], but with the ability to go back downhill and try again after getting stuck on a local plateau.

Time-rewinding stories with such "pattern"-seeking behavior on much-shorter timescales include the /The Batman/ episode /[[http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman_(2004_TV_Series)_Episode:_Seconds][Seconds]]/ and the movie [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Next][/Next/]].

*** /Next/ is very loosely based on the story "The Golden Man" by Philip K. Dick, which is in the public domain due to a failure to register copyright and [[http://sickmyduck.narod.ru/pkd082-0.html][can be read here]]. It's got one of my favorite descriptions of precognition.

**** The Naruto story /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4202377][Next]]/ (in which Naruto has the two-minutes-ahead precognition of the movie) uses a similar style of description:

#+begin_quote
  Naruto scrambled to his feet, his eyes wide in fear. He hadn't been this scared since... ever. All around him, Narutos were lying in various positions. One or two were even spread across the length of the impromptu battlefield, organs splayed like the grotesque scribbling of a madman. Everywhere he looked, he saw his own death, and the dead bodies of his teammates. Before he could stop himself, he looked at the sword and saw in unyielding clarity the missing-nin who would perch himself atop it in less than a minute. Momochi Zabuza was a man whose very eyes were colder than the coldest of winters. Naruto focussed too much on the man, the hundreds of future echoes of his entrance blurring over one another. A thousand teeth grinned in a single mouth that was both covered and uncovered as the paths of fate tried to determine if the man would tear off the bandages over his mouth or not. Naruto had never seen anything like it. He saw too much.

**** Yea, it just takes a minute amount of precomittment. Not that much at all, since it would be future you doing it for each iteration. Once your iterations are spaced out far enough, it's trivial to do so.

** I always find closed loop time travel very interesting. For unavertable prophesy, you'd have to work with the requirement that the universe will not allow the transmission of information from the future that would falsify itself, which imposes a lot of constraints on what kind of prophesies make it through, perhaps enough constraints to make their laws more of a topic of science than a big gaping deus ex machina?

** Precognition might not be done "rational" too often, but I feel like almost every precognition story we've got is actually a deconstruction of the basic first impression we would have of precognition's ability to make things better. That's why prophecies are always self-fulfilling and tragic.

** Though it is probably strictly possible to integrate them into the same world system with sufficient creativity, I think the entire idea of precognition falls apart once you've really grokked the idea of multiple worlds.

*** I suppose Worm tackled something along those lines with the powers of that precog who would only give percentages, never certainties. I used to think; Ok, but from what prior evidence are you arguing, anyone can give percentages, *I* can give percentages, I guess it becomes a lot clearer what that was supposed to be about when you realize wildbow was thinking in Many Worlds the entire time.

**** Worm was weird in that regard because it had precogs relying both on the world being deterministic(Contessa, Coil etc) and stochastic (Dinah). And they somehow did not get stuck in precog-loops, so, unless I am missing some in-depth WOG on precogs, Worm didn't really manage to grokk subject.

***** Worm did talk about how precogs block other precogs (as well as some other things blocking them), so it seems like precog powers have some sort of recursion-depth limit.
