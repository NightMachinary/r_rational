** The end of Journeyman's story--he didn't get closure, which is part of what made him who he is. And the start of a new thread.

We'll see if anyone gets the in-joke about the security researcher's name. 8-)

*** Bruce Schneier would like to talk to you. :>

I like this one -- you're good at 'emotional' and the bit at the end makes a nice chaser and mood shift.

**** When Schneier first started becoming well known, there was a meme for making cryptography jokes about him in the style of Chuck Norris jokes, so I used that for the name of the character based on him.

A good example from the Disqus comments on the chapter:

"Chuck Shiner doesn't know the meaning of the word ciphertext, because to him, everything is plaintext."

***** Cute. Cute, and extremely obscure. I don't feel bad at all about missing that one.

**** Thanks. And I actually did talk to Bruce Schneier once, at a book signing with Neal Stephenson for Cryptonomicon, back in the 20th century 8-). He autographed the appendix of my copy.

But the in-joke is something else about the name 8-)

****** No, but I want to give everyone a few more days to guess before I reveal it. It's just a little Easter egg for those that make the Schneier connection.
