** A short but clever exploration of uncountably infinite sets. I found it a thoroughly enjoyable read, and was surprised to find that apparently it had not been posted to [[/r/rational]] (or anywhere else, for that matter).

Thoughts?

**** My guess? His dream was better at imagining the transfinite than enforcing it. His dream was only one level deep, being a normal human who only has dreams one level deep, but that dream constructed a world which resembled one in which he was in a transfinite amount of dreams.

***** The idea of being stuck in a dream like that is sort of an irrational fear I have, that's why I ask. I see what you mean, though. For the story, yeah, he was just dreaming. After all the photo album was finite in size so it's not like he was actually up against something transfinite.

******* I have, at one point, dreamed that I was in a locked room, and that the key needed to unlock the door was located on the other side of the door. I imagine that's about as complicated as it gets for dreams, though, since your brain's higher functions aren't exactly, well, functioning while you're dreaming. I'd be very surprised to hear that anyone had ever dreamed about something as complicated as transfinite towers of dreams-within-dreams.

******* If I understood set theory at the proper intuitive level, and dreamed in a narrative style (rather than, mostly, a series of meaningful snapshots), I would not be surprised if I dreamed the story related in the OP.

I think the key is that any concept synthesized in my dreams could be expressed to me in a single phrase, each part within a single level of inference for me.

(Only when I have to explain that "the empty can of Spam is a nanotechnological membrane air-breathing rocket and oracle AI." ...does it become obvious that it is a /complicated/ tin can.)

Three scene-spaces is also a reasonable number for me.

*** In normal usage, there is no difference--both are used to describe a quantity that is greater than any finite quantity. The reason "transfinite" exists as a word is because [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor][Georg Cantor]] wanted to distinguish his "infinite" cardinals from something he called the "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Infinite][Absolute Infinite]]": a quantity so large, it exceeds the size of every other transfinite cardinal. Note that this is a philosophical concept, not a mathematical one; set theorists don't talk about "Absolute Infinity" as a mathematical object, and in fact there are several paradoxes that would be caused by the existence of such an object, implying that it is self-contradictory and hence /cannot/ exist. Despite this, however, the word "transfinite" stuck, and now it and "infinite" are used more or less interchangeably, at least in mathematical circles.

*EDIT:* I forgot to mention that the Absolute Infinite actually appears in-story as the titular pancake. This, then, is the reason you're not allowed to ask what's beneath the pancake: technically, it shouldn't even /exist/. (Why does it exist, then? Only Scott Aaronson knows for sure. Maybe it's because dreams don't always make sense--or maybe the old man was lying.)

**** u/DRMacIver:
#+begin_quote
  Why does it exist, then?

I think he's talking about the difference between a set and a proper class (i.e. a valid predicate about objects in the universe but which you cannot form the set of all things satisfying that predicate).

**** I don't see why the paradoxes that arise from assuming that *On* is a set implies that *On* doesn't exist, just that it isn't a set.

*On*, I think, is to be considered with something at least almost like fear.

When asked if there is /Something/ at the bottom of it all, he is silent for a minute (not just for a second or so, but a minute) before responding. When asked why it isn't valid to ask what is below it, he responds "ominously". The dreamer's response is shock and horror.

In my mind, this seems connected to

"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom"

** A trope springs to mind: "And I Must Scream". Simple because trying to fit that into my brain is like trying to pour an ocean into a cup. An /infinite/ ocean, naturally.

For me, the pancake might represent the question, "Why is there existence instead of nonexistence?"
