Has anyone ever encountered a magic system where casters are effectively programmers writing code? What would that even look like?


** [[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]] by Sam Hughes ([[/u/sam512]]) is pretty much that. Magic there is a mix of differential equations and programming. It's an excellent read, original fiction, and it's also completed.

** Basically what Rick Cook's Wiz Biz series is all about. Normal programmer guy gets summoned by mistake into a fantasy universe in order to save it. Discovers magic exists there. Discovers it can be manipulated. What's a programmer to do? Well...

*** Not to mention that he's slightly pushed into it by /not being a wizard/, and then discovering that this means "not able to cast big high-energy spells, but tiny micro-spells that do sod-all can be cast by anyone". And spells can /cast other spells/.

I particularly like how he doesn't register as a wizard to magic-detection spells, even when he's throwing around citybuster-level magic, because technically it's not him casting/controlling the high-level stuff, whereas with 'real' wizards they have direct control.

*** Should clarify though, in that setting not all wizards are programmers writing code -- it's just the protagonist. Other wizards do the equivalent of writing machine code directly, with all the ridiculous effort that implies. Also, unlike most settings, magic is devastatingly easy to do in this universe. It's just so hard to coordinate everything that people studiously avoid it, out of fear for the horrific consequences that inevitably follow the most minor spells without intensive training.

The programmer guy finds this ludicrous complexity impossible to deal with and builds several layers of abstraction, allowing him to ultimately run spells more massive than any standard wizard could comprehend.

**** Well, not quite. The protagonist was the first to do it, but the whole point of his work, to him, was that /anyone/ could do it, wizards and non-wizards alike. And eventually, they do. With the obvious unintended consequences. "Wait. What? That's not why I wrote /that/!" "Well tough, that's how I use it. What are you gonna do?".

As a programmer myself, working in a smallish (~600 users) healthcare structure, I really, really feel for him.

** /The Irregular at Magic High School/ does this. It's a pretty interesting system where something called eidos is manipulated with CADs, which take the form of traditional weapons or are wearable.

You might want to check it out. Personally I couldn't get past the first light novel.

**** The anime adaptation is still enormous fun to watch, despite the lost opportunities for munchkinry. Not rationalfic by any means, but it does have some interesting points. For example, the protagonist lacks the ability to feel almost all intense emotion, but is very far from a Straw Vulcan.

....I think someone needs to write rationalfic for that universe now.

** There is an original fiction which is a precursor to a Worm crossover where a SI is investigating an original magic system which functions like this. I was considering posting it as its own post, but I'll toss it here.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/]]

I'd tag it [WIP][MK][RT][HF] for now. Knowing (a little) where it's going from the later Worm crossover, I suspect [TH] is in the works.

One of the really interesting parts to me is the way spells have an exponential magic cost dependant on degrees of freedom. So, for example, a spell which is specified to an incredible degree, and cannot or does not need to interpret or guess at any other things (the spell formula has taken into account all variables) has its cost in 'willpower' or 'mana' significantly reduced. On the other hand, a common language wish, while possible to do, has absolutely insane energy requirements as the spell itself has to determine all of the thousands of variables needed to make it happen.

The main character is abducted with a backpack filled with basic science books to the world where he learns magic. He uses his knowledge of physics to fit in variables that, he suspects, people in other medieval fantasy realms would have always left open, and by doing so turns what might normally be high level magic into cantrips in terms of cost - which he is then able to cast with his mediocre reserves.

The title and Word of God have implicitly said he's out to break the magic system like an unruly horse, so I expect more of the same.

The OP has it all written but is posting at a glacial pace, and the index is not complete.

*** I tried reading it... but, well, the /style/. It's off by small degrees in grammar and large degrees in technical proficiency. Just read this sentence:

#+begin_quote
  James' vision was blurred by the sudden light of a noonday sun, which he found startling and disturbing, as he was quite certain it had been dimming towards twilight only a moment before.
#+end_quote

Not /unreadable/, but /annoying/.

I skipped to the last chapter and read a few lines. He gets better, but not to the point that it's fun to read.

On the plus side, the issues are mostly with phrasing, so a good editor would be able to fix it.

Bah humbug.

**** Yeah, phrasing and editing errors are something you really have to live with when it comes to online or forum-posted stories.

This one was written as part of NANOWRIMO as well, so speed induced errors are likely rampant, and it probably has a less than stellar editing process throughout.

*** That's a clever way to use a wand. I can also imagine this being a useful way to use runes - for when you want to cast a precise spell at a distance, for example, you can just specify the rune - perhaps each wizard has a personal one - and add in a component that destroys the rune.
