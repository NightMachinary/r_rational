** Fiction so rarely captures the inanity of bureaucracy properly. I just had to send an email asking one of our vendors to pretty please not cut us off because we're going to be late paying them because the money allocated to paying them was written down as being associated with the wrong purchasing group, which has spawned a multi-week "oh no what do we do how do we fix this" festival.

Like, this isn't people actively blocking anything. Everyone involved in the conversation wants things to be worked out and is willing to do their part in getting it there! It just takes this long anyway!

** Effective altrusim - donating blood/platelets/plasma. Especially COVID-convalescent plasma.

I did my first plasma donation today, I've donated blood only twice before. I got $65, not for the plasma, but for my time according to them. It took about 4 hrs though it was supposed to be only 2.5 hrs for a first timer. They pay $100 for donations of tested COVID convalescent plasma. I suspect I had COVID back in Feb 2020, but that's way past the CDCs 4 month estimate of the antibody presence in blood, and during that time the virus was just starting to ramp up anyways.

I was inspired to donate by the Lex Fridman podcast with Michael Mina about rapid testing. I recommend trying both the podcast and donating. Plasma goes especially far in this day and age. The pricing makes it easy to see how badly the stuff is needed. My plasma bottle was marked "for manufacturing use only", so that was neat.

*** The very last time I ever donated plasma, the nurse was in a bad mood and just stuffed the needle into me and I felt electricity shoot down my arm into my hand, and I said as much, but she just said something dismissively uninterested and walked away. The donation happens in multiple rounds of pumping and recirculating, so after the first round I told another nurse something like "get this goddamn needle out of my arm" and then for the next 8 months I had trouble bending my ring and pinkie fingers on that hand, and there was a numbness/tingling on the ring/pinkie side of the hand for the entire 8 months which didn't fully go away until another several months later. Nerve damage.

I looked it up at the time, and apparently there's a pretty important nerve that runs directly beside the vein they stick for plasma, and the nurse poked it. I got lucky to fully recover. It's not impossible for the damage to be permanent if they do more than simply poke the nerve. A hugely non-insignificant percent of the people sticking you at those places are very inexperienced.

I type. Finger dexterity is required. I make music with FL Studio, and I have plans in the future to hook up a MIDI keyboard for music-making purposes and get back into playing the keyboard. Finger dexterity will be required. I'm in the preliminary stages of beginning to start the process of teaching myself how to draw (meaning I have purchased a single notebook and bookmarked a couple of videos and had passing thoughts about the fact that Skillshare is a thing that exists). Again, fingers. I value my own use of my own hands (not to mention my own lack of permanent neuropathic pain) far more than I value the lives of others. Is that selfish? I don't think it is, and /if/ it is, I don't care, because they're /my/ hands. I'll never donate plasma again.

**** No, it isn't selfish not to do this specific altruism. There's plenty of other things that need doing. Plain cash donations to the Against Malaria Foundation is pretty effective (even better if it's cash from donating plasma).

I hope venting helped a little. Do you think everyone should be scared off from donating plasma? I think the answer to that is obvious, and while not donating because of a personal bad experience is fine, a long public anecdote is a bit self-centered and not much of a public service announcement. "A hugely non-insignificant percent of the people sticking you at those places are very inexperienced" is just unqualified.

If it's specifically the for-profit companies that bother you, plasma donations are taken by non-profit blood donation centers as well.

Again, covid-convalescent plasma is especially important now, no article from 2014 is going to change that.

The article was inspired by the author's own experience of complications after his very first donation, which happened by the book. He quotes 5 people. The first three lied. The last two didn't. He says he interviewed "three-dozen regulars" and "more than half of them" lied on the questionnaire or cheated one of the tests.

Did you actually read the article, or did you skim it?

It might be helpful. But it might not do anything at all. A couple of small trials have shown that there might be a small reduction in severity or duration. Is that truly indicative of anything? Something something p-hacking?

For one thing, I think I've donated enough to cover +most of the regular commenters on this sub+ at least like 70 people. It was 2012. I needed money for weed (or rather, y'know, /fake weed/, "spice/incense/potpourri"). I donated twice a week, every week, for like 6 months (conservative estimate). That's at least 48 donations. Then I donated again for about 2 months in 2017 (not for drugs, we were in danger of foreclosure), another 16ish donations. I've personally donated at least 60 or 70 batches of plasma, possibly as many as 80 or 90 batches. [EDIT: My point was, if anyone reading this had an intention to donate plasma before reading my comment, and my comment has dissuaded you from donating, you can mentally claim one of my donations as a donation made on your behalf, to assuage any moral discomfort you may be feeling as a result of deciding not to donate.]

For another, you recommended plasma donation with no qualifications. I felt obligated to provide them. It's not without risk.

[[https://www.healthline.com/health/donating-plasma-side-effects#citrate-reaction]]

#+begin_quote
  During a plasma donation, the technician will infuse a substance known as an anticoagulant into the blood collected in the plasma-separating machine before the blood is returned to your body. This anticoagulant is meant to prevent blood clots from forming. The plasma in the machine retains most of the citrate, but some will also enter your bloodstream.

  In the body, citrate binds together a small amount of calcium molecules for a short amount of time. Because this effect is small and temporary, most people experience no side effects from citrate. However, a small number of people who donate plasma experience what's called a “citrate reaction” from the temporary loss of calcium.
#+end_quote

It certainly doesn't always, but a citrate reaction /can/ cause you to have a heart attack.

You say "a long public anecdote is a bit self-centered," but I say "it's kind of irresponsible to advocate plasma donation so casually based on your own anecdotal experience of it."

******** COVID-convalescent plasma is important for research and production, not for direct therapies, though they use that too to save lives.

They're offering double monetary reward, I think that's a pretty good indication of value. It's just in demand worldwide and plasma donation is being requested of everyone who tests positive for the anti-bodies, they send mail, call you, and ask you in person.

I thought YOU skimmed the article, because even after all that quoting line by line it just doesn't back up your assertion that the staff are commonly under-trained. Bringing up the NY law didn't really help there either.

No, 60 or so donations from years ago aren't enough to cover the plasma demand today that readers of this subreddit could help with. I'm confident in asserting that without qualifications.

I spent 2 hours watching presentations and reading documents on the risks, including the citrate reaction and several others that the article doesn't mention, and so will anyone who chooses to donate. I made my suggestion without all that extra info because we (me, you, the journalist) aren't medical professionals. I do CNC machining, my hands are important too, but so is donating plasma.

I didn't say that it was. I assumed that maybe a dozen, or possibly even several dozen, people here would consider donating plasma, and that most of them wouldn't go through with it, and that the majority of those who went through with it would be likely to only make one or two donations each. If those assumptions were correct, and my comment about it put those possible donors off the idea of donating, then I've already covered that number of donations, I've already made as many donations as I (possibly) prevented.

But that was an extremely liberal estimate. You got like two or three upvotes.

[[https://abcnews.go.com/US/thousands-low-income-americans-donate-blood-plasma-profit/story?id=44710257][Nearly 80 percent of the plasma centers in the U.S. are located in America's poorer neighborhoods.]]

Realistically, the demographics don't match up. I'm stereotyping /really/ hard here, I'll own that, but I feel like, generally, most of the people who frequent this subreddit would probably be likely to only make a couple of donations at most, if any at all, because they would probably be doing it as "something to do for charity," just a donation or two to get the feeling of having made a difference and then not have to deal with the discomfort/inconvenience anymore, when really the plasma industry is relying on people in poverty who each individually give donations on a regular basis out of desperation/necessity and who each make hundreds and hundreds of donations over the course of /years/ in spite of the track marks and bruises it leaves on your arms, and the weakness/fatigue that comes with doing it once every three or four days for an extended period of time, and the time commitment of having to wait in a lobby for two or three hours before you get the chance to sit for another hour and a half with a needle in your arm. The people who give the most are doing it to survive, and I think most of the people who do it for the sake of "doing a good deed" aren't likely to give more than once each.

Who knows? I might be furthering your cause. Maybe one or two people who weren't inspired by your initial comment will react to what I've said by donating once a week for a month or two out of spite just to prove me wrong because Elizabeth is an insufferable know-it-all. Maybe several more people will make the same decision and then after their first donation decide that maybe they don't really want to go through with doing it more than once.

Regardless, I'm disowning the donations I made, and I'm now retroactively making those donations on behalf of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Boom, you just /instantly/ got somewhere between 60 and 90 donations from [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Congratulations, that's way more donations than I'd've expected you to get for only getting like two upvotes.

I'm not trying to be some type of way, and I don't not understand the need for plasma, but the industry really is kinda problematic and it isn't without risk for the donors. There's a shortage of liver donors too, but you don't go around advocating for everybody to donate a part of their liver (though I'm sure if they could pay poor people to do it the way they do with plasma, they would).

I'll leave with this:

I was extraordinarily stupid not to tell her to remove the needle the instant I felt electricity shoot down into my hand. I let it sit there touching my nerve for a full 15 minutes.

People still /need/ to donate plasma, and nerve injuries can happen during /any/ type of blood draw, not just plasma donation, so if anyone is bothering to look at the Friday thread like 3 days after it was posted, what you should take away from this exchange is that any time you get stuck for any reason, if you feel electricity, or anything unusual at all, immediately demand the needle be removed.

Seconded. One time a nurse went all the way through one of my veins. I should have said something about the pain. Luckily I came away with just a bruise.

I still donate fairly regularly. I avoid the blood bus (where that incident happened) and I have the clinic stick the other arm, which I'm told is easier to work with. If somebody screws up again, well, I'll mention it immediately.

I've yet to donate platelets this year. You inspired me to schedule my next appointment.

If I were to find that I have covid19 antibodies, I'd probably switch to plasma. My clinic doesn't pay anyone for their donations... I'm not sure if I'd switch to one that does. Hmmm.

** I want to see a world with stats but without bs magic materials.

​

For instance very powerful people resisting attacks because they are too dense to penetrate. i.e Enemy (who's superhuman already) throws rock at MC, the rock moves at bullet speeds but because of the MCs defense stat, his density is too high and the rock shatters to dust after giving him a small bruise. Maybe if the enemy had use a lead pellet he'd have damaged the MC but his lack of proper equipment to deal with a superhuman means he loses by default.

​

Or bows being uncommon because making a bow strong enough or with enough draw weight to damage a powerful person it'd have to be too big to handle or to be made of very rare materials.

​

People having to use interesting materials for weaponry like lead or gold because of the high density etc.

​

Ranged weapons being lead pellets people throw. Melee weapons having gold tips, crazy stuff like that.

​

I'm reading this LitRPG and some goblins are attacking this MC who could carry a car on his back with bone weapons and they're supposed to be a challenge? Come on, bone wouldn't even scratch his skin at this point it's too dumb to enjoy..

lets say you have a non adult stuck in a time loop. Lets say they re-experience the same month over and over, remembering the past iterations and being able to do stuff differently. The world is our world in 2021. How would their psyche change?

How would that affect kids at different ages?

Examples:

- A 15 year old stuck in a 30-day time loop for 100 loops

- A 10 year old stuck in a 30-day time loop for 100 loops

- a 5 year old stuck in a 30-day time loop for 100 loops
