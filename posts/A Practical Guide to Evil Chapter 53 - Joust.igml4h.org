** I hope I didn't miss someone else's thread, this chapter has been up for a while. Pretty exciting one too, what with Cat on the brink of a Name and all. I always like how smart the Dead King is. Tries rolling his vulture once an enemy jumps on it, and then just cuts his losses the second he knows the Knight Errant is doing more harm then good.

​

The new Name has almost come into fruition, and it's been a long time coming. It seems to be closely tied to her new role as a leader and arbiter of Named, and it may give her the power to hold sway over villains even if she loses the Night (which I personally suspect will happen once the war is over).

​

And for once, the Summoner actually pulled his weight pretty well. Archer and Huntress didn't try to kill each other either, so it's kind of amazing how well this little Named voyage went. A little odd that they didn't grab some random Name to make it the full five, but time was of the essence.

*** Oh sweet lord. That was it. If Cat had finished her Name, had Judged the Knight Errant Penitent, then it would have joined their band of 5 as a freed undead!

**** I'm pretty sure a band of five requires much closer ties than just throwing together some tactically pertinent Names for a quick sortie to take out some scouts.

***** Don't you remember when Cat but the band of five together to fight the Fae in the arsenal? Admittedly, she ended up half dead after the second traitor in the group went after her, but hey, it was still a band.

****** I would argue that it wasn't a Band of Five the same way that, say, The Calamities or the Woe are a band of five, or the band of five composed of both heroes and villains that made up the Five Stories.

It's a band like Bard has been part of, not a Band like Cat has been part of.

Still, I suppose there are benefits to having a band of five just at a tactical level even if it's not riding a story. Five people lets you cover all the major archetypes and party roles

******* That's fair. And as you say, this entire encounter only took half an hour or so

** Catherine's fighting style is a lot more interesting and elegant now that she's wielding Night instead of Winter. Much less brute force, much more finesse and, well, style.
