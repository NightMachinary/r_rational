*** The description on FimFiction is

#+begin_quote
  Daring Do can't believe her luck when she is asked to help explore the most ancient tomb known to ponykind. But terrible danger awaits her, for beneath the earth rests something beyond equine understanding.

EDIT: Just read it. This is really all the explanation that can be given.

*** No. This story is brilliant when read without spoilers. No summaries.

Yes, I realize it's /My Little Pony/ fanfiction. Read it anyway. Besides, ponies are great.

**** I personally find ponies to be some mixture of utterly boring and completely terrible, but this story was nonetheless totally amazing and worth reading immediately.

Just for contrast.

***** The MLP:FiM community has a higher proportion of older males in in, compared to all the fanfic communities populated largely by 13 year old girls. It's therefore somewhat easier to find fanfic that appeals to the demographics of this sub than many other fandoms of similar or larger size (largely because fewer people are trying to write romances, and more are trying to write adventures and sci-fi).

***** It's eldritch horror.

It makes sense in the context of that genre.

****** well thanks for clarifying. I still find it severely lacking compared to other eldritch horrors i read, if only for the fact i couldn't even tell it's supposed to be horror by anything other than the process of elimination . but maybe i was simply exposed to the better eldritch horror stories.
