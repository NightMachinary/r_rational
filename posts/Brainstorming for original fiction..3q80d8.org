I'm brainstorming for the world building of an original fiction piece I'm toying around with. The major background element is that at some point, around 14 years ago, for a short period of time (likely an hour) anyone that said "I wish _____" had it come true.

I'm not sure if it's going to play a major role in the story, but the point is to give myself an interesting playground to write in.

What I'm working on right now are just brainstorming some of the impacts this would have. Probably a few people miraculously healed, maybe a handful of people with various kinds of super powers, probably a couple of people with way too much power.

Then there's the less direct things, like people would probably be very careful and deliberate about even thinking "I wish ___", and I'd imagine that wishing harm on someone would be extremely taboo if not some sort of crime given wishes at one point verifiable came true.

So I thought I'd see what kind of world building elements the people around here would expect to crop up as a result of this divergence in history.

*** I disagree with the "there are multiple presidents". Instead, there're a sudden rush of random people being placed in the position of company president. there are now four or five presidents of the USA. (most people say i wish i were president, not president of the USA. The difference is pretty big.)

This wrecks even more chaos on the stock market, ofc.

***** Are you saying that giving them a smaller quantity of personal power is a less begin interpretation of the wish than a large quantity of power split over 300 ways, that'll probably be taken away once everyone realizes what happened?

I assumed president was defined as the Single person with veto power who runs the executive branch of the government.

****** People who say "I wish I was president" generally know which type of "president" they're talking about, and wishing for the title is more explicit than wishing for the power of being president, given that most people who wished for the power of the president would also likely get drastically less than they think they would as well, since the POTUS has nowhere near as much control over things as people think they do.

****** "True genie" should be "reality-perverse." "True" should probably be reserved for a Friendly genie, I'll concede.

******* Yes. Apparently the nation splits into five nations- like in the civil war, only more fragmented. Unlike last time, though, this is quickly rectified with hasty negotiations.

Still, you're probably right, it's a literal intent genie, not a literal wording genie. My mistake.

** I wonder what kind of limits you would impose on this kind of thing?

What if someone wished "I wish I was the only person who could speak" so that they were the only ones to be able to speak. If someone were plausible, and thought it out, then they could rationally conclude that speaking the i wish.

This means that in the background, you'd need to place some kinds of limits on the wish, because some could be extremely dramatic and universe-level altering.

**** Well, the bigger issue is that once someone has their wish come true, they'll immediately try a second wish. Other people who see this wish come true will try wishes of their own. So you're not really restricting it down to just "people who said 'I wish ...' within that hour", it rapidly expands to lots and lots of other people. This is true even if you're in the pre-internet era.

**** I estimate I say that phrase at least once a week. That's 126 hours awake, so I had a 1 in 126 chance. That's over five million English speakers, assuming that it has to be that phrase in English.

Of course, there must have been some kind of time delay, or the people who realized would have wished a million things.

Frankly, there would probably have been many people who had wished themselves omnipotence, so game over.

***** Yeah. The idea is for it to have been short enough that none of the end results were deliberate.

Otherwise I'm dealing with fallout that's much harder to work into an enjoyable story.
