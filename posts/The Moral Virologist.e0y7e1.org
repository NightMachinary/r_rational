*** Unfortunately not all that alien. I'll bet there's at least a few people at my church who would do this if they could.

** A: "Man, I've got it, you ready to hear me dunk on Christians?"\\
B: "Go for it!"\\
A: "In my story, somebody makes a plague and kills thousands, millions!"\\
B: "Vile! People will be sad about all the dead people in the story."\\
A: "Yeah, but, like, get this, you ready?"\\
B: "Lay it on me."\\
A: "The main bad thing in the story is that he does all this mass murder because... he is a Christian!"\\
B: "Woah, so, like, the people reading will be like, wow, Christianity leads to virus slaughter."\\
A: "Right, like, the story is mostly about hating the main character for being religious and hateful, I am just using the massacre of thousands to draw horns on him.\\
B: "Love it, but, like, could he be more loathsome?"\\
A: "And so he hires a prostitute, but, like, she's also smarter than him about how plagues work!"\\
B: "haha, nice, so he's a hypocrite against his own codes, and also incompetent! He is smart enough to make a super plague but too dumb to know how they work!"\\
A: "Because of how he is a Christian and can't get laid!"\\
B: "Masterpiece."

*** I agree with the summary but my take about the moral of the story is that the Christian bit is irrelevant, it's just there to set the scene for the real moral, which is: "Complex projects can easily fail due to missing something important, and you should consider the possible downsides of failure before embarking on them."

Nah, babies getting aids from mother is a consideration someone working as prostitute may have in mind, so when talking about super aids that everyone have, babies may be one of the first things she would think of.

As for him, he solved this problem 6 years before release, but on his high forgot that not warning everyone would lead to shitload of deaths before pattern is found. That and him being batshit insane.

** If this was written today, the research plausibly could've been government funded by the evangelical wing. Fox News would probably defend it as freedom to express religion.

*** I mean...I'm pretty sure just doing the research isn't illegal at all. Once it starts getting into the planning stages, that's where you start breaking laws, and probably a lot of them. And at that point "expression of religious freedom" would absolutely not cut it.

**** It's definitely illegal, it's bioweapon development research. That's an international crime for most countries, and would provoke strikes into non-signatory countries.

It's also defacto illegal even if not recognized: It wouldn't get approved by any research regulatory groups, there was a big backlash from research that created a airborne flu virus awhile ago that tightened those up. They would also classify the research as biosafety level 4, meaning it can only be done in certain (government) high security places.
