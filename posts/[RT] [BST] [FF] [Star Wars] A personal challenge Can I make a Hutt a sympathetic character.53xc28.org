The basic premise:

Our Protagonist's name is Zira, they use ey/em/eir pronouns, and yes, ey're a Hutt. Ey're growing up on a shit desert planet somewhere in the Outer Rim, somewhere around 10 BBY. Eir father is raising em to take over their branch of the Cartel, and on this particular planet, their main line is slaves.

After a massive slave result breaks out, Zira attempts to convince eir dad that maybe slavery is bad for business. This is partly because ey think that the gargantuan cost of feeding and watering slaves on a desert planet is immense. But it's also because ey was shaken by the slave revolt, and ey may also have some slightly juvenile ideas about the importance of freedom in general (and the freedom of Zira the Hutt in particular).

Eir dad basically tells em, "You are a snot-nosed kid, you don't actually understand what's going on here. You think you can do better, fine. Go. But you're not coming back."

Zira does go, and resolves both to grow a bigger operation than eir dad ever did and completely obliterate eir dad's, all without taking a single slave.

Along the way, ey meet a ridiculously cute Toydarian girl and her large overly-friendly family, deal with a protocol-droid-turned-assassin, and get tangled up with the nascent Rebellion.

Can ey reach eir goal without getting emself killed- and, equally important, can eir ideals survive getting hit in the face with cold hard reality?

--------------

Other things of importance-

- The aliens in Star Wars canon are criminally under-played-around-with, ESPECIALLY in the movies and especially-especially if they're not human-shaped. This fic is meant to rectify that.
- In this fic, Huttese is the language translated into English; Basic is the strange and foreign conlang.
- Plot-important, non-incompetent: Gungans, droids, Wookiees (with more characterisation than 'crossbow-carrying carpet cares about human'), Hutts by the scads, Toydarians, probably more as I keep writing
- Non-humanity as default. Alien as default. Humans are on the sidelines- they're the Stock Bad Guy or the Stock Minor Character.
- Mostly fast-paced fun Crime Hijinks, with a side of politicking and a squinch of philosophy.

Does this sound like something anyone would be interested in? If so, what are some problems you can see with the idea, and what are some things you'd like to see included?

***** Well, technically, they're still made up, just by multiple intellectuals over the course of a century and a bit. The fact that none of them have been adopted into common English usage means that they kinda fall under the same umbrella as words an author might make up to describe a phenomenon in their book with no proper word describing it in English. Intelligible to a person who only knows English and is familiar with the particular context of the words, but not intelligible to most English speakers.

Personally, I know my internal reading voice would stumble every time I read one of those pronouns, and as much as they're supposed to be gender neutral the dominance of the letter 'e' means I get a feminine image from the way they sound, so I also wind up feeling like they're not accomplishing their purpose.

*** The gender neutral pronouns are going to be problematic and immersive breaking; I think Orion's arm is the only place I've seen it done well and even there is often broke what otherwise is a lot of YMMV fun and physics porn. Do what you want; if it bothers me too much that is what replace all scripts or text to speech pronunciation customization is for.

That said: write it. I look forward to reading it and hope you pull it off well. I'd challenge you to make the slavers sympathetic too, not arguing for that choice, slavery IMHO is a capital E evil, but as written Zira has been inculcated in a society (I'm not the best on the expanded universe but Hutts=Mafioso) where slavery is normal and a sign of admirable status, so there's probably some initial cached thoughts pointing along the chain slaveholder -> power -> good.

If you need ideas, you could give [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/353476.Tales_from_Jabba_s_Palace][Tales from Jabba's palace]] a read. It's a compilation of shorts from the perspectives of the various alien denizens there, including the slave dancer Twi'lek and the Rancor master. To make us involved with the protagonist you could focus on the treachery and backstabbing that's business as usual in the cartel. Really looking forward to your first chapter.

** Are you going to be rationalizing the aliens' evolutionary and cultural histories?

One of the reasons I havn't touched my star warsish ratfic project in a long time is that every time an alien says or does anything, if I want to do them justice, if I want to avoid anthropomorphising them, I have to descend so far into the task of fleshing out their natural and social history that I usually don't come out again.

You avoid this if you're just importing star wars' aliens and taking the superficial characterizations from canon as the word of god.. but I sense you might not want to do that. You want to get into their heads and the only way to do that is to get into their evolutionary history.

*** I was about to say "to an extent" but then I realised, yes, that's exactly what I'm doing. Or at least, trying to give them any /semblance/ of their own culture at all, and part of that has to come from their shape.

Legends!canon is actually kind of decent to the Hutts - not /good/, but kind of decent. (In the words of my friend: "wait, Hutts are cool?!" There are plausible reasons for why they do what they do, some attempt has been made to get into their heads, they have some semblance of a history and a culture that could be fleshed out and expanded upon...

But for some of the species I want to use (like Toydarians or Gungans or basically anything that was a dumbshit idea from the prequels) people have decided to cut their losses and move on. Which means I need to do exactly what you said.

(Honest-to-god, I'm excited about the Toydarians. They're significantly cooler than presented in canon, especially movie!canon.)

Most of what I'm interested in IS on the linguistic/cultural side of things (I'm an English major, sue me), but you can't have culture and language without it being informed by body shape and size because slapping human cultures onto aliens is just twee and bland and blehhhhh.

At the same time, you have to keep them relatable enough that a human reader can at least understand what's going on with some explication. There's a reason my protag is a bit of an odd duck by Hutt standards. xD

I'm remembering these long-necked scientists in one of the prequels, but I'll bet they went and made them autistic to compensate or something. Or maybe they just made them unlucky, or persecuted. Whatever it took for justice to be preserved.

***** One legitimate defense of the ubiquity of gendered pronouns is that without them pronoun bindings will be ambiguous far more often- if you're talking about two non-binary individuals, "ey took eir wallet and put eir key into it" has like 8 different interpretations, pronouns almost stop being usable, and you end up having to resort to names. Bigots should note, though, that this is not a case against novel GNPs, but a case for introducing like 20 new ones and assigning them to people at random to reduce pronoun clash rates to unprecedentedly low levels.

"they"'s absolute ambiguity is one of the reasons I like it. It doesn't just omit gender, it omits plurality as well. Are they an individual, a group, an agent of a hivemind? Not for the reader to know.

******* True, heh, I guess the reason gendered pronouns work in this role is that gender is generally superficially apparent, if you know a person's name you probably know their gender too so the pronoun binding is obvious.

If we wanted novel pronouns to be as easy to associate with people.. the only traits I can think of that're as superficially recognizable as gender are ethnicity and maybe age. I don't like the sound of this idea any more.

****** My preferred solution is introducing pronouns that are predefined somehow based on context. Not really suitable for English, since we're not at all trained to use this sort of thing.

#+begin_quote
  Kate told Mary that <1 possessive pronoun> dress is more expensive than <2 possessive pronoun> but that <2 subjective pronoun> could look stunning in rags, whereas <1 subjective pronoun> always felt ugly no matter what <1 subjective pronoun> wore.
#+end_quote

Using hypothetical pronouns oss/om/oms, toss/tom/toms:

#+begin_quote
  Kate told Mary that /oms/ dress is more expensive than /toms/ but that /toss/ could look stunning in rags, whereas /oss/ always felt ugly no matter what /oss/ wore.
#+end_quote

I don't like that specific choice of labels for the pronouns, but hopefully it illustrates that the concept could be useful, if ungainly, for resolving ambiguity.

Although another good way to resolve it is to differentiate between the matching and non-matching cases. English already does this in some situations (e.g. "He killed him" vs. "He killed himself"), but doesn't always (e.g. "She lost her keys" for both). Making that relationship explicit goes a long way to solving the problem.

The latter is the Swedish solution: if you don't use a reflexive pronoun (sig, sitt, sin, sina), it's assumed you're referring to a different individual. So "Han dödade hans fru" means "He killed <another man's> wife", while "Han dödade sin fru" means "He killed <his own> wife". I'm not an expert in the language, but it appears to solve most of the ambiguity in the two-party case (for more than 2 it's probably going to be a nightmare in any case).

I consider the two versions to be approximately equal in ambiguity.

are there good Hutts /somewhere/ in a galaxy far far away? sure I'm fairly certain there are. but given Hutt culture, they are few and far in-between.

in the EU before it was discontinued by Disney there was a Hutt Jedi (Beldoron) who was actually quite sympathetic as a character. even if he did go mad and become a bad guy. but he was powerful and intelligent enough to be a Jedi that means he had to have been a good person once upon a time.
