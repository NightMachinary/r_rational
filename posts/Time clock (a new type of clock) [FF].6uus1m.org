** Is...is time the only thing we're allowed to communicate? Will the Gods Beyond Time, Fluffy Be Their Name smite me down if My future-me communicates with present-me?

Or are we actually discussing how cool it would be to use /time travel as a watch/.

Edit: Is our traveling limited to colloquially recognized units of time? If so, what's the limit? You said hours, what about minutes? Seconds? Could I flood the room with me-copies? How long can I stay in the future for? Is this a license to make infinite clones of myself? How far into the future can I go?

So many questions...

Edit': FF? Is this a fanfic of something? Is there supposed to be a link?
