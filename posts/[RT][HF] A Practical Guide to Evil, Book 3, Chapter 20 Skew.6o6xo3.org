** Brief recap - the Named Cat has on her "side" are:

- Adjutant
- Apprentice
- Archer (?)
- Thief (?)

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/68y7nw/rt_hf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_3_chapter_8/dh2lpeo/][Prospective Names (per previous speculation):]]

- Robber
- Ratface

Going to throw in Kilian for discussion. I'm including her because the "last big talk with Love Interest before battle" is such a standard narrative scene that I expect Kilian to resurface at some point.

--------------

Edit: Cat's speech to Thief is a remarkable throwback to her speech to herself.

Book 3 Chapter 20: Skew

#+begin_quote
  “Gods Below, am I tired of hearing about fault,” I shouted. “Fault and blame and Good -- none of it fixes any of this. If you want a solution, you deal with realities. With what exists, not the pretty little world that ‘should be'. Praes would have acted in its interest, and that meant torching the country. Procer would have acted in its interests, which was making us a protectorate. Anyone who plans without acknowledging that isn't planning, they're lying to themselves. That's what I can't stand about the lot of you. Do you think doing the right thing is enough? Fuck you. I've had to bloody my hands to get this far, Thief. I didn't enjoy it, and some of the things I've done will haunt me to my grave. But the only clean victories are the ones in stories. Preach all you want, I have gotten things done.”

Compare Book 1 Chapter 5: Role

#+begin_quote
  [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/chapter-5-role/][“Doing nothing is worse than being Evil,” I told her, striding forward. “Getting people killed because you won't compromise is worse than being Evil. I'm going to change things -- maybe not all of them, but enough. And if that means getting my hands dirty, I can live with that. I don't have to be a good person to make a better world.”]]

*** Ratface isn't going to become a name. Of this I'm almost certain. For one he has no real renown nor is he doing anything story-like. I mean, there's -maybe- a name for "Quartermaster" but it'd be a pretty boring one with pretty silly aspects.

I think we're looking at calamity mirrors still.

Cat | Black

Adjutant | Captain

Archer | Ranger

Apprentice | Warlock

Robber | Assassin

Thief | Scribe

**** u/AurelianoTampa:
#+begin_quote
  Robber | Assassin

  Thief | Scribe
#+end_quote

Not sure about those last two; Thief herself said that Assassin tried to recruit her:

#+begin_quote
  “Assassin tried to recruit me, when I first came into my Name,” she suddenly said.

  ...

  “The conversation couldn't have lasted more than a quarter hour,” Thief said. “To this day, I shiver when I think of it. That... thing was death made flesh.”
#+end_quote

So my thinking is that she's the Assassin analog, though Robber definitely has the better temperament for it.

I also find it really curious that this got tossed out unexpectedly, but there's no explanation (or followup from Cat) asking what they talked about or why Assassin let Thief live. Assassin has always been portrayed as reveling in (creative) death; and the Calamities, especially Assassin, have killed what, a score of fledgling heroes? I can't imagine she got away from Assassin despite the power her name might have conferred; which means Assassin let her go. Why?

Edit: A possible answer to my own question: Thief /is/ Assassin. Erraticerrata has mentioned that Assassin has already been in the story, in person, just not named as Assassin. It could be that Assassin took on Thief's appearance and is playing at being her. That could also explain why Cat notices the differences between Thief and other heroes she has met. Thief isn't attractive like most heroes become; she doesn't have the weight of presence or the ability to inspire like other heroes, even antisocial ones like the Lone Swordsman.

It's circumstantial, but I have been wondering which character we've met is actually Assassin, and Thief seems like a good fit.

Cause it ends with Scribe talking like Assasin being mad is a major turn on for her. Also, the assasin is frequently abroad, like during Cordelia's rise to power, while Scribe is Always at Black's side.

***** I'm thinking Assassin is likely that leader of the Blackguards who's appeared a couple times. But the reason I assume Thief fills in for scribe is because of this chapter. She literally skulks around and steals information/stuff making her the perfect black ops character. Also, she doesn't really kill all that easily, the only time we've for-sure seen her try to massacre anyone is versus pre-named Adjutant under William's dumbass planning.

Robber however? He's filling in the "infiltrate and execute" activities that Assassin would. He runs a team of sneaky murderous butchers and would likely make for a great Assassin himself with his enjoyment of insanity.

Lieutenant Abase, right? Just curious, any particular reason why? The best I can think of is that Black tells Scribe to contact Assassin, and if Assassin is in the Blackguard and thus traveling with them, that explains why murders can happen within hours of the request. Anything else?

I can see that to some extent; Scribe and Thief both share the characteristic of going unseen. Though Scribe seems to be MUCH better at it; Cat knew Thief was in the room in this chapter, and Thief had to take out the guards rather than just walk past them in "Raid." Scribe however can basically disappear from plain sight if she doesn't want to be seen.

Scribe also strikes me as more of the bookish type, while Thief is much more dexterous and energetic; I don't think we've ever seen Eudokia look rushed or move quickly or anything, but Thief is constantly on the move, throwing boats at armies or scaling the walls of heavily warded keeps to find Diabolist's secret basement.

Still, I agree, she's a closer match to Scribe than Robber is, by a long shot. I just wonder if my Thief = Assassin logical leap ends up being right, is there going to be some other character who steps up to fill the Scribe role analog?

Well, yes. The Calamities are, in their respective roles, MUCH better than Cat's team. I mean, could you compare Cat to Black? Adjutant to Captain? Apprentice to Warlock? etc etc. But they're all specialized differently and have their own fields of excellence. Thief would just be an analog not an exact duplicate. Plus scribe isn't as useful as a great Thief in a lot of situations even if she's an amazing "webweaver".

There are no /real/ reasons that I'm guessing this. But Abase has been named, is always around, and is in position to provide what Assassin does. While he might easily be someone else in this story given Erratic's hints I think he's the most likely culprit. But I won't be terribly depressed if I'm wrong. Assassin isn't an easily solved character and I wouldn't force myself to match wits with the author in this regard.

***** Assasin likely isn't a great combatant (He generally is only described killing non combatants or ambushing combatants with poisons), especially when the other named is standing right in front of his face. Plus thief seems pretty adapt at getting away, it would be a super easy way to blunder in a pattern of three

Correct my memory, but have we seen Thief fight other Named? I remember her fighting Hakram but that was before he came into his Name (and it cost him his hand, but not his life). So that sorta makes it even more likely she shares similarities to Assassin - she stays out of fair fights and/or might not be that strong.

Or another possibility: if Thief was actually Assassin and she could feel Hakram coming into a Name or knew of his importance, so she didn't want him to die and thus didn't go all out. Regular people don't go against any Named, even less offensive-oriented ones, and live very often. But she had to take a hand to make it look convincing.

#+begin_quote

She said that she met Assassin "when she first came into her Name." Odds are that she either did not have all of her Aspects yet, or was still learning to use them. And at that point Assassin had been killing Heroes for at least a decade and a half. If Assassin wanted Thief dead... I think she'd be dead.

The biggest problem i have with the Thief == Assasin idea is that she must have fooled the bard to pull it off, or the bard must have played along.

**** I suspect the name Cat is going to end up taking might be "Warlord".

She's been called it a few times, and while it has some significance to the orcs, it might /also/ be foreshadowing for a Name:

***** My main doubt about this is that Warlord is (as you stated) an orcish Name, and Cat is Callowan to her core. I feel it much more likely that she transitions to a Knight of some sort, or maybe Queen of Blades or some other culturally relevant Name. She has great respect among the orcs, but I could see it more easily going to an orc such as Juniper.

Or maybe Hakram... do we know if Adjutant is a transition name like Squire and Heiress? It feels like it might be; Adjutant is a military aid to a senior officer. If Hakram eventually branches out to become an orcish leader, I could see him transitioning to Warlord. Then again, Black Knight and Captain are both "end" Names that serve under other roles, so maybe Adjutant is similar.

***** Erratic has mentioned in one of the comment sections that Warlord is an orc title/name. I somehow doubt Cat will gain the allegiance of the entirety of Orc nations. I'd much more likely believe Hakram becomes Warlord eventually.

Or Nauk. Nauk is often not brought up during all this but he's pretty amazing all on his own.
