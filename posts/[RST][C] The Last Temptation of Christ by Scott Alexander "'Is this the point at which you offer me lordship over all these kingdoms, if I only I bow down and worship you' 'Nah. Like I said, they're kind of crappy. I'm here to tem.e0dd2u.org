** I really wish you guys would either:

a) Stop calling all statistics "Bayesian." They're not. The stats in the story are Frequentist, not Bayesian.

b) Stop obsessing over Bayesian statistics. It's weird. It's a methodology that mostly gets you the same results as frequentist approaches, just formatted differently. The differences in results occur in edge cases, and neither is clearly superior. You guys have some kind of "hipster statistics" movement going on.

*** nah it's not a weird obsession. "The medium is the message". Bayesian is key to computation, and we're communicating in hyperspace run on computers (PCs, servers and smartphones- they're all "bayesian computers") So on this platform we have a certain percentage of people who only know statistics through the lens of computer science. I myself dreaded the subject and at uni took "Statistics for Psychology", instead, which I still barely passed. So, if we were starting discussions in "meatspace", you'd be on target. As it is, all the technology from hardware, to browsers, and the rest of the internet infrastructure that comprises this web "discussion board", is built with Bayesian computing. Of course it's going to leak out in the content as well.

**** I used to teach a psychology statistics class, part of which included a section on Bayesian statistics. Unless you're doing something really weird with the math, the differences are almost completely negligible. The main difference seems to be that frequentist approaches are old enough that there are standards for use (p-values are a common gripe for Bayesians), yet the only reason Bayesian stats don't have similar standards is that they're still relatively new.

And I work in Human Factors Psychology, so I'm not unfamiliar with computer-applied statistical modeling either. I'm... hesitant to agree with the idea that CS is special, as most machine learning algorithms I've used are based on a frequentist background.

***** I did Psych Stats in '91, before the web was widely used, so... basically I'm BSing. I thought this was pretty good attempt though. Convinced myself pretty quickly lol! Saw a biopic on Bayes recently, too, and how relatively unsung the Irish mathematician has been. So that's colored my thoughts. OK, "Stop with the Bayensian references everyone! You're doing it wrong!"

** None of those 100,000 Jesi have any reason to believe that the real Jesus would be immune from this conundrum. So assuming all the Jesi are perfect Bayesian rationalists, they would all realize that the real Jesus still has to take that 1:99,999 gamble.

What matters to an individual Jesus's decision isn't "Which outcome has the best chance of being correct?", it's "What choice would the real Jesus make?"

** The story sort of depends on ignorance of schizophrenia, and symptoms of psychosis and delusion. Hallucination and delusion are actually two distinct symptoms. Haldol (brand name of haloperidol) would immediately dismiss hallucinations (in this case, of the Devil), but not necessarily dismiss a delusion of being Jesus (unless maybe the dose was strong enough to put the patient to sleep.) A patient with a strong delusion of being Jesus, would probably return to this delusion, even if the Haldol temporarily straightened out his thinking. -my sources of information: My mentally ill ex-wife needed a Haldol injection on a few emergency ER occasions, and at the time I was working as a mental health worker, and dealing with my own mental health struggles. In my life I've actually been a lot closer to this situation than any of you normie motherfuckers. This scenario should have been stretched out over several episodes, where the Devil has a separate presentation or offer each time, and revisiting the "Mr. Anderson" scenario several times at different levels of convincing. Also, parallel situations where Jesus becomes violent towards the Devil, or behaves "self destructively", to give justification why as "Mr. Anderson", he would get sedated with Haldol.

**** Yeah, there's the obvious... but if he's Mr.Anderson not Jesus, the nurse would have to have justification for the shot. No one just gives Haldol shots on a whim. You'd have to have "Jesus" behaving pretty badly to bring out a needle. I've heard "orderlies" or whatever you call them, make desperate and elaborate excuses to give liquid Trazadone, (helps migraines, don't you know!) But the story calls for a bad situation leading up to it. Cheech Martin trying to scratch his balls while in a straightjacket comes to mind ("Nice Dreams", w PeeWee Herman's debut)
