Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

#+begin_quote
  While at the Brothers of Christian Instruction, he became acquainted with a young doctor named Joseph C. Cyr.[6] That led to his most famous exploit, in which he masqueraded as Cyr, working as a trauma surgeon aboard HMCS Cayuga, a Royal Canadian Navy destroyer, during the Korean War. He managed to improvise successful major surgeries and fend off infection with generous amounts of penicillin. His most notable surgical practices were performed on some sixteen Korean combat casualties who were loaded onto the Cayuga. All eyes turned to Demara, the only "surgeon" on board, as it became obvious that several of the casualties would require major surgery or certainly die. After ordering personnel to transport these variously injured patients into the ship's operating room and prep them for surgery, Demara disappeared to his room with a textbook on general surgery and proceeded to speed-read the various surgeries he was now forced to perform, including major chest surgery. None of the casualties died as a result of Demara's surgeries.

** I came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/83jdld/the_dream_of_nuclear_fusion_is_on_the_brink_of/dvint1o/][this]] super interesting comment on the state of fusion power. If you have an hour, I highly recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4][this]] talk by the leading MIT scientist.

TLDR: ITER, the 50 billion$ fusion project, is so big because its limited by last generation superconductors - magnetic field strenght of about 5 tesla. Since then, next gen superconductors have become available on Alibaba(!) and go easily up to 10 tesla and higher. The constraint is no longer field strength, but rather magnet coil structural integrity. Internal pressure at those high field strengths makes the magnets implode.

Now, fusion physics has a couple of terms in which magnetic field strength goes in as a power of 3 or even 4. Meaning with this doubling of field strength you get 8 or 16 times better performance - or you can make the reactor smaller by that much.

Very exciting stuff!

It ruined the friendship when all he wanted to do was talk about the game and I didn't have the energy to learn very much about building a video game /and/ keep up with my coursework at the same time.

*** I currently have collision detection problems. I don't understand how other game developers can program this to be so efficient.

I mean, look at Obliterate Everything: that's a game where you construct buildings that build ships automatically every few seconds, and the ships that are carriers spawn miniships every few seconds, and those miniships can spray bullets out like crazy. And you can have 3 players fighting each other, spamming those ships out like crazy, yet the game doesn't lag (at least, not as much as you would expect). How the heck is that possible? The game code has to somehow detect collisions between all the countless ships and bullets in real time, which is nuts.

I looked for tutorials online, and they recommended programming an invisible grid across the entire map, and recording which cell of the grid each bullet/ship is in, and only detecting collisions between bullets/ships in nearby cells. I tried that, but it's still crazy slow. Especially when the map is huge, which it is in Obliterate Everything, considering that ships and bullets can go off-map and then come back.

**** The first rule of optimisation - do your calculations /outside/ the loop, as much as possible. If you're repeating a calculation a million times, then make the art that you repeat /as small as possible/. (An example of a small calculation for collision detection - is the difference in X-coordinate between A and B less than the size of the largest object in your map? If not, they are not colliding, move on to the next one, don't even bother looking more closely than that one-subtraction-and-comparison).

The second rule of optimisation - don't be afraid to use lookup tables for common calculations.

The third rule of optimisation - use a profiling tool (gprof is good) to see /exactly/ where your code is spending all its time. You don't want to spend six weeks tightening up Function A only to find out that the real bottleneck is Function B.

*** Hope you feel better! What's going on in yours?

Currently I'm wrapping up a project for a talk at a conference next month; hoping to get the paper submitted before then too. I keep thinking of (and collaborators keep suggesting) additional analyses to perform for the simulation component, which keeps extending the completion date.

Wife's coming to visit in a few days (her lab moved and took her with it, lest she otherwise forfeit several years of PhD) and we'll be together for a few weeks, for which I'm very excited! We talk for a few hours every night and play video games and watch movies and stuff but I've still missed her deeply. Her absence has actually affected me in a chronic sense more than essentially anything else in my life, but luckily she's wrapping up over the next few months and moving back x-country in the early summer, so not long left!

Earlier today I got a response for the call for summer teaching assignments -- didn't get the course I wanted but got one I've taught [[https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/3hs0em/taught_a_course_a_few_weeks_ago_on/][a few times before]] (paleoanthro's maybe half the focus, it's an upper div class on human evolutionary biology) which'll be substantially less work since I'll only have to make fairly minor updates to lecture materials. Pay's pretty good too, at least relative to what I'm used to, around $1k/week for part-time (~20h/w) work, which's nice cos I'll be taking a hefty pay cut from when my GRF runs out this year. And it's a fun class to teach (I get a captive audience to listen to me ramble on about stuff I'm interested in, and then we all discuss it afterwards, what's not to love). Listening to music this morning I had a thought to put the following in the syllabus:

#+begin_quote
  Your final grade will be computed as a weighted average of course components. A breakdown of those components and their weights follows:

  | Weight | Component                  |
  |--------+----------------------------|
  | 10%    | luck                       |

  | 15%    | concentrated power of will |
  | 5%     | pleasure                   |
  | 50%    | pain                       |

  In total these weights will sum to 100% reason to remember the name.

**** Some feedback on the article:

- You're not really explaining what state is, or how different languages treat them. Personally, I think functional programming has as much or more "state" than imperative programming; the difference is it has less incoherent / fragmented state, because functional programming makes cache invalidation easier.

- Imperative programming isn't opposed to functional programming, it's opposed to declarative programming. Imperative programming can have subroutines, so the part about it being more prone to code duplication doesn't really apply.

(also, I'd argue than object-orientation is less of a paradigm and more of a way to structure both functional and imperative programming, and that it's extremely overused, but that's a personal opinion)

***** I agree with your assessment of object-oriented programming as overused, though I'm mainly a functional programmer and I try not to be too partisan when I'm teaching.

If you're operating at a high enough level of abstraction, then, yes, object-oriented programming just seems like a weird application of closures. But paradigms are not really about the computer, they're about the programmer. That is, they're more about culture and general approaches to problems. OO is different not because classes and objects are special, but because when you're thinking in OO, you'll try to solve problems a certain way.

There's more to functional programming than avoiding cache invalidation. I'd recommend Rich Hickey's talk on complexity in the technical sense, as in not entangling one part of a system with another.

[[https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy]]

Regarding not defining state, that's more or less by design. Honestly this article is already pretty borderline for the audience of that blog, which is targeted at digital humanities people who don't tend to have much in the way of CS concerns. But sometimes you have to made compromises and turn up the temperature gradually so the frog doesn't (apocryphally) jump out of the pot.

Thanks for the feedback. I agree with you in general, but wouldn't do anything differently given this audience and what I know about teaching programming. I could be persuaded by some arguments about pedagogy, i.e. experiences teaching programming to people and what they did or didn't get in what order.

**** Also feedback on that article:

#+begin_quote
  A major source of complexity in a program is “state”---basically, what a program has to keep track of as it moves forward through time.
#+end_quote

This is misleading. While the opinion of state being a major source of complexity is generally accepted, this usually refers to /global/ state, that is state modified by many different procedures in non-obvious ways. You definition of state includes local variables and parameters, which are usually not considered harmful.

#+begin_quote
  Here, we'll be comparing three specific paradigms: imperative, functional, and object-oriented.
#+end_quote

Again, misleading. These are not exclusive, which is not clear from reading the article.

#+begin_quote
  Imperative programs often change the state of the program on each line, assigning new variables and referring to or changing old ones.
#+end_quote

Obviously they do. If an instruction did not change state, then it did nothing. That is what programs do, they change states. Even when writing in a declarative language, your statements are changing the state of your computer. This is a poor description of imperative programming, and, to be honest, causes me to question your understanding of the underlying material.

#+begin_quote
  Though intuitive for solving small problems, imperative programs quickly become unmanageable as they become larger.
#+end_quote

First, imperative programming includes what you describe as functional and object-oriented programming for the most part. (Note that Python is a purely imperative language!) So this sentence does not really make sense in the context of this article. Even if you were just referring to procedural programming (which would contradict your earlier description) this statement is in stark contrast to reality---many of the world's most complicated pieces of software are written in C, even if there are a multitude of options available. (Do you think NASA is launching spacecraft with Haskell? That the Linux kernel was written in Prolog? That your browser is a giant SQL query?)

#+begin_quote
  A goal of functional programming is predictability [...]
#+end_quote

You are referring to determinism.

#+begin_quote
  Object-oriented programming deals with state by designating certain functions that operate specifically on that state. Objects in object-oriented programming are a combination of state, or data, with functions that work specifically on that data. Rather than isolate state from the rest of the program,, the object-oriented approach allows only certain parts of the program to operate on certain pieces of data.
#+end_quote

Close, but this description is missing the central piece: Objects have an abstraction boundary between them, i.e. they encapsulate state. So OOO does actually try to “isolate state from the rest of the program”. (And, in my opinion, fails miserably, but that is neither here nor there.)

#+begin_quote
  First, our code is pretty messy. The script does a bunch of things, and we don't know which part of the script is dedicated to which functionality.
#+end_quote

I noticed that you did not add any comments in this example, whereas the other two feature quite a lot of them. That does not seem like a fair comparison. In fact, I would be very glad to find code like this in any of my projects, it is straightforward, simple, short, and does not hide any surprises.

#+begin_quote
  Second, it's not easily reusable. If we try to do another analysis, we'll be changing variables or copy and pasting code, which violates the programming principle of DRY---don't repeat yourself.
#+end_quote

So make a function out of it. (One.) This code is perfectly reusable. Accurately determining in advance which functionality would be best split off into a function is extremely difficult and needs a lot of programming experience. So I would advise beginners to not do this, and instead consider the problem lazily, i.e. factor code out into a function at the time when you actually need the functionality twice. At that point, you have the context to consider which parts need to be generalised and which can stay fixed.

Maybe you are objecting to the fact that you need to change the code a bit to make it into a function, i.e. it is not already a function. If this is the case, then please consider what the actual cost is, in terms of time and effort. (Almost none, making simple syntactical changes to the code is basically free, we are not chiselling our source into stone tablets after all.)

#+begin_quote
  Third, if we need to change the program, there are many parts that are dependent on other parts, which means that one change is likely to require a bunch of other changes to accommodate it.
#+end_quote

Sorry, but I cannot think of a single change that would be more difficult to implement in this example than in the others. (And some for which the opposite holds.) In case you are making a statement about real-world code, that would be quite controversial, to say the least.

#+begin_quote
  A Functional Solution
#+end_quote

Just a small reminder that this code is still imperative. In fact, it is even procedural.

#+begin_quote
  These functions don't make assumptions about what string or list of words will be processed, so they can easily be reused.
#+end_quote

Yeah, no. In the real world, there is no such thing as a function that does not make assumptions, but rather a lot of functions with undocumented assumptions. If you split up a single function into more than one, you introduce more surface area for bugs to appear. It is well known that untested code usually does not work---and if your program is using a set of functions only in a certain way, likely that way is the only one that is going to work. Additionally, you introduce more things you have to worry about, because you are still /trying/ to keep these functions general.

This problem is noticeable even in your simple toy problem, where your refactoring introduced a new bug: =words_matching_first_character= does not work when presented with a list containing the empty word. No “assumptions about what string or list of words will be processed”? Hardly.

So, to get back to my earlier point, do not split things into functions unless you need to. Especially for beginners---it is hard enough already to consider what the current program is doing, without having to try to imagine all the possible things that might happen in future iterations of the program.

#+begin_quote
  An Object-Oriented Solution
#+end_quote

This is obviously the worst one of your three examples, it is difficult to even comprehend what is going on (relatively speaking, of course). Part of it is the example itself: =StringProcessor.clean= does not use =self.string=, which is kind of weird. Also, looking at your source, it is /twice/ as long as the original one.

Do you really think this code is reusable, readable, or maintainable? It introduces two new classes, two superfluous functions, two fields (i.e. global state), and that is on top of the four additional functions added in the functional example. I do not think it is at all responsible to show this to people you want to teach about programming, at least not without a big (flashing, red) warning /not/ to do this.

Oh, and you got it essentially right in the beginning:

#+begin_quote
  Programs with great complexity, with many moving parts and interdependent components, seem initially impressive. However, the ability to translate a real-world problem into a simple or elegant solution requires deep understanding. When writing code, therefore, we might say, “If I had more time, I would have written a simpler program.”
#+end_quote

Which one of your examples is the simplest?

Whenever one introduces another layer of abstraction, be it by splitting things of into a function or by encapsulating them in an object, the total complexity of your system increases. It is as simple as that. Not only is all the functionality still there, but now there is an abstraction, which also adds complexity. Good abstractions allow you to ignore the things underneath for a time, and that is the trade-off: You trade additional complexity for the ability to keep only part of it in your mind at one time.

From reading your article I do not get the impression that this concept is something you have a good grasp on. Programming well is about choosing the right trade-offs and being aware of them, and blindly adhering to simplistic principles (such as DRY) is not going to work.

***** I made this point in my previous response to you, but it clearly missed the mark. This tutorial is not for advanced programmers. This is an attempt to explain these concepts in ways that are at least mildly comprehensible. Because nowhere in your feedback do you wrangle with any of the problems of explaining these concepts to new programmers, I have to assume you've put little or no thought into those problems. How many new programmers have you brought up? Where is your teaching on these subjects? Not to say that your feedback couldn't be useful without having created your own materials, but you're not engaging with the essential task.

There is, generally, a dearth of good teaching material on programming for people who aren't aneruotypical autodidacts. (Basically, the people in this sub.) Yes, you probably learned programming by creating a Turing machine from first principles with an abacus that someone carelessly left on a table. But that's not how people within a standard deviation of baseline learn programming. Frankly, this type of feedback is why most writing for beginners on programming is bad pedagogy or basically reads like docs. If you leave something out because your audience doesn't need to know it at that point, someone comes out of the woodwork and says, "functions are state!" or whatever. Yeah, no shit, they're stored in memory. What we're talking about is mutable state, but if I start using that term at that point, I might as well not be writing the tutorial because no one at the level I'm addressing will be able to describe it, and, not only that, but will be put off and discouraged.

In any case, I don't want to undervalue your experience. You may know more than me, though some of your assumptions about my level of knowledge that you've made based on a specifically pedagogical article are mostly wrong and make it difficult to engage in a meaningful and non-defensive back-and-forth. But it's also clear to me that you haven't taught any of these topics, and if you've tried, you've probably left people behind after the first sentence and not realized it. That's fine, I guess, and programmers have a tendency in this direction that you can see in the general level of rudeness and condescension on, for example, Stack Overflow. ButI do ask that, for those of us who actually care about new programmers and their learning, that you not actively belittle our efforts.

******* Whoops. Might have responded a little differently if I had noted that.

I think one basic problem of communication here is that I'm talking about paradigms as styles of programming rather than descriptions of the programming. You don't sit down and write some declarative code, or describe yourself as a declarative programmer. You can sit down and say, "I'm going to use recursion for this, because it's more functional," in the sense that it fits a functional style of programming. Same with object-oriented programming.

I originally wrote the article with the functional part using filter and taking some closures. But then I was like, this isn't really helpful for the people I'm writing for. But then I was left with basically talking up subroutines, which, as you say, aren't really functional, they're just imperative. I mean, as written, they're functional in the sense that they take arguments and return a value, but that's a pretty trivial version of functional programming. So the functional section is like 10% of the way toward introducing functional programming.

In terms of your criticism of the object-oriented solution....yeah, it's a lot of code, and it's complex, both in the sense that it's relatively hard to understand and in the sense that it connects things together that should not be connected. (At least in my mind.) However, this is how object-oriented code is, for good or ill, generally written. For my audence, libraries like Scrapy and NLTK use this kind of idiom all over the place. It's very common in Python. And, actually, it's not really a terrible thing, at least for Python specifically. That's because, if you've used a library like Scrapy or NLTK, you'll find that the API it exposes makes for pretty readable code. The NLTK internals look like crap, but code written with NLTK is pretty all right. And, in fact, while the code for the objects is pretty ugly, though par for the course with Python OO programming, the actual code using those objects is highly semantic and readable, which are prized in Python programming. Stuff like tokens.length() is pretty easy to comprehend.

Anyway, I still think you're looking at this stuff a bit narrowly. But thanks for the feedback.

And besides the course is really expensive here which isnt ideal when i wanted to realize some of my projects

like my and my friends smithy that we wanted to make and play in so we can make some swords, blades, armor etc. We are kinda super interesting in blacksmithing and its expensive and now i dont have any money...

school is getting really annoying when i dont really want to go there. its boring and nonsense mostly but i still need those points for being there...absolutely idiotic especially when half the teachers just go on some other things and we have reductions etc. I live outside town and coming over to school every day in WINTER is especially bothersome. On some days (like today when i had 3 lessons only 1 of which was nonsense organizational lesson with our main teacher) i am spending more time in the bus driving to the school than in the actual school. Our shitty main teacher that i hate yet again went and got us a nice practice in the lab class by doing something for a mark whithout explaining it normally first. She is such a shitty teacher its amazing really. I dont really know what she is doing at this school because its certainly not teaching. She actually hates kids and mostly tries to go on business trips away from school. I dont get it. MOst of the things we do in the lab will need to be repeated with other techears because we learn absolutely nothing from her and like atleast 75% of the things in the lab dont work. Its absolutely frustrating when you need to sit on your butt and do nothing the first hours out of the 3 of the lab we get per week. She is also really spiteful and like nobody likes her in school amongst the students and ofcourse i had to be in class that got her as our homeroom teacher...

by this time i just said "fuck it" and just focused on the subjects that actually will be on our maturity exam next year or on our job exam this year and disregarded all else. I really need to get into shape and do something positive with my life. Like holy hell and i am sitting all days on reddit or playing games when i am not in school or doing my driving course. Writing some webnovels that i have ideas for or learning programming are amongst the many projects that i prefer finding excuses no to do. The only project i am kinda doing is the wholy smithy thing but its going really slow cuz of money and how rarely i can meetup with my friend because we live on the opposites side of town and his bus drives even rarer than mine(guess having a car now would be cool huh).

I was watching [[https://youtu.be/QwievZ1Tx-8?t=122][the Avengers trailer]] from earlier today and it put me in mind of this. Personally, I've always felt it kinda lame not to introduce yourself by your given name, especially if someone has just introduced themselves to you by theirs. It seems like a move to artificially impose hierarchical structure on your interactions (comparable to those aforementioned professional relationships), to elevate yourself above your interlocutor, to brag. I think my reaction to it is in part driven by the impression that almost all the most brilliant doctorate-holders I've known are casual and modest, so to call yourself "Dr. ..." is to signal your own inability to "countersignal" in this way, and betrays a lack of confidence that one's competence can evince itself naturally. The context may change a little if you're talking to someone in their mid-teens (e.g. Peter Parker), and the may indeed be setting up a mentor-mentee relationship, but even so. I guess that hoity-toity-ness is part of Dr. Strange's character, too.

Don't worry about it too much since your body can store decades' worth of B12 so vegetarianism/veganism alone rarely cause problems unless you have some other condition or are not taking supplements for years. Your family members who have B12 deficiency despite eating meat are probably having problems with absorption or storage in their GI tract rather than not getting enough. Just keep taking supplements. Don't worry about Cl. Different sources give different normal ranges and yours is still within many normal ranges. Besides, the variation is so small and it probably changes slightly throughout your day depending on mealtimes, urination, etc. Your doctor is correct that you don't need to take Vitamin D supplements but it also doesn't hurt to take supplements.

** Scheduling with a therapist is hard so I'm going to ask for help with an existential question that's been bugging me for a while. I am not in a depressive episode or contemplating self harm, this is just what I'm thinking about because of the lingering depression in the back of my mind.

Ever since I first heard about the theory of the singularity, I always sided with Hanson over Yudowsky because I found his predictions both more plausible and more morally acceptable. Yudkowsky's preference for creating an AI that would optimize humanity never sat well with me, but now I'm worried that I've come over to his side for the wrong reasons.

When I first heard the suggestion for something as simple as banning humans from driving themselves in order to save lives, I was hardline against this because I saw it as a violation of human autonomy and the servitude role of technology. However, my depression and anxiety so often leaves me with no ability to act or think independently that I need my environment to care for me.

Couple that with revelations about how much more suffering people are in than I ever thought possible due to the circumstances of their existence, and I find myself more inclined to think that life is pain and just want the pain to stop. So I've begun to wonder if it is a moral imperative to forcibly change humanity into something that is, by definition, not human so that people experience and cause less pain.

Am I becoming a nihilist? Is it mentally healthy to think that the only way to stop the suffering of myself and others is by altering the human mind at a fundamental level? What does that say about my identity or my respect for the rights of others? Am I just rationalizing a scenario in which I would commit suicide and is it better to tie it to an event that may not even happen?

I don't think it's likely that I'll ever be in a position where I will contribute to a decision about whether to assimilate humanity into a hive mind where our psychology is altered to eliminate prejudice, abuse, discrimination, and mental illness. However, if I got the chance to change myself in that way, I would be inclined to take it due to my self loathing and I don't know if that is a reason not to do it or evidence that I should take it because of the pain my mind causes me.

Any conclusion or reasoning you make right now is almost certainly going to be influenced in a negative direction, at the very least in terms of your reaction to it. You will then remember your conclusion, but not the negatively influenced reasoning behind the conclusion.

Even if your ability to reason about these things isn't affected, as would be the case with drunkenness, your emotional reaction to them is certainly altered. This isn't productive towards helping you feel normal again. Hold off on making these type of decision and revelations, and if you feel that "focus on getting better" is too trite or unhelpful, then at least focus on gathering data that opposes your current viewpoint in a more emotionally positive direction. I would recommend reading The Better Angels of our Nature, by Steven Pinker, to counter the despair and cynicism you seem to feel towards current humanity. It's isn't a happy book, as it details a variety of horrific things that humans have done to each other. But I would argue that it's overall a positive book, which doesn't sugarcoat the backslides in moral progress, but does clearly show that upward trend.

But if I value my current mental architecture so little that I think it should be changed so I think and act like a person who I consider to be more virtuous, then why should I value the less virtuous minds of anyone else more than my own? I believe that I think dehumanizing thoughts about others and hate myself for it because I believe those thoughts lead to suffering, but that could be used to justify doing the same to anyone else regardless of consent.

I'd probably be doing it for selfish reasons, “optimizing” humans my way so I feel less bad, but I'm also not sure how much empathy I can actually feel for people who've suffered in ways that I haven't so that rationalization might be the best possible way to optimize utilitarian values. Even if I could test to see if I actually cared instead of just being loyal to an ideal, would it matter if the result is reducing a form of suffering that is never morally justifiable?

#+end_quote

I think anything that is forcible implies a certain degree of pain because to most humans the feeling of autonomy and freedom is a really important thing - even when it concretises in freedom and autonomy to drive themselves in some shitty corner and make their life worse. I would be wary of applying your personal experiences to everyone. You have no reason to believe that people who claim to be genuinely happy just aren't, for example.

As a general rule, I am not the sort of person who would be against transhumanism on concerns of sticking to either God's or Nature's supposed "plans" for us - those are bunk for me. But I would say that anything that changed my mind so much that it removed all potential source of pain from it would probably have effectively killed me anyway. The new entity that replaced me would be happy but why should I care? While I exist, it doesn't, and it has no rights nor is it entitled to anything. And a cure for my problems that kills me is not a cure.

That said, I also think that, luckily perhaps, we will never really get the chance or need to take a practical position on such issues during our lifetimes. At a difference with the most optimist predictions, I don't think such things can be achieved within a human life's time frame yet. For those who will be, it'll be a hard call, but I still think that a good is worth nothing if someone forces it on you. Since individual experience is fundamentally inaccessible, the only way to know what someone desires is to listen to what they say and watch what they do, and therefore individual preference trumps everything else. To come from outside and say "no, I know better than you, /this/ is what will make you happy" is nonsense to me.

I'm an anti-wireheader. I view pain in the map not the territory, as a signal rather than a end in itself. You feel pain when you get hurt because it teaches getting hurt is bad and avoiding it is good. There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain][people unable to feel pain]] and they tend to do things like accidentally bite their tongue off without noticing.

I view changing your mental architecture to not feel pain or short circuiting your brain using narcotics is generally an act of changing moral values rather than maximising the ones you already have. This is not to say that pain is always perfect, sometimes our brain gives us too much pain or pain when it isn't warranted though likewise sometimes it doesn't give us enough. My point is that eliminating pain is much like an employer making a policy that employees are unable to provide criticism even if it is constructive.

I'm a compatibilist wireheader. I don't think the human mind is a simple optimizer-- different parts of our minds want different (although not mutually incompatible) goals. So I think it's possible to both wirehead (fully satisfying the parts of your mind that wants all the tingly neurotransmitters they can get), while also working on other goals.

I'd heavily recommendation meditation and pink elephant exercises for learning to ignore and eliminate intrusive thoughts & mental states. I'd also recommend practising graded exposure / systemic desensitisation. Essentially you deliberately expose yourself to (weakened) triggers in a safe situation while keeping yourself calm, gradually escalating the intensity of the triggers as you become better at handling it and able to manage them.

What about nootropics? They're poorly understood right now, but take an "ideal" nootropic that really did change how you thought, temporarily and for the better, with minimal (although not nonexistent) side effects. Would you be willing to use one, or would you still be too uncomfortable?

Myself, I don't forswear drugs, but I prefer to use them sparingly so I don't build up any sort of tolerance or dependence. I only drink coffee/energy drinks when I really need them, for example. If your exclusive motivation is just avoiding impaired thinking, I think, on a closer look, you could find a number of drugs where the cost/benefit calculus is in favour of taking the drug, even for pure utility purposes.

Similarly, I think there's a cost/benefit calculation to be made for true mind-altering drugs. How much alteration is acceptable to remove suffering? Because independent of drugs, and independent of how you define personhood, there has to be a threshold, or literally any action taken by a human would be unacceptable because we're rewiring our brains all the time.

It's nowhere near rational enough to deserve its own thread IMHO, but it does keep the xianxia's popcorn fiction feel, without being the sort of thing where, reflecting after a hundred chapters with no character development whatsoever, or xianxia protag sociopathy.

It's the story of an irreverent cultivator only in it for the money, an agricultural and technological revolution, and a war between generic xianxia humans, nature spirits with the most developed society and complex magic system, and +anthropomorphic pokemon+ beast spirits who just enjoy the thrill of combat. The cultivation systems are relatively fleshed out, the secondary characters are actually able outdo the protagonist, and are actual characters.

Thank fuck. If you haven't seen it yet, the quest Forge of Destiny on SV seems good at avoiding this too. It at least touches on the protagonist's morals.

** The Brain Preservation Foundation has recently announced the [[http://www.brainpreservation.org/large-mammal-announcement/][successful preservation of a large mammal]] brain. This is not a revival experiment, but a preserve-and-verify-with-electron-microscope experiment similar to the [[http://www.brainpreservation.org/asc_rabbit_fulleval/][rabbit brain]] experiment that got a lot of press a couple years ago.

Now a YC startup called [[https://nectome.com][Nectome]] run by Robert McIntyre, the guy behind the rabbit brain experiment, is [[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610456/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/][pitching]] human preservation within the next few years, and accepting deposits for when they have the capability. Owing to the impracticality of ASC on clinically deceased patients without intact vasculature, this will be restricted to patients covered under assisted suicide laws. Apart from that, it's basically the same deal as cryonics, and no it's not really any more fatal than cryonics (apparently less, from an information theoretic standpoint -- although that's considered a bit hard to measure due to dehydration distortion in cryonics patients).

Also, relative to cryonics, Nectome also has quite a bit more mainstream cred as a research company, considering that it has won about a million dollars in [[https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9355699&icde=38525280][grants]] to study whole-brain connectomes, and of course there are expected positive effects of this research that apply outside the realm of brain preservation.

** I'm looking for a program I used some years ago. It would give you a question with two options, e.g. "which of these two are the richest" (the options would be picked from a list of he richest people in the world) you would pick one of them, as well as how certain you were in your answer (the options were 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and either 95 or 99%) If you answered correctly you'd get points according to how certain you were, and if you answered incorrectly you would lose points, there were a bigger penalty for answering wrong. I remember there were 0 points for answering 50%

** Have you come across any traditionally-published books that remind you of fanfiction stories?

The infamous [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40498][/Xanth/]] series of Piers Anthony reminds me powerfully of Perfect Lionheart's masterpieces [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][/Chunin Exam Day/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][/Partially Kissed Hero/]] (endless [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Crosses_the_Line_Twice][Crossing the Line Twice]] combined with fascinating ideas). I also was (less strongly) reminded of Esama's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][/Sisyphus/]] when I read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790842][/Life After Life/]] (endless time loops combined with trying too hard to sound deep instead of actually accomplishing anything cool). In both these cases, however, I vastly preferred the fanfiction stories to the original stories.

I've read the first half of /Chunin Exam Day/ three times (but the second half, where [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/35][the bashing of Sasuke and Kakashi starts to cross the line /thrice/]] and the boring harem shenanigans start to take over too much of the wordcount, only once) and the entirety of /Partially Kissed Hero/ three times.

****** How many incredibly-cool ideas were brought to light in /Chunin Exam Day/? Just off the top of my head:

#+begin_quote
  Detailed chakra-control exercises (/e. g./, for water-natured chakra: sitting on a river's surface, letting your chakra leak through the river, and feeling the river by feeling your chakra)

  Fuuinjutsu written, not with two-dimensional ink on paper, but with the three-dimensional impurities in gemstones---and in an entirely-new language

  The people of the Village Hidden in the Sand use their techniques, not only for military purposes (as ninja), but also for civilian purposes (street puppetry, using wind to sweep streets and speed up trade ships, /etc./), and they use this secondary outlet to avoid losing expertise while they're under Daimyou-imposed budget cuts that prevent them from keeping many ninja in training

  Using Tsukuyomi, not as a torture device, but as a training area akin to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber

  A suggestion that maybe lightning is, not its own chakra nature, but a mixture of fire and air chakra that has become widespread over centuries of interbreeding
#+end_quote

/Et cetera/.

These ideas are creative and awesome. Even if Perfect Lionheart fails to actually /use/ many of them to their fullest potential, there are /zillions/ of them! Compare the similarly-cool ideas of /HPMoR/ (partial transfiguration, superpowered Patronus, "do not mess with time") or /Worm/ (using spiders, not for combat, but for a bulletproof suit; using body-hijacking, not for public impersonation, but for private selfcest; a hivemind team of capes).

*** I loved Chunin Exam Day for so long. It was one of my favourite fics as I read it.

By the end, I can safely say it's one of the very, /very/ few fics that I've left unhelpful, inflammatory comments on (though my youth had a good bit to do with it as well) The concept was well founded, and spawned more than one fanfiction of its own(looking at you /Time Braid/ and that Shikamaru one) and was honestly an enjoyable ride for quite a while.

Then, at some point, it became a terrible story; the bashing was completely unneeded and over the top, the harem aspects (which my young self loved at the time because 'oh, hot women that the main character gets to bang' was all the rage in my pubescent mind) were completely ridiculous, the power creep (which is honestly one of the funnest parts of groundhog day style stories in this sort of genre; it's almost the entire point of writing one) fell flat because Orochimaru somehow has counter plans on counter plans for literally anything the time looping Naruto tried to do, even though he was hundreds (possibly thousands?) of loops in, and took several opportunities to seduce (females) or torture (males) any of Orochimaru's henchmen for all of the information they had. It would've been one thing if [[#s][Spoilers for Time and Again by KyLewin]] but the story went out of its way to make it clear that Orochimaru didn't know and was just that good, despite him being thwarted by much lesser means in canon.

It became clear that the author was just trying to justify some reason for Naruto to remain in the loop, even though it was again made explicit that it was Naruto making Chuunin and not Orochimaru losing that was required for that to happen.

And just to harp on a previous point...the bashing. I'm not going to try and defend Kakashi's teaching style (which is pretty terrible, though consistent with a lot of anime sensei styles) or Sasuke's absolute prickishness but the retribution sought includes, among others, a loop in which Kakashi's dead father came back from the grave and inscribed a seal on his penis that would cause it to explode/fall off if he got an erection that wasn't caused by a woman he married to "break him of his porn addiction and loneliness" and there were several loops in which Sasuke is beaten horribly/killed/crippled for amusement and little else.

And the poop humor. God, the fucking cringy poop humor.

TL DR: I have a lot of issues with PL as a writer, and the story Chunin Exam Day in particular. Calling them masterpieces is an insult to both the words "master" and "piece" and the letters m,a,s,t,e,r,p, i and c.
