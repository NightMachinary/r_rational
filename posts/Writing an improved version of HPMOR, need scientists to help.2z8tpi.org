I've already started the outline, and it's coming along nicely, except that I need some people who actually know science well to help me with the science aspects of the story. Since by the time the story starts, there is centuries worth of observations and data that needs to be explainable somehow within the context of a universe that has magic in it.

Anyone with some scientific expertise who wants to help me with this?

Thanks!


** I can help with mathematics and basic physics. I think it would be a good idea to either start your own subreddit and/or have an accessible google doc which people can comment on, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BfyA18VKxT_TJhfPtvFsj-0d7DY4BS1SLoY8fNfWc4/edit][similar to S.I.]]

*** you think i should make a subreddit for beta readers or something? i don't want to share the outline with everyone when the story is not even written yet. (or rather, not entirely. there are siginificant chunks of the original HPMOR that I plan to preserve)

**** Maybe, but I was thinking more along the lines of a forum for people to propose changes and additions, to be vetted and critiqued by others in the project.

*** that might be very helpful, not entirely certain. It might be helpful when Harry tries to figure out why some muggle tech doesn't function right at Hogwarts. and it might be useful for a lot more than that in this story. not entirely sure. I don't know much about engineering, but I'm guessing the type of engineering might be important too.

**** I've always rationalized that the reason magic has such a hard time with tech is that magic causes constant warps in local space, on the molecular level.

A lightbulb is no longer airtight, a circuit no longer complete, and a piston cold fuses to the walls of its engine.

Small things that are relevant to the workings of delicate and complex electronics, but not clockwork, and certainly not overly redundant biological processes (We have healing factors AND pain receptors)

***** that actually sounds kind of ingenious. but then why would it cause constant warps in local space, and how would that affect the universe?

****** I've never rationalized that far. I've also never rationalized the mechanism that causes certain materials to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures much higher than around 25 kelvin. There are mysteries in the world, and I don't plan on solving the fictional ones. Now watch me get a BS in Engineering.

****** We could argue that the effects are small and localized, never being noticed because muggle items malfunctioning at an observably high level only occurs in "high magic" areas. And as muggles don't have access to these areas, it's never been observable.

As to why it causes constant warps?

******* i don't like that answer. it kind of messes with some of the main themes of the story.

And saying, "because science" like that sounds like saying "because magic". which doesn't help if it's magic itself you're trying to explain.

******** I knew "because science" wasn't a real answer, haha. I mean it COULD be. But it certainly doesn't fit what you're trying to go with. I just heard the quote in my head while reading your post and had to include it (altho my mental Jesse Pinkman said "Magic, BIATCH.")
