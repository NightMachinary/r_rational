** /Worm/, except where Taylor hesitates for a millisecond when talking with Armsmaster.

This fic benefits strongly from using /Worm/'s characters, but I think it might actually be a better story. Taylor does a lot more thinking and plotting, and is more independent all-in-all. Much more rational than the original, I think. Also features some very clever worldbuilding for parahuman!Earth -- things that made me go, "Of course things would be like that," but weren't mentioned in original /Worm/. Slightly deconstructionist, in this way, if that's even possible.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2417525/chapters/5347754][There's a sequel, too!]]

ETA: Also, I just plain enjoy the author's writing style. 4.2, for instance, seemed just masterfully written. Good quality stuff.

** Hmm, I enjoy it, but I have trouble taking it seriously as rationalfic.

Now, I haven't read the whole thing yet, so /maybe/ it'll all make sense later, but...

SPOILERS FOR THE "Intermediaries" ARC (chapter 16+)

** It seems good so far, though I feel like the summary spoiled something... rather major.

Meanwhile, I'm hoping that she does join the Wards, rather than join the Undersiders again. If she does join the Undersiders again, it would just feel far too like a wasted opportunity.

Finally: Shadow Stalker did /what?/ I realize she was kind of... psycho in the original story, too, but this seems a bit much. That won't break my reading experience by any means (because this otherwise seems good and, as you said, more rational), but it definitely required a lot more of my suspension of disbelief.

I'm in 5.2 so I won't spoil anything, and I want to say something that would be just a "Maybe you should think about this ..." but I'm afraid that would be a spoiler anyway, so ahhh silence

Can you spoiler tag what you're referring to?

***** Hmm. Well, [spoilers removed at second thought] Keep reading and you'll see how that one plays out. There's a lot of blame to pass around.
