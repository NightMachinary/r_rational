What do you guys think?


** Definitely Zenith of Sorcery. Nobody103 writes archmages extremely well (many of the MoL fans were really excited about the idea of a Quatach-Ichl sequel, etc.) so I'd be interested to see his take on this. Plus, archmage protagonists aren't something you see much of; most novels start far from the top in terms of power levels so it would be covering fresh territory.

See, I thought the back half of MoL was weaker than the first half. The problem with extremely powerful characters (especially ones that start powerful, rather than develop over the course of the story) is that it's very easy to fall into the trap of them always having another card up their sleeve. When they're that powerful, it's tricky to make sure that the reader knows exactly what they can and can't do.

The final fight, in particular, suffered from this, I think. While I'm not sure I'd call any of the gadgets Zorian pulled out Deus ex Machina, it definitely felt a little too close for comfort.

If Zenith is more of a Zach than a Zorian (classic Fireball wizard, rather than a artificer), that might help. But I'm not sure.

**** I really liked the ending of MoL, but I think that Zorian's mana limits were kinda thrown out the window. Nobody103 didn't let him solo artillery spells or anything, but he was maintaining a lot of simulacra at the same time, all casting magic.

The golems and crafting made sense, in that he didn't actually independently develop all of them, he iterated them over restarts hiring people to work on them and then recreated that work out of the time loop, but having all his gadgets and letting him teleport simulacrums around shooting force lances and fire stars and running ritual spells...

I still loved it, but arguably it could have been even better if he'd restrained zorian a bit more.

** I rather like King of the Junkyard and Zenith of Sorcery.

I'm confident Junkyard would be good. The premise seems promising, and I don't see any obvious traps that would cause readers to bounce off.

Zenith sounds like a great premise, but I think it would be very difficult to launch. An advantage of a tabula rasa low-level character is they can learn about the world and develop their own abilities at the same rate as the reader. Managing the exposition loads of both a new world and a wide-ranging set of abilities from the very start sounds like a real challenge.

The addition of the possibility of outright "breaking" is an interesting addition to the way they affect their users. And having the origin and mechanics laid out so clearly before the story has even started makes me think that the characters are probably more aware of the way the Sparks work at this point then most capes were in Worm, which could have some interesting applications.

There does also seem to be the addition of a lot of other extraterrestrial and/or supernatural beings and elements outside of the Sparks, whereas all the supernatural elements of Worm could be traced back to Shards

** I have thoughts about each.

*King of the Junkyard*

I like the episodic nature, as long as it's going to ramp up to an occasionally broader plot. Think DS9, where there were a lot of plots that were resolved by the end of each episode, but the ending was stretched across nine episodes, and resolved plot threads going back several seasons.

My main concern with this problem is that it seems like a bit too much of a coincidence for all of these various plot threads to be happening at once. The aliens showing up so soon after Godfall, in particular. I'd want to see the various Weird Things™ to all make sense to be coming to a head a the the same time.

*The Infinite Dungeon*

Again, without a looming threat, I think I could enjoy this being episodic, but there would have to be an overarching plot asserting itself, at least occasionally, if it's going to have a satisfactory conclusion. I'm not overly fond of LitRPGs, but I would make an exception for something by nobody103.

My main concern would be: why is this person the protagonist? He's just "lucky and willing to take risks?" It seems to me like there would be people who were better, smarter, stronger, more skilled, etc., or otherwise more naturally talented, and "lucky" isn't a really satisfying reason for a protagonist to be the one who prevails (unless played for laughs).

One thing that I would really like to see if this is the concept chosen would be to have rotating viewpoints. All of these characters are going into the dungeon for their own reasons and having their own adventures; it'd be a shame to focus too closely one one point of view.

*Zenith of Sorcery*

High-power-level stories are hard to write, and I just don't see this going well. This sounds like a character who can accomplish pretty much anything through magic, which makes it really hard to relate to the character, really hard to have the challenges that the character will struggle to overcome, and really hard to have antagonists who want to antagonize the protagonist in the first place. It's like writing a Superman story: you either have to use Kryptonite, or threaten someone Supes cares about, or put the character in a moral quandry, and all of those stories will eventually get old.

Again, this is a [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] story, so I'd probably at least start to read it, but this is the least compelling of the four ideas in my view, just because: where does the tension come from?

*Refuge in Void*

I like the idea of a reverse-LitRPG. The only time I've seen something like this done was [[https://www.bgreco.net/kidradd.htm][Kid Radd]], which I really enjoyed. And this one actually sketches out a long-term plot, which endears me to it more than the others. In fact, I'd say this is the one that speaks to me the most.

My biggest concern with this one is that, at first glance, the protagonist sounds completely unlikeable, and for someone who we're going to spend a lot of time with, that sounds like a pretty fatal flaw to the story. I mean, it can be done (see Black Mage from 8-bit Theater), but you'd have to sell the character as someone worth following pretty quickly, in order not to alienate the readers.

Zenith sounds like the exact opposite of MoL. Young novice vs old master. It's also a break from the constant teen protagonists. Junkyard's lightheartedness also looks promising and poses a challenge to nobody103 who is a bit lacking in writing fun and humorous dialogue.

An NPC in a VR game is transmigrated from his home server to another with a different theme and must make his way in the world. The NPC has intelligence because all NPCs are AIs, and this one happens to ”reincarnate" due to a fluke bug. A major difference in premise though is that the transmigrated NPC interacts pretty often with human PCs and comes to the attention of the "god-like" Admins, which ends up being quite the source of conflict.

They seem to follow a more recent crop of progression fantasy type stories that eschew the coming of age aspect for an already mature protagonist that's experiencing "arrested development" in a power-level sense only, usually due to circumstances of birth or other misfortune.

I enjoyed Zorian a lot because I felt like his teenaged cynicism was genuine and well executed. I'm not sure I want to read about these guys.

Anyway, just pushing back slightly that there's a trend of some sort, the real trend in my eyes is the eternal overuse of kids as main characters. I think it has been particularly pronounced in progression fantasy because most of the authors are also very young.

**** I would definitely call it a trend, having read Street Cultivation and seen Heart of Cultivation show up only a few weeks after I was done. There's other examples but I'm blanking on names (Diaries of a Skill Trainer? Not sure that's right). It's a very trends-based genre, at least at the moment. That doesn't make stories bad, so I'm not bothered by the idea that younger protagonists are an "overused" trend (though I think they're more a natural choice for coming of age narratives). I'm just speculating as to the inspiration/motivation for ranging far from Zorian (maybe it's specifically to get away from that type of protagonist, even).

I think progression is at its best when it's multi-dimensional. I feel like these stories come with characters that are developed out of the box, all their learning far behind them, with only a situation to remedy and then power progression ahead of them. It's not a lack of originality that I'm speaking out against, but more a choice I personally see making stories worse instead of better, by a subjective standard.

I get that other people are more interested in power speculation and numbers-other-than-age going up, but I like Mother of Learning enough to comment when I see the author joining in a trend I'm personally not confident about.

(This is also not to say I don't see character development in the future for Heart of Cultivation, for example. I think that story did well setting up a big misunderstanding right at the beginning that not even the readers are sure about and that the protagonist will eat crow for almost for sure. I'm not sure the stories outlined here lend themselves to the same kind of "promise" built into the premise. Then again, that's just one promised moment. A young character promises more than one right from the concept, not so much an adult one.)

Both adults and teenagers can have the same struggles, in terms of categories: needing to adapt to challenges regarding friends, lovers, and their approach to the world. Adults simply have pasts that create nuance. Kids and teenagers have to start off by making relatively predictable mistakes that we all make at that age -- and if they don't, then they don't come off as authentic kids. All that said, authors can screw up and write kids that act like adults, or adults who come off as wooden or uncomplicated, and progression fiction isn't exactly a wellspring of good writing about relationships and personalities to start with, so I'd really have to go outside the genre for most examples of what I mean.

****** That's not really what I meant. I was referencing someone else's sentiment in another chain that, for example, a lot of people seemed interested in a Quatach-Ichl sequel because they like what author could do, powers-wise, with a full archmage from the beginning.

My point is that a young protagonist promises more mistakes than an adult protagonist (meaning more opportunities for growth or subversion of growth, forms of progression in a dimension other than power-through-mechanics) as well as implying that they have things to learn about the world they live in, and seeing some of the dry power fantasy that comes out of the genre and knowing characters are not the author's strong suit, I'm not convinced by what's on offer here.

At the end of the day these are all very cursory overviews of ideas. Maybe I'm completely off-base on the predictions part of my argument, but I know I'm not lying about my reaction to reading through these. If you don't like young characters that's your thing. You're entitled to your own opinion.

I personally don't believe in "overused" or "predictable" as markers that predict whether I'll enjoy something. I believe in setup and execution above pretty much everything. Premise is part of setup, and the protagonist's experience or lack thereof is a part of a story's premise.

I also think you underestimate how many stories use tricks to get the same kind of setup as a young protagonist would give (TRICKS ARE GOOD, just to be clear). Making the character a fish out of water through Isekai, for example, is a way to keep the protagonist learning new things like a young protagonist would. Stories like Street Cultivation and Heart of Cultivation don't do this, because the protagonist already knows everything important about the setting (or has the means to look it up) and is only educating the reader.

People who don't want to see progression, just power, are going to gravitate towards the archmage story. To borrow an expression, they're valid. I don't like that kind of story so I don't like that kind of story.

I don't underestimate how many stories use tricks. I'd say, instead, that 90% of progression fiction is crap that doesn't have much to recommend it, at all, and it's not particularly surprising to know that crap relies on cheap tricks.

... that's way more shade than I meant to give, I also recognize that these are amateur writers doing it for fun. Haven't read Heart of Cultivation, but Street Cultivation was nicely done.

***** I tried reading the Chronicles again more recently and was, mm, a bit put off. The writing is really macho, sexist, and Corwin comes off as an asshole to his sisters; some of the assumptions about their personalities and motivations could fit well in [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]]. So -- if that's what you didn't like about him, I totally understand. But the book is old; now verging on really old. I read it as a kid and (dating myself here) there was nothing weird about it at the time. I think today you'd have to read it sort of like a mix of old-school pulp and noir fiction, forgiving or ignoring the styles of the time.

As for what I still like about him, here's my pitch (spoilers included): the story is essentially about his relationships with his siblings and dad; although that fact is not immediately obvious, either to the reader or Corwin himself. Each person he encounters has a history with him that must be uncovered; old feuds and friendships. In the first story arc, Corwin builds up his power, gets an edge, makes his bid -- and loses. He's crippled, imprisoned, and left in prison to brood on his failures. Later, he escapes, makes a new plan and begins to win. But on the way he also begins to realize that, despite his advanced age, he really isn't fully mature, and that there's a great deal about the universe that he never understood. Ultimately, he gets what he wants -- but the weight of his deeds has built up on his conscience, forcing him to consider whether he's actually the right person. He concludes that he isn't, validates the character growth of one of his brothers by giving him the crown, and goes into the Shadows to fix his mistakes. It's a redemption arc, in short. To the point of this thread, the story would not have worked with a child protagonist. None of the siblings are right or justified, all of them know what they want from the start and pursue it without hesitation; there's no time wasted on immature fumbling around; but, everyone in the story still has character growth and is vastly changed by the end.

Sorry about the length, as they say, if I'd had more time I would have written less.

Zenith might be interesting, but (unpopular opinion time) very little of what the protagonists in MoL did felt "clever" in a way that makes me excited to see more supermages-beating-everyone kinds of stories from this author. Would rather see him try something new.

2. The infinite dungeon 4/10. Mixing fantasy dungeon with modern world does not sound cool. After watching the first video of fantasy knights getting killed by machine gun you saw it all. [[https://youtu.be/UEahGo9EEyE?t=329]]
3. Zenith. 7/10. It is hard to write a book about a powerful protagonist. The only time I saw it being done well was in Hard to be a God. A very short story by Strugazkie. They made 2 movies but they are shit go read the novel.\\
4. Refuge. 5/10 Recently saw it done in New Game Minus. I do not believe good world-builidng is possible with such a premise.

** (This post is intended for [[/u/nobody103]], not the OP)

To me, Zenith of Sorcery both has the most potential, both the potential to be good and bad.

I have been searching for a good OP protagonist story for years now, basically. They are incredible hard to write, as you already knows. Still, if anyone could have the chops to write it, I believe it would be him.

My biggest problem, however, is that the setting seems...super boring. I know that you mentioned that different universes/planes will eventually be explored, but why not have that right from the start? What would a world look like in which multiple universes, all with different magic and technology, look like?

The obvious problem would be how hard it would be to write. I know you mentioned that MoL took a lot out of you, and you seem to be more interested in branching out. Still...I would absolutely love for you to write Zenith of Sorcery. And heck, if you want to write King of the Junkyard as a side project, I'd read that too!

Well, I'll read everything you post, anyway.

Thanks for the absolute incredible journey of Mother of Learning, and I'm excited to see what you create next!

** *King of the Junkyard* - Healer/Mender Protagonists are rare and well-done ones that don't turn their self-healing into a method of being godlike in combat are rarer still. This has promise.

*The Infinite Dungeon* - Pass. I don't mind LitRPG in general but the genre is absolutely saturated right now.

*Zenith of Sorcery* - Hard pass. There are two good ways to write an OP protagonist - have the conflict involve side characters mostly while the protagonist is largely there for comedy (One Punch Man) or acknowledge that the MC is undefeatable and go full slice-of-life so that Demon Lords showing up is just an amusing afternoon diversion before dinner (the middle arcs of Death March WN [first arcs are rocky and worse in the LN version, and later arcs become too serious]).

This one sounds tedious and awful.

*Refuge in Void* - My vote goes here. I've always wanted to see a story set in a world where the odd abstractions used in a TTRPG actually exist - quantised power-ups etc. - but where it's also not actually /gamified/.

First idea-urban fantasy and a sprawling world which seems multivaried with episodic pacing. Good

Second- straight litrpg. First off ewwww. Can probably be done well but it's been done SO many times I would skip. Doesn't seem at all original in any way. Inventive twists are unironically required for litrpgs at this point.

Third- op dude making moves and solving problems on a big scale. Seems ok. Making it about logistics and political stuff can be a pacing killer but I'd be down.

Fourth- character gets isekia'd (however you spell it) into a fantasy world with monsters and a dying civilization. Biggest problem is that the main character is described as an oblivious guy with no self awareness. I've seen this done badly too many times. He could probably do it well but idk.

Trading in power futures, power sharing cooperatives, power sharing laws, power taxation and more. Are married couples always share their powers? Spoiled kids piggyback on powerful parents? A lot of material for interpersonal dramas here.

1st and 2nd: sharing second place. Both are common tropes but solid premises. 1st is theme used a lot in paper published urban fantasy, 2nd is most common web stories theme. Common doesn't mean bad - it means that most glaring error already identified in genre.

3rd: Nop. Receipt for failure. It's extremely difficult to write. Plotwise it only make sense as tragedy (Like in Dostoevsky, "Idiot" which is essentially about social communication superpower) and tragedy kind of difficult to build with two part structure of the plot.

** I'm most interested in Zenith of Sorcery by far, but it's definitely true that it's the riskiest option. A protagonist that magically powerful needs to consistently face real conflict just like any other, and that means that political and logistical problems basically have to be a huge focus of the story. I live for that stuff, so I'd love to see it, but there is the danger of just going full wish-fulfillment with a protagonist that powerful. I trust nobody to avoid that, but a more cautious course is definitely starting with King of the Junkyard, which also looks interesting and is definitely more in the established comfort zone.

** King of the Junkyard is definitely the most interesting setting, because a fantasy kitchen sink where the different elements of different thematic focus are woven together with a coherent underlying world creates excellent opportunities to tease out the underlying mechanisms and forces of the setting as you go along. If it's episodic, I feel you could approach it one of two ways:

- Episodic until the last big arc(s), where things start tying together. This would give you the, in the end, final overall narrative, while retaining the episodic freedom from concurrent plots for most of the fic. All a given arc would need in terms of tracking plots is "This incident was caused by X, which will become relevant in the finale arcs."

- Fully episodic, with the emphasis on character progression. No need to make a grand plot where everything ties together, you just need Jack to be a slightly different person at the end of each arc, until you reach the final arc that's the culmination of his growth as a person, even though the last arc needn't be a world-shaking conspiracy or anything.

If you go fully episodic, I would recommend the side-project approach, for whenever you need a change of pace or to leave the main story to percolate. If you go only mostly episodic, with an underlying plot for the grand finale, though, it could fairly easily stand on its own imo.

The Infinite Dungeon, in its LitRPG dungeon-delving premise, would likely find it hard to stand out from all the other LitRPG dungeon-delving stories out there. This doesn't mean it'll be bad or uninspired, of course, but rather that it might not be as popular as the other stories. In terms of quality, I'm especially interested in the factor of the masquerade straining and breaking and new powers rising in the world destabilized by this out of context problem. As for the questions posed:

- If I was given a low-key magic, I'd probably not risk myself to make it stronger, but instead go public immediately. The Randi Prize isn't up anymore, but it wouldn't be hard to find someone in a similar position and prove that my magic is legit, which would give me the signal boost to get attention and recognition early. My goal would be to become famous enough that I can enlist protection against anyone, magical or mundane, that might want me dead or under their thumb because of my magic, as well as to help control the breaking of the masquerade as best as I can.

- If I /was/ adventuring and there was a government order to give up the prizes, what I would do would depend on 1) whether I thought I could get away with it, 2) what I stand to lose if I get caught, and 3) what I stand to lose if I give in. I can see myself having enemies and not wanting to give up the only thing keeping them from killing me, and I can see myself knowing that there's no way for me to hide that I've got such prizes, and that if I don't comply I'll be targeted by a force far superior to me.

- I'd go for a survival-focused build, because above all I don't want to die. Factors relevant to good health, weathering damage, avoiding danger, and escaping conflict. Stealth, essentially, with a focus on damage control if stealth fails me. I would ideally resolve combat by avoiding enemies altogether, or by hit-and-run ambush strategies.

Zenith of Sorcery, especially the latter half, sounds interesting, but the fact that he's already powerful and has tons of tricks means that you'd have to be creative a lot of the time. And/or do a lot of 'nothing in my bag of tricks can do that' ahead of such limitations becoming relevant. If you can get that to work, though, it sounds like a very enjoyable story to read, because as others have noted you do archmages well. I have no doubt that you'd make Marcus' fight scenes extremely impressive, and as long as you can sort out the meaningful limitations bit you'd be sorted.

Refuge in Void is my personal favourite of the options here, if only because it's heckin /evocative/ to make the setting a world falling apart and have the slow subtle collapse of everything be a main focus on the story. I also like the idea of an NPC who thinks inhumanly, and if you go with that I hope you lean into it where appropriate. In my opinion this story has the greatest potential, with the biggest trap in it being the risk that NPC-guy would come across as too obnoxious when his differences from normal human thought is highlighted, but that's far from an insurmountable hurdle.

** Now I'm not tying from my phone while half asleep, a proper post. I'm hoping for The Infinite Dungeon with Zenith of Sorcery second.

King of the Junkyard doesn't feel like it's anything truly unique. An urban fantasy protagonist who sticks his nose in where id doesn't belong, I've seen that before.

The Infinite Dungeon combines many things I like: Dungeon delving, a great big mystery at the heart of the setting, progression. And with the sheer number of litRPGs where the protagonist wins because some deus ex machina [[https://i.imgur.com/3hxAhfz.png][hands him free starting perks]] (the whole point of an MMO is everyone starts equal...) it would be extreemly nice to see an author of nobody103's calibre show how to write a protagonist who wins fair and square.

Zenith of Sorcery appeals to me. I'm not a big fan of cultivation in general (Street Cultivation being a noticeable exception) because of the way the settings tends to focus on progression for the sake of progression, and the way the entire magic system tends to revolve around combat. But I'm not too worried that will apply here. And nobody103 does great archmages.

Refuge in Void: It seems like the lesser of the two litRPG proposals and the protagonist starting with perks is a red flag to me.

Maybe an alt-Earth with the action focused in a fictional city and/or country? Like Brockton Bay or Wakanda.

I don't think a huge relative power growth is necessary for an interesting story, but one downside of starting with a powerful character is that it can be hard for the reader to follow along with a developed power set from page one.

One way to slow down the infodump on powers would be if Zenith hasn't had time to read some of the spellbooks from ancient masters that he found on his journey. That would let you introduce his "starting" powers in chunks - whatever he already has, whatever's in book 1, whatever's in book 2.

** I'm partial to "King of the Junkyard", even if it feels a bit like 40 Millenia of Cultivation meets Worm. Smashing together two excellent series, putting a fresh spin on it and giving it a writer equal to the task? Yes please.

The "Infinite Dungeon" story seems to lack a good reason to pressure the protagonist.

The heroes journey in the "Zenith of Sorcery" is likely to be stunted by the fact that the character has already risen to power, and so you get the narrative burden to exposit upon all of the character's powers, so that we can lean on Sanderson's second law, but none of the joy of seeing him get there. This just seems like a likely supply of overlong infodumps. Then once you finally get all that rooted and the audience gets comfortable you suffer the usual xianxia planeshift problem of abandoning all the character development and setting you just built and starting over fresh. I'm not saying it can't be overcome and done well, it is more that I'm saying that it hasn't.

"Refuge in the Void" seems like a perfectly viable story, it just doesn't appeal to me, personally. I have a hard time getting into lighter toned fiction.
