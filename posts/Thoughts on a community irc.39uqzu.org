So I've often been in a position when I had a small idea or question I felt like posing to the community that didn't seem like it warranted a thread. Or I just wanted to discuss something, or maybe just talk with like-minded people.

Basically I'm just wondering

A. Do people here want such a thing?

B. Would the mods be willing to put it in the sidebar?


** The sub is usually quiet enough, just make a thread about it. More inclusive, chafeel

** Sounds nice and i would probably join such a channel if opened, but from my experience having an IRC channel can cause some alienation.

Essentially what tends to happen is that you get a certain subgroup in IRC which develops its own quirks and inside jokes etc. and as a result becomes much harder for new people to join into it.

One aspect that tends to make this worse is the fact that over IRC people develop much stronger interpersonal relations vs forums. But while that sounds good, and it is good in the sense that its always nice finding more like minded friends and getting to know them better, it makes the barrier to entry much higher.

Some of the issues can be solved by having public logs or somesuch which makes it easier for people to get to know the IRC community, but some of those "issues" don't really have a solution, at least not one that I am aware of..

** Sure. It could be a place for asking minor questions that you're wondering about but don't think should be put in their own thread, too.

** I'd say it's worth a shot.

I tend to be pretty damned unreliable about using IRC channels, though.

** I'd prefer a Slack channel at this point. I have it open all the time anyway.

***** Seems like a closed source, single server(by which i mean there are no different slack servers you could join), IRC experience based service that adds lots of extra features and fluff.

****** Yes. I use it at my workplace and it's great and has nice features, but because it's closed source, single server, and I'm pretty sure you can only use the slack client for it, it's kinda a huge pain to deal with compared to IRC, which has tons of clients and can use a different server. It's entirely possible Slack will be gone in a year or two. It's happened to other companies in the same field.

*** The reaction was pretty lukewarm. IRC's don't work without a critical mass of users.

**** Well, thanks for the idea; hopefully we grow enough as a community that we'll be able to do it at some point.
