These books' plots can be awkward at times, and some of the science seems absurd. The English translation of The Dark Forest leaves something to be desired. The translation for the third will be released in September, but it's translated by the guy who translated the first one, Ken Liu.

However, I enjoyed reading the books, and would recommend them.

There is one idea in the book in particular which was...worrying: it's solution proposed to Fermi's Paradox.

** I second the recommendation, I read the first book and I quite liked it. It was a novel perspective on chinese culture, and left me really curious about the development of their sci fi, their influences and so on. As you said, there were some awkward moments, and I was unsure if it was lost in translation or what, but overall a good read.

** I bought and read The Three Body Problem without knowing it was the first in the trilogy, and was surprised that it ended so abruptly. I've been waiting until the final book is out before reading The Dark Forest.

I certainly enjoyed the insight into the Chinese perspective on science, especially wrt the cultural revolution.

Is there any possibility that Ken Liu would translate The Dark Forest?

*** The second book has a different translator, but I believe Ken Liu is translating the third book.
