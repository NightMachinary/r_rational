Something I noticed reading rationalist fiction and fanfiction is that authors often fail to account for the Butterfy Effect when applying changes to a timeline (in time travel) or to backstory (in fanfiction).

Some things that almost nobody takes into account when changing the past in the plot:

- *Conception:* influencing people who were about to have impregnating sex, however slightly, is extremely likely to change the outcome of conception. Either they fail to conceive, or conceive a child of opposite sex (50% chance of that), or simply a person with a different set of genes, and thus looks and personality. Every change in the timeline that predates most of the characters should logically undo said characters.

- *firefights*: regardless if the fight is with firearms, arrows or spells: projectile fights are very chaotic by nature, and most hits depend on precise timing that would fail otherwise. Delaying a fight by mere second should logically change the outcome, unless it was completely one-sided.

- *accidents:* be it a magical accident, car crash, plane crash, or something more mundane, accidents by their very nature depend on specific set of events and timing. Change that set of events by a fraction, or by a second, and the whole thing might not happen, or happen to someone else, or worse.

- *disease, especially cancer.* Cancerous mutations depend on very random genetic mistakes to start and to survive. Virus infections depend on "luck" because the immune system beats them in 99.9% of cases. Which means that the Butterfly Effect should cause or prevent a lot of deadly diseases.

- *Love, sexual lust.* Attraction and infatuation are rarely rationally planned in advance, and depend on many random factors like timing, exact influence of other people, mood, often psychoactive substances in exact amounts, hormonal balance, randomly chosen conversation topics and flirtation attempts. In other words, a lot of relationships, sexual or platonic, would be greatly changed by even a small shift in the timeline.

TLDR: good rational fiction that tries to deal with timeline/backstory manipulation must account for all the major shifts that even a small change can cause.


** I agree with you that that's how things would work in real life.

However, fiction is generally less about hyperrealism and more about telling a particular story that the author wants to tell. And that's true even when applied to rational fiction.

Unless you want to make your story /about/ the changes that would happen as a result of the butterfly effect (which a fair number of science fiction stories have done), then you'd have to spend a chapter explaining all of the differences between this timeline and the previous one, every time you jumped back to the present, and that just sounds tedious both to write and to read.

This is one of those instances, like FTL, where I really don't mind things being scientifically inaccurate, as long as it's in service towards telling a more compelling story.

After all, a lot of rational fiction is fanfiction with a point of departure well into the past, and if you take your premise to its logical conclusion, then most rational fanfiction would be a bunch of OCs doing stuff that doesn't really resemble the original plot all that much, in which case, what's the point of writing it as fanfiction in the first place, rather than as something original?

** When it comes to time travel, yes, fiction that doesn't take into account butterfly effects is vastly unrealistic. When it comes to changing the backstory of fiction, as an author operation rather than as a postulated Peggy Sue or other in-story time-travel or change relative to a previous in-story timeline, this is not necessarily an operation on a timeline that obeys strict physics. It happens on a literary level; it's not something that's supposed to be inside any kind of physics, realistically chaotic or otherwise. You might as well castigate the author for failing to correctly simulate their entire universe on a quantum level. In a Watsonian sense the original Harry Potter universe doesn't exist inside the HPMOR-metaverse, so there's no in-story unrealism about James and Lily "still falling in love" because in-story there's no other universe for them to be "still falling in love" relative to. Asking for an in-story time-travel effect to obey Butterfly is scientific; asking for an out-of-story changed postulate to obey Butterfly is scientism - asking for something to imitate a sciency phenomenon that there is no reason for it to actually imitate.

I mean, the obvious reason for that is to tingle the figgin of nerdy people, who would otherwise nit-pick the incongruence. But even if we ignore the sciency angle of the Butterly effect, there should still be a serious consideration to the social, human2human effect.

Example: What if HP was born a girl, Harriet Potter? Most fanfics would only consider the narrow romantic/erotic angle, ignoring the fact that it would have a pretty big impact on the entire story, and each and every character throughout. To do otherwise, would be to either consider gender to be socially irrelevant in HP verse (thus introducing an even bigger issue to solve), or make everybody act as if Harriet was Harry, as if they were reading from the wrong script.

This applies to much all of the other forms of backstory manipulation. Either the author has to do the work and adjust all these little butterly changes, or risk our suspension of disbelief to...well maybe not be broken but lift its eyebrows and do some double takes. If a backstory change does not result in a pretty complex Butterfly, and the plot stays largely the same, it requires us to believe in a very big pile of coincidences, or fate (also known as writer's laziness;) ).

Sure, that's what I call "a lack of imagination", because exploring all of that would actually make the story MORE interesting and fun. But "Harry Potter was born a girl, Harriet, therefore every character born after July 31st, 1980 (such as Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley) does not exist any more and was replaced by someone else" may be taking it a bit too far.

**** It's somewhat of a balancing act; continuing your example of Harriet Potter, presumably both the audience and the writer want a story that examines how a genderbent Harry Potter would work. If Harriet is too different a character than Harry, then while the world building and knock in effects might have been handled well, the author has failed in their task.

**** I disagree with you because if read like that, even the original work doesn't account for "butterfly effects". Like, why was Rowling's original Harry Potter a boy instead of a girl? Did Rowling make sure that James and Lily had sex in the right moment? Did she toss a coin before starting to write the series? Did she do so for every character?

And what about broader history? Why did the USA form pretty much like IRL in a world that is so massively different?

Honestly, taking it to this extent makes any and all works of fiction, derivative or otherwise, unworkable until the day where quantum computers can simulate worlds passably.

***** This makes no sense; the creator of an original work simply POSITS, as a postulate, that things went like this and that. We have no information or details on the sexual life of the Potters, and there is no reason to believe it unbelievable that their gametes would combine to conceive Harry (a boy that we're repeatedly told looks a lot like his father, but has his mother's eyes; pretty believable). The problem only arises when you decide to make a derivative work that can be summed up as "original work but instead of X, Y". Because the logic of such works is /exactly/ to extrapolate in which ways precisely that single change snowballs into more consequences down the line.

******* True, and I agree we generally accept that. But also, the /enjoyment/ derived from the story lies in the deviations. If I copy-pasted the Harry Potter novels, Ctrl+R'ing all occurrences of "Harry" with "Harriette", and called that a what if genderbent fanfiction where Harry is a lesbian girl I would... get a copyright strike, I guess, but also make something that's really boring for a reader of the originals. The fun is in seeing consequences, not as unexpected as to see random, but neither as expected as to feel too predictable. It's a balance. But this is certainly about just making a good story of a certain genre, not about being accurate to the temporal mechanics of parallel timelines of fictional worlds.

******** The point is that changing something in the original to make a fanfic with some things but not everything changed is nothing like time travel. You don't stick your hand into a parallel universe where Harry Potter is real and change him into a girl (or whatever other AU change you want to make) and then have to account for all the physical dominoes as you speculate on what changes your intervention caused. You are writing a new story, building a new universe to your specifications that happens to bare certain stricking similarities to the universe of another story while also having certain differences that are significant to the story you want to create. As long as there is no in-universe time travel involved the author is under no obligation to act as if his story is subject to the Butterfly Effect, even if he wants to keep things rational and consistent. Just like an author that edits some thing in the first chapter of his original work doesn't have to roll dice on every subsequent scene to preserve continuity.

** Conception is a huge one. Changing the time of conception by seconds (or even milliseconds) will completely change the sperm that arrive at the egg, and the child will get completely different paternal genes.

Doc Brown: "Sorry, Marty, Even if you get your parents back together, they're going to have completely different kids. On the plus side, that "erased from time" schtick doesn't make any sense either, now I think of it. I guess your photo just got wet or something... you'll still exist when you get back to the future, you'll just be a homeless orphan."

Limiting time travel to the recent past, or splitting the timestream when you go back, are pretty much the only ways to stay "hard" without confronting the time traveler with being a mass murderer of everyone they knew before the trip.

Or you can invoke the Novikov self-consistency principle and every time you go back to the past you're unable to change the resulting timeline. If you do interfere with the past your interference turns out to have already happened in the "original" timeline. That stranger who pulled your mother out of the car accident where your elder brother died as an infant? that was you arriving too late to stop the car accident.

** While I agree with you that a bottom up worldbuilding approach would lead to significally difference characters I think that for many people such a time travel story would be less appealing because it makes non-time traveling characters insignificant to the reader since they'd be erased once the character jumped back again.

I recall a time traveling story with romantic elements and I kept wondering if they were going to follow the relationship elevator and get a child just for the child to disappear once they jumped back.

On a related note I think it's very reasonable to consider time travel to be genocide(and gods below I wish more stories explored those implications). The newest chapters of WtC have had me thinking about what they call 'Supremacy of Existance' as a term for the position that existing and then not existing reigns supreme over not existing in the first place. I know that isn't what the term refers to in the WtC universe but it seems apt and I am wondering why I haven't encountered that position in fictional works.

** For single worldline time travel, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy already has it covered: You can't change anything with time travel, because you've already done everything you're going to do with it and the effects have already been made manifest. For softer fiction that doesn't abide by this obvious ironclad rule, well, you can't go back in time if you unmake yourself so the universe has to contort itself into a timeline where you exist.

For fiction with multiple worldlines, well, they're more akin to sliders with a significant divergence limiter imposed on their travel. Just tourists, effectively.

So for something like Back to the Future, its rules are just a little immersion breaking if you think about them seriously. For something like Bill and Ted, well, we wouldn't even think to hold them to this standard.

Edit: Some of this is applicable to the dimension you exist in right now. Hydrogen is obviously Harry Potter magic nonsense. That it would form stars that build heavier elements is almost as nonsensical. That they would die and the heavier elements would form planets, totally coo-coo. That abiogenesis would form life, which after billions of years result in multicellular organisms, completely wacky. That the specific lineage of jellyfish had sex with the right kinds of jellyfish over hundreds of millions of years to produce you... to say this is statistically improbable is more than a stretch.

Some of your cases (conception) seem reasonable, others not so much (firefight), and overall I take issue with your reasoning that "logically, X should happen", as we're dealing with probabilities not arithmetic.\\
Consider the firefight. Model it as, say, 10 rolls of a d10, looking for a 10. Timeline modifications, IMO, might change the outcome of any given die roll, but that might just mean the third shot hits instead of the sixth, or vice versa. Ditto for cancer and relationships; any situation where something repeated is occurring and it only has to "succeed" once.

Notably, and AFAIK, this includes all chemical reactions - two molecules have to encounter each other with the right orientation, etc, and then the magic happens.

For example, let's take the usual trop "let's go back in time and kill Hitler". There would be some slight changes in how Nazi Germany evolved, but the situation would still be globally the same because it's not any individual or group that changes things, but context create logical developments in history.

*** This is partially true, but it does ignore the fact that sometimes massive societal changes pivot on the action or inaction of singular powerful individuals.For example, if the Nazi party had a significantly less charismatic leader, there is an argument to be made that they may not have been able to win the initial popular election.

Both are true, societies have momentum that can bulldoze over millions of individuals, but individuals can sometimes be elevated to extreme heights of influence and completely alter the course of a nation and the world.

I'm reminded of an excellent book "Time and Time Again" by Ben Elton which shows the truth of both of these Killing Hitler stops world war 2 as it happened, but often leads to far worse outcomes. Most of the time Hitler isn't even responsible for WW2, its other people.

Take your Hitler example. If you killed Hitler long before he came to power, then most like NSDAP would not rise to power without their charismatic spokesman. The main parties back then in Germany were Nationalists, Imperialists, and Communists, NOT National Socialists. WIthout Hitler, the most likely scenario is either that Imperialists merge with Nationalists, and bring the Kaiser to power, OR Communists gain the upper hand and Germany joins the Soviet Block.

To keep the Hitler example, his party did not rise solely thanks to him. For every speech, every action, he had his party behind him, and he was as influenced by it as he influenced it (he probably became the leader because he held the same view as his party too). Remove Hitler and the party pushes the next most charismatic person it has, but the context is still the same and prone to having a Nazi party and WW2 coming, and most big decisions would still be the sames because the same people would push for them.

Of course, some things would change. The party would probably have been a bit less efficient, and this could have been enough to tip the scale in another direction. Though I believe you would need to remove way more than one person to have significant changes.

For each historical character that rose to power, there is another person that could have fit the same position but was not pushed by his peers because the other option seemed better

** Granted, but a "what if" scenario that truly accounted for complexity to that degree soon would turn just into its own story. I dislike what ifs that stick /too/ faithfully to canon too - they make no sense, in my opinion (one example, though I overall didn't hate the story: "The Arithmancer" and sequel, where the plot sticks REMARKABLY close to the original Harry Potter books even years down the line for being a completely new timeline where Hermione Granger is the heroine). However, deviate too much and the story and world become unrecognizable.

In the end the very concept of a counterfactual is a purely speculative one, so I'm willing to cut some slack. I won't complain if the firefight started in the same circumstances just /happens/ to go in the same way. But sure, if someone leaves by car three hours later than they ought to and STILL has the same exact accident, I call bullshit. Conception is problematic because effectively almost ANY baby conceived after the divergence event should be affected, which would often erase a lot of our familiar cast. Not really feasible.
