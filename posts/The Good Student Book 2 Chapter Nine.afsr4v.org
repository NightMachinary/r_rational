** My boy Nic Tut always doing the opposite of what people expect.

"You've got a way to get Winnum Roke out of me? Too bad, I was the one who put her in here!"

"You cultists want to put me into the High Father? Haha, you'll never find me if I hide inside the High Father!"

*** It was not clear to me whether he collapsed because he made it inside the dragon, or else Roke did something (maybe made the knockout drug take effect again).

**** I got the impression it is because the High Father let his spirit in. It's like in Book One when Nic and Simole were shifting bodies between the terrorists and dragons. When they switched between bodies, the old ones would collapse.

***** Sure, that is one possibility. I was just saying that from what I read, it was not clear whether that happened, or whether Roke somehow made him collapse before he could transfer, since Roke obviously did not want to do it. I agree that the first possibility is more likely, but I do not think it is certain.

******* No one really knows what she can or cannot do. Anyone would be foolish to take Roke's word for it.

******** The reader knows. She's not built up as someone who can just take over and the story tries to be consistent with how magic works.

If we go too far to the "anything can happen" end of the room he might have just passed out from the sleep deprivation and stress.

********* No, the reader cannot rule it out. Roke has already demonstrated the ability to affect his body. She did something to his eyes in addition to keeping his mind alert when the drug took effect. Considering that we have no idea what Nic did to be able to walk around despite being drugged, it is quite plausible that Roke could undo it, or simply stop doing whatever she did to keep his mind alert which could result in him collapsing.

** Great chapter. The back and forth with Winnum vs the doctor was tense.
