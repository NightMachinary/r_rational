** Chapter 4 is up! Note: in this one we start going a bit into the endgame of this arc, which means you could start piecing together more of what's going on than is said explicitly. If you do, please write any guesses in spoiler tags. Thanks!

** I was honestly worried about how a Pilaf in a rationalist fiction would work but you managed to make them more competent and still hilarious.

***** Hmm, could be about Goku (I'm leaving this out of spoilers since I'm not going to dig into anything special anyway). I'm still trying to find my way around the characters I guess, I have plans and ideas but perhaps can't always make them coherent 100% of the time. My idea there was that it was him following his feral instinct and making a rushed decision (that he /does/ regret immediately afterwards).

Also [[#s][about magic]].
