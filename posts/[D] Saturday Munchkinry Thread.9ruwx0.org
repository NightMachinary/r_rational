Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** This is a "power" cribbed from a popular fantasy series. I won't say what series or what character as that's a heavy spoiler, but the power itself won't spoil anything. Please refrain from identifying the series in comments, you can PM me if you want confirmation on a guess :)

Every morning you wake up with a different INT score. These tend to cluster around your normal--it looks like a standard distribution from some statistical meddling you did on a good day--but there are occasional (extremely rare) outliers that leave you catatonic and drooling or, on the other end, piercing the veil of the universe with your insight. There is no pattern, save that you're just as likely to wake up with -4 INT as +4.

For purposes of discussion we'll say "genius" comes at +2 sigma, meaning 2.1% of days you're at Einstein-level cognition (and 2.1% you're a giggling child).

The character with this affliction has munchkined it pretty thoroughly, so I'm curious to see what this sub would do. First priority is probably setting your life up so that waking up with 50 IQ wouldn't collapse your whole deal.

*** I'll assume it changes at midnight. Set up your sleep schedule so that you wake up at midnight, so on a rare good day you get 24 hours and can use stimulants and nootropics to borrow an extra boost from the following days. Depending on how trusting you are, find someone who loves you to get you through the bad days, or reveal your powers to also get large amounts of assistance on a good day.

The answer to many munchkinry questions involves AI, but this question is ~tailor-made for it. Beyond-human intellect is going to be most useful in producing insights for the alignment problem. Go to MIRI or something, convince them you're right, and watch them apply their creativity to motivating you to get tutored in their work on above-average days so you can play oracle once a year.

"Travel the world visiting mathematicians to solve their problems" is what Erdös (edit: not Gödel!) did on merely human intellect, so your best day should give you a good shot and hope not to be abducted by some government.

It's probably wise to look at your brain for how this is happening, though.

Einstein took a long time to design his theories, and if we only get his genius 2% of the time then I don't expect our character's short bursts are going to contribute much. The average of your ability is back at your starting intelligence, so your net contribution isn't going to be much more than without the ability. Unless high intelligence massively scales up your contribution, but even so the increase will be limited. eg. if the scaling is x^2, then your contribution is about double what you would have without the power.

*** Step 1 is to build restraints for yourself. Every day before you go to sleep, lock yourself in a room with food and water and no sharp objects, and make it so that the only way to unlock the room would be to solve some complex puzzle. You can achieve this with AI or just getting a friend on the other side of the door to unlock it only if you solve a mathematical problem. This way you can't kill yourself on days when you are a total idiot. Depending on how stupid you can become, you may need to tie yourself down to the bed and get an IV drip.

​

Step 2 is experimenting with your ability. How are you getting a different IQ every morning? What if you don't sleep at night? Does your IQ still change? Can you force rapid changes of IQ by taking naps? What if you travel to a different timezone, or keep moving around the earth ahead of the morning so your IQ never changes?

​

If your IQ changes every 24 hours regardless of what you do, you can stay up all night and prepare tranquilizers to be injected into you right after the IQ change if you don't solve some puzzle (again either AI or friends would do). That way on days where your IQ is low you just spend time asleep, on days when you have average IQ you just catch up on sleep or waking hours, and on days where you are a freaking genius you chug down lots of coffee to stay awake.

The danger is just before that, when you are so stupid that you think you are smart. You will rampage around doing all kinds of stupid things while thinking that they are genius plans. And the worst part is: because of your days as a freaking genius, other people will think that you /are/ doing genius things and won't stop you.

People with 40 IQ aren't /delusional/, you would be able to notice that suddenly the world is extremely confusing and things are really difficult for you, and you would still have the basic sense to follow very basic instructions left for you by past you.

Well that's the question isn't it? What does an Int score actually mean? How does the -4 INT manifest itself? Do you just suddenly compute things worse? Do you lose memories or knowledge? Becoming irrational seems entirely possible as a way of manifesting -4 INT, since you might temporarily forget things such as Bayes Theorem or anything beyond simple logic.

​

Using your example of leaving notes for your future self, there are three cases:

1) You wake up too dumb to read the note, and so realize you are dumb since you can't read.

2) You wake up and read the note just fine, and obey the instructions.

3) You wake up and read the note just fine, then proceed to completely ignore the instructions because you think you are a freaking genius that is smarter than past you, and so can do much better than following past you's instructions.

​

You're saying that case 3 can't happen, but I have to ask: why not? That seems like a perfectly reasonable manifestation of -4 INT to me. (Unless whatever game system you are using has another mental stat like WIS for representing this.)

Lower IQ means you score worse on IQ tests, given rationality is an acquired skill which doesn't improve your ability on IQ tests it should be completely unaffected. The problem was bringing up IQ so interpreting INT as being IQ is entirely reasonable, especially since research would seem to pretty consistently fail to show any aspect of raw innate intelligence which isn't covered by IQ.

Subcategories of the IQ test very rarely deviate that significantly from the overall score, so you could mainly predict something like verbal IQ based on general IQ, or even a seemingly unrelated thing like ability to mentally rotate objects in your head.\\
That's why multiple intelligence type theories aren't taken that seriously by people in psychometrics these days, because they either correspond to things that are nearly entirely learned skills or the different types of intelligence can be almost entirely predicted from G.

One clever day you come up with an amazing idea: What if having sex/kids was banned for stupid people?

This might check the boxes for int (use evolutionary pressure to make people smarter), but not for wisdom (that's wrong/there'd be riots, etc.).

If you think this is a reasonable example of the difference between them, then int might be concerned with 'theory' and wisdom might be 'knowing/predicting in advance how well it'll work in practice'.

On the rationality front one might say 'logic and reason can be used to figure out how to do something, but they should first be used to to figure out what you should do - sometimes it's better to go around a mountain than climb over it.' The example might show someone figuring out /how/ to do something, but not that they /shouldn't/. That doesn't mean the idea should be entirely discarded: Somehow the inverse approach 'smart people should have more kids' or just 'we should research what affects intelligence' (like lead) seem much better - we do see a difference between 'killing off everyone who is unhappy' and say, 'cloning some happy people' or trying to make people happier/less unhappy.

The fact you can generate fictional examples that seem to support the cultural concept of wisdom vs intelligence does not mean those are actually meaningfully distinct categories. Were there any cognitive ability that resembled wisdom and wasn't massively correlated with intelligence (as much as different sections of IQ tests are with each other) then it would have been noticed by now. However the past century of psychometrics has pretty consistently indicated that it really is just G. This should also be intuitively obvious in that the people who consistently act like they have low WIS are usually not terribly bright either.

My point here is that there really doesn't seem to be any innate or separate "wisdom" trait. It's just a combination of intelligence and learned heuristics.

You are probably right about that. My comments are only intended to apply to /fiction/. I also think we still disagree on the meaning of Int and Wisdom, but for the purpose of this discussion, I think it matters only that in fiction, a power that increases "intelligence" is more likely to have effects as I described.

It's similar in principle to what happens with sleep deprivation or alcohol. In particular in that while you'll know when you're severally compromised, but you'll also be prone to not recognizing how compromised you are when you're "only a little bit compromised".

Additionally a lot of very risky activities will naturally gravitate to that "average adult" zone, so a day where you're just a little bit below average and have decided that's 'close enough' is a day you're more likely to regret than a day you were way below average and could tell you weren't in a good place to make decisions.

Yes but my point is that people are perfectly capable of having the sense to avoid putting themselves in a situation where they can make any decisions that are terribly important while intoxicated.

What you're describing is mostly learned heuristics which isn't really intelligence except insofar as smarter people learn those heuristics faster and more reliably. Impulse control is at least somewhat a personality trait but also seems to be heavily learned in a way that intelligence can't. Calling any of those things intelligence when talking about a system where intelligence is a /stat/ doesn't really make sense because they would more clearly be skills or stuff not captured in game-like statistics.

*** Well if we're assuming you have a 140 IQ to begin with (not actually terribly remarkable in this subreddit if our demographics are anything like say [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]) then going off the 15 SD IQ scale you can expect to be superhumanly intelligent, say 195 IQ (barring non-statistically-valid stuff like adjusting for age nobody on earth should have an IQ that large) only every ~22 years.\\
With that level of intelligence it's not clear what you could do, but you still only have 24 hours to do it and given people with insanely high IQ's in the actual world aren't churning out groundbreaking stuff every day I wouldn't hold your breath.

So for this ability to seem very useful (though maybe you could get some money from being a scientific curiosity) it seems like you really need to be a remarkable genius to begin with, since being an ordinary genius isn't good enough. After all if you have say a 160 IQ to begin with then you get a day at 195 IQ every 102 days, days at 200 IQ every 261 days and days at 202 IQ ([[http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/iqtable.aspx][the highest this chart goes]]) every 391 days. So /those/ are levels of intelligence I can really imagine being useful to have even if only for 24 hours, especially since being a genius already you'll have more crystalized intelligence to go off while your IQ is massively boosted.\\
Also usefully at 160 base IQ you shouldn't expect to ever be reduced to 100 IQ or below but every 80+ years, so the ability will basically only every make you /less/ clever for the most part.

He also set up everything people in the comments suggested, he IQ tests every morning (they have their own name for IQ) and schedules his day based on it. He's actually a public figure so he can't work or be in public on very extreme IQ days.

​

I didn't see any really interesting munchkinry suggestions here, just people solving the basic issues the power causes, arguing how it'd work and overestimating what this high IQ could do specially how fast it'd be at solving difficult mathematical theorems.

​

I think what the author did was actually pretty close to optimal, you could think it can do more or less depending on how accurately you interpret high intelligence.

  Not how the power works, I've read the source, the base is 100 IQ, he gets the bell curve from there.

Well I don't know about the story this is based on but the post said it would deviate randomly in a bell curve from one's current IQ.

  Also you should google highest IQs individuals on earth, there are some really stupid numbers out there, and they aren't doing anything insane.. Mostly college professors making a decent living.
#+end_quote

What exactly is your point supposed to be here? I basically said the power wouldn't be much use unless it let you achieve superhuman levels of intelligence several times a year (and you were already a high level genius the rest of the time).

Actually given in the source the character is supposedly 100 IQ to begin with, I kind of have to assume that this post is incorrect in assuming the intelligence follows a bell curve here. Since if it did then days of actually impressive genius would happen only every few years (and given the setting and the lack of crystallized intelligence to draw on you wouldn't be able to accomplish much of anything even when you got genius days).

That's the case, he had 1 day where he was monster level intelligence. And he knows it probably won't ever happen again. But in that day he did a lot, made a lot of plans and set many events in motion.

He's not xXxOPboi69XxX he's a powerful king with high intrigue and several plots and plans.. It's an interesting character following plans made by an alien with alien morals who is also himself but he can't really understand it completely.

The OP wanted to see if anybody here could exploit it more optimally or do something else entirely, but the actual author is fairly intelligent and did a good job optimizing it.

I was talking about just human level genius (which for a single say still wouldn't be /that/ useful), you would expect him to only ever actually have superhuman intelligence if he had the power for many millennia.

Again this absolutely sounds like superhuman levels of intelligence, which would require that the distribution of his intelligence not be a proper bell curve. Otherwise you'd never actually see him with intelligence which is this impressive.

Very low chance does not equal never. 1 in a million, 1 in a billion, 1 in a trillion..

********* My point is that if you ever see truly inhuman levels of intelligence then we're talking one in many trillions (since IQ rarity is exponential) chances if the intelligence distribution is a bell curve. So seeing it once is very strong evidence against that, so much so that even if you had pretty strong evidence it /was/ a bell curve this evidence would completely trump that.

** Another children's book to munchkin: In this book, a boy discovers that the tooth fairy is his homeroom teacher, and in return she offers to grant him one wish that must be tooth-related. She offers "a new toothbrush" and "never get cavities again" as possible wishes, and the boy ends up wishing for all his teeth to fall out in hopes of getting extra money to buy a new bike. In the end, while that happens, his teacher puts his teeth back and just gives him the bike because she feels sorry for him.

So, assuming you encounter this situation, what would you wish for? Assume that any actual alterations to teeth can only be done to your own teeth. Does your answer change if we assume that in this case you still have your baby teeth?

You'd definitely need dentures, given that Californium is highly radioactive and unstable.

Hell, if you knew exactly when the change was going to happen and had a friend standing by with a sledgehammer and pliers ready for immediate extraction, I'm still not sure if you would survive.
