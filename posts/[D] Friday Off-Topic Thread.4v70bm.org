Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I watched /Atlantis : The Lost Empire/ again after 15 years, and wow, this movie really isn't as good or profound as I remembered. The basic story is about an expedition to find the sunk city of Atlantis, lead by a mercenary whose face screams "Going to betray you all for money in the third act", a bunch a quirky international first-class experts in demolition/mechanic/archeology/etc, plus two hundreds crew members. The unnamed crew members start dying ridiculously fast and the expedition loses their giant steampunk submarine and most of their supplies, but after a while they finally make it into Atlantis. The local king immediately decides to kill them for trespassing and being rather obviously looking for trouble, but her daughter convinces him to let them rest for a day, then kick them out, and in the meantime asks for the archeologist's help finding the forgotten secrets of her civilization (though how they could forget anything even though they all have eternal life is beyond me). So the greedy capitalist leader of the expedition turns out to be a greedy capitalist and decides to steal the power source that keeps the atlanteans alive, go back to civilization and make loads of money. The main characters refuse to help him and get left behind, but they find Atlantean warplanes and go get the power source back, killing what's left of their fellow crew members in the battle (but who cares, their lives can't be worth anything since we don't know their names, right?). The main characters then go back to civilization with a bunch of worthless yellow metal the atlanteans had lying around, and thus become filthy rich (except the protagonist, who stays with the natives).

My main problem with this movie is that it made me feel incredibly sorry for the nameless crew members, but never followed up on it. More than a hundred redshirts die when the Leviathan sinks their submarine, and they're given a brief sort-of-funeral, then are never mentioned again, and the expedition continues without a hitch. None of the survivors mention loosing a friend or a brother, they're all perfectly content to follow the expedition's leader even when his orders get them killed, and in the final battle, none of them goes "Wait, I actually /don't/ want to die to help exterminate an ancient civilization for money". And at the end of the movie, when the main characters go back to civilization, no one seems shocked that they're the only survivors of an expedition that started with two hundred people. So even though I really liked this movie as a kid, I'm having a hard time remembering why. :p

As an aside (and not a bad thing in any way), it's funny to realize years later that the main character (Milo) is so completely Disney's Daniel Jackson. Polyglot archeologist who discovered an ancient super-advanced civilization through reading old texts, check, no one believes him (or his grandfather who said the same thing), check, is approached by a mysterious powerful expedition who believes him and needs him for an expedition, check, has trouble integrating with the military crew, check, befriends the locals first, check, stays behind with a native girl while his friends go back to civilization and pretend he's dead, check.

"You know what, I don't remember. Maybe we should refresh our memories on this vital topic on a regular basis, or perhaps write the information down."

*** My rationalization about their treatment of all the nameless mooks is that none of them are actually on an archeology trip. No, that's what Milo is on a trip for and as a slightly unreliable narrator that's what we see the other travelers as. Instead they are a group of people who would have been in prison for several years and are sent on a foolhardy expedition in exchange for not going to jail. Milo's backers are not actually super-powerful mysterious people who believes Milo unlike everyone else. No, his backers were people who don't want to have to house criminals for years and if Milo finds something, great! But otherwise everyone either dies or are released when they return. This explained why everyone apart from Milo seemed like a group of criminals and were willing to follow such an obvious bad guy (every other potential leader were equally shady and was a worse choice). Also, no one's going to /really/ mourn the passing of criminals.

The language thing is explained by the fact that writing systems slowly changed over time and no bothered to retain knowledge of how to read the older writings because royalty were the only ones allowed to see the engravings and even they only ever visited the engravings a handful of times in their lives. Therefore it went from a father who knew how to read them (barely) to a lazy son who pretended to be able to read them well enough to get out of the boring and "unnecessary" duty of learning how to read the carvings. Then the father died abruptly and then the son realized that nobody knows how to read the carvings well enough to teach him. They may be immortal, but that doesn't mean they can't die of something other than old age or that they can perfectly remember every skill they have learned.

Remember that this was what I thought was going on when I watched the movie as a 6-7 year-old. So I don't actually know if this makes sense in context of what we see in the movie.

In "The Gamer" Han Jee-Han primarily levels int.

They both have trouble depicting increased intelligence, but again, I'm not certain what Int is even supposed to mean in The Gamer. It legitimately barely seems to be more than a magic stat, at least for Jee-Han. I mean I guess it's fine if Jee-Han isn't /supposed/ to get smarter with int boosts.

****** Int gain is a somewhat nebulous concept anyway. What would it mean for you to be smarter without actually knowing more? Increased working memory, greater ability to recognise cognitive biases that you already know, or perhaps simply the speed of your mental processes?

Stories that feature characters getting smarter usually take the Sherlock approach---they gain the ability to perform magical abductive reasoning (I wanted to just write "abductions", but that meaning of the word is decidedly less common) and an eidetic memory, even of things they saw /before/ the int upgrade (and, most often, never explicitly saw at all).

Actually modelling somebody's thought process and what they would get stuck on is really hard. We're poor predictors of our own future behaviour, let alone a stranger's.

One part that frustrated me about The Games We Play was that Jaune levelled int and wis so high that he effectively became psychic. That's not to mention his absurd perceptive abilities, which just kept getting closer and closer to omniscience unless the plot required him to not notice something. So Ryuugi mostly skipped illustrating his thought process and just outright handed down declarations of truth from on high.

Honestly though the thing that most frustrated me was the writing. Usually a few times per chapter he'd use the same conspicuous phrase or word in proximity. And the chapters which seemingly existed just to show off how badass the characters were ("It's apparently a tradition for large groups of ninja wizards to cause wanton destruction in a battle at funerals, so let's do that."), especially when those characters added almost nothing to the larger plot.

[[#s][Spoiler:]]

Oh and why, whenever Jaune levels more than once, does it say "Your level has increased by one!" multiple times? Why not "Your level has increased by 7" or at least don't specify "by one".

Eh, I could gripe about this story for a long time. It needs a brutal edit before I'd recommend it.

That's actually a reference to how at least some (MMO)RPGs work. The default scripted response is to inform the player whenever they manage to push [[http://imgur.com/a/amnkG][the ever-so-slowly crawling]]^{1} experience bar over the edge and get a Level Up, so if you manage to kill mobs [[http://imgur.com/a/9SU78][that are significantly stronger]] than your player character, it's possible^{2} you'll insta-jump through several levels at once.

So players get classically conditioned to salivate at those delicious multiple Level Up notification lines,^{3} written in that sexy status message font and colour.

*** Agreed on The Games We Play. It's pretty slow-paced, but the real problem is that Jaune is completely out of character, even considering the INT and WIS boosts. Which is fine IMO when, like in HPMOR, the character getting replaced is boring, but I felt like the new Jaune in this fic was less interesting. I prefer Ryuugi's Prytaneum, where Percy Jackson retains his most important character traits.

I disliked it less than I disliked the other two reboot movies (for which I /also/ was dragged to a theater...), I think--though, at this point, my memories of the other two movies are /quite/ fuzzy.

A thought that crossed my mind many times in the course of the movie was that it was a gigantic waste of money to have a zillion fancy visual effects when I wasn't enjoying /watching/ the movie any more than I would have enjoyed /reading/ [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263012][a random /Star Wars/ novel]]. I can visualize the /Enterprise/ just as well as I can visualize the /Millennium Falcon/--a zillion enemy-of-the-week fightercraft in swarm formation as well as an endless fleet of coralskippers coordinated by a yammosk--James Kirk as well as Corran Horn. Once the basic images have been established--once the reader has something on which he can base the vision of his mind's eye (maybe nothing more than a book's front cover and back cover)--expensive sounds and images are no longer necessary.

How often do you hear about /Indonesia/ in contexts other than "largest Muslim population in the world", "giant forest fires blowing smoke to neighbors", and "hurricane/tsunami target"? I, at least, found it somewhat interesting.)

**** To build on this, have you ever seen the youtube channel [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOzD4Sfgag][Every Frame a Painting]], [[/u/ToaKraka]]? It does a great job of showing how, in the hands of a competent screen writer and director, visual and audio can communicate a hundred thousand subtle and meaningful ideas in ways that are unique to the medium. The above linked example goes to a video on comedy, but he has a ton of others to show it in other ways too.

The key word there of course is /competent,/ which might be better phrased as "exceptional." I know many people who like Abrams as a director, but personally I've found him mediocre at best. He's never "wow"ed me with his directing, for all the fancy visual effects and cutting edge CGI.

I don't deny that visuals /can/ have an impact. For example, I consider the opening scene of /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080][Speed Racer]]/ to be /at least/ as awesome as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/27][the fight between Sakura and the Zombie Combo in /Time Braid/]]. However, these are /outliers./ When the /average/ orgy of visual effects and the /average/ literary action scene are equivalent in impact, and the visual effects are significantly more expensive than the simple words, spending extra money on visual effects doesn't make much sense.

The same response can serve to counter [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]]'s contribution. In my opinion, subtle implications can be made in books just as well as they can be made with movies.

***** Subtle implications can be made in books, but I would argue that certain implications can be made much more elegantly and powerfully in visual medium, to the point that I can't think off the top of my head of ever seeing equivalents to them in books.

Take comedy again as an example. As demonstrated to some extent in the linked video, most movies rely almost completely on dialogue and absurd events or obvious visual gags for comedy, because they're written as screenplays, which have access to all the same things books do, just without narration. A great director can inject comedy in tiny things, subtle absurdity in quick movements and camera shots and sound effects, that just can't be done with narration in a book. Or at least, I've never seen it done well.

I'm interested to know, what are some of your favorite comedy movies and books? How would you compare them?

I bother to seek out neither literature nor video that's /focused/ on humor, since I've had such lackluster experiences with the genre. Off the top of my head, I remember finding particularly funny [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185][the /Harry the Hufflepuff/ series]], /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]/, and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106][Seventh Horcrux]]/ (as well as a few short /Friendship Is Magic/ crack-fics) in literature, and /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142][House]]/, many /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stooges][The Three Stooges]]/ short films, and some /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy][Laurel and Hardy]]/ short films in video. Out of that list, I'd /very tentatively/ estimate that the /The Three Stooges/ films are the funniest and /Seventh Horcrux/ is the second-most-funny.

******* Hmm, so maybe I've been going about this in the wrong genre if those are your favorite comedic movies/shows. I was going to make some direct comparisons between, say, the comics of Scott Pilgrim vs the World and the movie, or the book Big Trouble and the movie, but it seems like it would be fair to say your favorite non-written comedies center around witty dialogue (for House) and slapstick (for Three Stooges/Laurel&Hardy)?

Actually maybe I can do it this way after all. Think of facial expressions that have made you laugh, or body language that an actor did that was particularly humorous. Have you ever enjoyed any Charlie Chaplin? In particular I'm thinking of the way he runs, which always makes me grin, or how he turns corners with a kind of skidding hop on one foot, one hand clutching his hat as the other holds his cane.

Sure, you can describes these things through the written word... I just did, at the most basic level, to put some kind of picture in your head and communicate the basic idea. But I'd contend that the exact mannerism of Charlie Chaplin could never be captured by words alone in as short and effective a way as he can portray it on screen, robbing him of many unique aspects of his humor. A split second of movement that can take a paragraph to describe is often much funnier visually in the context and moment you see it in, compared to the written word.

I don't think I've seen any Charlie Chaplin movies. Your description does, however, put me in mind of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Keaton][Buster Keaton]] in /The General/ and /Steamboat Bill Jr./, which I enjoyed. Yes, that's a style of humor that's different from the humor in /Seventh Horcrux/, while still equivalent to the latter in quality. Still--how expensive were the stunts in Keaton's films, when compared with the negligible sum that the writing of /Seventh Horcrux/ cost?

For facial-expression humor, [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34C1F26D03F5F9B8][the Half in the Bag series]] (humorous movie reviews, bookended by humorous skits) is the only example that comes to mind. In my opinion, however, the reviewers' mugging at the camera is a /very/ minor component of the show's humor, in comparison with their intentionally-exaggerated tones of voice. Even in this example, whether or not the cost of constructing and maintaining a studio and props is worth a few funny facial expressions is, in my opinion, highly debatable.

This is a good point, but a different point than the one I was making. I definitely agree that as a matter of pure cost-per-laugh, movies will likely always be more expensive than any written story, in some cases astronomically so. Same goes for other genres.

But the experience itself is still unique, regardless of cost effectiveness, and that has its own value to many people, and its own premium. Besides which, you're generally paying a fraction of the difference in seeing a movie vs buying a book (putting fanfiction aside for a moment), so the cost-to-laugh for the consumer is likely not an issue, while for successful movies the scale of its popularity makes up for the cost of production.

As for free fanfiction, I guess there's an equivalent in free online videos. I've always enjoyed this video as a clever bit of dialogue-less humor.

[[http://youtu.be/oP59tQf_njc]]

There are other examples that can be used, but the unique blend of body language and music/sound accompanying the action makes it very hard to duplicate that particular experience through written word.

It likely cost the producers far more to film and edit than it did to write it. But I think there would have been something lost in translation to even the most imaginative reader. As an aesthetic experience, visual/audial media can present very unique moments compared to the written word, just like the written word can in different moments.

I myself can't claim to have a better imagination than what's necessary to generate a single cartoonish freeze-frame image at a time. Still, even a fleeting glimpse (mostly copied from memories of Sasuke's fight with Deidara in the anime) of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/22][Cursed-Seal Sasuke sheltering himself with his wings from Sakura's assault in order to form hand-seals]] is /very/ satisfying.
