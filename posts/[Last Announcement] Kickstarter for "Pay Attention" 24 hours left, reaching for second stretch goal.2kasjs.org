Hi folks,

[[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention][The Kickstarter for "Pay Attention"]] has done amazingly well, thanks to you lovely people.

Today is the last day; as I write this, there are 25 hours left on the clock. We are very close to the second stretch goal and I'd love to get there; if you know anyone who's been on the fence about pledging, please give them a nudge.

This is the last announcement you'll see about this Kickstarter -- when it ends tomorrow, I'll send the 'thank you' message to the backers. For now, let me just say this:

Thank you, [[/u/Timewinders]], for giving me the idea for this story in the first place.

Thank you to everyone on this reddit for encouraging me to do the Kickstarter back when I wasn't sure about it.

And thank you so much to everyone who has pledged, Tweeted, Facebooked, or mentioned it to anyone ever. You have no idea how amazing this is for me.


** Well, I chipped in $5. Wish I could give more. I started out really disliking the writing in Two Year Emperor, but after the 7th or 8th chapter either you improved drastically or I got into the swing of it. Now you rank pretty highly on my author quality lists.

Anyone with a lot of disposable income want to add a few thousand words to the story? I know I'd really appreciate it.

*** Thank you very much, that's really great of you.

I'm glad to hear that you ended up liking 2YE. Out of curiosity, do you remember what you didn't like about the first few chapters?

**** I just looked back on the chapters, and I think it was the density of references and "4-th wall" breaking. The main character just wasn't taking the story even a little bit seriously, so neither could I. Of course those things aren't bad at all, and honestly they're a big part of what makes 2YE so entertaining, but at the very beginning it seemed like that's all there was. Just some random guy talking about D&D and programming and fan fiction with a backdrop of OOTS except without emotional investment.

Then you started adding characters and plot and historical background and the rest of the things required for a actual story.

Honestly I think it comes down to me having read so much stuff with a premise similar to OOTS, Erfworld, 2YE, even Natural 20. I've just gotten slightly sick of the start all of these kinds of stories have, I have to push through to whatever part is done uniquely.
