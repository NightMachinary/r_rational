Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have the power to move from this Earth to a different, unspoiled Earth where humans died out thousands of years ago. You can take up to 140 pounds with you, so long as the thing you're taking with you fits entirely within a radius extending two meters from your center of gravity.

The other Earth has its own weather, distinct from our own. The landscape is generally the same, except where human intervention has changed it.

When you transfer over, you are not guaranteed to be safe from changes in air pressure, nor are you guaranteed that you will be safe in the environment, or that you will be at a safe distance from the ground. The transfer retains your precise position with respect to distance from sea level, longitude, and latitude.

You can make the move from one Earth to the other once per hour. Initiating the transfer happens at the speed of thought.

If an intersection would occur (i.e. you would transfer into a place that's occupied by a steel girder, block of granite, or another person) the other matter will be transferred to the other Earth that you've just left. This also applies to anything you bring through with you. While this prevents some severe potential catastrophes, transferring to, for example, the interior of a boulder would leave you without oxygen to breathe.

To your knowledge, you are the only person who has this ability.

- How do you make the most money within a one year timeframe, legally or otherwise? In a ten year timeframe?
- What equipment do you take for your first few trips?
- How do you ensure your safety in the long-term?

*** If matter is substituted where you go to, and you can use it to move your body's volume of stone from a boulder, you can use it to circumvent the 140lb limit. A 2 meter radius hemisphere of air allows you to pull quite a few things through--if you want to take a human weighing over 140lbs, for example, just carefully coordinate for them to be in the way of your hemisphere of air when you come back.

If you can't arbitrarily take air, then making a large aerogel hemisphere would be a worthwhile goal. If it only does the substitution trick for solid objects intersecting your physical body, well, I'd consider getting fat to make it easier to take friends there who weigh over 140lbs.

I'd take over positioning beacons and set up platforms for transferring goods fairly early on. I'd take drones as well, mostly as a lightweight way of surveying an area.

I'd be afraid of animals in particular--large animals on the alternate Earth won't be afraid of humans. I might survive the first few encounters by using a gun, but I wouldn't want to rely on that method. Traveling in the other world is dangerous, so I'd mostly travel in our world.

To generate money fast, I'd find rare trees and cut them down. Ebony is 10k per kilogram--that's pretty efficient. Rare metals are also a possibility, but harder to spot with a drone.

A personal goal: de-extinct passenger pigeons. That would be hard given their famously large minimum viable population size, but by stealing eggs and coordinating with ecologists back on Earth, maybe it could work. Or I could spend several days capturing as many birds as possible. I'd definitely, definitely try eating one while I was there. I'd also go look for the legendary extinct birth control herb, silphium--there's probably a market for that on the first Earth.

I'd probably try to set up an ideologically stable alternate population of humans, but I'm not sure how well that would go. As the only conduit, I'd feel very vulnerable to the possibility of people on either Earth deciding to coerce/kill me to obtain/prevent further transfers.

Finally, I'd definitely take a telescope with me when I go camping there. Very little light pollution on empty Earth.

I was wondering how easy that loophole was to see. I'm not planning to write a story for this question, but I /was/ thinking about what the story would look like, and having a loophole like that allows for plot progression in a way that I find pleasing ... so long as it's not bloody obvious from the outset, and people are left wondering why the protagonist didn't leap to that conclusion from the outset.

***** Hmm. It took less than an hour for half a dozen people to think of it, but then again we didn't actually have a brand new world to explore with all the possibilities and initial work distracting us.

In a story I'd be tempted to make the power require a 'push' if solid objects were in the way, such that the more mass there is in the way the longer it takes to jump and the harder it is to initiate. That would be convenient for preventing the MC from getting stuck in a boulder, but it would also make it less likely for them to perform the experiments that reveal the mass limitation is from only one side--it would draw out that revelation, at the cost of complexity.

**** I'm curious. Why would your personal goal be to de-extinct passenger pigeons, or at least, why that species in particular. I know that their extinction is due to humans but the same can be said of other species as well.

I definitely think it's a cool goal to pursuit and would probably use the powers in the similar way in trying to discover species that that have been lost due to human actions.

I guess I feel a bit surprised to read that here since in my personal experience I feel like most people in the rationalist community are more concerned with the advancement of technology than the conservation of nature, not to say that the rationalist community don't care about nature but that I haven't seen much topic on it being discussed.

***** I'm glad you asked. I find the passenger pigeon's story particularly egregious among extinction stories: a near-limitless supply of readily available meat, hunted right to extinction. It's hard to imagine just how bad things had to get for that to happen. Here's a summary from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon#Hunting][Wikipedia.]] Reading that, one can't help but think that a valuable natural phenomenon was destroyed--it would be nice to restore it.

My thinking was also affected by a plot point from the first book in a series: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/264946.Hominids][Hominids.]] The series is about connecting to an alternate Earth where Neanderthals survived instead of humans. A Neanderthal's confusion that we managed to kill all the passenger pigeons stuck with me. I'd recommend the series.

I think we'd be more capable of avoiding the extinction of passenger pigeons today, what with the internet, better enforcement of laws, and a more ecologically-minded populace. Maybe we'd even farm the pigeons for meat. Of course, their astonishing extinction itself informs our culture... I consider them a good example of how humanity underestimates its own power to cause disaster.

One other reason: maybe the visibility of de-extincting passenger pigeons would allow me to generate support for other de-extinction projects in the hypothetical world. And indeed, in our world passenger pigeons are already a candidate for [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ancient-dna-could-return-passenger-pigeons-to-the-sky/][de-extinction.]] It would be a lot easier if you could just go grab some, though.

I feel like such an ambition in this hypothetical world would be difficult though. In addition to potentially bringing back an extinct species I feel like a lot of contingencies would be needed to ensure that no diseases are transferred between worlds.

In addition to spreading potentially invasive species to and from worlds, plant pathogens could surely cause their own scale of damage and that's not counting the things that animal pathogens can do.

Unless this teleportation removes any disease I feel like this new world is only going to suffer from the moment humans are involved.

*** There's short-term and long-term safety. Short-term safety is dominated by worries like "how do I make sure I don't get stuck in a boulder". Long-term safety is dominated by worries like "how do I prevent powerful agents from exploiting me in ways I do not like."

Fortunately, short-term safety should be mostly fixed by easy fixes like bringing

- a hunting rifle

- two hours' supply of oxygen

- another person, possibly ex-military, with duplicates of this gear (EDIT: 140 pounds weight makes this tough, but it might be possible if he or she is very slim)

- something to prevent your death when you possibly fall between 20 and 1000 feet (possibly a combination of multiple systems, like a compact parachute and something else)

Although now that I think about it, the safest place to transfer over blind is probably the ocean: go out in a small rowboat about 100-200m offshore, transfer, since your position is preserved relative to sea level you should continue to be in the ocean. After this, row to shore while recording everything, and transfer back depending on how far away from shore you are on Earth Two. Be recording with several GoPros while you're doing this, and when you get back, piece together the videos of the Earth Two with videos of that region of Earth One to figure out if there's super different geography. If there's not, your next trip back and forth can be in the boat, but slightly closer to the shore. Repeat until you find a safe place of the shore to transfer on, and work your way inland until you get to property that is convenient for you to access.

- Nobody can get back.

- Nobody can get help in catastrophic events

- Everyone you send there will die there.

- How do you make sure they don't die there?

- How do you convince a woman/couple to get pregnant from a random man they don't know instead of their SO? Why should a man care about an others child (That doesn't look like him) in a hunter and gatherer society?

- How do you make sure your utopical idea don't turn out to be a distopia?

The solution is to advertise it widely, and let them know that it is a one-way trip in advance. Colonization has always had this danger. The traditional problems with colonization, the pushing out of native humans, explicitly do not apply in this scenario, because there are no native humans to displace.

#+begin_quote
  Then there are other problems like:

  - Will the world exist after you die (probably, but who knows?)
#+end_quote

Same exact question could be made for the world we live in. I don't know if it will continue to exist after I die. There is no known physical mechanism for it to stop existing when I die, given my understanding of the world, but that is

#+begin_quote

  - How do you stop infecting tribes people with your bacteria/virus(es?)?
#+end_quote

Prolonged physical isolation prior to contact, along with antibiotics. Also, in my variant, I would attempt to take as many people there who want to go, not just isolated tribes people.

#+begin_quote

  - How do you make sure they don't die there?
#+end_quote

I do my best to select communities to come along, not just individuals. The goal isn't to bring one or two people along and leave them there. The goal is to bring people in groups of 50-100, so they can support each other on the other side.

#+begin_quote

  - How do you convince a woman/couple to get pregnant from a random man they don't know instead of their SO? Why should a man care about an others child (That doesn't look like him) in a hunter and gatherer society?
#+end_quote

Let people make their choices. There is a difference between convincing people, and letting them have the choice should they want it. As for men caring about somebody else's child, for the same reason that people adopt. Because they want to. Not everything is about a genetic imperative.

#+begin_quote

  - How do you make sure your utopical idea don't turn out to be a distopia?
#+end_quote

I don't. My goal is to establish a stable population in the other world, with as high of a chance of survival as possible. I don't expect it to be a utopia. I expect it to be human.

#+begin_quote
  And your assumption that the benefits are good (aka not evil) is based on your value system:
#+end_quote

Every choice one makes is based on one's value system. You eat each day because you value the feeling of being full. You talk to friends because you value social cohesiveness. Your statement conveys no useful information, because of course my decision to spread humanity would be based on my value system. There is nothing else that it could be based on.

#+begin_quote

  - are preserving humanity, (many say humanity is a desease)
#+end_quote

Humanity is what gives the universe meaning. Without intelligence to see, to learn, to appreciate, there is no glory in the stars or the planets. And yes, there are those who say that humanity is a disease. I don't hold with those self-hating misanthropes, nor does your statement that they exist lend any credibility to their arguments.

#+begin_quote

  - given it room to spread, (why should that be good? you just create more humans somewhere not connected to our earth)
#+end_quote

One of my favorite books is /The Little Prince/, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. There is a quote “The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen." The uninhabited world is so vast, so empty. But by bringing people to them, by knowing a person here, and a person there, knowing that they are facing challenges. That fills the world and makes it wonderful.

#+begin_quote

  - and creating a backup plan for several potential forms of human extinction. (Why should we care about extinctions? If everyone decides to not make children, it would be okay. )
#+end_quote

Again, I disagree. As beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so would beauty die if there is no one left to behold. Humanity will eventually die. There's nothing that can be done to prevent that. But I want that to be in the tail end of the heat death of the universe, as the last human walks through empty halls, orbiting the last slowly cooling white dwarf. Smiling to themself, thinking back on the eons of the universe and saying "That was fun. Time to figure out what comes next." To look back upon a humanity, a universe well-spent.

#+begin_quote
  And counterargument:

  - You would just make a society fated to 'destroy' a new earth.

If nobody uses it, then it has been destroyed far more effectively than the presence of humanity ever could. All the potential, every life that could be led, every child's laughter and every grandfather's chuckle lost.

We can see that in our own past, and the places where humanity has yet to touch. We can see the senseless rise and the senseless fall of species, continents, stars, galaxies. It is intelligent life, so far found only as humanity, that gives meaning and purpose to these mere objects.

- You can talk by sending sound waves through the air

- You can read the thoughts/communicate via telepathy with anyone touching you. You can't use this to gaslight/plant false thoughts/manipulate your wielder in a way that involves pretending your thoughts were originally theirs.

- You are obscenely sharp and never dull.

- You are immune to the magic of the era, whatever that is.

- Limited effectors give you holograms/fine-grained manipulation/pyrotechnics within about ten centimeters of your surface. You /could/ use this for anything from "pretend to be a neat glowy sword" to "record and play back video for your bearer."

You have unspecified goals that at default include "bring peace and prosperity," "disincentivize evildoers," etc. Or, for fun, try to rule the world.

** What would you do, if you had could create and shape forcefields.

The device doing this would be at least 1/10 of the size of the forcefields. and lets say has the density of steel.

You couldn't create forcefields inside most solid matter. (but you could create knives and drills..)

Just one thing, forcefield generators rarely randomly turn off. You can restart them with no problem. But nobody knows how to fix this. And not fixable.

If you can overlay forcefields for redundancy, you could use them for structures. A material with invulnerability and a redundancy multiple of a tenth of the density of steel might make for good, say, spaceships. Unmanned vehicles like drones don't even need the redundancy, you just lose a small fraction of your fleet over time.

**** You want a forcefield 10m away from the device, the device has to be at least 1m big. forcefields don't get damaged over time. They collapse if they get overloaded (too much force) or at random. And can be restarted without repairs a few minutes later. How much force is required depends on the energy and the form of the forcefields. A weak forcefield (for umbrellas or such) would collapse if it is hit with a knife. A building out of forcefields would collapse if someone shoots an artillery round at it. Or drives a car fast into a wall. One out of concrete and steel would only partially collapse. Of course, you could still use multiple forcefields, still not optimal.

Steel should also be cheaper to build normal buildings. (of course, if you have to move or change a building every few weeks, forcefields are cheaper). Forcefields can't go through other forcefields, but you could have holes in both (if a forcefield goes through those holes, their range is shorter), or for buildings multiple segments.

***** Hmmmm. Then I have a potential (partial) solution for the sudden-random-failure problem.

Let's say I want to protect Item X with a forcefield. So I stick a forcefield generator onto the side of X, which generates a Sufficiently Large mostly-spherical forcefield. (If I can get it to reflect a given wavelength of light, then I can use the internal surface as a mirror and have an actually spherical field).

It's /mostly/ spherical because there's one needle-thin protrusion pointing inwards. On one side of this protrusion is a laser; on the other side is a light detector (not detecting the laser because the forcefield is opaque to it). When the forcefield goes down, the laser (which is independently powered) hits the detector; and the detector controls the 'reset' switch on the forcefield.

So, yes, it can still randomly go down - but then it goes back up again before anyone can react.

For simplicity, you could use 2 forcefields for redundancy. They would be less efficient.

And I still have to calculate what the probability of random chance is. I think if you build all houses in the USA with 2 forcefields, you would have every week one whose forcefields collapse at the same time.

********** You could, spinning is difficult, since the device would need to calculate how to change everything so you don't cut off the energy transfer of an outer layer.

Since the random chance of shut down is low, you probably wouldn't need multiple forcefields. Big ships would have many forcefield segments outside of their hulls. The same for buildings. But buildings have the problem that a terrorist could just wait, that one forcefield collapse.

If you want personal shields, you should be okay with one. Multiple forcefields mean more weight and more energy needed. And not many benefits. It would be cheaper to duck, if your personal forcefield collapses. If you were a soldier you would probably prefer a longer batterie life, than redundancy

Anyhow, would you use it for anything else, except shields?

Like drones, or multitools or as helicopter blades(thats the name?). Or fan or propeller or for turbines for an energy generator. Or as sun sails. Or 'cheap' windows. Or tents for emergencies. (Better 5min wet/cold than the whole night)?

I'm not sure if anyone really wanted a building or a plane or spacecraft only made of forcefields that collapse. But there could be cases, where a forcefield building (with minor material structures) would be the only realistic option (Like after catastrophes)

I think I should clarify the probabilities.

The probabilities are so that if you have 82 million houses (number of houses in USA) relying on one forcefield and has a second one as redundancy. Once a week one house of the 82 million would collapse because both forcefield fail at the same time. So basically one forcefield has a chance of 1:9000 of failure over a week because of random collapse. (Not counting stuff like defective devices and/or misuse)

Now that I calculated it, it seems a little low. Since after 20 years 89% of forcefields wouldn't have collapsed. If we say the time frame is a day, we would have only 44% of forcefields never collapsing in 20 years.

| 1house/86mil/timeframe | after 1 year | 5      | 10     | 20     | 30     |
|------------------------+--------------+--------+--------+--------+--------|
| day                    | 96.02%       | 81.64% | 66.65% | 44.43% | 29.61% |
| week                   | 99.42%       | 97.15% | 94.38% | 89.08% | 84.08  |

(That is the probability of 1 Forcefield still standing without collapsing. Keep in mind, they still collapse at random. Turning them off and on doesn't help.)

I still need to calculate the probability correct. Since the forcefield would be down for ~5min and it only matters if the other forcefield collapses in that time.

So I would still risk it for pots, pans and similar stuff, but not for my house or car. And I guess there is a higher chance for a lifeboat to have a leak, than for a forcefield to collapse.

Well, I agree that I would prefer a lifeboat made out of real stuff. I think a forcefield device (50x50x50cm) that is normally used as eating table could have also the setting "lifeboat" or as an emergency tent or anything else. Which would be quite useful on a cruise ship. And I sure as hell would prefer a forcefield lifeboat over nothing. And a forcefield lifeboat for everyone over not enough lifeboats. Lifeboats are special, since the device (if waterproof and able to swim when turned off) would be able to get reactivated and the passengers would only get wet for ~5min. Of course, there are other reasons to not have forcefield lifeboats, like battery life or too expensive.

It would get down to how likely a failure of a forcefield is (1/9000 failure probability for a day, means 99.92% everything will be fine for a week.) If the probability of sinking a lifeboat because of other causes (storm, waves) is much bigger, I would risk a forcefield lifeboat.

Anyhow, what everyday stuff would you make with such a device if it didn't collapse randomly?

Hmmm. In this case, you have a super-strong building material whose only drawback is that it requires continual electrical power to exist. So this would be best for /temporary/ structures - like bridges that occasionally stop existing to allow a ship to pass, for example, or emergency bracing to aid in the safe demolition of tall buildings. Or, hey, given the fact that it doesn't actually need support (I'm assuming the location is constant with regard to the generator) it makes for excellent scaffolding, without looking ugly.

Also ladders of infinitely adjustable length (up to a maximum) and some very interesting ways to cheat in pinball games.
