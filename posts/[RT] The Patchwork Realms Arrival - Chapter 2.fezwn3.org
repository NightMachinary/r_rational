** I considered titling this chapter 'Grief', but we aren't there yet. This is the initial shock. Grief comes later, and it's not a momentary thing that could fit into one chapter, so no single chapter deserves the name.

*** So call the first arc of the story Grief instead of Arrival?

**** Could do, but it's more about his arrival in the new world and how he adapts. His grief is a result of that but not the core premise.

** Awww puppy.

  I mentally reviewed what SpearGuy had said, taking note of which words I now (thought) I knew.

  Okay, enough linguistic note-taking! There were smols being difficult!

I see what you're doing here and I approve. Magically-assisted learning can still be satisfying when it's addressed as requiring attention and effort. Bonus points for canine psychology.

** More chapters? So soon? I cant...believe it!

Pretty good so far, I am bit miffed at how fast he went from dog think to advanced reasoning, but I suppose its necessary for the story to get going, same for random translation, maybe could have been done by pantomime between dog and Spear guy, just point and woof at things. Wonder if they will save some of the meat, maybe not waste it or leave it to feed wolves and other foresty animals.

*** There's no translation going on, Athos simply learned a couple of words and now notices them when they're spoken. Don't worry, there will be plenty of pantomime going on.

As to the horse meat...the caravan is in quite a hurry, as evidenced by the fact that they're traveling after sunset. (Recall that Athos arrived to find himself under a very bright full moon.) They're going to deal with their dead but they're not going to spend time doing anything with the horses. OTOH, Athos is hungry and is going to eat a bunch of the dead horseflesh before they move on.

** Anyone want to do guesses on where the doggos power came from? My best guess is that the individual who best represents their species gets upgraded to an ideal of their species, and one of those gets upgraded again. Now, there are probably dogs in the world since there are wolves, but I posit that earth breeds are distinct enough to count for the system.

So our MC is the most rotty-mix pup to ever rotty-mix in the new world, and the system recognizes that. Thoughts?

** I am not literate enough to understand what the fuck is going on.

Does this story come with an English translation?

*** It is in English...?

Oh, wait, you're talking about the dialogue. Yeah, that's not an actual language, it's just placeholder babble to signify "This is a language that Athos does not understand. Here is roughly how much content is being spoken, and parts of it will start to be in English as he learns more words."

Basically, the leader of the caravan (SpearGuy) says "Are you intelligent and friendly?", Athos doesn't understand him but demonstrates friendliness and a willingness to cooperate, so SG invites him back to the caravan. The people are scared until SG reassures them, one of the women decides to use healing resources on Athos, a different person protests that they shouldn't waste all that on a dog, and she tells him to heck off. Lissi and Faffi hug him for reasons that will be clear later, Marza is freaked out about that.

** I'm genuinely stumped, and cannot for the life of me picture what the non-humans look like. Like my imagination just falters for some reason.
