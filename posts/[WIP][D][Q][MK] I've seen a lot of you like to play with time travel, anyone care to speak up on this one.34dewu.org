The fluffy fun version can be found here: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/34ddxp/a_fate_market_entry_prophecy_stone/][Prophecy Stone]]

The broad rules here are that the time travel is not many worlds or branching, no alternate realities at least as far as prophecy stone is concerned, there is no outside universe that you can link the causality back to something.

However it's also not perfect predictive ability, the past and future peripheries are effectively the 'borders' of where time travel can be effected and at those peripheries there is no significant way to determine what will happen.

The History of the setting ends up being made of peripheries and 'zones' of territory that define roughly how possible time travel is or even information about sections of time and space (because the prophecy either does or does not carry signals from the future events back and artifacts bearing information about the internals of the event do not make it 'forward' from the past).

Any thoughts or interesting ideas regarding story telling potential would be appreciated.


** It annoys me when people try to play with the arrow of time like that. It's a result of the boundary conditions of the universe. You can define that the stones exist with no markings at the end of the universe, but that would probably just result in them forming close to the end. You can't make the backwards arrow of time follow the stone.

From what I understand, the message written on the stone is the one that will result in you writing it on there. You could precommit to writing whatever happens and then end up with what will happen being written, but it would be more useful to precommit to writing what you see if things go well, and writing something else if they go badly. They're not prophesy stones. They're probability manipulation stones.

*** Yes that is exactly what they are, but the setting is full of obfuscation for safety purposes. The naive belief that they are prophecy stones is useful and helps insulate the nature of the universe from those that interact with them directly.

** Is there an entire wave of time travellers building up at the edge of known time, like the Restaurant at the End of the Universe writ large? Do people wait until the nanosecond before they cannot go back, and then go back? Is letting yourself be washed "over the edge" by the stream of time considered the only form of suicide that's really, irreversibly /final/?

I mean, a universe bounded by apocalypse on either temporal side /seems/ pretty depressing until you consider that residents are like fish, swimming against the current before they can be washed over the edge.

*** That is actually a lot of the point, when your nestled deep away from the peripheries your unquestionably amazingly safe.

As long as you still haven't used up all of your value with the fatemarket.

In the fate market everyone has access to the entirety of their wealth over their lifetimes.

But that wealth is also in many regards also the extent of their certainty and control about their lives.

The residents are a bit less like fish and more like threads that are only so long that can be looped and woven through the expanse until their worth to the market forces involved is used up. And that will eventually happen. Every job and craft and product has an absolutely FINITE demand for it.

Transit back in time is a limited resource. And it has been hoarded greedily.

So yeah drifting into a periphery is suicide, except some times it's as much suicide as being poor is suicide.

**** Oh! I think I get it! Time travel is done by magic circles, which can summon people through spacetime. Peripheries happen when either there are no more targets for the magic circles to latch onto, or no more magic circles to go to. That implies that, whatever the apocalypse is, it obliterates all minds and all magic circles.

For the next bits, I'm going to call the before-mind periphery the Genesis boundary, and the after-destruction periphery the Apocalypse boundary.

My first thought is to extend the Genesis boundary back by inscribing magic circles on the prophecy stones themselves. If that doesn't work, then my second thought is to sculpt the prophecy stones not only into instruction manuals, but into actual, working machinery that can be used to take shortcuts while climbing the tech tree.

The third thought is, if the issue is degradation of the stones preventing a magic circle from persisting, having someone skip back along the stone's timeline, restoring it at each "furthest reachable point".

***** AH Nice! The primary mechanism problem is a mechanism of the magic circles themselves.

I'll be writing another excerpt on those as there are actually many flavors of them and they vary in what their good for. However for now the hard restriction of a receiver is that you need a symbol recognizing brain to act as an 'activator' for most forms of magic circles, or the equivalent of entangled star gate type systems for actually moving solid matter.

Both of which run into challenges with prophecy stone that ends up meaning the earliest you can get someone back in time is roughly ten to a hundred thousand years ago if we assume this is earth.

****** So, my first thought is to somehow turn a prophecy stone into computronium with an AI installed and a magic circle embedded on it - an independently functional magic circle. Any equivalent process that allows a physical entity to piggyback with the prophecy stones, really.

******* That is pretty good actually, I'll consider it but I'm thinking that they run into similar problems as the future peripheries. And these are extremely expensive machines to build both in labor, time and raw prophecy stone materials.

Still I like it, it helps make the shape of the fate market a bit less lopsided with a really narrow past and a really wide future periphery.

******** It means that you've got what amounts to an asymptote of low-value spacetime stretching into the distant past, with no actual origin of any species within the fate market, because they can be seeded from an arbitrarily distant point in the past has already been. Everything exists because it does, and the whole thing is more or less an closed timelike curve that doesn't really exist in the way we think of it.

********* Your getting the idea :) and yeah I like this. It's mildly disturbing and existentially horrific. But also cool and gives even more room to stretch.

That said practicalities are kind of the absurd yet solid name of the game with the fate market. What is 'practical' tends to define what has happened. In practice there is still borders and limits going into the past, and like you surmised their pretty low value real estate.

********** Well, barring the costs of transferring into the past, it's low-value because there's a huge expanse of indistinguishable time bounded only by things like the creation of planets - or the Big Bang, if everything's prepared perfectly - not because it's undesirable as an aggregate. That's a /ludicrous/ amount of unbounded time, with only a few "crossroads" and maybe a tourist trap at the edge of the inhabitable universe, the formation of notable planets, and so on.

**** Why is backwards transit limited? That is, what's the mechanism by which it occurs?

Could you retroactively break a prophecy stone by precommiting to smashing it in the future?

How does paradox work? If I can access all the money I'll ever make at once, what happens if I go to the border of the City of a Single Day, donate all of it to charity, and slip into the Apocalypse Foundries?

If you get shot in the face, are you dead? Or can your mind-state be retrieved and restored/shuffled to a new future where you don't get shot?

What happens when it all runs out? The Prophecy Stone seems to flow from the end of the world backwards, but there can only be so much stone at the end of the world, and the city of a single day processes a finite amount per subjective day, meaning that at some point, everyone's value is going to run out, its processing speed is going to grow slower with less labour to support it, and the last vestiges of stone from the Foundry will pass back in time. Unless every fragment of stone moves back from the Foundry every 48 hours, and all the iterations are just loops of the same changeable physical stone?

I'm loving the Fate Market setting so far - it feels whimsical, terrifying, and spectacular. Also really, really confusing.

***** Paradoxes do not happen, because they are impossible. However things can seem paradoxical. The person who chooses to donate all their money to the city of a single day and jump past a periphery is not going to be as rich as the person who does more with their life eventually.

The fate market is actually a 'stable' loop. But it's so enormously huge and convoluted no one can SEE enough of it at once to know precisely what all of the causes and effects are.

And prophecy stone is more or less fully utilized, but it's not entirely clear how it's being used at any given point. People work prophecy stone through planning and pre-commitments or from dictations from other prophecy stone, or something.

The end result is that all the work you have to do is equal. Time travel just lets you do it in other periods of time.

A common newb mistake in the fate market is to try and pre-commit to an action, and then because they don't actually do it the action has no time loop shenanigan effect.

Then they don't do the action.

Proper pre-commitments are a LOT harder then most people realize (generally about as hard as just getting the thing done in the first place) and most people find it psychologically healthy and motivational to not pay too much attention to their own relative futures.

Also so glad the fate market is coming across that way. That is more or less exactly the goal of the setting.

******* Wanting to murder the poop out of grand-dad is a much easier statistical thing to skew then the rest of the universe.

There is already a barrier of entry to those that can even use the fate market to begin with thanks to the great big abyss contact filter.

Those that would be most likely to create a paradox end up not being in charge of fate most of the time.

That said statistically impossible things are happening all the time TOO. But that's more because people are playing stock market with probability.

What happens is whatever is 'paid for' not what is 'likely'.
