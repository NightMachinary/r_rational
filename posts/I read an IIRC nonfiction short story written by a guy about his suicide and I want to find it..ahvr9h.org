All I remember that it was probably 1st person narration, the guy was exeriencing a kind L'Ã‰tranger-ish alienation towards everything, and was trying with therapy (I recall dialogue with therapist), and... not much else.

[Edit:] Narrator was a 30-something US male, and there were scenes of driving.

Edit:] We have a winner, Good Old Neon, by Dawid Foster Wallace. It seems I was sorta right about it being autobiographical.


** Just out of curiosity, why do you want to read this? Feel free to ignore this if it's too personal.

*** I remember it being pretty well written and kinda relevant to me. Yes, a bit of call of the void too.
