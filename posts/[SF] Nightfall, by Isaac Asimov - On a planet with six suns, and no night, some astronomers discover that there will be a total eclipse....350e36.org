** u/Bowbreaker:

  Two dozen suns in a universe eight light years across. Wow! That would shrink our world into insignificance.

Y'all have no idea.

** Not sure about rationality-content, but this is a great classic story, and if you haven't read it before, you should.

A kind of Lovecraftian horror without any monsters or even that many fantastical elements, really.

** Has anyone ever tried to model a solar system that works like described in this story?

  CONCLUSION

  We have explored several aspects of Asimov's novel. We have found that the suns, especially Dovim are bright enough to blot out the stars. Kalgash 2 can eclipse Dovim for a period of 9 hours.

  We also tested one possible star configuration and after running some simulations, we found that the system is possible for short periods of time. Several other configurations might exist and have to be explored more fully.

** This was also later expanded into a full-length novel that explored the themes here more fully.

**** I don't know about "much better". It's a much better short story, but the novel does things that novels are supposed to do quite well.

** This reminds me very much of Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin. Definitely worth reading.

** This is my favorite Asimov short story by far. Great look at a really alien mindset.
