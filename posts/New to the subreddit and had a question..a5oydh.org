What exactly does each of the abbreviations in the titles mean? ( [RT], [D], [HF], [FF], etc.)


** Per the sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  You can use standard tags in your post title to improve Reddit's search function:

  Is the story [RT] rational or [RST] rationalist? Or is your post [META] discussion about [[/r/rational]]?

  Is the story a [WIP] work in progress, or [C] complete?

  Optional genre tags: [HSF] hard scifi, [HF] hard fantasy, [DC] deconstruction, [EDU] educational, [MK] munchkinism, [TH] transhumanism, [FF] fanfic

***** He means the Reddit redesign. The way it is now you have to maintain two versions of the sidebar, as the Reddit redesign has a lot more compartmentalization.

  flair

  1 : a skill or instinctive ability to appreciate or make good use of something

Maybe a Shadows-of-the-Limelights-like superhero series with flairs - really minor ental powers of a type "Path to Victory in a specific area"? Doesn't give you absolutely the best possible path, but a good enough path.

The protagonist, Jason Crane, has a flair for Definition, he can define concepts that someone else has only a vague understanding of, and uses it in debates.

His bumbling sidekick Jorry has the most common flair - flair for theatrics, he can impress the audience.

The antagonist would be the mysterious J.B., who has a powerful flair of Natural Order of Things. In fact, it's a customary flair in the tribe he comes from.
