** Make the gotcha a consequence of the wish:

"Oh, to ensure immunity to viruses... your genetic material is no longer compatible with anyone else's, your biochemistry has been changed to use a different set of nucleic acids in your DNA-equivalent."

** Heh. Another pretty good use of wishes, and an amusing attempt to get around the Jinn's restrictions.

** #+begin_quote
  your wish is supposed to be selfish, so that the aftermath can prove how foolish you were. Where would we jinns be, granting wise and noble wishes

I was a little disappointed; this premise was set up to clearly show that this was an evil genie and the main character would need to be clever to get around the downsides, yet that just got dropped. There are any number of ways this could have backfired, yet everything worked out perfectly with little effort.

*** These 3 wishes will kill millions of people. Everybody becomes superintelligent, but they aren't yet immune to diseases. Some of them are bound to be terrorists/madman.

A new virus is created by someone that kills all Jews/Muslims/Homosexuals/Black/White/Slavs/Roma/whatever people. Whole countries die off. Nuclear and conventional wars start.

The only survivors are people already insuspectible to sickness and lucky enough to survive the wars.
