** Author recommendation: Daniel Abraham (Aka, M.L.N. Hanover and half of James S.A. Corey).

In general, he writes almost-rational stories, with some selfish, idealistic, uninformed, etc. characters that /create/ problems despite the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. For example (vague enough to avoid spoilers), a character meddles with forces beyond his comprehension and nearly causes an extinction-level catastrophe. The characterization and worldbuilding is good enough that everything seems inevitable in hindsight and theoretically predictable, but it still managed to surprise me with twists and turns I didn't see coming.

Another thing that sets his writing apart is that time passes and things change. I can't nail down why the changes in the Expanse, the Long Price Quartet and The Dagger and the Coin feel more real and impactful than the ones in Harry Potter, The Wheel of Time, The Dresden Files, The Belgariad, and the Amber books, but the difference is night and day. The stories are set in a living world that reacts to world-changing events /as if the world has changed/. It seems like each book in a series shifts genres a bit to show this as well.

For specific book/series recommendations:

The Long Price Quartet (starting with A Shadow in Summer): High fantasy setting, with one empire controlling /Andat/, which are bound philosophical principles (eg. Stone-made-Soft or Removing-the-Part-that-Continues) that serve as both industrial tools (stone pottery, de-seeding cotton and abortions) and nuclear-level deterrents (melting a continent, ecological catastrophe). The first book covers an attempted invasion (by political means) of that magic-wielding empire, and a couple of characters on each side.

The Expanse (starting with Leviathan Wakes): Space opera that respects F = ma and other standard physics and economics (e.g. Terraforming Mars will take centuries of concentrated effort by millions of people). The setting has three main factions: Earth, with billions of people, Mars, with millions of experts at everything, and the (Asteroid-)Belters, who live on the fringes of society. There are cultural clashes, conspiracies, miscommunications, etc. that complicate the plot, and also talking problems through that preempts conflicts. The first book is mystery-like, with a murdered girl and an attack on a freighter being the driving ideas for the main characters.

The Dagger and the Coin (starting with The Dragon's Path): Fantasy set in a mostly post-magic world. There are different races of humanity (elf-like, otter-like, bug-like, underground specialized, etc.), indestructible roads between cities, and a few (very minor) mages, but everyday life doesn't contain any magic. It starts with three threads: a fairly standard war, with an incompetent and vengeful pawn who dabbles in philosophy is put in charge of a conquered city and proceeds to royally fuck everything up, an apostate from the (secret) Church of the Spider Goddess, who have the power to detect lies, and also anyone who hears them believe what they say, and a banker's apprentice who needs to navigate a warzone.

The Black Sun's Daughter (starting with Unclean Spirits): is urban fantasy, focusing on Jayne, a woman who inherited her uncles responsibilities as basically a demon hunter after his death. She doesn't have the training, and his allies (who she also inherited) aren't nearly as good as he was, so they're having trouble accomplishing their goals. I haven't read past the first book yet, but I'm planning to after I catch up with other things. I think it's probably the worst fit for me and this sub, but still a good book (and probably series).

** Request:

Podcasts with people talking about their disagreements, and really trying to get to the heart of where they disagree. [[https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/][Intelligence Squared]] is the closest one I'm aware of, but they often move on just when I feel like they're zeroing in on the actual disagreement.

Other things that are kind of close to what I'm looking for:

[[http://www.dylanmarron.com/podcast/][Conversations with people who hate me]]: It's a really good podcast for the question “how can you have civil conversation with someone very different than yourself,” but I'm looking for “Now that civility has been established, let's proceed to talk about the actual issue.”

[[http://www.atheist-experience.com/][The Atheist Experience]]: A call-in show show mostly centered around theists calling in to talk about the “Is there a God?” question. I would say It's around 50% atheists asking questions, or voicing their appreciation for the show, 40% theists bringing the same 3 arguments, and 10% actually interesting conversations.

[[http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/judge-john-hodgman][Judge John Hodgman]]: 2 people having a personal dispute agree to have it decided by the judge of this podcast. I like this podcast because, with the wide variety of people they have on, it's a good way of exploring the [[https://xkcd.com/1095/][fractally nested human subcultures]]. It's not quite what I'm looking for with the request, though, because there's rarely much emotional weight to the disagreement, and, to get on the podcast in the first place necessitates that the two people have reached a point where further conversations between themselves is no longer useful.

** The six Titus Crow books:

[[https://archive.org/details/tituscrowburrowe00luml][/The Burrowers Beneath/ and /The Transition of Titus Crow/]]

[[https://archive.org/details/tituscrow00bria][/The Clock of Dreams/ and /Spawn of the Winds/]]

[[https://archive.org/details/tituscrowburrowe03luml][/In the Moons of Borea/ and /Elysia/]]

As an aside, once you borrow a book from the internet archive, most books have the option to download a DRM-protected PDF that'll open in [[https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html][Adobe Digital Editions]] and then expire 2 weeks after you checked out the book.

I'm not making any suggestions, I'm just making a factual statement which is not meant to be taken as an endorsement of any particular course of action; it is incredibly easy to Google the words "pdf drm removal" and find a program which allows you to remove the digital rights management technology from the PDF and keep it permanently (and open it with whatever PDF reader you normally use rather than Digital Editions).

Another fact: Doing such a thing and only borrowing a book for the 5 minutes necessary to convert it and then returning it immediately significantly increases the turnover rate and gives more people the opportunity to read the book. Joining the waitlist for a checked-out book with only a single person ahead of you on the waitlist means you could have to wait for up to a month for the book to become available again, by which time you could have forgotten you were waiting for a book and then miss your 24-hour window to borrow it.

Another fact: Artificial scarcity is stupid.

As for the books I recommended, they're horror/adventure books based on the Lovecraft mythos, but the main character has a clock the size of a coffin which is /bigger on the inside/ which allows him to /travel through the multiverse/. The characters also fight back against the Cthulhuian monsters, instead of just sort of puttering around like the characters in Lovecraft's stories. The writing is pulpish, you can definitely tell it was written in the '70s in emulation of older writing styles. It's like someone stuck Lovecraft, Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Doctor Who into a blender. The story itself is pretty over-the-top, especially later in the series. It's great fun.

** Right, so last month's rec thread spawned a chain of me reading Culture-crossovers that culminated in me reading a Worm-Culture fanfic and really liking it, despite the fact that I've tried reading Worm before and never been able to actually get through it; the premise, characters, and world are really interesting, but Wildbow's writing /stresses me the fuck out/ between how obvious it is that the characters' decisions will lead to terribleness and how the narrative relentlessly progresses with no time to breathe.

The conclusion I have drawn is that is I really like Worm when Wildbow isn't writing it. Not having familiarity with canon meant I had to rely a fair bit on the Worm wikia to check who people/concepts were that fanfic authors elided, but it was a price I didn't mind paying. And so I am going to share my favorite fanfics here, so people who are in similar boats may have the opportunity to enjoy the parahuman world like I did.

- /[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm.273255/][Cenotaph]]/ and its sequels /[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wake-worm-au-thread-2.310371/][Wake]]/ and /[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/legacy-worm.345448/][Legacy]]/. Listing this first because it's most similar to canon. Taylor decides to try out with the Wards instead of going on a solo patrol, her name gets leaked, and Bakuda murders her father. From this dark point of divergence comes a really gripping story that actually felt much more hopeful to me than canon-Worm. Legacy is probably a deadfic, but still worth reading for the first two books.

- /[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-internship-worm-au-au.483163/][Deputy]]/ and its sequels /[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-commander-worm-au-sequel.518383/][Deputy Commander]]/ and /[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-director-worm-au-sequel.581563/][Deputy Director]]/ tells the story of a Taylor who never gets superpowers, joins the PRT as an intern, and proceeds to have adventures. Really fun; relies a bit much on OCs, but I deeply enjoyed the Piggot characterization. Recursive fanfic from /Internship/, which I am sorry to say I cannot really recommend; the /Deputy/ saga is much better-written.

- /[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894][Ring-Maker]]/ is the story of an alt-power Taylor: a Tinker who forges items out of the history of Middle-Earth. I don't actually know what to say about this, I like it so much; just read it.

I've recently discovered the app [[https://meet.libbyapp.com/][Libby]] which allows me to check out the works present at my local library as e-books.

** I have preferences for scheming protagonist with ambitions and realistic depiction of politics. My recommendation list reflect that:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10457949/1/Living-an-Indoctrinated-Dream][Living an Indoctrinated Dream]] - one of the main antagonists in Mass Effect series, Illusive Man wakes up after his death before humanity first contact, and promptly gets to business of manipulating everybody in preparations for the Reapers. The best thing about this fic is that everything happens on truly galactic scale starting with carefully calculated batarian genocide to the recreation of Prothean Empire(sic!). It's also has best depiction of how various governments work and upward of 1mm words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12241700/1/Mass-Divergence][Mass Divergence]] - turns out author of "To the Stars" has another fic under different account - crossover of Mass Effect and "To the Stars".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5316196/1/Loyalty][Loyalty]] - Naruto fanfic about girl who was strongarmed into becoming a spy against her village. Fic contains lots of betrayal, moral doubts and other deliciousness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4109686/1/Taking-Sights][Taking Sights]] (Evangelion fanfic) - magnificent bastard Gendo Ikari wakes up after Third Impact in past and discovers that his wife, for whom he literally burned the whole world, sacrificed herself to prevent all that he has done. So he sets out to save the world and take care of his kids in most underhanded and ruthless way possible. Fanfic is unfortunately dead but has about 150K words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3946501/1/Thousand-Shinji][Thousand Shinji]] (Evangelion and Warhammer crossover, complete) - "Shinji is his father's son, and with a little mentoring from an unlikely source, he will learn the ways of plotting and scheming, along with a few other useful skills.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian][The Maretian]] - a crossover between /My Little Ponies/ and the book /The Martian/ by Andy Weir. Don't read if you haven't read /The Martian/ yet since there are heavy spoilers for the book's plot. It's a very well done plotline of ponies and humans juggling surviving together on the hostile planet, Mars, and handling a first-contact scenario.

It's a sequel to [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/327551/changeling-space-program][Changeling Space Program]], but that's only to cover how the ponies managed to develop space flight and isn't necessary reading for reading /The Maretian/. Great read with Queen Chrysalis as the protagonist who is hellbent on reaching the moon first to gain ever-lasting power and conquer Equestria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11575324/1/Silver][Silver]] - a RWBY fanfic where Juane is the protagonist who came up with the audacious idea of creating weapons out of Aura. The story is about team JNPR rather than just Juane having major character development and comes up with novel ideas about how Aura works. A good amount is having Juane and others do a lot of figuring out the rules of Aura that is somewhat similar to the early chapters of HPMOR where Harry was testing the rules of magic. It's unrealistic how often they're right when a lot of hypothesis testing is usually failure rather than success.

Hmmmm.....I use calibre library to catalog and store my digital books. This gives me the option to create and share a list of the books in my library. While it may seem useless, I have a library that is specifically for books I can download off the Internet and if I give the list to others, then other people can find all of the free books/stories I have chosen to download off the Internet. Would anyone be interested? If there is anyone else also uses calibre, I would be interested in other people's book catalog as well.

** Still kinda new to rational fics, for some reason I have always enjoyed when people fuck around with time. I enjoyed those aspects in MoL and HPMOR, any other recommended rat fics out there where messing with time is a crucial part of the story? I don't mind plot holes or stuff that would break the universe that much. I also read Everyone is a Returnee under the recommendation of someone from here in some thread a few weeks ago (thanks whoever you are!), and even though it isn't very rational (or at least not rationalist?) it still is within the ballpark of what I want/might enjoy.

**** I finished reading it a few days ago and it was pretty good! I really enjoyed it and pretty much finished it in like two days. The time loop was well done and very interesting, the whole thing about Sakura having different versions of herself in her mind was neat (kinda reminded me of Cristal Society/Legion). I don't know how much of it is canon since I never finished shippuden, but the whole thing about the demons and the gods was great and quite trippy.

It was a bit too pornographic for my tastes at first, well not really but I guess since this was in the Naruto universe I didn't expect it to be so mature... you get what I mean. Eventually it grew on me and I started appreciating how honest it is, but yeah. Great fic nonetheless but it's a bit harder to recommend than something like Mother of Learning.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain][The Elephant In The Brain]] (non-fiction) was good, though at times the writing felt forced. Still, worth a read.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle][We have always lived in the castle]] I felt was very good, but probably not if you're looking for the 'rational' aspects. While the characters are very well crafted, they're... exaggerations? And the setting is far from rational, built clearly to faciliate the thought experiment. Call it a character study.

Read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7139892-under-heaven][Under Heaven]] again, all [[/r/rational]] readers should read at least one Guy Gavriel Kay book and decide if that's their style :P

Attempted [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25328003-the-war-of-undoing][The War Of Undoing]] but DNF. Setting's somewhat interesting, but the prose is uninspired, and each character in the main trio is so frustratingly flawed it's difficult to cheer for them. May come back to this later.

** I'd really like a list of good audiobooks from audible, specifically with good narrators. I've been trying to listen to Dune and Men at Arms but the audio quality is awful. Id prefer science fiction but high fantasy is okay too.

Additionally, Id enjoy some more off the radar reads like Sufficiently Advanced Magic, the Lightbringer series, and anything similar to Sanderson novels.

*** If you want good audio quality, stay away from Terry Pratchett, at least anything narrated by Nigel Planar. They really ought to run all those though some high quality audio cleanup and mastering. But those are the only really bad ones I've yet listened to.

Interestingly, the first voice actor I would recommend, Scott Brick, is also featured in Dune. But most of his stuff has decent quality. I've listened to him in a few Michael Crichton novels recently, like Jurassic Park (awesome novel, one of the best technothrillers ever, independently of the movie).

The Martian is very well narrated, to the point that it's worth a listen even if you've read the book. And it's my favorite novel, so there's that.

You can get the entire 70 ish hour Sherlock Holmes collection as narrated by Stephen Fry for a single credit. His rendition of Harry Potter are also worth a listen, although his tone fits the first couple of books better than the last.

This is a niche one, but you're a Halo fan, there's a short story collection called Halle Evolutions, that include two shorts narrated by the voice actors of the Master Chief and Cortana respectively. In general, I can recommend all the Halo novels if you haven't read them, expect The Flood which is just a novelization of the first game.

You mention Brandon Sanderson, but a lot of people only know his Cosmere stuff. If you haven't read them, the Reckoners trilogy is amazing. And I can also recommend Legion, which is hardcore competence porn in a good way. But if you're like me and have read literally everything he ever wrote already, check out Powder Mage. They're basically Brandon Sanderson novels, but written by a student of his, Brian McClellan. That description isn't quite fair to McClellan, but it's the quickest way to recommend them to someone already familiar with Sanderson

Old Mans war is very enjoyable and has a good narrator. Clean sci fi fun. Not much to say about that.

Reamde is a great one if you're into technothrillers. It's a long ride, but very action packed and framed around well researched contemporary tech

**** Seconding the Legion audiobooks, especially the second one since the first is too short even if it's better at introducing the premise. Sanderson can even do Dan Brown-esque thrillers right. I've only /read/ the first Reckoners book, but it's pretty awesome and manages to be dark in a fun pulpy way without feeling too grim or too silly.

***** The Reckoners books are good fun, but a large chunk of the second one, the metaphysics underlying powers and their connection to Epics' psychology, and the ultimate conflict and its resolution, feel heavily taken off Worm. Especially the rushed-feeling final battle at the end of the third book, which leans heavily on the protagonist having a uniquely powerful will, and is almost play-by-play the ending of Worm, except "and then the villain realized that humanity was great, and gave in".

*** Watchmen is the Citizen Kane of comics, so make sure you get around to reading it at some point. With that out of the way, I recommend JLA/Avengers for an epic melding of mythologies that you can easily understand even without getting the references but makes you want to go read the old comics to learn more.

My favorite “typical comic” I've read so far is JLA: Tower of Babel, which reminds me of my favorite Doctor Who episodes with David Tennent. Great story all around that has more emotional and intellectual depth than you'd think. I've enjoyed Grant Morrison's work in general, though his stories can get pretty surreal at times.

I love the out of continuity stories All Star Superman and Superman: Red Son, but they won't be as enjoyable if you don't already love Superman. The story that made me fall in love with the character was the animated film Superman vs The Elite, an adaptation of What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way? written by the same author that kind of improved on the comic.

The Killing Joke is my favorite Batman story so far, aside from Barbara being forced into the role of the victim who suffers tragedy for the sake of other characters' development. The Court of Owls storyline is the next one on my list to read, which I've heard is amazing. Of the older comics I've read, I've liked the ones by Chuck Dixon the most.

If you want to start following current comics, the [[http://www.comicbookherald.com/reading-dc-comics/dc-rebirth-reading-order/][DC Rebirth]] is a good jumping on point that I read using [[http://readcomiconline.to/][this website]]. I don't know Marvel as well, though I've heard great things about recent Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl.

If you want comedic reviews of bad comics, not unlike The Nostalgia Critic, I recommend checking out Atop The Fourth Wall. All Star Batman & Robin is my favorite (you won't get the running joke about Batman hating rock & roll) along with the Youngblood comics. His style of analysis is what got me into comics.

**** Re Watchmen: Best superhero story ever, awesome even if you hate graphic novels and superheros in general. The movie is also surprisingly good and faithful to the book (much better than you would expect for Hollywood-comic-movies). Watch it after you read the book; especially the villain's plan is done much better in the movie, imho (I know, heresy...).

Obligatory rec for V for Vendetta (the book was kinda butchered by the movie, so don't run away for possibly hating the movie).

Also plus one for Superman: Red son, even if you're not into superman (but it clearly does not reach Alan Moore level of awesome).

******* One thing I thought he left out is how different the action is in the movie. Characters act more like pulp heroes who can throw and take a lot of punches, while action in the comic is much more subdued and emphasizes single powerful moves like firing a gun for an instant kill.

In the debate over the climax, I'm all in with Linkara's side. I don't care if the comic version is way sillier, superheroes are an inherently silly genre no matter how dark and gritty the story is. The weirdness of it gave it more shock value to me and the political reaction sounds a bit more logical in the comic.

*** Reading the entire Ultimate Spider-Man run in one go is probably one of the best comic experiences of my life.

Peter Parker starts out 15 years old, much younger than in the regular universe, and he actually grows and matures as time goes. He has a 150+ comic character arc! It's amazing. Not only that, he accumulates a lot of scars and baggage, causing him to lash out sometimes, to act erratically, to have PTSD-like symptoms even, just like you would expect a crime fighting teenager to have.

The secondary characters are also very well executed, particularly Mary Jane, Aunt May, Gwen Stacy, and Kitty Pride.

A *lot* of the characterization and setting from Amazing Spider-Man 1 & 2 and Spider-man homecoming comes from the Ultimate Spider-man run.

The entire run is(in order):

- Ultimate Spider-Man #1 - 46
- Ultimate Six #1-7
- Ultimate Spider-Man #47-133
- Ultimatum: Spider-Man Requiem #1-2\\
- Ultimate Spider-Man (Vol. 2) #1-15
- Ultimate Spider-Man #150-160 (yes, it reverts to the original numbering)
- Ultimate Comics Fallout #1-6.

**** Definitely seconding this one. Ultimate Spider-Man manages to really have an ensemble cast by the end of the series, and has a fascinating larger mystery arc without losing the street-level story. It manages to have the events at Peter's high school actually weave well into the story.
