Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** This is a question that probably goes into this thread. It is regarding the ethics of a hypothetical universe. Please tell me if this should not go into this thread. Let's say a universe has a form of vampires. These vampires must kill one person a month to survive. Does that mean that it is always ethical to kill them? If they do not kill people but instead keep a number of people in a permanent trance like state where they need to be looked after how does this change things. If you have a boy snatcher how kills one person every 80 years how does that change things. If someone kills slowly enough does it affect things. After all if you can gain 120 years of life from killing someone who has 60 years left to live then this is a net positive even assuming you are a neutral person who kills a neutral positive. If you are in a fantasy world with races that have to kill to survive, what ethical standing do you give them. What if they eat only criminals. What about the second scenario where it merely puts someone in a perpetual trance. Is that any better, should people be allowed to volunteer. What about a race that has to kill someone to breed, for instance one which must lay eggs in a living sentient host. What morality applies to races who are not necessary evil but must be monsters.

*** My partner once joked that cats, as obligate carnivores, are "moral abominations" because their very existence requires the death of other animals on a regular basis. He states that from a moral point of view it's better for housecats to go extinct (through either universal sterilisation so they're all dead within 20 years, or if you want to be quick about it, mandatory humane euthenasia).

I'd view races in this fantasy world who had to live in the way vampires do similarly, in that it's unethical for them to live. Something like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Human_Extinction_Movement][voluntary human extinction movement]] for vampires or body snatchers might be a good idea, otherwise keeping the human population huge and the vampire population small and the vampires eating humans who are either condemned to capital punishment (itself unethical IMO), or eating terminally ill humans / suicidal humans / humans who are over some very advanced age would be the most ethical ways to handle it.

Realistically though a vampire eating one human a month is basically the same as a human with the standard American diet in terms of "lesser" animals they're killing (depending on the intelligence/status/etc of humans vs vampires), but unlike humans vampires don't seem to have the option to go vegetarian (they can't even have "just a sip" of a human and keep her alive otherwise?).

Another ethical concern is the potential loss of "vampire culture" - if I was the czar of this world I'd require vampires, if they would eventually die of old age, to go for voluntary extinction and feed them the candidates I outlined before. I would also require them to "adopt" human babies and raise them in vampire culture and we'd end up with a "caste" of vamp-humans who would continue vampire books, poetry, and whatever other cultural stuff they have going for them. But that's because I value having a variety of cultures. If vampires don't die of old age then I'd have them killed in 50 years but require them to raise children in the same way before that. But both of these would require buy-in from the vampires so who knows =/

In the end, "is it always ethical to kill them" is a very hard question to answer because it entirely depends on the ethical system. I know in Catholic beliefs it is not moral to kill one of your vampires as you need the law of double effect / people are an end in themselves rather than a means to an end - so you can't kill a vampire who is attacking another person because your intention is to kill the vampire. Or to put it another way, in the trolley problem you can switch the tracks but you can't push the fat man. In utilitarianism it's ethical to kill vampires. Kantian probably not - because what's stopping a Centaur killing you for all that horse meat you eat? Virtue ethics probably not - a virtuous person doesn't kill. Etc...

*** Month-to-month vampires seem comparable to people wearing enemy uniforms during a war. Killing them isn't always ethical. There are narrow exceptions where they're not a threat. But you'd start from a presumption that those exceptions don't apply, and the vampire is an active threat.

Past that, the vampires aren't an immediate threat to me. There are real-world humans who pollute in ways that slowly increase the chances of statistical death. We (hopefully) treat them like criminals and handle them through the justice system.

It might be worth splitting out morals ("how much do we like various outcomes?") and ethics ("what rules does society create to get good outcomes?"). Philosophers can make moral arguments about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem#Transplant][killing people to save lives]]. But, in practice, there are [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_humans/][good reasons]] to not trust individual people to make those decisions.

**** In defence of the philosophers, in this situation, the vampires very existence means that they have killed and that they will kill. A murderer can repent but a vampire cannot. And it's not like there is room for ambiguity. They must directly kill one person per month, no loopholes or exceptions. And even if the justice system did get involved in this case, the only possible verdict is guilty as it is a fact that they are a vampire and that vampires must feed. Their species is ironclad evidence of their guilt. The only possible sentence is death as there is no way to leave them alive for imprisonment that does not lead to a death every month. They can feel guilty, and you have to admit in a lot of cases this is not very fair such as forcibly turned individuals but I cannot see any other options. On a related note what do you think about werewolves. They go insane every month and try to kill people. Should they be held accountable for deaths in their transformed state. One example is Remus Lupin from Harry Potter. They receive a lot of sympathy due to losing their job as defence against the dark arts due to being a werewolf, but look at it from another angle. Let's say your child goes to a school with a teacher with a dangerous disease. They suffer psychotic fits every month, as predictable as the moon in the sky literally, and have done for most of their life. It's not like they are blindsided. They could find a list of every single full moon for the rest of their life the month they are infected. They are no danger as long as they take the medicine and get away from people. Then one month they forget, almost kill a child. No matter the circumstances you would justifiably demand they be fired. Wizarding Britain's rules aren't sensible but letting them live free is madness. While they don't have to be killed if a werewolf forgets the protocol even once I can see good reason to assign a handler and if it happens more they probably should be locked up. Arguing for equality is all very well and good in our world but these people objectively need special rules.

A country might justify a vampire soldier. Texas executes about a person a month. And California has around 5000 people sentenced to life without parole. Alternately, Canada could have a custom where vampires feed on the terminally ill.

If I found myself in the Buffy-verse, I wouldn't assume that any of these exceptions applied to any given vampire. But, they could create a moral grey area if I knew that a specific vampire was making an effort.

In a world with Werewolves, accidental deaths are negligent homicides. You'd charge the Werewolf with involuntary manslaughter. This is similar to the charge we'd use if a railway conductor decided not to maintain the brakes on their train.

The common-law elements are:

1. Person was killed as a result of defendant's actions.
2. The defendant's actions were inherently dangerous, or done with disregard for others' safety.
3. Defendant knew, or should have known about the danger.

Interestingly, Remus Lupin wouldn't be guilty for the assault against Snape. Remus took reasonable precautions. We'd probably press charges against Sirius Black, who maliciously circumvented those precautions.

And I'm not sure you'd need much in the way of legal restrictions beyond this. People are allowed to own tigers and cannons. We just say that you're responsible for any damages that result. Being a werewolf seems similar.

****** You've made some good points regarding the morality of werewolves. Thank you. It's actually really interesting to consider how these sort of magical creatures with racial abilities and requirements would affect law and morality. For example it seems reasonable to have a law against mind control and to not hold actions committed under such effects against a person but against the mind controller. But what about a succubus with a permanent lust aura akin Glory girl from Worm. Should she be locked up because she literally cannot turn it off. Should any time she has sex be considered rape. And how strong is it? Because if it's weak enough then a person probably should still be charged. After all, otherwise you could always walk from raping a succubus. And if succubus's need sex then should a underage one be permitted to have sex? So they should probably be considered exceptions to underage sex laws. And if the Government decides to create a welfare program to feed the starving then what should be done regarding such creatures. Some would be difficult to feed such as a abandoned emotivore. Should the government even try. Should I be allowed to discriminate on the basis of such racial ability? Can I hire succubus to be sex workers preferentially? If a race is stronger should they be allowed in professional sports? What if it's not magical but the race merely puts on muscle much faster than any human could? If a race is inherently more violent or smarter? Can I consider that? What if a race is always born psychopaths? And if a creature can turn a human and the human consents, should they be allowed? I can totally see someone agreeing to be turned because those races tend to get cool seeming powers then realizing that it's not enough to make up for the downsides. And it's not something that you can undo. I could easily see a person agreeing to become a werewolf or something because their lover is one and then breaking up. Wanting to be a vampire to be with their lover is literally the entire plot of twilight. All of these things would need to be considered before our kind could integrate in soci... I mean before you could write a story involving these creatures being a part of society

****** Yeah, I don't get why a Classic Werewolf wouldn't just... confine themselves into a cage during the full moon period, and not have a key available. Make it a silver cage if you want to be extra special careful.

******* I can see a number of reasons. 1) Cages are expensive, especially silver ones and werewolves don't tend to be well off 2) Werewolves are often considered very strong, so it is possible they could either break or throw the cage. This would mean the cage would need to be reinforced, raising the cost 3) A silver cage would leave them with scarring, likely permanent. This is assuming they don't shy away from the silver which is likely. 4) If the key is not available then this requires that the werewolf confide in someone who's willing to bring them the key. 5) If the key is in the cage on the basis that the wolf can't use it, then the question becomes how smart is the wolf. They are normally considered violent, but that is not the same as stupid. It is reasonable that they might be able to recognise the key and make and attempt at using it. In fact if they are smart enough they might be able to repeatedly attack points on a iron cage to weaken it or override their hatred of silver to break such a cage. 6)This is not necessary true but I always thought it might be interesting to claim werewolves are the archetype of the predator and need to roam and hunt. In this case the werewolf would steadily grow sick.

******** Solution to #5: encase the key in a large enough block of ice that you have to wait 3 days (or whatever) for it to melt. (okay, smart wolf could probably scratch it to bits....)

Actually can someone post the "you're a werewolf. You can predict your transformations, but when you transform you only want to cause mayhem and you are smart enough to operate key pads, try and destroy cages, etc. How do you... not do that" on the munchkinry thread? I'd love to see people take it on.

FWIW I don't think cages are THAT expensive if it's a priority for you, and given the consequences it should be. Many people own cars, and I don't think a cage would cost much more than a decent second hand car (order of $5,000).

Forget a key lock: a timed electronic lock like a bank safe that will only open after 72 hours would probably solve the problem....

********* The problem is that if the wolf form is smart enough , it could cage you (whith a supply of food and water) to prevent you from trying this . It would be riskier for it to do so than for you but if it's the only way of cause mayhem and it wants it enough it could do it.

Hmmm.

Well, it is very clearly /not/ ethical to allow them to just feed indiscriminately. And if they do feed, then I'd recommend that the ethical course of action would be for them to face the full legal penalties for murder. (If they take on a job as executioner and feed only on sentenced-to-death prisoners, then there might not be any legal penalty - though this leads to ugly questions about how ethical it is to ensure at least one person gets sentenced to death every month).

At the same time, though, I don't think it is necessarily ethical to go hunting them down and killing them, absent legal authority - on the grounds that, without proof of murders, you can't be sure that they aren't (say) subsisting by purchasing and killing cows (or monkeys, if they need primates specifically); and if you /do/ have proof, then this proof should be taken to the relevant legal authorities.

It doesn't really matter how long it is between murders, or whether or not the vampire can get more years of life than he takes; if he gains a hundred years by murdering someone who had one year left, he's still a murderer.

**** I wish to clarify a point you appear to have misunderstood about the question. They must feed on humans. If you wish a scientific explanation you could claim it is due to them needing very fresh human blood. However it is more likely that there is a magical explanation. It is not particularly difficult to imagine a self consistent magical system that placed value on human blood. The fact of their existence is evidence of them feeding on human lives. I'm basically asking for a story I was thinking of writing where creatures that were once human such as this exist and the protagonist is a rationalist who uses their self reflection to not only defeat the monsters but to debate moral quandaries such as the ones presented above. It might be a while till I write though as I have no writing experience and I wish to consider the types of monsters carefully. So don't wait for it. I have a lot of ideas of horrific circumstances I can put the hero in such as forcing them to kill a little girl begging for mercy and exposing them to lots of mental influence when the reason they became a rationalist is because they wished to have their mind in their control

No problem with that - from a Doylist viewpoint, i.e. from outside the narrative, this is a constraint that the monsters /must/ follow, and a known constraint.

But from a Watsonian point of view it's a little different. Sure, the vampires /do/ kill a human every month, and maybe the very learned wizard over there tells me that they have to or they will die - but I, as an ordinary person without significant education in the minutae of magic, I can't be certain of that, and I must consider my own uncertainty when contemplating ethical conundrums. After all, the wizard /also/ told me that the Sun is millions of times bigger than the Moon, which is clearly ludicrous, because then how can the Sun hide behind the Moon in an eclipse?

...I am kind of assuming that in-story characters do not, generally, have the benefit of a modern understanding of astronomy at the end there.
