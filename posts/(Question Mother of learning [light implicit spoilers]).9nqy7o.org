Has anyone wondered who other than red robe might have damaged Zach? this was sparked by the previous question about mother of learning, I got to wondering whether there is any evidence for Spear of Resolve attacking Zach and altering his mind.


** What motive would the matriarch have for altering his mind? If she's past his mental defenses, she knows why he's looping and how the month ends if he fails. She'd be dooming the real her and her web to destruction.

But I agree that it might not be Red Robe; I think Panaxeth might have done it. When they assaulted the cultists at the Hole, each of the seven had mind-control-blocking spells up, and Zorian later speculated that it was to block Panaxeth from messing with their minds.

*** So Zach, in his typical "die killing a dragon until you succeed" way, assaults the cultists when they're attempting the summoning. He's there when Panaxeth is loosed, and gets his mind messed with.

It makes sense, but it seems like Panaxeth would have created a better mental compulsion. Unless Zach was in the process of activating his suicide switch, so it had to be rushed? Otherwise, how did Panaxeth getting write-access to the controller's brain not result in an instant & total victory?

*** I found her compelling even though she was planning on betraying Zorian, perhaps she was influencing Zach in order to use him as a tool across loops.

I really hope Zorian finally mans up and invades Zach's mind tomorrow. I don't even think it's ethical to let your mind controlled/brain damaged friend tell you not to help him when his reasoning is damaged, beyond the fact that Zorian is letting his concerns over this course of action imperil a stunningly large number of lives + souls.

I could imagine him entering Zach's mind to find a shadow of Spear of Resolve, or evidence of her handiwork, twisting Zach away from full cooperation with Zach.

Weak evidence in favour of this would be slight personality changes in Zach pre and post Zorian's interaction with the aranea, which I think there is a case for. Maybe Zach matured between Zorian's first loop and their later partnership, but I'm skeptical.

also, Spear of Resolve clearly figured out many secrets about the loop like a decade before Zorian did. Like, how did she know that only one could win? Because she plucked it from Zach's head. The only other source of knowledge might have been the Ghost Serpent, but that seems off to me.

Why does that seem to off to you? It's the source she explicitly gives in her memory packet.

**** I don't think Zorian will enter Zach's mind due to the extreme risk. Doing so would anger and alienate his only friend and ally in the bubble realm, who is also an incredibly potent mage, and more importantly, is the controller of the realm.

It's entirely plausible that doing so would trigger a reset, wiping the memories of all their other allies.

Don't get me wrong. I'm a big subscriber to the belief that something to do with Zach's missing memories /will/ be back to bite Zorian, and very likely Zach as well. Before looking into this, though, Zorian needs much higher apparent stakes, or else a way to effectively mitigate that risk.

** It's possible, and not entirely out of character, though I feel like she wouldn't have done anything too drastic simply because she doesn't understand the loops' system and wouldn't want to effect it too much.

My prefered theory is that Zach befriended Veyers early in the loops, together they eventually beat up or somehow tricked QI out of his crown, experimenting, Zach gave Veyers a marke. In the next loops Veyers learns of his limited lifespan and wanted more, so he turned on Zach and sided with QI who after some persuasion and trial was able to break the marker in such a way as to make it permanent, then Veyers learns mind magic from QI until he could sufficiently fuck with Zach's head, which he did though poorly, this made Zach's memory of the early restarts vague and removed all knowledge of Veyers from his memory, as opposed to just the knowledge of him in the loop which Zorian could do easily.

#+end_quote

Question: Why does QI not want in? Unless his deal required being able to condition red-robe in order to ensure red-robe fulfilled the outside-the-loop part of the deal.

Still, QI has every reason to want to know about the loop, and IIRC when QI first met Zach/Zorian (the incident which brought Zorian into the loop), he didn't realise that Zach was "immortal" until Zach blabbed, and /then/ QI changed tack.

So, QI would have been willing to not be given knowledge of the loop, for some reason, yet still get something out of it post-loop somehow. /Or/ be tricked into meddling with RR's soul to mess with the marker, without recognising the marker's purpose (which seems extremely unlikely).

All in all, it doesn't add up.

**** It's distinctly possible QI can't be brought into the loop without access to his phylactory, and the chances of him showing it to anyone no matter the circumstances are slim to say the least.

The idea that QI makes a forced compliance of the deal in RR soul is also plausible. I never said that QI never learners of the loop, just that he wasn't added with a temp marker, only the controller can use the artifacts, and Zorian cause he is a fake controller.

It's also possible that Veyers marker was broken by QI by accident, perhaps after they 'beat' him and Veyers got the marker they tried again I'm order to get the crown and add other, but they failed and QI tried to fuckup Veyers soul, Zach killed himself to reset and interrupted, thus leaving Veyers with a bugged temp marker, after that Veyers just did what Z&Z did to learn enough soul and mind magic to fuck with Zach.

If QI knows he's in the loop, he blows himself up rather than permit a hostile looper to gain from him.

If he knows about the loop (which would be a prerequisite to getting a marker, since soulfuckery is serious business), then he'd have no qualms about risking his philactery, for the same reason he's willing to blow himself up.

** Another option: cranium rats.

Perhaps they didn't do the damage themselves, but they could have flagged Zach for QI, who has some mind magic ability.

*** I'm predisposed to that theory because it seems like it adds interesting depth, whereas saying that red robe was a temporary looper who hacked the system and gamed Zach seems washed out at this point. I realize it's problematic to complain about repetition in a time loop story, so I'm not sure if that instinct is remotely valuable.
