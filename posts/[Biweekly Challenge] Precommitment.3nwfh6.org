[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3m4s4n/biweekly_challenge_dangerously_genre_savvy/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Dangerously Genre Savvy". [[/u/ZeroNihilist]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3m4s4n/biweekly_challenge_dangerously_genre_savvy/cvcl2vv]["From Earth Prime With Love"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair.

The next challenge will be *"Precommitment"*. In the classic game theory sense, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precommitment][precommitment]] means that in a game of chicken, you throw your steering wheel out the window so that there's no element of choice involved and any rational actor will know that you're incapable of changing your mind. In essence, it's a strategy of removing options in order to strengthen a position in a conflict. This is one of the more rationalist concepts we've had for a challenge; I'm curious to see how it does. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, October 21st.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

*** I don't understand why they can't charge a fee then use that fee to refund those who don't get it.

Only in a very minute amount of time lines will the refund cause their firm to go bankrupt right?

The profit model is wait twenty years send back 99% of what was requested and keep the rest right? Since they could stay liquid just using the fees of new clients to pay off old clients because they won't have any other liquid demands until twenty years later or whenever the first time travel back is due.

Also how you gonna trust that business when you have no verification they did send anything back and have no incentive not to rip everyone off

**** Timelines are causal. In other words, timeline one causes timeline two.

For the scheme to work, the company has to survive the first timeline in order to spawn the second timeline. Unfortunately, if the company is giving refunds, the first timeline is the one that they're going to go bankrupt in, and then there's no second timeline. So it's not a minute amount of timelines go bankrupt, it's 100% of the timelines.

The reason you'd trust the business is that they've got a track record, one that was presumably hard-won in other timelines. That, or some kind of transparency and/or oversight.

Under this model of time travel, the originating timeline never experiences any travel from the future, only travel to the past.

If what you're saying is true people could just replicate this by storing their own money in a bank or safety deposit box or some other fixed access thing, and wait twenty years and send things back in time themselves. No one would pay a company for the massive risk they don't do something.

******** The service that they offer is precommitment (which was this week's theme and the point of the story).

#+begin_quote
  You might make a commitment to do it, but after you saw that the electronics hadn't arrived in the warehouse, you'd break that commitment. Or maybe you'd do what some other people do, which is to say â€˜Well, alright, I'm going to just send it next Sunday, not today', but when they don't get a shipment from the future on Sunday, they push it back again, and never end up going through with it. So that's why we exist. We don't have a stake, so we just do whatever we were told to do. You make a commitment that you can't unmake.
#+end_quote

This is (by implication) a world in which time travel has already been demonstrated a number of times, meaning that it's timeline #432454990 instead of timeline #1. This business probably couldn't exist without prior instances of time travel, but it still has to survive its own subjective first timeline.

********* Right, but there's absolute zero reason for the pre-commitment company to be the same company that does your time travel. Because if you hold the money for 20 years then you'll have it.

You can precommit using fixed bonds or tons of other relatively non-liquid assets.

Also why would anyone even do this? It's not like the other one where you net gain to all universe versions of you. You create another version of you by sending something to them (if it's causal timelines) and then lose your own wealth for their gain minus the fee.

Maintaining control of the money means that there's no precommitment on your part, only commitment.

While it's not a net gain for all versions of you, it's a net gain for the average version of you, which is why you'd do it. The reason that you have to do it via precommitment using a third party is that you would logically back out if you knew that you weren't going to be the beneficiary, which is what the guy tries to do in the story. Precommitment is used in order to completely eliminate the possibility of doing otherwise.

How? The average version of you only exists because you're doing this if you're talking about causal universes.

The average you is better when you keep all the money 1000/1 = 1000 because less of you exist.

*** Hyuuga are hardcore.

Would a version of the Hyuuga that didn't have a "main family" function better? The main family strikes me as such a security hole. If everyone were sealed and their lineage and governance was like any other clan (Not that canon ever elaborates on clan governance), with their brainwashing Hyuuga-worship, it seems like it would be much stronger.

**** Actually, I've only just created an account, so I don't have much experience with how the reddit infrastructure works. I've enjoyed reading [[/r/rational]] fiction for a while now, and been regretful that I couldn't see a way to make comments without registering, but it was today that I first read through the Biweekly Challenge runners-up, started musing about what I would/could write for Precommitment, had an idea, wanted to write down the idea, wrote down the idea and created an account so I could post it.

(Do you need to post to vote?) --Looking at [[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/voting]] , voting should instead be the grey arrows to the left of the comments (I think), in which case what prompted your question?

(Hmm, only one day left until voting ends in any case, so I'm very late for this. Nevertheless, I'm happy that it has a chance to be read by others (rather than stewing in this head eternally without exiting).)

*** There's something interesting going on in the background there, and I'm not sure what...

Is the casino cheating, somehow for some reason? Double-sided coins are mentioned. Is there a mob involved, probably running the casino, and maybe they're double-crossing the guy with the brain box? Then I start to wonder, "to what end?" What's the significance of the on-screen box going red? Presumably a loss.

***** I disagree that they wouldn't take that risk. The guy is basically paying more for the casino than it is worth (all casino games are house favoured), only one casino does badly Al other casinos do better.

The casinos owners don't care about the business in the same way a person cares about their liveliness.

The casino as a multi universe company is profiting from this and would do well to encourage all customers to give all their money on a 1/slightly more than casino is worth odds.

Edit: actually what would happen would be special consolidation entities where you pay a fee (your wealth) for a chance of getting money. If you lose you kill yourself so you're happy, and the net value for the business is positive due to the fee.

****** I was imagining that the casino owner didn't care about the other universes beyond his own reality (as well as having no interest in fairness); even if you don't care about a casino as much as your own life, if you've been living without thinking or caring about other universes you're not going to be happy about being suddenly driven into debt even if you're assured that practically all other yous are still well off--if all it takes is a casual word to get the whole thing derailed for certain and make sure you haven't lost anything significant by the next day, that casual word (that others aren't going to know about) is going to start looking pretty tempting. If there are casino owners which have several casinos or several liquid funds then they could just pay the debt with that instead of with the casino, so in that situation we can imagine that the gambler would have planned to continue the doubling until they were forced to give a casino to cover the debt. If you're still unsatisfied about the psychological aspect, you can rewrite your head-canon for the gambler to be aiming for a debt harder to accept, in order to maintain the theme of the gambler 'trying to bite off more than he can chew' (looking at a fair many-worlds perspective and missing the unscrupulous self-protecting perspective of the single-universe person versions he's effectively picking a fight with). --Ah, and I just remembered another thing: in addition to that the casino owner doesn't think of himself as gaining anything even if parallel versions of himself gain money, keep in mind that, though the gambler is convinced of there being many worlds, the casino owner probably doesn't know (or care) whether there are actually multiple worlds or whether the gambler is just being incredibly lucky.
