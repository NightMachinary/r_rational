Hi all, I quite like the premise behind [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evil-god-average/]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/]] Is there a name for this genre, and do you know of any other similar stories? Cheers,


** Skimming through the first chapter of Snake Report it looked like a "transported to an RPG world as a weak snake then starts getting stronger" sort of story. If you're looking for more of that than Kumo desu ga, nani ka? (I'm A Spider, So What?) is literally that but as a spider instead of a snake.

Translation quality and how far along it is varies a bit.

I've also been enjoying another "transported to RPG world" story called The Wandering Inn, where the protagonist ends up taking the Innkeeper class and starts trying to just get by.

**** There are two translations of that story. One is either mostly or completely done being translated, but the quality of the translation isn't great. The other is by blastron and is incomplete, but the quality is much better.

Here is the link to blastron's translation: [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents]]

*** I have read the manga "Kumo desu ga, nani ka" and now the Snake Report.

Imho the Snake report copies brutaly Kumo desu ga at first but get much more interesting much faster.

** Wuxia/xianxia (chinese martial arts/chinese high fantasy)/litRPG (setting is a game world or game-like fantasy world/) and maybe also isekai (portal fantasy). (I haven't acutally looked at your link, I can tell just from the website name,). Do note that [[/r/rational]] as a whole isn't really a fan of these genres, although you will find some overlap. Try royalroadl for western-written xianxia, isekai, and litRPGs.

Mother of Learning/A Hero's War are the fics posted here that have the most overlap with those genres.

*** Do you have any recommendations for stuff similar to MoL & A Hero's War? I really like both of those, but they're not updating atm, and I want to get my fix. :P

**** MoL is a member of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop][groundhog's day loop]] subgenre. Check out [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu][Re:Zero]], [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi][ERASED]] (AKA boku dake ga Inai Mache), and [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/][Edge of Tommorrow]] (also known as "All you need is kill") for non-fanfic examples. Also check out the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue][peggy sue]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][groundhog peggy sue]] pages for when the time loop is on a significantly larger scale. For some reason I can't find a whole lot of non-fanfic examples (I've probably just forgotten stuff I read a long time ago) but there are /oodles/ of fanfic with that premise.

Are you willing to read MLP:FiM fanfiction? I have a bunch of excellent completed fics to recommend for groundhog's day loops. If you like naruto, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] and Chuunin exam day of the top of my head for loops, though they come with caveats: Time Braid is rather overty sexual, and Chuunin exam day is pure tripe written by an author I hate (so I only mention it because of its popularity.) Naruto also has incredibly amounts of peggy sue fics, but they tend to be either fairly blatant wish fulfilment or incomplete. I know for a fact that harry potter has tons of both peggy sue and time loop fics, but I don't really read that fandom much. Worm has a bunch of peggy sue fics, but they're all (or almost all) incomplete.

--------------

On the other hand, Hero's War is an "uplift" fic. The only non-fanfic example I can think of off the top of my head is [[https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GASFDA/ref=series_rw_dp_sw][Light on Shattered Water]] which I'm about halfway through. Aside from that, check [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/][spacebattles]] for ASOIAF SIs: they almost all tend to be of this variety. Again, I also have a bunch of MLP:FiM fics with similar premises.

For sort-of-similar works, check out [[http://archives.erfworld.com/Book%201/1][Erfworld]] and [[https://smile.amazon.com/Two-Year-Emperor-Deor-War-ebook/dp/B011DQOT74?sa-no-redirect=1][Two Year Emperor]] for modern-person-gets-put-in-charge-of-fantasy-land fiction.

Spacebattles really likes both of these kinds of fics, so you may have more luck posting a thread there.

****** So I had a massive writeup with links and wordcounts and everything, but then chrome ate too much of my RAM and crashed. feelsbadman.jpg.

I've added an ampersand after the very bet works.

Here's a mostly unordered list:

Time loops:

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]] (has two complete non-looping sequels.) COMPLETE *&*
- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]] (AU with multiple loopers (and vector clocks ([[https://github.com/RampantArcana/Hard-Reset-2-Helper][and it's own github page to keep track of everything]]))). DEAD *&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&* (seriously just read this one, even though it's dead)
- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever][The Best Night Ever]] (has one incomplete non-looping sequel.) COMPLETE *&*

As for Uplift fics, the general consensus seems to be that ponies are somewhere around the industrial revolution already, so the equivalent isn't as blatant as in a Hero's War and ASOIAF fics. (Incidentally, the general consensus is wrong: ponies have cathode ray computers and video games, but whatever. Less advanced ponies make for better stories.) As a result, mostly I actually have first contact fics with more advanced humans. I think I had some more blatant uplift fics, but then unfollowed them because they got too blatantly wish-fullfilment-y for me.

**** If you like ASOIAF, there is one called Purple Days. I'm enjoying it so far. Joffrey is the looper, which starts out exactly as horrifying as you'd expect. It gets steadily more interesting from there and the character (somehow) ends up likeable.

Really liked it, just the kind of Isekai story I was looking for lately. Thanks.

** Really, there's lots of stories that do things that resemble one or both of those. My recommendation would just be using novelupdates' tag and recommendation systems to explore other stories. There's lots of interesting stuff out there, especially if you don't hate Chinese novels as much as I do.
