** I'm up to chapter 7. The link for chapter 8 (Strike A Blow For King And Country) on the index page goes to chapter 9 (titled the same though), and it looks like I missed chapter 8. Things That Go Boom In The Night isn't on the index page, but comes up as chapter 10.

Just thought you might like to know.

Edit: Some poking around and I find the real chapter 8 [[http://dreamtime.logic11.com/index.php/2016/06/24/462/][here]], which I'm linking in case anyone is in the same boat I am.

*** Yeah, mistakes were made... ;-)

Trying to get the index sorted right now. I was numbering the chapters and I screwed up. My bad.
