*** me too. considering the original books, he's probably going to be the antagonist. Harry defeated Voldemort with an obliviate. What's Lockhart's favorite spell, again?

Maybe Lockhart will realize that Harry is a copy of Tom Riddle or something. It's too early to really make a reliable prediction. But wouldn't it be interesting if Harry gets lured down to the Chamber of Secrets by Lockhart in an attempt to expose him as the heir of Slytherin, and Ginny has to go save him? Maybe Lockhart will make the basilisk into an inferius or something. And students who the inferius basilisk looks at get petrified instead of killed because the basilisk isn't alive anymore.

******** Oh it was weird alright. It started with Harry dealing with actual PTSD and antisocial behavioral disorder from his time with the Dursleys, combined with independent experimentation of wandless magic before he got his letter. His approach to beating Voldemort is much more pragmatic, involving transfigured sniper rifles and grenades and such. Cool premise, right?

Then it ended with Harry's mom being resurrected through the Philosopher's Stone + his blood to kill Voldemort after he gets his new body. Harry becomes somewhat crippled (nerve damage from extended Crucio) and goes to America to live with Lilly, who's apparently into religion in a big way. A whole sequel story was written that I skimmed, where apparently the factions from the game Command & Conquer show up and for some reason the magical world has to help GDI beat NOD, all the while Harry learns to accept God's grace.

Like I said, started promising, ended up in a very strange place. The whole thing reminded me strongly of Orson Scott Card descent into ideological extremism. I ended up chatting with the writer via private messages for a bit, and they turned out to be fairly intelligent but a staunch Young Earth Creationist that ultimately said that when confronted with evidence against his faith, he had to side with his faith.

So yeah. I was a bit concerned with it showing up in this fan-fanfic. Religion is so rarely handled well in regular fiction, putting it in fanfic, let alone rationalist fanfic, can very quickly drive things off the rails.

They do celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts, don't they? Trees and everything. (And they say "Christmas", not just "holidays.") I always assumed when reading canon that that was a subtle statement that wizards live in pretty much the same historical-cultural meme-plex as muggles. (Well, it might have diverged somewhere in the last few hundred years---maybe since Salem---but most religions are older-enough than that for wizards to think of them as culturally "theirs" inasmuch as muggles do.)

**** That's a fair point, but this fic is derived from HPMOR, no canon. I assumed that celebration of holidays were a sort of hangover from the muggle world. At the very least, no one in HPMOR discusses religion except to say that it's comforting lies and not held seriously by anyone of importance. No one is seen expressing a concern over what God thinks.

I can get behind the fact that this author has a divergent point and can write whatever they want, but it seems to really jar with the spirit of its predecessor.

***** Alternate explanation: /smart people of academic raising/ (like Draco, Voldemort, Snape, and even Dumbledore) are very commonly atheists in magical Britain. The meme is still around, perhaps even with a majority of salt-of-the-earth wizards, but the kind of people who send their children to a magical boarding school (wizard Harvard) instead of, say, homeschooling them, are the kind of people who "know better than to believe in silly superstitions like that." Meanwhile, people-who-grow-up-reading-books (like Harry and Hermione) are very commonly contrarians (and therefore atheists, for one thing) no matter where they're found. Together, that's every character whose opinion we cared about in HPMOR.

Whereas the Weasleys are the kind of people I'd expect to cling to faith (if just for the "community experience" of churchgoing), even in a culture where most people are atheists.

That he thinks it's a legitimate tactic is reasonable. admitting it is somewhat less so, but if Lockhart is a Slytherin I can even see that working out in his favor.

Less reasonable is the cloaking, at this point is be very surprised if both Harry and Hermy can't cast good protegos, or go with my personal reaction, and get everyone to spam ma-ha-su as fast as possible.

That was pretty much the most jarring thing; whereas the dragon weakpoint thing was cool and the idea of lethifolds being baby dementors seemed reasonable, totally redefining what a Nundu is really doesn't work for me.

Maybe make up a new magical creature name? Nundu doesn't even sound particularly entropaic or deathly.

*** Wizards are religious? They believe in an afterlife (both for canon and hpmor). They celebrate the same holidays (though I suppose that could be muggle influence). There's clearly something at least nominally religious going on even if canon never brought it up.

Going off Merlin, we can assume Wizard culture gradually split off from Muggles during or after King Arthurs time and gradually became more insular, which means they should show signs of roots that are somewhere between pagan and Christian - as they, in fact, do. (Yule ball, etc).

See [[http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/16058/are-there-practiced-religions-in-the-wizarding-world][here]] for a good discussion--it seems more accurate to say wizards in canon are as religious as the UK in general in the 1990s (that is to say, not very).

In HPMOR, on the other hand, wizards are at least much less religious, if not totally areligious, and explicitly not Christian. (See e.g. Minerva's mention of "Muggle religion" in Ch. 61).

***** Ah, I just interpreted that as disdain. Obviously, Wizards would grow to somewhat dislike "Muggle religion" which they associated with witch burning. "Muggle religion" the same way we laugh at primitive people who don't allow us to take pictures for fear it will steal their soul, or worship cargo cults, etc.

There is a sense that they're areligious - There's no obvious theology mentioned and also they don't seem to have religious rituals. But then again they have /actual magic/. They /live/ in a world of real, actual magic and rituals. Why would they feel the need to make them up? The psychological need for ritual to make sense of things would be fulfilled by living in that reality.

Yeah, I suspect the real reason is that Rowling wrote them in her own image and her own culture - instinctively spiritual with respect big beliefs about souls and afterlives but not publicly religious, with a few kooks who believe in tea reading hanging around the peripheries. And I'm guessing she drew more from Wicca and stage magic than actual pre-Christian practices in designing world mechanics.
