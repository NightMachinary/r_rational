** The day fails to improve (except for the commuters in Rome.)

*** This seems bad for Flicker's emotional state.

**** Indeed. "Push until you are near your limit, then stop," has some relevant failure modes...

*** Making the day better for commuters is a vastly underappreciated utilitarian move. Best indications are that reducing a commute from 1hr to 0 is worth 40% of a salary, in terms of life satisfaction. That beats pretty much every intervention besides curing chronic pain and escaping unhappy relationships.

** I always enjoy the sections that focus on Flicker being awesome, so this is right up my alley.

It's nice to see that Hermes can learn...I wonder, would he have gotten the message if she had said to him "Look, the next time you cause trouble we're going to do this again, but next time I'm not going to bother being so careful and you're going to end up a lot more injured. The time after /that/, I'm just going to rip you in half. If you get summoned or otherwise end up outside the Box, don't cause trouble. Okay?"

*** Flicker tried almost exactly that once before, and it didn't turn out well. The context is given in the second scene in Chapter 3 of Skybreaker's Call (thought her age is now wrong--it should be 15), and that incident is the one referred to in the "Then things got messy" paragraph of Princess, part 2. Mr. Uncatchable was the "recently revealed death".
