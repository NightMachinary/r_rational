** I think we know why nobody's ever killed a Stormbringer now. It's never expressly stated, but there's two points in this chapter that made me think "Ah, that's what it is".

My original theory was that the Stormbringers were overwhelmingly powerful. In Chapter 61, I theorised about Zapdos's capabilities: "Two dozen lightning rods and a layer of psychic shielding might hold back the lightning from destroying every last member of the defense in a single apocalyptic blast. A barrage of type-advantaged artillery attacks might send the Zapdos dodging back into the clouds for a few seconds."

Some of this happened, some of it didn't. One Elite trainer can actually keep the Zapdos busy for a considerable period of time, so couldn't all of them together, plus a few dozen League level trainers, actually kill one, if they fought together? That's when I realised...when Zapdos came down from the clouds, it didn't really DO anything. It didn't attack anyone until it was attacked first. This makes me think that the Stormbringers aren't actually intentionally aggressive...it's the Pressure they bring that causes all the destruction. That's why they need to be lured away from the city.

The other key line was this: "And their [Stormbringers] response when truly challenged, is always to retaliate with overwhelming force."

So the Stormbringers aren't trying to destroy anything. They're just travelling, and the Pressure does its thing. When the trainers attack Zapdos, they don't go all-out. (This is why Lorelei attacks it with one beam first, then three...not six.) Because if Zapdos is legitimately hurt at all, it kills people. Trainers, civilians, anything. Nobody knows for sure if they've ever seen, in history, the full extent of the Stormbringers' powers. And even if they could win this fight, half of Vermillion would get destroyed in the meantime.

So rather than commit all their best trainers to a fight that they might not win, with enormous collateral damage, people decided on the luring strategy instead. And they've kept it up ever since, even as technology has gotten better and better over time. Perhaps they could win right now if they went all-out. But it's far too dangerous to find out.

Man, I feel so bad for Seto. That constant guilt and self hate...

And Leaf. But I trust she will recover, as Aiko did.

I really like Karen's way of turning fear and Pressure to a motivating force. But it leads her into danger when she lets her desire for recognition overtake her senses. Is she a drug addict, addicted to Ether? She has a higher risk of addiction if her brother was a drug addict. And I hope she has a Surfer.

** I'm a little confused about where Karen ended up luring Zapdos. The Elites were leading it southwest straight out of the bay, they drifted a bit too south towards Fuchsia, so Karen was trying to course correct... south again? Anyway after she's downed, which cardinal direction is Zapdos heading now, and is it vaguely hitting anything?

Good chapter. One thing I've liked about this fic is that it conveys a /very/ dangerous and scary world, but still keeps a sense of Pokemon Adventure^{TM} and doesn't devolve into complete "All pokemon are expendable murder tools that kill and maim each other horribly aaaahh" [[https://i.imgur.com/2Yni481.jpg][edginess]] it could very easily slip into.

*** Karen turned right first, when she and Zapdos was getting close of Fuschia, putting their direction west - the narrative suggested they weren't going to go straight over Fuschia, but it was still advisable to veer away to minimize setting off Pokemon rampages near the city. Then she turned south-west, then south proper. Then south-east, to avoid the Sevii islands, and then she was shot down.

*** Wait a second. Giovanni's whole point of doing the Mewtwo thing is that he wants to use it to kill the Stormbringers. The plan at the end of the chapter here were to drive Zapdos south, which Karen immediately recognizes will put it on course to hit Cinnabar Island. So maybe he intentionally set it on this path so that he can get Zapdos to come to Mewtwo.

** I'm now wondering how triage works in pokÃ©centers. The ticket system suggests it is first-come, first-serve. And of course, the stasis of pokÃ©balls means that there is no urgency to prioritise life-threatening cases. But when they are rushed, such as after a Tiered event, even the small medium of pokÃ©balls might push the center's storage capacity, and more to the point, lots of trainers will be out of their pokÃ©mon for longer. This is a risk to the city and surrounding area as defence will be underpowered when they are most vulnerable. An after-tier event or renegade attack would be devastating.

It seems to me that, since time is not a concern with regards to saving lives, but /is/ a concern for getting pokÃ©mon back to their trainers, it would make most sense to prioritise the treatment of injuries that are easiest, quickest and/or most straightforward to heal to ensure that the region is brought back up to readiness (or the closest they can get to it) as quickly as possible, and save the difficult cases for later during post-tiered event response. In short, the availability of pokÃ©ball storage technology perfectly inverts the rational triage protocol of human hospitals.

This would of course require a means to quickly assessing the condition of new in-patients.

** I remember there being someone who asked a few chapter discussions back why people haven't seriously tried to kill the Stormbringers before, when there's no reason to believe they're not living breathing creatures that can't die if it's hit decisively enough. Well, I guess here's the answer.

Preconditions of needing pokemon that can fly for a long enough time to contest it. What appears to be high-grade and permanent Light Screen and Flash. Both of which, I'm assuming, was caused by so much electricity running through its body you can't even get near it without hearing a physically discomforting buzz in the air. Thunder or Thunderbolt powered up enough to OHKO anything that doesn't resist and/or doesn't have pseudo-legendary defences. Even theoretically immune things like Flygon is affected by secondary effects - wonder if that mention of heat being hard to ignore was an indication of Burn status. And with Pressure on top of all this causing emotions to overshoot, of course.

Anything I missed? Or, conversely - anything else it could have that wasn't explicitly demonstrated this chapter? Since abilities don't have the exact same mechanics here as they do in the games, I've been contemplating if legendary Pokemon have /all/ the abilities they could potentially have in games, instead of just one. Lightning Rod would fit with how its attacks are so powerful, for example, since it seems to be running so much electricity through itself it totally could've powered up its Special Attack by dozens of stages - though I guess its power could also be chalked up to it being just that powerful. Alternatively, it might also have abilities that haven't been given to it in games but would be appropriate thematically - Volt Absorb, for example, would make it plain unfair if Zapdos just running electricity through itself is enough to let it heal. Ah, the speculation.

All this makes me wonder again, though, what exactly motivates the legendaries to get near human cities. Is it as simple as animal instincts and holding so much power it just has to move wherever its impulse takes it? But if so, what makes it stick to Kanto instead of moving west sometimes to Johto? (Though that's maybe a possibility that could've happened once or twice, so what makes it stick to that area instead of relocating to somewhere like Sinnoh, for example? Assuming Sinnoh is located relevant to Kanto how real-life Hokkaido is to real-life Kanto region.) Or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, is it some kind of intelligence that set it to clash with human culture? But if that's the case, what's the point of giving human society a metaphorical bloody nose every once in a while?

Other than that...Prof Oak's segment kinda made me reflect on myself. On one hand, I saw him as a supremely competent man, so seeing him so plainly screw up a job was surprising...but on the other, if I didn't have a direct line to his thoughts and was hearing a recording of that conversation, I totally would've thought he was just slapping those university presidents with the cold hard truth, wouldn't I. Though I guess it is pretty much both. And I guess there's still an opportunity for a mistake to turn into an advantage.

Thanks for the chapter.

"co-ordinate" I... think this might be the British spelling? I can't recall the last time I've seen this word with a dash in it.

"the Elites job is to stay fresh and ready" missing apostrophe.

"Because what is there to fear, really, from the perspective" I would switch the comma after "really" to a semicolon or something

"Zap Canon" should have three "n"s, occurs three times

  "With all due respect, you're on the review board for three different journals," Professor Elm says, adjusting his glasses. "How many papers have you personally looked over in the past year, out of all those that those papers published?"

  Osamu's face reddens. "Are you questioning my integrity?"

  "Not at all," Professor Oak quickly says. "I know you're a diligent and rigorous academic. But there isn't enough time in the day for you to be solely responsible for every paper in even one of those journals. And instead of hiring more reviewers, the names of the reviewers are what's being paid for. It's become a mutually beneficial prestigious position, not something that assures quality."
#+end_quote

I thought the above was a typo initially, with Oak and Elm being used for the same person. Leaving it in this thread just in case.

On a first read, it was somewhat confusing (to me at least) why Oak reacted to Osaku's remark rather than Elm. It was not very clear to me that Oak and Elm were working together until the point that Osamu thanked them both for their time.

** Good chapter! Loved the different perspectives, and of course Oak went after Blue. I especially enjoyed the elites leading Zapdos and the different mindset it showed.

Here's hoping Leaf is ok.

** Love this story, was introduced by someone near the start of December, and binged it up to the current chapter, then waited for this one probably more than new years.

I'd like to echo the fact that you are really good at writing in a way that helps one really feel like they are inside the character's head, well, now to wait for the next chapter!

** A very tense chapter, and I think the multiple perspective switches we're executed fantastically. Seto's section was particularly interesting to me, a really nuanced character peice in the midst of disaster.

A minor critique being that, I think that in the work read as a whole rather than serially, it will seem a bit strange/redundant feeling to have to catastrophic Magnemite/Magneton attack in back to back chapters.

Zapdos definitely racked up a few "not an evil monster, just an animal" points in the scenes with Karen. It basically responded to the attacks like a cockroach bumping into a wall. "Oh, that was weird, better turn a different direction."

I do really like Karen as a character too. I'm sort of on the fence about whether or not her in-game existence says about the subject of plot armor in this story. On one hand, I've kind of been enjoying OtOS as a sort of, higher resolution retelling of the Kanto story, so I am totally fine thinking things like, "I know Karen will survive because she is alive in Gold/Silver." But also I like the liberties you take with the story, and the future butterfly-effect it allows. But we haven't seen a whole lot of that narrative divergence yet, like the kinds in HPMoR for example, so I don't know if it makes sense to "start now" so to speak. I know that I would mostly likely be satisfied with this story if it ends with Red fighting Champion Blue and then him running off to stoically stare at the Peaks of Mt. Silver, but I don't think that's how I /expect/ it to end. Anyways, looking forward to finding out.

Side note, game canon states that at least one person, Pyramid King Brandon, was eventually able to capture (or clone!) the legendary birds and the regis. But maybe our heroes find themselves in one of the blighted universes where the Battle Frontier is perpetually locked in development hell and Brandon was crushed in another of Team Rocket's archeological "accidents." Perhaps after he came too close to unlocking the secret of capturing legendaries for Giovanni's liking.

Speaking of complicated game canon multiverses, I wonder what the implications are of LGPE forwarding that a version of Red, Blue, and Green!Leaf exist somehow in a time-shifted era before Oak finished his pokedex, where Fairy types, mega-evolution, alola forms, and Melmetal exist... But not baby Pokemon or happiness evolution... but after Mewtwo and Porygon have been created. LGPE are really just a mess. I think rat!Red's head would explode if he was forced to confront all of canon Pokemon's multiverses.

**** ...well fuck, guess we know why he's staring stoically off of Mt. Silver now! :P

+honestly my running theory is that LGPE is some sort of broken simulation trying to replace FR/LG in the timeline somehow, and Red/Blue/Leaf are pretending to fit into it in order to hunt down the cause and save their world. :P+
