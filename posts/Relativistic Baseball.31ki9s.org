** This whole book was a wonderful rational read. In addition to being informative and entertaining, it shows that you can approach more or less any serious question scientifically and arrive at a reasonable answer.

*** For a given value of "reasonable".

I have (and love) this book, and it is certainly logical, but I'm not sure you have a very strong argument that calculating the electical output of Yoda is very reasonable...

**** Agreed. Some questions can only be taken so seriously and the Yoda one is one of the best examples of just having fun. But once you assign non-arbitrary limitations on the power-output, you get a workable problem and he makes a sincere effort to arrive at an actual answer. That's the real take away of the book for me. (Almost) no question is beyond taking semi-seriously and making an effort to answer.
