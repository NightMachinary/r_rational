Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

**** Since I'm revisiting this anyway, the other half of my unwritten response was to distinguish my use of ‘hyperintelligence' from the standard term ‘superintelligence'. I consider superintelligence reached whenever the best humans are outperformed at a task; I use hyperintelligence to distinguish those superintelligences that are most acute, such that no practical quantity of humans provide even modest competition.

A real-world example would be bitcoin mining, where a single GPU may outperform the entire planet of humans, despite the task being readily parallelizable. A non-example might be chess, since humans still evaluate some positions better than any current AI, and human-AI hybrids still outperform pure AI players at long time controls, albeit increasingly modestly.

****** This distinction is only meant to aid conversation; it isn't pointing at a fundamental distinction in reality. In contrast I don't think ‘super-machine' or ‘hyper-machine' are likely to be all that useful as classifications.

If I were forced, I'd posit that a machine was super-machine relative to another class of machines iff it was better at the task than the best of the latter class, and hyper-machine iff it was so much better that no quantity of the lesser machine provided even modest competition. A GPU might be a supermachine at rasterization relative to CPUs, but it would not be a hypermachine.

***** I think the quality increases with the later books. I actually liked the last book in the original series more /precisely because/ it was such a departure from the original premise(the last book left me gaping, it was crazy). I can see why some people might have problems with it, though. It went from "reverse portal fantasy with grit" to more of a high concept science fiction. The use of real life political figures as antagonists might also trigger some people, but I'm not american so I don't care.

****** Well I tend to like SciFi more than fantasy (generally, not universally), so it sounds like I might fall a little more in line with you. The main critique I can remember though applied mostly to the middle books which I heard dragged on a bit. I was envisioning a sort of "Wheel of Time" syndrome where the middle 1/3rd of the series could be removed and the whole thing would be improved. Was that your impression, or no? The political figures thing /probably/ won't annoy me unless it gets too preachy/heavy handed. I tend to think both sides of american politics over-react to things so if some particular real life political figure is just ABSOLUTELY THE WORST THING AND CLEARLY EVIL, as opposed to "our goals aren't aligned and therefore we are in conflict with each other", it will probably push my buttons a bit, but I'm sure I'll be able to deal.

******* Yeah, there is a lull in the middle, IIRC. It's been a while since I've read it, but I remember it was a bit of a slog. I can't even remember what the problem was, which is telling. I only persevered because I'm a fan of Stross.

And it's kind of a mixed bag on the heavy handed-ness. On the one hand, I don't think he uses the names of the politicians, though it's very obvious who they are, and they do some very over the top stuff (plausible to me, but who knows). On the other hand, it's a very short sequence at the climax of the last book, so not the focus of the novels at all. It's no [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(Card_novel)][Empire]].

Both of them talk about various things related to their own careers, in particular how they work and why they make the choices that they do. It's not always /rational/ per se (Grey says repeatedly that he is more productive if a robot in his house is working while he is trying to write, for example), but I still feel that it's the kind of podcast that a lot of people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would appreciate more than Hello internet.

*** Not quite at Val's level, but [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig's]] Sylvester is a devious social manipulator.

Biopunk universe, where Frankenstein's monster wasn't a novel, but an actual scientific creation. The British Crown snatched that up pretty quickly, poured money into bio research, and conquered large parts of the world. Now, in 1920, Sylvester and his fellow young Experiments must find their place in a world of living superweapons, all-powerful nobility, and mad scientists.

Fair warning, it's a Wildbow work, which means it's fairly dark, fairly long, and good enough you won't want to put it down 'till you're done.

** Just got reccommended the [[https://www.valsalia.com/comic/out-of-placers/oops-91/][Out of Placers]] webcomic, which is set in a very interesting lowish fantasy world with minimal magic but a number of extremely nonhuman species coexisting with humans in a trading settlement.

*** Author's fetishes are a bit too in-your-face in this one. I mean, human dude MC(?) gets randomly forcefully transformed into small rodentish female furry in the first 30 pages. Apparently permanently.

**** I admit, the plot is pretty "webcomic-y." In my personal opinion, though, the worldbuilding outweighs that, but I can understand why you'd disagree.

Though with how the MC's transformation is handled, I viewed it as less fetishy and more of an examination of body/gender dysmorphia. If he was happy about the transformation or transformed into something cooler then it would clearly be wish fulfilment, but the guy's a waist high rodent now.

***** Just caught up to the story. World building is done pretty well and the transformation is alright. I /kinda/ get a fetishy feel from it, but I think the major hint is that humans are drawn kinda badly and all of the rat people are drawn with great care.

****** It's harder to get the proportions right for humans, which is partially why you see so many "funny animal" comics. When something is wrong with a representation of a human, we're hardwired to notice. I wouldn't be particulalry surprised of the author was a furry, given the subject manner, but, as I said, I think any fetishy stuff has a relatively minimal impact on the writing of the webcomic.

Edit: so I was looking at the sidestories, and have to retract my statements. The comic was definitely written with fetishy reasons in mind. (Still good though)

*** From my Audible libaray in the 25 or more range.

Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell - regency era style novel about magic coming back - with footnotes! Not very rational but excellently written in a period style.

Anathem - very weird story about cloistered communities of scientists (called mathics). Very good. Very weird. Pretty rational.

The Name of the Wind: The Kingkiller Chronicle, Book 1 - overly competent protagonist tells his story of going through life being overly competent. Features a very well realised magical university. Has flaws but very engaging. Also has squeal. Book three has GRRM syndrome.

The Lies of Locke Lamora - the growing up of a thief/confidence trickster in fantasy Venice. Very good. Has two squeals which are good but don't quite have the same magic.

**** Love Anathem & Name of the Wind. Anathem's one of my favorites, I'd definitely give it a rational tag.

I've tried Strange & Norrell a couple of times and have never been able to get very far, though plenty of people whose tastes I trust have recommended it. How do they do footnotes in the audio format?

***** If I remember, they break from the main narration for an aside in a slightly different tone of voice. Same thing they do for the Discworld footnotes. I still chuckle sometimes at one lengthy aside where the story just stops for a bit so we can hear the differences between London and country-side servants. It was very good.

*** - Sanderson's Stormlight and Mistborn books are generally >25 hrs. Mistborn is probably the most rational fantasy series.

- Bank's Algebraist which has a interesting deep time human similar gas giant species is just under 25 hrs.

- The second 2 books in the Three body problem trilogy (The Dark Forest and Deaths End) are 22 and 29 hours respectively

- The mote in God's eye is classic Niven about evolution and is 20 hrs

Stuff you might like but might not like:

- A lot of Alistair Reynolds is 20+ hrs but they are kinda weak after the transhumanism and posthumans whoo.

- Kim StanleyRobinson's Mars books are all 20+ hours and they are good potential future histories but they can drag on.

- Heinlein's Time enough for love is penultimate capstone and basically has 3 or four novels jammed together with some interesting philosophy, if you already like Heinlein you'll like it if you don't like him you won't.
