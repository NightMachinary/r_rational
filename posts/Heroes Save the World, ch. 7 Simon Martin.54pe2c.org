** I've really been looking forward to being able to post this chapter.

*Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

** /Save the cheerleader, save the world./

This isn't an AU Worm fanfic, is it?

[edit] The way that visions work makes no sense though. Either there's information flowing back in time, or there isn't. If there isn't, the visions are genuinely meaningless. If there is, then knowledge about how to do this should be the main payload of the message. (It isn't, so it's likely the former.) For a good treatment of "stable-timeloop" visions, consult Greg Egan's Arrows of Time, which is a "globally causal" world - the configuration of spacetime is determined instantaneously and globally, such that the only universe that can exist is one in which the use of time travel causes no contradictions. This leads to visions being both boring and self-fulfilling - knowing that a certain future is coming, people become fatalistic, allowing it to come to pass. (Which is, indeed, the most probable way in which a time loop can be stable.)

Also: dude. Go find a deterministic set of children, touch them in a deterministic order, receive larger messages from (up to 150 years in (assuming you do it again when you're old)) the future. I wonder how many messages you need to pass through the compressed version of a seed AI?

Unless you're very careful in setting it up, foresight is either broken or useless.

You're imposing HPMOR-style time travel onto another story. It's fiction-- the time travel does not have to create "stable timeloops", per se. For it to be rational, however, the rules do have to be self-consistent, however. What if, for example, sending a message back in time destroyed the future for the intervening time between the delivery of the message and the transmission of the message. Time then continues forward as usual. This can be done self-consistently, and was executed in the highly-recommended Terminator fanfiction "Branches on the Tree of Time" [1].

#+end_quote

If you follow the model of time-travel I just described, then sending messages back systematically like that is /extremely risky/. Each time that a ~10 second message is sent (I'm guessing that's how long the message was), Simon must survive in the new future long enough to send the next message. What happens if, while waiting, he gets hit by a bus? Heart attack? Now the loops are terminated and he's dead. 10 seconds is not a lot of information, for having waited several years.

"Visions can't be changed" implies stable /something/.

Why would that terminate the loop? All that'll happen is that you won't get a message from any people who live longer than that. Alternatively, they can just arrange for them to say that Simon died. And yes, /Branches/ is great but it assumes a mutable future. All I'm saying is either the future is mutable or it's not; even if having a vision /forces/ the future to become immutable that still means you don't get to pick your message like this, you just get the first one that's stable because it /makes/ itself stable.

***** Ah, I get what you're saying:

These two statements are mutually inconsistent:

"Visions are fixed; futures can change"

"Time is mutable, without such a thing as 'fate' or 'destiny', and can be affected by time travel in useful ways"

My bad, that sounds about right.

****** I took "Visions are fixed" to mean that his power is one use per person, and you get the same vision every time you touch someone.

I think it works like this: let's say that he's helping a police department take down a particularly dangerous subject. He get's a vision of Officer1's death, where he's in the upstairs bathroom alone when he dies. So he tells Officer1 not to wander off by himself.

Simon checks Officer2's death, and in the vision Officer1 is in front of Officer2 in the basement when Officer1 is suddenly killed in front of Officer2 before Officer2 expires.

If Simon were to check Officer1's death again, he would still die in the bathroom alone, instead of in front of Officer2 in the basement, because even though he changed the future, his power will only show him one death per person, and Officer2's chance was used up.

It's kind of depressing, because even if he saves his mother from suicide, he'll always see that vision every time he uses it on her. Let's hope this power has some kind of voluntary component!

******* Yeah, in which case you can't really use it to receive messages because there's no "first time around before he touches that person"; there's no state of the world in which Simon does not receive that message, in which he can decide to send that message back. I mean, what, in that world his power just stopped working on that one person? Or else that world did experience a vision which was changed.

******** [[/u/CreationBlues]] and [[/u/munkeegutz]] are accurate here. (Speaking of--Simon's power does have a voluntary component, thankfully!).

There's spoiler text below where I've elaborated on the situation. Let me know if you can't see it for some reason.

[[#s][spoilers]]

I don't think that Simon has the information necessary to figure out all of the above just yet, but if there's anything that you think that I can add to this chapter to reasonably clarify things, then I'd love to hear it. At the very least I might make mention of the fact that the situation is confusing for the reasons that you give above.

********* Oh, so [[#s][visions]]

This reminds me of how time travel works in the Butterfly Effect, in that there's "reserved spots" into which time travel can slot.

********* I suspect that you can't clarify that without giving more information than you want to divulge at the moment. That said, there are a number of things which you might want to think about (and probably, you already have)

--Future simon hopefully has some kind of plan for how to best equip past simon with the tools necessary to use his power. How is he going to communicate these insights ASAP? I would be sure to have the first several visions communicate this information. Ideally, if possible, I would make the first several visions link directly to each other, so that past Simon knows who to touch to get the next piece of message. This strategy is obviously delicate because one break in the chain and the segmented message is lost thereafter.

--Time travel is difficult to do in a rational manner. Be sure that you're very clear with yourself on what the rules of time travel are. How long do simon's messages last? Do they only happen on someone's death? Do they only happen on certain kinds of death? Can suicide make the messages happen earlier? When does the transmisison of information happen? Is it when future simon dies (and all the messages he chooses to, are sent back in time simultaneously to past-simon), or does time get "reset" with each message sent? How does simon "break out" of this loop, since he will probably be sending messages back in time whenever he has the chance, provided that it gives him benefit. --If I was past-simon, I would pick the nearest obvious place to touch lots of people -- ideally both people who are dying soon, and people who are dying in the distant future. Ideally, the people he meets at this location will die in predictable times/manners, so that they can easily convey messages (perhaps a display near them showing a text message, because reading is faster than writing). Be predictable for future simon, is the plan. A hospital, perhaps? Future simon could equip past simon with the credentials necessary to sneak in more easily, hopefully.

--I don't know if you have a plan for this, but it appears that the 100 heroes have some kind of special information. Hopefully there is a known way by which they acquired that information (you don't have to tell me of course)

********** Thank you!

Yes, time travel is very difficult, especially since this story is going to be on the long end of things, which means that there's so much rope to hang myself with. I'm not sure if I'm going to regret the precognition later on, but I'm feeling optimistic. The most limiting factor for him right now, IMO, is that he's not the sort of person who can justify killing people in one timeline to get information that will save more people in another timeline.

He may or may not change, but it'll be part of a character arc if he does, and not a trait that he gets starting out the gate.

*********** I think that one big challenge you'll see is that the time travel can go so far into the past. One reason HPMOR time travel worked is because of the six hour limit: EU only had to make the travel work for that little story arc, and then he was free. You, on the other hand, need to have a solid grasp of all the events surrounding the time travel right now, in the 7th chapter. Otherwise, simon's motivations won't line up with the evidence provided by the previous messages.

At some point, Simon might consider the universe a write-off, killing many people systematically to send lots of information. For instance, if something really bad happens.
