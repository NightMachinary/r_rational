*** I personally did not like this story much. I found it really similar to wuxia.

Sure, it's a deconstruction of many common fantasy tropes. The humour is okay sometimes. But protagonist has severe psychological issues (I'd even call him literally insane), the world at least partially runs on narrativium, and characters use an ability to detect if somebody is telling the truth (you know, not what the speaker believes to be truth, but /truth/ truth) as a lie detector instead of an Oracle it is.

Where did you get that from? If memory serves, at one point the detector even fails because Colin was saying something that was true, but that he wasn't really convinced of himself.

  “Your ability, it allows you to tell when someone's lying.”

  “Yes.”

  “Even if they believe what they're saying, you can still tell when their belief is incorrect.”

  “Yes.”
#+end_quote

Here character clearly tells that he is able to detect if someone is telling the truth. Yes, the Oracle might be slightly awkward and inconvenient to use, but it is still a fully functioning Oracle, and with an Oracle you can win everything everywhere forever if you manage to ask a correct question. And you can even ask an Oracle to /tell/ you the correct question.

EDIT (clarification): I don't say that I am necessarily correct and this definitely is an Oracle. I am just saying that when you encounter something that looks like an Oracle at first glance, you really should drop everything and /check if what looks like an Oracle is indeed an Oracle/ because if it is, you just won everything everywhere forever. My issue here is that nobody as much as raised a brow when they encountered a potential Oracle. Compare with [[#s][HPMOR chapter 17 spoiler]] Colin, on the other hand, just ignores the truth-telling thing altogether.

****** I think a lot of people misunderstood how God (the truth teller) worked. Mainly by rushing to interpret it in the way they found most convenient.

They seemed to assume if you just made any statement he would be able to verify it for you.

As though if I said, the man who killed JFK's name begins with A. B? C? and by a process of elimination work out the identity. It doesn't work like that.

In addition, God doesn't have to answer any question he doesn't feel like.

I had a lot of people assuming how it worked, convincing themselves their assumptions were facts, and then throwing these 'facts' at me as proof of whatever theory they had come up with.

I intentionally made it confusing (and also left myself enough wiggle room with areas not explained) exactly because it wasn't to be used as an all knowing oracle. If none of the readers understand how it works, how do you expect Colin to? Especially when his first experience of it is breaking it.

It's also mentioned that the truth telling part isn't what God uses his powers for, it's just a side-effect.

Anyway, those were my thoughts when writing it. It's not that I'm unaware of the power of an oracle, it's that I tend to only use OP things in a way that isn't helpful or makes things worse.

You completely misinterpreted my objection. The issue I have with the God (and the zone-of-truth later) is not that I "assumed how it worked". No, the issue is: When protagonist with head full of concepts from modern society, while in new and unusual land of wonders, encounters something that to him looks kinda like Grand Cosmic Power That Would Let Him Win Everything Everywhere Forever, he should not ignore it. He should do at least cursory check, because if it is in fact Grand Cosmic Power, he will win right now. Again, look how it was done in [[#s][HPMOR ch. 17 spoiler]].

This just makes it worse. I treat such "wiggle room" as sloppiness. Also, Colin, unlike the readers, really could at least /try/ to find out more about the truth-finding methods. He didn't even try, that's what bothered me.

It doesn't matter if world domination is just a side effect, it's still world domination.

Also, I'd like to use this rare possibility to converse with an actual author to leave my review: I personally didn't like the work. The main character, with his insanity, Irresponsible-Captain-Tailor-grade luck and inconsistent stupidity was really unlikable. He is well written, but I really didn't like reading about him. About the only three things I enjoyed out of 131 chapters were unusual rabbits, tsundere princess and ninja Ayanami Rei. It might be that I'm just not an intended audience for your work, but I can't honestly recommend it. Sorry.

******** "encounters something that to him looks kinda like Grand Cosmic Power That Would Let Him Win Everything Everywhere Forever"

This is an example of you assuming how it works. That's how you see it, not how Colin sees it. He has always looked at things in a way different to other people. I understand the frustration if you personally wouldn't do it that way, or think something is so obvious as to be undeniable, but it's always been written as the reader seeing things from Colin's somewhat odd perspective, not Colin doing what most people would do.

"It doesn't matter if world domination is just a side effect, it's still world domination."

Here's an example of creating a 'fact' and then using it as an argument against me. I didn't say his side-effect was world domination. You decided truth telling=world domination when I already stated it doesn't work like that. I get a lot of this kind of straw man argument.

By the way, I'm no trying to have a go at you, I like conversing with my readers (not as rare as you might think, I tend to answer most queries on Reddit and other forums) but I get a lot of people coming at me with very stridently held beliefs about what Colin should or shouldn't do. I mean really strident.

One reviewer on WFG insisted the people arriving in this world would have created electricity and gunpowder (not could have, definitely would have) and gave the story 2/5 stars because of this obvious and massive error. They offered to amend this score once I fixed things. Do they expect me to turn my story from fantasy to steampunk just to please one person? (Answer: Yes).

As for leaving me your review, I'm not sure why you feel the need to tell me that directly. Wouldn't it be better to just stop reading? After 133 chapters I doubt I will suddenly change my writing style.

*** The story is entertaining. It is not, IMO, particularly rational (though Colin is less driven by tropes and stereotypes than most fantasy protagonists), but there are a fair number of creative solutions he comes up with to solve problems.

I have some issues with the characters themselves and have mentioned them before in previous threads here. But in the end I found the story more entertaining than abrasive. I'd recommend it, with the caveat that the humor isn't for everyone, and that it is more a deconstruction of fantasy tropes than an actual rational work.

To the author: I just caught up with the last several chapters. Really enjoyed the end of book 4 and am intrigued by the beginning of book five. Thank you and keep up the good work!

*** Personally, I haven't been able to get past chapter 20. The main character is just super sexist and racist and I really just can't identify with those kinds of thought processes, makes it much harder to connect to the character.

**** I've been accused of this quite a lot, and I can see why, but just because the character exhibits those things doesn't mean the story condones them or considers them good (although I've been accused of that too).

The protag is a 19 year old modern male full of self-loathing and social issues. If you think he's going to be a enlightened and liberal individual you're certainly reading the wrong story (or not, in your case).

I consider the kinds of stories where only the villains exhibit horrible personal traits to be far more extreme examples of wish-fulfilment. These are all issues the story disseminates on many levels, but to do so those elements have to exist in the world and in a way I consider realistic. Yes, good, likeable people have some dodgy facets to them.

I'll give you an example of what I mean. Early on, Jenny tries to join their group and Colin rejects her. He says that the last thing they need when fighting monsters is another girl in the group.

This raised some accusations and caused some discussion (some in this sub) as it was meant to.

In a later scene, Colin gets the boys in the group to do push ups and none can do more than three.

This scene was cited as an example of my own misogyny. Aha, I'd undermined my own point. Stupidly proved the wrongness of my own argument. As though elves had broken into my PC and snuck in some irony without me knowing.

I wrote it that way deliberately. Girls might die in a fight in 5 seconds, but so would your typical video game obsessed boy. I set it up that way because I find it amusing. That's the joke. Nobody is of help when it comes to fighting trolls and ogres. Your only option: avoid fighting.

This story has had three significant black characters (in a fantasy story and without resorting to tribe of natives nonsense) and easily passes the Bechdel test (and that's in a story told through first person POV of a male).

It's not just the villains who are prejudiced and bigoted, and even those who are often get away unpunished for it. Which isn't very rational, but then it isn't very rational when it happens in our world either.

I don't mind people saying they don't like reading about those issues (rape and anal sex and homosexuality are all brought up) but implying that the story is some misogynistic, racist wish-fulfilment on my part is misleading, I feel.

BTW you may just be saying the main character's outlook is too unpleasant regardless of other aspects, which is fair enough, but that's not how your short statement reads so I wanted to clarify on that specific point.
