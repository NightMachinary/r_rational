**** It's not even so much the logistics aspect as it is him being the perfect right-hand man. He's exactly the kind of friend Catherine needs whenever she needs one, and exactly the kind of second-in-command she needs whenever she needs one. She's incredibly fortunate to have him, especially considering how the "trusted lieutenant" trope /usually/ pans out.

I hope he doesn't die. I'm pretty sure that would be the most painful story development possible.

Remember, she had issues dealing even with a Duke and has lost Rise as a stolen aspect. She's now facing a Princess and the Queen of Summer. Later she's going to face a GOODLY portion of the Winter court. She can't rely on Ranger a second time and she needs power to do so.

** Something just feels wrong about her drawing the line at a specific kind of human sacrifice. She sacrificed thousands starting a war to move up the ranks. She personally sacrifices enemy soldiers to win a battle. She sacrifices her own soldiers to win. I feel like when she draws a line like that, it's a way of pretending that killing people in other circumstances isn't bad. That she doesn't have to worry about all the choices she makes as long as they don't cross the line.

*** There are several reasons from that.

First, on an emotional level, Catherine and Hakram both view sacrifices as "that thing Praesi do to us sometimes when they feel like it", so it makes sense they'd be extremely against it on a gut level, for the same reasons people who frequently fought Orcs are extremely against necrophagia.

Second, human sacrifice has perverse incentives that war doesn't have. While Cat does sacrifice her soldiers, she's not happy to do it; all else being equal, she's always more likely to choose the path that leads to the least amount of her soldiers dying. As long as Cat cares about her soldiers, her incentive is to choose peace, or at least to choose the actions most likely to lead to peace on the long term.

On the other hand, human sacrifice and treating people as commodities has the opposite incentive curve. Praesi nobles have no incentive to reduce crime, poverty and corruption, since they all produce the death row inmates their sacrifices need. Praesi even have strong incentives to engineer civil wars, since those lead to the massive amounts of prisoners and sacrifices that they need to keep their crops going.

EDIT: Although, now that I think about it, Catherine does have perverse incentives herself, and the story hasn't talked about it yet. She started the civil war to get in a position of power. Every single time Heiress released demons, she won more power and loyalty from her followers. The Gallowborne wouldn't be nearly so loyal to her if she hadn't had Heiress to point them at.

***** That's not what I meant by perverse incentives.

The fact is, she didn't get as much power and popularity from the civil war as she did from fighting Heiress's demons. The fact is, if Heiress hadn't been around, most Callowans would still see her as a traitor.

That means that in a way, she had an unspoken incentive to let Heiress get away with her mayhem while shaking a fist angrily at her, because the most carnage she causes, the more power Cat has.

*** There's a very half-hearted attempt by Cat to respond to this in text where she acknowledges that she's done awful things, will continue to do even worse things but she is drawing this arbitrary line anyway.

Gaining benefits from the deaths of those already condemned to death by the state seems far and away a morally superior action to starting a war in order to gain power in the process. In any context human sacrifice is one of those things you feel the need to flinch away from and label in the BAD column without any real consideration but I expected a little more from this story which has shown its willingness to explore the utility of actions normally considered Evil.

  Cloak streaming behind me, I guided Zombie to the bottom of the marble steps and stared at the massive bronze gates.

  “Break,” I said.

  My Name flared even as the metal crumpled like parchment under my eyes, falling apart with a sound like a gong being struck. In the hall behind, two dozen soldiers stood shaking and pale.

  --------------

  A globe of air, the same magic he'd used early in the fight, formed around me. A heartbeat away from my feet touching the ground the air solidified, trapping me like a fly in amber.

  . . .

  “Break,” I croaked.

  For an instant all I felt was my will pushing against something infinitely larger. If the Duke had fought me, I grasped,  I would have been swept away by the tide effortlessly. But he wasn't fighting me. Magic was will, and his will was in the spears. The globe shattered, the Beast howling in approval. I'd been caught with my sword raised to strike and though the momentum had been blunted that was again how I began descending.

It seems to be very similar to Black's *Destroy* for the most part, although it's notable that it can target spells as well as objects.
