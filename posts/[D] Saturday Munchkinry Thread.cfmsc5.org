Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I'm interested in what people would do in the modern world if they knew the GURPS spell "Seek Earth", which lets you find the nearest natural dirt or stone, and exclude known dirt and stone within the range, so over several castings you could inventory all the minerals in a fairly small area.

For discussion purposes you would be able to make an average of 5 successful uses of the spell per day with a maximum range of 100 meters.

I've got my own ideas, of course, like being able to "pan" for gold or diamonds really efficiently along streams or rivers that cut deposits, but I'm curious what others would do.

***** Tree leaves have been used to search for trace amounts of gold beneath the surface of the soil, to determine where to mine. This technique is limited to the depth of tree roots, which makes it most useful in dry areas where tree roots go deep. I can't find many hard number, but the world record for deepest roots is 120 meters, and most tree roots in residential areas (well-studied for infrastructure reasons) don't go more than 5 feet deep. From that, using a 100 meter range to identify locations of gold deposits would be very useful in establishing mines.

*** Hmm, what is the precision of the spell, and limits on what materials it can detect?

For example, could you go to a hospital and cast the Seek Earth spell looking for gold, and thus find any patients suffering from gold poisoning?

I imagine it wouldn't work for arbitrary poisons, especially biological ones like snake venom since they wouldn't count as "Earth", but there are a lot of poisonous metals that could be considered "Earth", so using a "Seek Earth" spell may help you quickly find and diagnose poisoned patients.

***** I can see a difficulty, then, in that (IIUC) the spell would work most efficiently in a context where the thing you're looking for is embedded in a large amount of a less valuable material of a type that would not trigger the spell. So, a needle in a haystack, but it can't be an actual needle because that's not natural. But there are a limited number of situations where that would apply, and depending how finicky the spell is you could spend a lot of time sifting through the different kinds of mineral you aren't looking for. But I may misunderstand the parameters.

​

If you're standing on a sand dune, will it incessantly point out the nearest grain of sand, one after the other, until you run out of castings, or can all sand grains within range be marked as catalogued once it's pegged one? Or can you tweak it to identify handfuls of sand, or larger groupings of small units? Shifting this around, suppose you're standing next to a cliff face looking for a specific mineral. Does all the more or less solid rock of the face count as one found thing, or does it count individual mineral bands, or what? I don't remember a lot about geology from high school and college, but I vaguely recall that there are a huge number of different kinds of rocks and minerals.

Does the body as a whole count as one source or is each speck on the body one source? I would've thought any contiguous piece counts as one source, so the area under each fingernail would count as separate sources if not multiple sources.

Though if we're using the word "source" it implies the resource is extractable so it would only detect the smallest possible unit of resource manipulable by Earth magic.

I'm guessing Earth magic can't pull the Iron out of someone's blood, so that wouldn't count as a source of iron for Earth magic.

** The Problem of Heaven:

Secondary Fantasy realm. There are a number of known True Faiths. These each have well known criteria for accepting the souls of the departed into their respective afterlives. If you meet more than one set of criteria, you get to bounce around between the various afterlives you qualify for.

None of them are perfect utopias - because none of them exercise tyrannical control over the souls residing there, and the locals are, after all, largely human. But they generally are very nice places.

This is known because there are magics for contacting the afterlife. Well, "For contacting people in the afterlife who wish to speak with you". They are not obligated to answer, and getting hold of someone without living relatives tends to get difficult. The oldest souls stilling willing to talk to living people tend to be subject matter experts, and you better have something interesting to say, or they will hang up and go flying around the Tree of Yrud instead of wasting time talking to you.

And none of the True Faiths account suicide in and of itself a sin.

Okay, I am basically assuming that this counteracts malthusian forces pretty darn hard - Whenever things in the mortal realm gets overly miserable, you get mass suicides.

What other inevitable consequences do you see?

Most of the True Faiths are going to /heavily/ encourage people to stay alive and propagate the Faith in some fashion, despite your bullet point saying that none of them count suicide as a sin. Memes can't spread if every carrier is dead.

That being said, if there's a "catch-all" Faith for people who didn't meet any criteria, that one is probably going to be all for suicide.

Anyone who's still alive (though this might vary with the workings of the ritual). A religion need not die out - even if everyone alive who believes dies...that doesn't mean they can't be summoned. While they're alive, some people try to preach/spread their religion. While some people might only be interested in talking to living relatives, people who enjoy sharing their beliefs might continue doing so after they've died. (Someone doing the ritual: "I want to talk to someone about the afterlife." Ghost: "Have you heard about...")

Does that mean that the various heavens are thus interconnected by the multiply-qualified serving as pseudo-information traders? So the locals of a heavenly world could learn of the other heavenly worlds connected to them by the multiply-qualified?

I could see some kind of multi-world cooperation going on to record all of the people born in the mortal realm and which afterlives they ended up in, if only to confirm whether or not all afterlives have been found. The after-lifers would have an incentive to encourage the living to become multiply-qualified, so as to strengthen the heavenly network connections and possibly find new afterlives.

That means the mortal realm will soon be full of multi-faith people, aiming to be qualified for as many different afterlives as possible.

#+end_quote

Implicitly, this means that these religions do not need to maximize their followers and the afterlife is something like a social club situation where the various faiths in the afterlife are just trying to make good matches and meet interesting people.

To explain, if these heavens and their respective deities were trying to maximize their number of followers, then more than likely, the tenets of those religions would quickly change to prohibit suicide. Suicide can easily become a mass phenomenon even when we don't have any proof that literal heaven awaits you in the afterlife. But provide proof of heaven and circumstances that would make people fear they'll lose their chance at getting there and you'd sometimes see entire countries disappear in a day.

For example, suppose you have a country with a religion which prohibits its followers from killing, but allows suicide. If some other powerful country declares war on them, they can't fight back without losing their chance at their preferred heaven. Their best option is to all just commit suicide together, as an entire country. After a couple of incidents like that under various circumstances, you'd probably see religions starting to prohibit suicide. However, since none of your religions prohibit suicide, it would suggest that your religions really don't care much about how many followers they have.

Implicitly, this would also suggest that your deities are not powered by worshipers, and they don't really need worshipers to advance their plans or accomplish anything of importance. The worshipers are ultimately doing their own thing independently, and the deities merely tolerate it rather than encouraging it. At a guess, I would suspect that your deities are probably similar to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNXohNU3tWo][Dr. Manhattan]], in how they have [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxM79UNvKqc][difficulty connecting with humans]] because of their perception of space and time, and their rather "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK9RvNVGcWY][different]]" views of life. Similar to Dr. Manhattan, they would likely be powerful enough that the endeavors of man are generally too feeble to be worthy of their interest or concern.

#+end_quote

People start being good all the time (assuming the religions with the good heavens require good behavior). There won't be much conflict in the world, because even people with bad intentions who have any self-control whatsoever are still going to act and behave like good people. Bad behavior and conflict would typically be associated almost exclusively with drugs/alcohol, demon possession, or neuropsychiatric disabilities like untreated schizophrenia, delirium, dementia, etc. In general, it would probably be seen as a sign of medical or magical illness which requires treatment. However, this could be different for religions which offer "forgiveness", in which case, you might still see patterns of bad behavior followed by at least half-hearted repentance among people who are not mentally ill, but just genuine assholes who like doing that kind of shit.

Human knowledge along with scientific and cultural advancement would probably be significantly improved compared to our current situation. For example, Thomas Martin Einstein is Albert Einstein's great great grandson, so we would conceivably be able to contact Albert Einstein through him to see if he's developed any new testable hypotheses that would further our knowledge of the mathematics governing the fundamental physics of the universe, and we could update him with the results of the tests to keep him interested and willing to keep giving us new ideas. Similarly, MLK's granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, is still around could allow us to get her grandfathers' thoughts on the current state of affairs in US culture and politics.

With this arrangement, even if the dead count as viable worshipers, you'd still want to maximize or at least promote the expansion of your living worshipers to facilitate continued supply.

To draw an analogy, livestock farmers probably wouldn't set up their ranch next to a cliff and use the cliff like it's a fourth wall to complete their ranch enclosure. However, if they did choose to do that and then half of their herd flew off the cliff in a panic one cold winter day, they'd probably realize it's a bad idea and put up another fence to keep their animals from committing suicide. Even if the rapidly-frozen dead livestock could still be made perfectly fine to eat, it's risky to have no control over situations that could cause all or most of their herd to die.

Your powers:

- You know the super's unmasked identity.

They're generally equipped with tasers, cellphones, business suits, a lot of muscle mass, and sunglasses. Some may have stun sticks or gunpowder pistols. Some may have that unusual quality of character called "initiative", which causes them to be creative in problem-solving.
- You have hacked the app servers of the convention that's currently going on at the convention center: the app's panic button and messaging functions don't work.
- You do not have an IMSI catcher or Stingray-style cell tower spoofing device. If the super has or acquires a phone, they can call the police.
- You have the bland cooperation of the convention center staff: you have keys to lock and unlock most doors, the walkie-talkie-equipped staff have been told to cooperate with you. Non-walkie-talkie-equipped staff will seek -equipped staff before following orders from you or your Mooks.
- You have the backing of your superiors, who you're pretty sure are some shadowy government agency. Nevertheless, they have asked you to be discreet.
- You have your backer's analysis of the super and their script for how you were supposed to approach the super's unmasked identity. The script did not work; you squicked and frightened your target and your target super is now bouncing around the atrium.

The super has non-lethally disabled several of your Mooks, and acquired their weapons. The super appears to have used one of your disabled Mook's cellphone to call for emergency medical treatment for one of the Mooks that the super disabled.

The convention center staff are becoming worried about the goings-on.

The convention staff haven't noticed that their app is down yet, but the con-goers have definitely noticed the super bouncing around the atrium, and are likely to start noticing your Mooks and you.

The goals of this operation:

- Preserve your operational capacity for future missions. Avoid drawing media attention to your mission, and avoid contact with the conventional police.
- Recruit the super, or if recruitment is not possible, capture the super. If capture is not possible, learn as much as possible about the super for future recruitment or capture efforts.

Do you decide to abort the capture mission? Do you proceed but change tactics?

*** Prepare a weighted net as a backup, especially from on high, with the idea being that it will grant a few seconds of distractions so that a mook can tase him, but that's in case things go sour. Then, stage a hostage situation to keep him contained and present with several mooks (3 or so) taking several hostages each cooperatively. Two such hostages are plants, preferably a man and a woman.

The hostage-takers are demanding the hero cuff his own arms and legs and allow a blindfold to be placed over his eyes. If this works, great, capture successful.

Set up a scenario where the man "plays the hero" and sees a chance to tackle a mook and steal his weapon, "wildly" shoot another in the foot, and "try to" shoot the third, but the third shoots him, preferably in the arm or shoulder. The third mook should have to be facing away from the hero for this, giving him a chance to take the third one out himself.

Have the woman scream "No! ____" where the man's name is a name of one of his family/close friends, preferably a father, son, or lover, but brother or close friend works. Even a "gender neutral" equivalent can work (Aaron/Erin, Jesse, Jamie, etc.). The name should be common enough to not be surprising. The woman rushes to the other plant's side and tries to tend to his wounds.

The plan can be tweaked based on his psyche profile, but should allow a conversation where the man (or woman possibly) plays it safe but tries to get a way to contact or a future meeting. If nothing is going to plan, the weighted net drops.

If things aren't looking up for that, the woman plant (and maybe man) assist hero on escaping the net, then attempt to extract him with a disguise in a vehicle while a few managers and a few more mooks attempt to "catch" them. This should pretty much guarantee further conversations if they're good actors. If they're bad actors and he isn't buying their cover, we skip straight to the net and tasers. Possibly limb shots as well.

At no point should he see my actual face.

Ah, a good guy. Take innocents "hostage", but hostage in the sense that the super will be responsible for their deaths. Specifically, order the convention staff to simply stand on the edges of the catwalk/bridges but don't do anything. Don't do anything to the staff either, just let them stand there. This would mean that if the super uses his gravity powers on a small object, those poor innocent staff will be pulled by the gravitons and fall to their most grisly deaths.

Since the super has clearly displayed a reluctance for personally murdering his enemies, this will most likely seal off his supernatural usage of small objects, leaving him only with his ability to float around. Your mooks should have no problem taking him down now, because without those small objects, his offensive ability is essentially the same as a baseline human, while his mobility is easily countered by superior numbers.

Yes, the super has done this, but it's on the scale of tens or hundreds of kilograms, not planetary masses. You don't notice the gravitational force exerted by a car driving past you; you wouldn't notice this transfer. The lethal thread comes from hole-punching, not gravitational gradients.

***** Ah, I misunderstood. I thought the threat came from the gravitational force applied by the marble onto the mooks. If the marbles don't have that many gravitons infused, then they should only accelerate downwards with great force, but are otherwise mundane in terms of horizontal force since the super is just throwing them with his baseline human strength.

In that case, since vertical force is the issue, while horizontal force is negligible, I suggest regrouping for another attempt, and this time bringing along a bunch of powerful fans/wind ability users to blow around the super and his marbles horizontally. The fact that the super's ability can only apply vertical forces means that he can't overcome strong horizontal winds, not unless he grabs onto something. But if he's grabbing onto something to avoid being blown around by the wind, that means he isn't dodging, so your mooks can shoot him with tranquilizers.

** Suddenly, in every parallel world where you exist, a magical walkie-talkie appears along with an instruction manual.

This walkie-talkie lets you communicate with the yous from other parallel worlds according to the following rules:

1) Every walkie-talkie has two buttons, labeled "Send" and "Receive". Pressing either button will permanently lock the walkie-talkie into that choice.

2) At every point in time where the number of Senders is less than the number of Receivers, an optimal matching of every Sender to a unique Receiver is created that minimizes the total squared distance between each Sender-Receiver pair, and each matched Receiver plays the sounds in the vicinity of the matching Sender.

3) The total number of walkie-talkies never increases: whenever a parallel world branches, only one of the branches will have the walkie-talkie, the walkie-talkie becomes a mundane primitive lump of metal in all other branches.

4) The sounds emitted by a walkie-talkie in Receive mode can only be heard by you.

5) Any attempt to analyze the technologies/magics involved in the creation of the walkie-talkies will cause the walkie-talkies under analysis to revert into mundane primitive lumps of metal.

So given these magical walkie-talkies, how would you decide when and whether to press the "Send" or "Receive" buttons? (And when, if ever, to destroy the walkie-talkie to change the optimal matching?)

How would your answer change if every world receives two walkie-talkies instead of one?

**** That is one of the issues you have to overcome.

You can assume some kind of super rationality is going on, in the sense that parallel world versions of you are likely to make decisions similar to your own. So for example, if you decided to roll a die and press Send if you get a 1, and press Receive if you get a 2 or 3, you could reasonably expect to see ~1/3 of parallel worlds being Receivers and ~1/6 being Senders.

The Senders could then start talking about all of the knowledge his world knows, especially about technology, so that the Receivers can reap large benefits from such information by recreating those technologies in his own parallel. (Masterpieces of music and literature can also be sent and recreated.)

The problem here is that with that many Receivers, the distance between every Sender world and the Receiver world would probably be very small, so most of the knowledge sent will already be known by the Receiver. You could reduce the odds of being Senders and Receivers much much more to increase the distance, but then that would mean most of the parallel world yous would get no benefit.

So I was really looking to see if anyone had any clever ideas about how to do better.

I immediately discard my lump of metal, and waste no further time hoping it has magical properties. The chances of it remaining magical are essentially zero.

But if actually the walkie-talkies were duplicating during branching, just like me, then I'd contemplate this:

1) Divide the world into square km sections by latitude and longitude.

2) Use a quantum random number generator to pick one.

3) Using all my money, loans, cajoling, etc: acquire the land in question and the mineral rights for it. If I can't reasonably acquire it within a year, skip this step.

4)a: Spend the rest of two years prospecting my new claim and trying to turn it into value.

4)b: Wait if it is apparent my claim is useless.

5)a: If I have profited more than 100 million USD by the end of two years, turn my talkie into a sender and put a device near it playing the coordinates I received and a three-word description of the value I found there.

5)b: If I haven't profited that much, turn my talkie into a receiver. Keep the device on my person until I hear the message of the 'winning' coordinates. Once I do, write it down and smash my talkie.

6): Continue to wait.

If the message is 30 seconds long, I'm awake 18 hours a day, and I only listen twice to write it down, I expect to reach a million alternate selves within three years. The surface area of the Earth is 500 million square kilometers. If there are 500 or more square kilometers on it that are worth more than 100 million and within my reach, all alternate selves will have 100 million USD to play with by the end of five years.

I would do more thorough math if I actually found myself in this situation: it might be better to have senders smash their talkies as well, with longevity proportional to value. It might be better to use 10 square kilometer chunks, or to find a way to exclude the ocean.

*** The problem lies in the fact that /I/ received this opportunity. I receive no benefit unless my walkie-talkie is on Receive, and I'm not altruistic enough to put it on Send just for the sake of potentially helping out a possibly-nonexistent alternate dimension that I will never be able to interact with. I know myself well enough to know that I almost certainly wouldn't select Send in any alternate world, unless events had diverged in such a way that my psychology was significantly different. It's sort of an interdimensional tragedy of the commons.

There's the further problem that anyone on Send wouldn't necessarily know the state of technology on the opposite side. Let's say that somehow one of the alternate versions of me hits Send and is in a sci-fi utopia. He realizes that the other world would likely appreciate the knowledge of how to construct the FTL drives they have in that timeline, but where to begin? Alternate-me can inform whoever's on the other side that the breakthrough allowing FTL travel came when they figured out they needed to shield the warp drive with neutron star material, but that's only useful if the Receiver he's connected to is just slightly behind in technology. You could learn and explain the technology progression from early history onward, but I would run into the problem that I'm neither patient nor intelligent enough to learn and subsequently teach such a breadth of knowledge.

Perhaps I'm just not thinking this through, but it seems like something which I wouldn't be able to utilize at all.

I really only created the rule on branching to limit the number of walkie-talkies, so one world can't become an infinite number of receivers and get all the senders from similar parallels. If it helps, you may assume that the worlds cannot branch at all.

--------------

Felicity's first wish gave her a metal dome for cover, and her second gave her a trapped fortress, not huge in scale, but certainly dwarfing the dome from before. She was sitting on top of the dome, inside the fortress, watching a video feed of an outside camera pointed at the metal box that encased her opponent. Presumably.

There was audio---believe it or not, excellent quality audio---but there wasn't much to hear. The box was thick, maybe a third of a metre of solid metal, so it was a shock to hear sound come through in volume at all at first, but it had died down relatively quickly. Felicity didn't know much about hallucinogens, but whatever it had done with the victim, they hadn't stuck to whatever they were doing before.

Then the paper plane hit the back of her head, and she jumped so fast she tumbled to the ground.

--------------

The task laid out was fivefold. Get a spear, get a flamethrower, wait for her opponent to run out of oxygen, failing that try to lead her into the fortress' traps, and failing that do a bit of stabby stabby.

Getting the weapons was easy; Felicity had an intuitive grasp of the fortress and how to move around and modify it safely. The wish seemed very generous on that front, fulfilling not just the spirit of the wish, but fleshing it out and rounding the corners. The fortress was a bit bigger than a large house, squashed and spread out over a larger area, and with a much, much sturdier build. Waiting for the air to run out, well, that would take a while, but the fortress had drinks^{water} and snacks^{rations}, so she sat by the TV^{external video feed}, cranked the volume up, and after waiting many uneventful hours, finally caved in and took a nap.

...

  All injuries become one tier more severe.
#+end_example

#+begin_example
  [[ Affliction: Bloodlust ]]
  Like a vampire,

#+end_example

Felicity was up and heading for combat in seconds, before regaining her composure and back checking the video feed. She wanted to win, and she wanted it now, but even so she didn't want to end up dead. Oxygen deprivation wasn't going to cut it, but the rest of the plan could be handled with restraint. She moved out of the fortress, weapons in hand, and looked for an entrance to the chamber of hallucinations.

The box was formed of four metal walls that had driven themselves up from the ground, somehow joining at airtight angles. They were sloped inwards slightly, and the ceiling seemed to be literally just a thick, metal plate that had fallen on top of it. Moving around the side revealed a circular vault door, the kind that sits flush with the sides and has a protruding, circular handle to open it. A moment later the door was unlocked, still with no noise inside the chamber, and Felicity opened it cautiously, standing behind the bulk of the door with the flamethrower in one hand and backing away from wherever she thought the hallucinogens might spread to.

Then the lights in the room turned on, and her opponent was seen standing at the opposite wall, hands by her side, gazing into open space. Felicity shouted at her to grab her attention, but there was no response; her opponent just stood there, gazing, from inside the room. She tried a bunch more times, but at best got muted, distant responses. Felicity was worried the hallucinogens had spread to her, so she made a choice, backing off to hyperventilate to get oxygen pumped into her lungs, and then charging into the room, spear raised.

The spear hit her opponent and bent, barely denting the skin. Felicity sprained both her wrists in the process, perhaps because of the effects of =[[ Sudden Death ]]=, but she grimaced through, raised her flamethrower, and let it fire.

*Arlene Lewis defeated!*

--------------

The next wish for you to munchkin is again ‘ten times the mundane, ten times the magic... well, give or take'. You should know the drill by now.

Since this is [[/r/rational]], I have some comments concerning rational optimization. To be frank, before researching hallucinogens and discovering just how potent some are, I expected Felicity to end up dead. These are some comments on the suggestions given for the chapter.

1. People don't risk running out of oxygen; they get carbon dioxide poisoning first. A small room would still take multiple days for this to happen, and Arlene was not in a small room, so we're talking something like a week of waiting, at which point dehydration is a bigger issue. This was also not going to waste her stamina, since “her strength was purely magical in nature, and it took no special effort to engage.”

2. Arlene “stabbed a grip into the smooth steel” with her hand, and took no injury from it. She is probably not going to die if a normal human runs up to her and pokes her with a spear.

3. Leading Arlene into the fortress would not have been particularly safe, because if she was aware enough to respond productively, you would have been leading around someone vastly faster than you, who could have killed you with any stray movement.

4. Your fortress contained traps said to be using poisons, and even if it didn't I had allowed for ‘fairly free reign'. Throwing a canister of poison into Arlene's room would have been comparatively very safe and very effective. (I'm not saying this is the most optimal solution.)

In the end I'm glad Felicity survived, even if it was a bit anticlimactic.

  I wish for a member of a largely emotionless alien race from space, which bargain with prepubescent females, which they consider maximally emotional, so they can harvest their emotions to produce negentropy. Their side of the bargain is that they use magic, which is powered by said emotions, to fulfil arbitrary wishes with strength proportional to the expected emotions of the wisher, and in return they ask the wisher to perform harvesting tasks that eventually result in the wisher turning into a ‘witch' and themselves being harvested at a later date. This Kyubey should then offer Felicity a wish.
#+end_quote

Is this an accurate interpretation?

***** Exactly. The witch part would have been a problem but we only have 2 more battles ahead.

****** There are ten rounds, as mentioned in the first chapter. I've only brainstormed a subset of the 1024 contestants for effort reduction reasons; if you win next round I'll probably brainstorm another bunch.

******* Still doesn't matter much as we can just use our quest-wishes to trivialize the risk of witching out, like wishing for some other form of magic that comes with a replenishment method to get around the problem that there's no witches to get Grief Seeds from.

*** One-on-one against a self-enhancing Wisher, we are in /trouble/. I think it's seriously time for a good defensive self-enhancement.

I wish for /speed/. This will allow me to dodge pretty near anything that the next person tries to throw at me, and will allow me to lead them through my trapped fortress with impunity.
