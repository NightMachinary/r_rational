In response to [[http://en.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/24gaex/q_should_we_have_writing_competitions_here/][the thread suggesting them]]... our first writing competition!

Unlike - I assume - most of them, this is a meta-competition to see what exactly people want (and put the heavy lifting on you guys, rather than mods who really should be working on a report due next week).

[[/u/AmeteurOpinions]] notes:

#+begin_quote
  Most other writing-oriented subreddits have some sort of weekly or monthly contest, coordinated by the sub's mods and open to suggestions by their users. ... I have no ideas on what sorts of challenges the contest would actually entail, though. Thoughts?

  Edit: And if we do, what sorts of prompts would we use?
#+end_quote

*So: in the spirit of +slacking off+ being open to suggestions, how should a writing competition work?* Entries can include things like a suggested format, prompts, topics, etc. Bonus points to ideas which are implementable enough to post as the first competition!


** I think we should try something simple for the first time, since we'll need to work out how to best format the event and everything. I've messaged the mods of [[/r/fantasywriters]] (they run excellent writing contests) to that regard.

I would also like to drop [[http://www.terrybisson.com/page2/page2.html][Terry Bission's 60 Rules For Short Fiction]]. Extremely relevant and useful advice, paticularly:

#+begin_quote
  3 The SF reader is a gamer who brings a problem-solving intelligence to the story. This is the SF writer's one great advantage. Use it.

  4 The more extraordinary the idea, the more ordinary the language. Experimental writing is for quotidian events. James Joyce and Virginia Woolf understood this.

  41 Novels are made out of characters and events. Short stories are made out of words alone. They are all surface. Polish.

  54 Withhold as much information as possible for as long as possible. When the reader knows everything, the story is over.

  59 Ignore these rules at your peril.

  60 Peril is the SF short story writer's accomplice, adversary, and friend.
#+end_quote

Edit:

Has anything like this ever been attempted at LessWrong?

I'll also link to [[http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction][EY's fiction]], since he's basically the gold standard.

And heck, why not [[http://qntm.org/fiction][qntm's]] while I'm at it?

**** I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]], a crossover between Doctor Who and Harry Potter, and it has a few of the best 'reasonable explanations for a seemingly crazy canon' I have ever seen in Harry Potter. Not particularly rational as fiction goes, but still pretty awesome anyways.

I am going to list a couple of the best examples from the fic below, but really you should just go read the whole thing, it's pretty amazing.

#+begin_quote
  PWATWT Ch. 13 - Duology (II) on Quidditch:

  #+begin_quote
    [Of course, quidditch was unusually interesting, come to notice it. It was a universal constant. Everyone was into it, even Asenion Izzard was a quidditch buff. Up to a point it made sense: a spectator sport with plenty of violence for the kiddies and plenty of graphable statistics for nerdy grown-ups was a perfect recipe for broad popularity. But with /that/ degree of enthusiasm?

    Oh. Oh ho ho. Wait. Of /course/ it's that popular, how could it not be?

    It's a ritual. A ritual performed by teams containing the occultly significant number of /seven players. Every match is an act of magic in and of itself./ But why and to what end?

    Obvious, really: In what passes for my memory, alchemists are silly people who save their own urine and discover phosphorous by accident. Here they're enormously puissant people who fail to run the world...because they're wrapped up in quidditch. /Quidditch is a memetically-engineered auto-hypnotic socio-magical control mechanism designed to tie up wizard minds!/

    Okay, /that's/ sorted, back to the Trophy Room Problem.]

#+begin_quote
  PWATWT Ch. 12 - Duology (I) on Neville's Remembrall:

  #+begin_quote
    "What /good/ is it?" he said. "Of course I've /forgotten/ something. Everyone's forgotten /something/. Goes without saying. What's the point of an /aide-m√©moire/ that just discreetly points out you've forgotten something without telling you what it /is/?" The only reason to do that would be if you wanted to be reminded /that/ you'd forgotten something you don't want to remember just yet, /and in that case she should have sent it to me, not Neville ---/

    Oh. Hello unexpected insight.

    /--- but it's not for me, it's for/ him/!/

    /He knows his faults! he doesn't need to be reminded of them! he needs to know how to/ fix /them and/ this can't help!

    /This is nothing more than an insult./

    The Remembrall disappeared into his closing hand.

    /I hate --/

    Wrong word. Not hate. Hate was for burnt toast...

***** It's a CSS thing. I'm not sure that you can have both special flair and custom flair - [[/r/worldbuilding]] only has special flair. In my mind, there would be a little 16x16 pixel image next to the user's name, which would be followed by whichever text flair they wanted. That you can do by having a special CSS class for the flair. Give me a bit and I can experiment with implementing a mix on one of my test subreddits to see what works best - it might be that the only real way to do it is to grant a flair that the user can later override with plain text, assuming you can't "double flair".

Edit: There's a tutorial [[http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/m59kf/user_flair_tutorial_7_easy_steps_to_enable/][here]]. Basically, you'd let the users pick their own text but you'd hand-assign special flair via CSS. I will have to test to see whether this works as expected, but that's my solution right now.

** This might go without saying, but I would expect the bulk of our contests to take the form of a prompt about which to write a rational story. I would expect this prompt to be some sort of trope, either of rational fiction or of fiction in general, for entrants to embrace or violate or warp.

The other thing I can see us doing is perhaps more unique to our community. This genre has a habit of re-writing works from outside the genre (see: HPMOR and the bazillion copycats thereof). Because of this, we could have contests specifically for fanfiction. [[/u/Threedoge]] suggests explaining why some aspect of a story that seems not to make sense actually does make sense. We could also have "how it should have ended"s, in which some character or characters in an established work take some shortcut to the ending of the story they want. I'm sure there are many other possibilities in this vein, and these are fairly broad, so we may want to limit them further.

*** I second this; such fanfiction also makes for an easy way to produce writing prompts. The one potential problem with that is that if the writing cues are specific to a given story (e.g. "how would Frozen have ended if X were a rationalist?"), it does limit the participants to those who have seen or read it.

***** I support this plan. It's really hard to write any rational fiction at all, and to write a lot of it is a lot harder. And I don't think we should have competitions that last for over a month or so; better to have a lot of weekly competitions than like 2 yearly ones. And not too many of the people of [[/r/rational]] have the free time for writing long rational fictions in a short amount of time, so the competitions should be about writing very short fictions in order to gain more competitors.

I think having everybody write things that are about the length of Lord of the Rationality would be nice.

***** The problem I have with some of the Omakes is that they seem to be more about signaling rationality than about being actually rational. I know this is a problem inherent to the genre of flash-fiction, but I think [[/r/rational]] should try to transcend that.

****** Lord of the Rationality, the longest Omake, was legitimately rational, and a lot more of a serious fiction than some of the other Omakes (like the He-Man one, which was a single joke sentence). If we could get a bunch of people on this subreddit to participate in a competition to write the best/most rational Lord-of-the-Rationality-style short fiction, I think that'd be pretty great.

** Enforce a small wordcount and/or time limit to get more writers (and more readers). [[http://365tomorrows.com/][365 tomorrows]] has a 600 word limit, and their stories are fine. [[http://thirtyminuteponies.tumblr.com/][Thirty Minute Ponies]] gave writers a 30-minute limit and usually featured stories in the 1000-word range; some lovely things were written there.

You might also want to restrict fanfic writing to well-known franchises. Series like Naruto, Harry Potter, Evangelion, My Little Pony, Sailor Moon etc... are extremely well known and it is more likely that readers will be familiar with them.
