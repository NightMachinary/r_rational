** It is still interesting, but i found the 1st chapter more interesting..

Should I understand from you description that the holy grail in this fic doesn't grant wishes, but instead answers questions?

Also it may be intentional but so far i don't see how what is described explains the need for 7 mages fighting for the right to ask a question..

With absolute power and knowledge, it's basically the same thing.

**** Hmm i don't know, some things are just not possible with knowledge alone. I mean you can always phrase a question as "how could i make <wish> come true", but while its a valid question some cases will just have a null\"you can't" answer.

from the link you provide:

#+begin_quote
  If a task is absolutely physically impossible no matter what plan or path one could use, it is still impossible. For example, a user of this power cannot simply make objects appear out of thin air or warp reality. If, however, the user has enough time and resources, they may be able to find ways to attain these "impossible" goals.
#+end_quote

What is physically impossible of course depends on the universe of the story\what the author decides , but still it is different than the original described in the fate series, at least as far as I am aware of it(just watched the series, never played the games).

***** True, but what actually is physically impossible according to the laws of the universe is unknowable unless you actually know the laws of that universe fully.

Easy to see from a creator's perspective outside looking in, less so from the inside looking out.

****** After thinking about it some more I think that while technically as far as tools for the author go it allows for about the same things. If it -doesn't- actually make a difference then why is it there? why change it if its doing the same thing?

Its like having gun which is described as not working when humidity is higher then 70%, if the character lives in a desert and is never going to be effected by this limitation, then why specify it in the first place? basically Chekhov's gun.

***** In a universe where magic exists, knowledge is literally power. If you ask the Grail how to do something that is physically impossible, it might say "do this magic ritual".

******** In universe of course you would do that, though it would still be better to go to a grail which fulfills the wish(probably).

My point though was mostly from storytelling perspective, I wanted to know if there was any particular reason to change that aspect of canon..

*********** Although this grail doesn't literally grant wishes, a carefully worded query will effectively grant a wish. Also, since it is smart, it's better at solving certain kinds of problems than the Holy Grail. Uh, to explain further, huge spoilers for F/Z. So, at the end of Fate/Zero:

#+end_quote

if that is the case are you confirming that in your fic magic has no real limit? i.e. if someone made a properly worded "wish" which had the spirit of "how could i destroy the universe 5 seconds after hearing your answer" the grail will be able to give some kind of incantation which would destroy the universe? If so why change the wording?

That should answer your confusion.

Regarding what kind of things you could do with The Divine Grail: it's still limited by the rules of the magic system. If there is a way to destroy the world in 5 seconds then yeah I guess the Grail could answer that. But there's have to be a way for that to be possible, ya dig? It doesn't rewrite the laws of physics.

Yeah I got that, but you said "a carefully worded query will effectively grant a wish." which didn't specify a limitation so i asked if that meant you verified that in the fic magic has no limit, seeing as you are the author and in theory if you decide the world is built that way then anything -will- be possible. anyhow i mostly wanted to be sure there were differences and it wasn't just a different explanation, you can just show the rest in the fic :)

****** I'm still planning this part out, but I think question-answering also won't limited by things like "your query must be a singular question" but more like "The Grail only has a information gathered from before the questioning begins, and a limited (if massive) amount of power. If you ask questions and change the state of the world in a big way, The Grail's info is gonna be less relevant since it was gathered before you did X Y Z"
