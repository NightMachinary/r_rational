** So Ray is both the spy AND the one who started the escape. It sounds like he was trying to play both sides. If the escape was looking good, he could do that. If it looked like it was going to fail, he would just fully betray them and stay with Mama.

** I feel so stupid right now. I suspected Ray of being the spy, but only as a new one. Of course Mama wouldn't have accepted a new informant so easily!

As a shounen manga, I'm going to say the reason Ray is working for Mama is because Ray originally was "selfish" enough to only care about his survival.

** My guess is that Ray and Mama are related (sister, mother idk).

The thing about Mama holding a child at all times is a big hurdle.

An awesome chapter. I think we'll learn more about the world next time

*** My guess is that Ray found out the truth independantly a long time ago. Since Ray seems to be the most pragmatic out of the group, Mama probably explained just how dire his situation is and offered him perks in exchange for loyalty.

Perhaps she even told him that he might one day be a Papa.

But Ray wouldn't take her word that he would be safe from being shipped. So he set an escape plan in motion so that he would have another option instead of just blindly trusting Mama (who had already proven herself untrustworthy). The reason he waited so long is because their projected shipping date was soon and he had less to lose by gambling closer to the date he would have been killed anyways.

I just don't think Mama is the type to cling to sentimentality and spare him because he's related. I also don't think the Demons would let someone look after their own family members.

**** It's also possible that he recognised the need to improve his chances of escape by acquiring more knowledge and skills (and pushing the other main two to do the same).

Incidentally, this would explain why Ray didn't want to bring the younger kids. If all he wanted to do was inform on them, he wouldn't need to make a point of being callous; slipping under the radar would suffice. If he genuinely wanted to give himself the greatest chance of escape, he would.

However, it would also make sense if he were just playing a role as the pragmatist to avoid suspicion, so I'd say my point is only weak evidence for the "Ray is hedging his bets" proposition. The bigger evidence is that it fits his character perfectly.

** So, all of those who predicted he was just pretending to be on mama's side...

You have chosen... poorly.
