** Hmm, benefits of electric lighting: no more worrying about torches blown out by winds.

Downsides of electric lighting: If the generator/circuit gets damaged, all the lights go off, and monsters spawn literally everywhere.

*** And that is why you build substations and multiple generation sites. Our current power grid is a hot mess, but at least its a hot mess that can usually get power back up within the hour. Although, if theyre going to really have this take off theyre going to need to invent transformers to do step-up/step-down shenanigans to properly propagate electricity without melting the cables and towers they use. Let alone the fact that theyre probably using single phase AC power, which is even less efficient (im assuming its single phase AC, we have no idea how detailed Rain went into the subject of electromagnetism Staavo, and 1-p AC seems the simplest generator to make to me). Theyre looking at many city fires in until they can really work on their safety measures and get 3-p AC going.

**** There's also the low tech option of using electrical lighting as a redundant system alongside ever-burning torches.

***** Especially since evertorches are an option, I think this is the way to go. As [[/u/PDNeznor]] said there's a lot of logistics between the current state of affairs and an electrically-lit city, but supplementing evertorches and regular torches with electric light when necessary would be a great help.

****** Yeah, the problem with evertorches is that they're really hard to make in bulk. And the problem with electricity is that it's really hard to get 100% uptime. But evertorches have 100% uptime by default, and electricity isn't expensive, once you know the trick to it, so each can cover for the weaknesses of the other.

**** I'll be kinda disappointed if that kind of technically difficult problem gets solved soon. (On the other hand, could justify with superhuman mental stats, but then how do you justify people not figuring things out before?)

Maybe Tallheart can solve all their problems through magitech.

  "The monsters are too fresh. They haven't had the time to collect any essence, chemical or otherwise."
#+end_quote

I'm starting to think there is going to be a way to break someone's cap without a blue.

Rain had mentioned that there was something fishy with the essence terminology as well. Something about the essence well skill.

**** You know, the Discord and the chapter comments are always full of "he needs to break the cap, maybe he can do it by X", but this is the first X that has sounded even slightly plausible to me -- in fact, it makes a lot of sense. Kudos.

***** I'm somewhat doubtful that it's this simple, but I suppose the combination of no one taking auras and there being no other reason to pump monsters full of mana could make it unknown.

The other weird consequence is that his pet crystal slime(s) would probably be the first blue, because he's always feeding it mana. Which would mean someone would probably kill it.

**** That is one thing that is bugging me. In that particular line I quoted, he is not talking about essence in the context of blues. He is talking about crysts.

Could crysts be physical essence? Maybe that's the key to the cap problem.

** There's a reference in there to that snake seeing Val despite Transparency. My first instinct was to think that this was due to Transparency being only for visible light and not affecting his thermal radiation, but I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be that, or something else like vibration/smell.

** I still can't wrap around how talent can get you nowhere in this world from what we seen so far. Even choosing new awakened was based off a lottery system. Isn't it more rational for a nation to hold tournaments for the unawakened to choose who gets awakened? Like tournaments for the best swordsman, the best crafter, or the best smith. It should be commonplace already but the people in fel sadanis did not even mention anything about it or a nation doing so.
