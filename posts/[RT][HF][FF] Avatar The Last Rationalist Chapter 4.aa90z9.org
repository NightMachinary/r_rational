[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13057460/4/Avatar-The-Last-Rationalist]] Hi all. Sorry for the delay. It's been a very busy two months at my job. Thanks and have a nice day.


** Loving it so far! One small request... don't apologize for taking "too long" between chapters! Take your time and release when you're ready :)

*** Thanks. I have the story somewhat planned out, but it's going to be really long so i got to make sure everything is consistent. The middle of the story of course is the greatest danger of lagging so I have to be careful there.

** It looks pretty promising. The only nitpick I have is how he assumed that they use same dating as we use now. For all he knew it could have been x years after the birth of Vladimir Putin.

*** Thanks. That assumption is one Aang will address later on. I got to even out the scientific dilemmas he face throughout the story or else it will just be a science rant against Avatar imo. Though thanks for reminding me I kind of forgot about this issue and how their calendars and units of measurements will work.

**** On the other hand, this kind of issues should maybe be cleared in the start to a) leave more room for other kind of stuff, and b) show the guy is actually smart and notices these things.

***** I'm curious. How would you introduce the issues with language and measurements while dealing with the whole South Pole subplot? I could do a rewrite in the future to make it more palatable. I'm kind of new to writing as I'm just following guides right now and editing them when I have time. Thanks for the suggestion.

****** Heh, I'm only planning to write stuff myself. Don't take me as any kind of authority. ;)

These just feel so... small, but important bits that they shouldn't be all littered throughout the fic. I think you could have a paragraph or a chapter where the MC would have "the talk" with folks he finds, trying to make sense where he is and either spam them there or just say they talked about all these issues and he decided he is not in Kansas anymore and call it a day.

I'll still read this either way. It just feels like characters are often not curious at all to actually solve things when they find a friend and could ask all these questions.

On the other hand, it could well fit the character to be very disoriented and not thinking coherently yet, as he just had a heart attack and was thawed out of ice. Icy brains not good. If he was coherent, first priority before even figuring out where he is could well be exploring his newfound powers. I'd forgive him for any weird thinking right now.

edit: And I'm mostly talking about him figuring out where he is and who he is and what kind of world he is in. Especially what is this magic everyone is using. The whole translation machine/magic thingy probably needs more exploring anyway and he can't get straight answers to that from them.

But it's your story, you do you.

******* I was going to do that, but I thought it would lead to an exposition onslaught for three fourths of the chapter. I'll probably have the talk and exploring his airbending powers in the next three chapters to compensate. Thanks for the advice. I would love to read your stuff!

******** Would all the exposition need to be given to reader immediately? Part of the information could be boring and not so relevant and you could just let the MC have a degree of understanding about the world after the talk so he doesn't have to be surprised about everything. Could say Gran Gran told him about a basic thing behind the scenes when a basic thing appears. So the exposition wouldn't have to be that long, but the character could still know some things.

********* True. I guess I'll use that technique later on in the story. I'll have more exposition revealed to him later.

**** maybe the same thing that translates all the languages also translates all the units of measurement?

***** I thought about that, but then there was the issue of decimals when converting between units. If there were different units throughout the nations then I think people might start to notice the translation service when it translates units.

A) One solution would be to have only two systems of units. One for the Earth Kingdom and the other for the Fire Nation. The water tribes will use the Earth Kingdom's by default since they side with them. I'll make the conversion simple like 2 FN units = 1 EK units = .745 meters (I'll make it more exotic for Aang's units).

B) The other is to just make it so that everyone in the world uses the same units of measurement and only Aang can hear the measurement conversions since he expects it to be different. I could say 1 world unit = .745 meters or something like that.

Honestly it's a fight between convenience and realism I guess. Let me know what you think and thanks for commenting!

****** Honestly I think translating between languages has a similar problem. Similar words and phrases in different languages don't always match up exactly one to one. Just like converting between units will sometimes cause a rounding error, converting between languages will cause certain connotations and meaning to be lost in translation. I don't see how this is any different.

******* That's true. Thinking of it now I wonder how the machine would do accents. Like imagine Aang just hears Katara and Sokka speaking in British accents.Oh well guess you win some lose some with a translation machine.
