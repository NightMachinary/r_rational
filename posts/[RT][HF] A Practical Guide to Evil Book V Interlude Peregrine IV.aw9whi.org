** It'd be interesting to see Mercy in face of the flowering of those to whom mercy was rendered. Namely, Pilgrim was able to lay aside vengeance because of the consequences and suffering enacting that vengeance would bring. And I don't necessarily think he'd relapse on sight, but I'm curious how seeing either the retired prince, doing well by himself and heaven's light in the house of light, or the daughter heir, either serving admirably or reprising her father's mistakes, would make him feel, and more importantly how he thinks it ought to make him feel.

*** It's the Prince of Orense these days. He was mentioned in the epilogue of Book 2.

Remember the events of this chapter took place fifty years before the Tenth Crusade.

*** The Pilgrim is empowered by what is widely recognized as the ultimate moral authority of the setting. In many ways he is more sanctioned than any individual that is empowered by purely moral laws.

**** Yeah, this is not a "right or wrong depending on your point of view situation". The Prince had a foreign leader murdered to curb competition on his silver mines. Killing him isn't exactly the height of arbitrary vigilantism.

***** That may or may not be true, but it has not been found to be so by a properly constituted Tribunal of the People. In any case the alleged act, if proven, would only be the usual corrupt jockeying of foreign autocrats; the victim being, herself, a "hereditary noble", one may reasonably question whether it was even a crime.
