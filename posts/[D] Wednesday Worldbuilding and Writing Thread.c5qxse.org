Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I'm still plotting out that story where the main character has the ability to passively gain beneficial traits from anything organic that he eats. At some point, I might be making this story a multicross, with many new settings introduced.

What is some interesting biology from other fictional settings that you think is interesting?

Also, you all gave some really good advice for real adaptations, so if you've got more of that I'd love to hear it!

*** The obvious low-hanging fruit here would be DC, Marvel, Worm, and other superhero settings. Chock-full of absurd and absurdly overpowered biologically-based superpowers: Kryptonians, Asgardians, Bonesaw's experiments, and so on. You could even consider some funky synergies with Crawler from Worm, whose power is /also/ focused on biological adaptation (and there are probably dozens of characters similar to him in other franchises).

But if I had to talk about fictional biology I found most /interesting/, and not overpowered specifically, then it would probably be the main character and other shapeshifter species from Everybody Loves Large Chests. Pretty cool overall.

**** Thanks!

Yep, all those are likely to make an appearance. Gaining the powers themselves would be too OP, but gaining biological features (even ones induced by powers) is generally fair game.

By this metric, Kryptonians and other beings of that level would be fine, but honestly I might make specific exceptions to things like that - it's just too much power. Repeatedly eating Crawler until he can't anymore is definitely going to happen at some point.

Generally, full free shapeshifting is a direction I don't want to go, but there will be some more limited kinds. For example, obviously there are octopuses, and on the more fantastical bent from other settings there are kandra from Mistborn, who can shapeshift as much as their knowledge (and gastronomic history) allows, but they can't make hard tissue.

To me the main problem with full, unrestricted shapeshifting (especially the supernaturally empowered kind) is that with enough knowledge, logically it enables the ability to split off biomass from yourself and create an army just by eating. Obviously there are ways to mitigate this, but I don't think there are reasonable ways to prevent it from /eventually/ happening.

**** Ha! Funny thing, I'm actually thinking this fic would /start off/ in MHA. The way I'm likely to have it, is that they can't gain the quirks themselves, only products of them.

For example, he could gain a strength boost by eating the hyper-efficient muscles of someone with biologically based super strength, but eating someone who had super strength based on their quirk magically directly applying force wouldn't result in any gain. TBH, I think this is the only way it could work without being OP, since the MC's quirk /already/ optimises things to avoid accruing negative traits. Otherwise he could just go grave robbing for an absurd power boost.

Other superhero settings are likely to function the same way. Basically, if it's biologically plausible it's fair game, but if it's too weird then it's not gonna happen.

***** That is a pretty good way of doing it. Has the power still be strong but not 'I can solo the world with my eyes closed' strong.

Also while reading your comment I just rememberd that the [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/7887/Toriko][Toriko manga]] was a thing and it is mostly biological baced shonnen super powers with some food baced mysticism thrown in there. It's like the author took a look at what biology can do in the real world and cranked that shit up to 11 ... out of a possible 5.

You got trees that grow so fast their branches can chase and hunt people down, animals who's survival instinct are so good they can predict and react to threats years before they happen while on the other side of the planet, a character who's 'hair' is actually a set of hyper thin prehensile tentacles that can bind opponents up and intimidation and social combat being a thing with Toriko being able to make a grown man piss himself in the first chapter and being able to avoid fights with animals stronger than him by being so threatening they don't want to mess with him. The manga has a few problems, the ending being rushed the main one, but I adore the power system and 'natural world x100,000,000' flavoring behind it.

*** Most of the D&D Monster Manual

It's even sorted out for you! Your character should be able to gain any ability tagged Ex, which means it comes from the monster being simply exceptional. The other categories of special abilities are Su or Sp, which boil down to "magic" and thus probably don't count.

For example, if your character ate some [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/vampire.htm][vampire steaks]], they could get the ability to drain blood, fast healing, resistance to electricity and cold, the ability to climb like a spider, and a bit of resistance to priests - but not the ability to dominate folks with a glance.

Also, arguably, eating bits of an entity with higher stats should grant the character stat points.

*** I would want two things out of such a story.

Firstlly, I want to see an exploration of the social stigma surrounding cannibalism and the disgust/selfloath that could come from eating people, ideally in some kind of analogy to veganism. I feel that there needs to be a good, and preferably utilitarian, excuse for why someone need to use that power.

Possible themes to explore includes rules such as 'only eat non-sentient beings' however in most universes the truly powerful beings as sentient so it's a severe limitation. If I were in this case I might make a rule that I would never eat a sentient being that I myself killed in order to avoid becoming someone who makes up flimsy excuses to hunt down people. Or have a very strict rule about what people have to have done for me to hunt them down. You could possibly do it in a humane way(i.e. drug someone, slice a piece of delicious meat from them, and use a restorative power to restore said meat).

Secondly, I want to see someone be smart about this strong a power. In the few stories I know of with a protagonist with this kind of metapower, the power accumulation always start out with an accident and the protagonist just gains powers as story appropriate. I want the protagonist to gather information and find the best approach to gaining a well rounded power set. At minimum you want some kind of offensive power, some kind of all purpose defence(forcefield, dragonscales, being able to turn into mist, possibly mental defence as well.) and some kind of fast movement(teleportation is ideal but fast running or flying can work), information gathering power and anti information powers, as well as any power that aids in power accumulation(such as a way of generating money so you can buy people's redundant organs, temporarily neutralize powers, generating people's muscles, restoring muscles to long deseased powerusers etc.)

In terms of actually answering your questions, other have already done a good job of covering most things. I'll add that there's a good chunk of biopunk universes(e.g. twig), the parasytes in the Parasyte anime are biological, in the naturo verse chakra is stored and controlled biologically(I think?), and in a good chunk of magical universes the magic is stored physically somewhere. Though I would stay the heck away from the naruto verse until I had mental defences and the heck away from Parasyte until I had a lot of physical powers going for me.

Yeah, at some points there are going to be situations where it's arguably the right move to eat a person's body. Whether or not the character would go for it is another matter entirely that relies on the specifics of it all. Your note about settings rules for hunting down and killing people and the justifying thereof is a good one, and though I've thought of it before you've definitely expanded on it.

Eating only non-sapients is going to be the main rule they abide by. While it's true that the best powers are usually reserved for the people of a given setting rather than the animals, there are still many powerful creatures that you don't need to feel guilty about killing to eat.

And, it's not just fictional organisms on the menu. The story is going to start out in My Hero Academia, which is basically Earth with superpowers and a bit in the future. There are loads of awesome powers you could gain just from real organisms, plus I think I can easily justify unexpected synergies. What the power actually does is optimise his body based and input and criteria, with the input being the food that it can select from, and the criteria being how it makes those selections. These criteria include, to some degree, the wishes of the user, but it's still a passive power rather than active so it's never going to be full controllable.

In regards to the MC being smart about his power, that's definitely going to happen, but I think you're overestimating the gains he can make. Pretty much any power that is basically just magic isn't going to be acquirable. Generally only macro scale physical features will be available, and while there will be some exceptions (special cells that lack senescence etc) gaining whole powers isn't a direction I want to go.

For example, if someone has the power to fly through generation of reactionless thrust, he's not going to be able to gain that by eating it. Same thing goes for powers like telekinesis, teleportation etc. But he can totally gain things like acid spit, hyperefficient biology, radio eyes etc.

I'm inclined to stick with this limitation when it comes to other settings, too. Some magic abilities will be on the menu, many will not. He could still gain and learn some forms of magic that are available through other methods, but that'll be limited too.

Looking at what I've written, I feel like maybe I've dialled down the MC's power too low, but maybe not. I honestly do think staying on the lower level of possible power for this idea is beneficial, since even with all these restrictions he's going to be maybe still a bit OP.

Due to the unreliable nature of when and how powers manifest in My Hero Academia, the first use of it will definitely be an accident. But you can rest assured that afterwards he'll be doing his best to gain the most from it. He's not going to be some hypercompetent genius about it, but he IS going to be realistically smart about it. There is going to be a bit of the story mirroring real life in that he's obviously going to use the internet and other resources to look up interesting things to eat, just like I am doing to find interesting bits for the story.

Now we're finally up to the reply to your final paragraph, sorry about that. Twig, Parasyte, and Naruto are all most likely going to make an appearance. Still good suggestions though. I think next time I post about this story I should include a list of what I've already thought of or had suggested to me. Your mention of other biopunk universes intrigues me, could you name some? Twig is the only real one that I could think of.

IIRC you could justify that having no chakra at all would protect against mental attacks in Naruto, and even without it he may be able to stay out of sight for long enough to remedy this weakness. Physical toughness is likely to be one of our MC's highest stats, right behind perception (note: this isn't a litrpg ;P), so parasytes aren't likely to be too much of a problem, especially since they're typically alone - and once you've eaten one the others aren't near as much of a threat. It's partly for this reason that I'm actually thinking of just transplanting the parasytes into some other setting as some bio-experiment, like Star Wars or something(their psychic sense would slot well into force sensitivity). They're the only real interesting thing about their setting, so I feel like not much would be lost here anyway.

Phew! That was a long one! Thanks for giving me so much to think about though, I relish the opportunity to dive into these things.

**** I love Super Minion! Yes, it is a little like that, but there is a difference in my mind that is very important. This difference is the fact that Tofu analyses, understands and reproduces the biology and my MC do not (or rather, only understands it on a basic level). This means he doesn't have too much potential to become an expert biologist turned mad scientist, which I generally favour from a story perspective. Better to keep things at a lower level as much as possible without feeling contrived, if you ask me.

Going with the Super Minion approach, the main character necessarily has to understand the biology on a deep and practical level to produce results. Obviously, this knowledge and skill can have all sorts of unintended and unknown consequences and paths of action. Since I don't have anything like that knowledge, I wouldn't be able to do all of that justice, so I prefer to limit the options.

I think having biology function somewhat like static upgrades is a good direction to go, because it can still be pretty interesting (biology is fascinating) and makes this story actually feasible for me to write.

Sorry, I seem to go on a lot. Obviously I've got a ways to go before I'll be writing this story. And it's really late right now so brain don't work good.

** I'll apologize in advance for any mistakes I make regarding community guidelines. This is my first time commenting or posting here, and while I have read them, I may accidentally slip up.

So, I am trying to build a superhero setting from an alternate history where a meteorite containing a special serum was able to give a select few U.S. soldiers superpowers in World War 2. Essentially, they replaced the development of nuclear weapons as it happened in real life.

This leads to the U.S. being a much more powerful superpower and throwing their weight around because they have the superpowered muscle to back it up.

EDIT: I should have added more.

Everyone gets a different superpower from the serum, and their children have a chance of having superpowers. The powers are not exactly the same though, and are not even guaranteed to be similar.

About ~5 years after the war ends is when superheroes become government sanctioned crime fighters.

The two things that I would caution are flip side of the same coin. If an event is due to a long-term trend, then a small deviation in surrounding events are unlikely to change it much. On the other hand, if something only happened because the right sequence of events happened at the right time, then a small deviation in that sequence of events will absolutely chance things.

As an example, Kennedy probably would have passed some kind of expansion of civil rights, even if he hadn't been assassinated and LBJ did so in his name. On the other hand, the terrific expense of the moon missions may have caused them to be scrapped if Kennedy hadn't been shot, because a lot of that impetus came from his death.

And the US probably would have ended up in another Middle East war if 9/11 hadn't happened. And Congress may even have found a way to pass the Patriot Act, or something like it. But the Department of Homeland Security probably wouldn't have been created if a profound attack hadn't shown Americans just how bad their federal agencies were at communicating with each other.

*** Some of this depends on how powerful the powers that the supersoldiers get. You could imagine some supers that can assure mutually assured destruction however most powers wouldn't, which would have a significant impact on the progress of the cold war.

I imagine that the US would use most of this serum on it's soldiers meaning that you damn well want to be sure that your vets gain a good pension and a good therapist to avoid them blowing up train stations and whatever.

I think that it's a mistake to have supers become crimefighters from an optimization point of view. Superstrong supers violate conservation of energy and can be used to produce renewable electricity, used for research to understand where the holes in our understanding of physics are, and can for many purposes replace multiple squats of soldiers/tanks/battlecruisers.

Personality enhancing powers would make great politicians, spies, teachers, or would just quickly rise to the top of whatever organization they were in. Mental enhancing powers would make great researchers, city-planners, advicers, economists, and anything related to investment or risk. Mind-reading is excellent for negotiations. Same goes for folks that have powers related to post or precognition. People with telekinesis can make a killing in transportation or heavy menial Labour.

There's a lot better uses of supers than to send them after criminals, especially when the number of super criminals should be low when the US government have control of the source of powers.

**** Very good point, and I've been thinking about it. In this setting, the idea of being a 'superhero' is an American cultural trend. All comics as of 1941 were made as war propaganda to boost morale for the people that were using real powers now.

The sanctioning of heroes is mostly to give the public a sense of safety after some scuffles between the super community and the civilians.

All the same, I should give some thought to those supers who would rather go into a more traditional field. After 70+ years, there's really no way that it should be an uncommon phenomena unless some sort of law is put into place outlawing it, which just seems silly.

** I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas /about the magic/ not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bzscca/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/eqyoele/][Previous Here]] (I missed a week).

Death Magic. Death magic is related to flesh magic, except it instead reverses the biological process to bring the flesh to it's original state as long as the enchantment lasts. Death magic is powered by arbitrary matter (including optionally the flesh it is being applied to), the more matter (and denser) the longer the death magic enchantment lasts. Living flesh can only have it's own flesh consumed (not arbitrary matter) as a power source. In general death magic got it's name for reviving the dead, this is a laborious process which involves visualizing each of the things the caster wants the dead to be able to do.

Examples:

- Speak With the Dead: Assuming the head is mostly intact, a death mage can imaging the process of death reversing to when the head was able to speak and converse with it. The original personality of the dead is not there (unless the death mage knew them well enough) but memories can be somewhat accessed.
- Raise Dead: By visualizing a sequence of things a person could do before death a corpse (or skeleton for better mages) can be made into a poor soldier. However the dead will not know anything the caster does not visualize, reflexes and memory can be recovered by the magic, but if the caster does not visualize jumping then the dead will not be able to jump even if their reflexes were impressive, If the caster does not visualize opening doors then the dead won't be able to navigate buildings, even if it has memories of secret entrances.
- Revival: As long as a person isn't warm and dead (or their death was quite recent) a death mage can revive them, though it takes a heavy toll (metabolic energy wise, but not permanent) on the death mage.
- Destroy Flesh / Beautify: By reversing the biological process of something living and powering it with itself, they can destroy arbitrary flesh. Done gently one can look younger, but it takes an equivalent number of years of the being's life.

*** I think that for this system to make any kind of sense you're gonna have to really nail down the metaphysical underpinnings of life and death in your universe.

'cuz IRL, death isn't an off switch. Sure, there's people who are definitely alive, and there's people who are definitely dead, but in between there's a whole spectrum - and as medical technology advances, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbE8E1ez97M][that spectrum gets wider]].

Like let's say you've got some peasants who're getting guillotine happy. They've lopped off the head of the King. A loyal Death Mage nabs up the head at the moment of severance.

King's dead, right? His head's fallen off. So the Death Mage applies the "power from arbitrary matter" ability to preserve the head.

Except time passes. It's a hundred years later, and a whole school of death mages have been passing the insanely well-preserved head of the King down for generations.

Now, we have the technology. The technology to hook the king's head up to a bellows and run some air through his vocal cords. Turns out, he wasn't quite dead this whole time! The head can survive for a few painful moments when separated from the body! Also he's really mad because he's been living those few painful moments for the last century!

Or let's say you're really rich but also very old. So you pay a Death Mage to make you younger. Oh, but the Death Mage can't do that! Living flesh can only consume itself!

So they kill you. Stop your heart. You're dead. Mr. Death Mage uses like ten cows to revert you back to your early 20's. Then Mr. Lightning Mage starts your heart back up again. Hooray, you're cured of old age!

If you don't want things like this to work, you're going to have to basically /give/ people some sort of metaphysical off switch that says "you're definitely dead and also you're not coming back to life", and with which death magic interacts. At that point you might as well just call it a soul imo.

  I think that for this system to make any kind of sense you're gonna have to really nail down the metaphysical underpinnings of life and death in your universe.

I have but they are semi-spoilers.

  Sure, there's people who are definitely alive, and there's people who are definitely dead, but in between there's a whole spectrum

Agreed. A death mage can only get a full biological revival if they reverse the process of death (e.g. the patient is not totally dead on a couple of important metrics). After that they can only perform a magical revival which is bringing about an "undead".

Brilliantly macabre, and well within the bounds I expected (though your specific example breaks some rules, and would be the fulltime job of 10 death mages to preserve the head using only death magic, but it could work with some minor changes). Yes death magic can allow a person to be preserved forward in time and then revived.

This example breaks a couple of rules. For starters the magic that can be done on dead flesh and live flesh are separate, because there are different processes in motion. To give a simple metaphor, a death mage can't reverse the aging process if you aren't aging anymore. Also if the death mage can't bring you back then an electric shock definitely can't.

*** > to it's original state as long as the enchantment lasts

Why is the change temporary? Is their some cosmic entropic fairness that resists permanent change, or is their magic too inferior or clumsy to allow for a permanent change? If it's a completely reversal when the enchantment ends, can this be munchkin into death magic powered mechanical power?

Death magic sounds like a paramedics best friend? The revival mechanic sounds like it is not intended to be temporary, but even if it is, other interventions can be used to stabilize the person after the death magic fades?

This was a failure of explanation on my part. So there are effectively two classes of reversed effects. Those that use magic to effect the world as if the state was reversed, like having a skeleton walk around. And those that are reversing actual biological matter from one state to another, like reviving someone recently dead. One might even call them two different magics, but the study of them is so intertwined they are considered one magic.

Not in a useful way I would imagine. Fissioning the raw material used in the spell would give one more energy. Or just instructing a skeleton to spin a crank.

A journeyman death mage (10+ years experience; journeyman is the peak most mages reach) can do 3-4 revivals per hour for about 8 hours per day without collapsing of exhaustion. The revival is effectively temporary, it's basically jump-starting the patients body for a few seconds. The technique is actually to spend a couple minutes fixing up the patients body as best as possible (using stuff like CPR to buy more time) before attempting the revival. They also have to be rationed so most patients will only get two revival attempts (times out the death mage for 30 minutes), one in a triage situation if that. People still die.
