If rational/rationalist pony fics are for you, then you're in luck! We've just finished sorting through the list of nominated fics on the LessWrong group on FiMFiction.net. You can find all of the approved fics [[http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong][here]]. Many of the approved fics deal heavily with subject matter that might interest LessWrong members (uploading, transhumanism, etc.) without being rational fics, though it should be possible to figure out which fics are which by reading the story descriptions.

Cheers! -Flutters


** RHJ's [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/92077/the-great-alicorn-hunt][The Great Alicorn Hunt]] and its prequel [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/60523/parting-words][Parting Words]] certainly qualify.

*** Thanks for the recommendations. Great Alicorn Hunt was already included. I've just given Parting Words a read, and it doesn't seem quite as relevant to our interests, since Celestia's treatment of Twilight makes more sense in a world where friendship is actually magic and where existential risks can't actually occur (because that would wreck the show's continuability) than it would in our own world.

If you want to press the case for a specific piece of fanfic being included, the best place to do that is the [[http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong/thread/199827/story-nomination-thread][story nomination thread]]

**** ... *squints.* Sir, you are aware that Parting Words is a /direct/ sequel to The Great Alicorn Hunt, yes? As in, they are part of /the very same narrative/ and that one provides if not crucial, then at least important back-story for the other?

Parting Words is a /prologue/ for TGAH. It is not a separate story, and I am genuinely confused by your reply to my post.

***** There are rational-fic with irrational, or less relevantly rational, prequels. If someway made Belatrix lestrange and the rational terror as a prquel to HPMOR, it might be less rational, or less relevantly rational, as belatrix is no rationalist even in HPMOR canon

***** NotAHeroYet's reply to your comment is spot on-- that's basically part of what I thought, too. Also, I try to use the same rules and heuristics that the other two admins use when approving stories--and in deciding whether or not to approve things, relevance to LW is more important than quality, or whether or not something's a prequel to a rational fic. So, it would be rude to the other mods, and the community, to approve something that I liked (like Parting Words) if it didn't properly fit into the group.

Parting Words won't be approved because rationality/LW relevant things aren't a big part of the plot, or of the story. There's some munchkining, but that's only a small part of the story.

  Put stories in here whose central ideas are relevant to our interests. If you don't know what's relevant to LessWrong because you haven't read LessWrong, don't put stories here. You don't need to be as strict about quality as about concept.
#+end_quote

I can't help but think this is overly harsh. I'd suggest that prospective authors spend time here or reading rational fic to get a feel for what rfic is first, and then submit to nominations in addition to the above to sound less exclusive. I can guess you've had a spamming problem, but they wouldn't listen to warnings anyway.

**** Something like:

If you've read at least a few rationalfics then you probably know what we're looking for but for those just joining us rational fiction is generally found when:

Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

I take it you've read neither [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/87619/biblical-monsters][Biblical Monsters]] (10,000 words) nor [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/211007/souvenir][Souvenir]] (3500 words). Both are accessible to readers with a minimum of background knowledge. The latter fic is tangentially related to futurism.

It seems like his post has been getting about as many downvotes as upvotes since I posted it. Sorry if posting this was a silly idea. I'm the worst pony. I'm a dumb pony, too. :(

Should I keep from posting pony stuff here in the future? Did I do something in particular wrong with this post, or is there just not a particularly high tolerance for pony stuff on this subreddit?

*** Pony stuff is fine, so long as it is still rationalist fiction. Some people are against it, but they aren't the majority around here so don't take it to heart. Rather, most people seem to be neutral. If a story is interesting I'll read it regardless of if the protagonists are humans or crystal aliens or ponies or gas beings that live in Jupiter.
