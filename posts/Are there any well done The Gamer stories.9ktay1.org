I'd love a list of stories where someone has powers like the protagonist of the Manwhua The Gamer/RPG style gaming. I feel like I've read so many potentially good stories that just kind of fall flat. Whether that be from a writing failure, a tendency towards power creep, ect.

It doesn't necessarily have to be rational/rationalist, I'd have asked elsewhere but I feel like the people on this sub have higher standards for fiction.

Also, I am currently reading Worth the Candle and The Daily Grind so recommendations outside of those two would be nice.


** I'm going to recommend [[https://archives.erfworld.com/Book%201/1][Erfworld]]. It's the story of a gamer who suddenly finds himself in a strange, cartoon-y world and is forced to quickly learn the rules in order to survive.

*** I would recommend [[https://www.erfworld.com/blog/view/50734/the-last-turn-part-1][The Last Turn]], an Erfworld fanfic by the writer of The Wandering Inn. It's a game world, not a single-person power, but it might be what you're looking for. It's short (for the genre) and I enjoyed it much more than Erfworld itself. Munchkinnery at its finest.

**** It's still pretty good and consistent, but the pace goes waaay down.

By now it's the kind of pace where the story has an entire book (twice as long as Book 1 so far) dedicated to the "multiple characters are stranded from their base and their faction is in mortal peril as long as they are" arc.

It's enjoyable to read, mind you, (I'm still reading) but the pace has really taken a hit. The fact that half of the updates are text pages going into the details of each character's backstory and how it informs their decisions doesn't help.

("eg Did I ever tell you about that game I played 10 years ago when I was in a completely different faction? Here's how that game works. The situation I'm in has some stark similarities with that game.")

Conflicts were resolved mostly by one side overpowering the other, or upon discovering a misunderstanding.

As for how I met Nate, it was a cold call on his part back last September asking to grab dinner!

Your headcanon isn't /terribly/ far off. I've been sort of rationalist-adjacent for a long while. I've read a lot of rationalist fiction over the years (and stuff in the general neighborhood like Worm, Unsong, Vinge, etc.), because I tend to get sick of the standard Hollywood narrative that any sort of progress is inherently bad.

I've read a lot of the same source material, e.g. I stumbled on Less Wrong when working on some MCMC stuff and looking for material for trying to explain it to folks, collected a degree in AI during my binge through academia. I use lots of adaptive dynamic programming / Q-learning style tricks when working on compilers and the like, MCMC for graphics, etc. This means I've had to pick up a lot of the same tools but for use in rather more "pragmatic" short-term goals. I also try to be a good little Bayesian in my day to day life, though maybe not to the same degree as the typical MIRI-ite, as evidenced by the fact that my wife feels a need to apply a correction factor whenever I tell her my odds for things. ;)

If we're going to have some form of AI it'd be nice if it was something we could reason about. My main emphasis currently is on the idea that if the kind of AI we do know how to reason about is made up of functional programming and logic programming bits, it'd be really nice if that sort of approach could scale to the levels of data we can feed to deep piles of neural networks, and if it could run on the same sort of hardware, lest it be relegated to a form of irrelevance purely for a lack of computing resources. Going slow to go fast by trying to get our foundations right works to a point, but now there are 10,000x more folks working on the other side of the equation.

I'm not sure I can speak to that. They do have a bunch of functional programmers on board and are actively recruiting in FP circles for both interns and regular employees. I also know Nate and at least one of their interns were doing a lot of work in Lean recently and also seem to have a lot of internship positions to fill and comparatively few applicants, so for folks looking to do an internship, at least, that seems very viable. I'm also around the office now and again and have been spending my time there relentlessly braindumping FP, math and category theory on folks.

**** My take on it: Jaune does a lot of thinking, and it does help him (it at least looks like a rational fic), but he's not spending that thinking time effectively so it seems more rambly than rational. Jaune has a lot of abilities which he can choose between but he makes his decision by thinking about it instead of taking measurements and making calculations. Eg. he chooses to split his stat points between intelligence and wisdom but:

- Stat points can be increased by training them, so he is encouraged to put his points into already high-level stats to maximise their payoff (ie. focus on one stat)

- Intelligence and Wisdom stats work together very well, but in the late game, each 50-stat step gains even more benefits to the last. So while 250-250 was very powerful, 0-500 would have been absurd.

It's like the rational equivalent of a chinese xianxia: a large quantity of (relatively) cheap writing that is enough to tickle all my requirements.

The protagonist doesn't start out as a very smart person, but he makes decisions that make logical sense given his experiences and the situations he finds himself in. And as the story goes, he does gain a lot of agency and makes more intelligent decisions.

** Dungeon Defense is solid and has has a fairly clever protagonist. The description, copied directly from the series' wiki, is:

#+begin_quote
  After renouncing his inheritance of his late father, a young man decides to spend the remaining years of his life without working. One day, he received an email from the company that created『Dungeon Attack』, a standard dungeon-capturing RPG that was boasted as the absolute hardest strategy game. After answering a suspicious survey for the next expansion, he now finds himself in the game as the weakest Demon Lord,「Dantalian」.

  With only his eloquent tongue and memories of conquest as the hero of the game, in order to survive as Dantalian, he decides to tear this new world apart.
#+end_quote

Dantalian is normally defeated in the tutorial mission in the game he finds himself transported into, so he needs to use his intelligence to succeed instead. It's not the greatest story ever written, but in my opinion it's written well-enough and is thoroughly enjoyable.

Last I heard, the writer was going through the process of writing the isekai elements out of the series, because in general it functions better as a fantasy story than as an isekai.

*** I read this after your recommendation and stopped in Volume 3. I didn't like it. We as the readers aren't let in on what is happening or why most of the time and then the problems get solved because "Oh yeah, the main character knew this thing from the game so it all works out." I would be down with the main character abusing known game info basically be prophetic but the readers are never let in on it until the exact moment when it becomes relevant and makes the main character win out of nowhere. That makes it seem like deus ex machina and not good planning. Also the main character is a pretty insufferable Gary Stu. "I'll just start reciting the complete works of William Shakespear (Which of course I have memorized) at this random bar and now everyone is in love with me because they have never heard a good story before."

The other big reason I stopped reading was because the main character just casually threw away one of his core convictions in Volume 3. It makes no sense for his personality to take such a huge turn.

I'm still reading it, but I don't rush to catch it as soon as it updates. But I'm always waiting for the next MoL chapter.

I'd say that half of the appeal is the level of world building (it was a fantasy world building project before it was a story), and the other half is the level of opposition. Zorian has a time loop, but he starts off so vastly overmatched that he just keeps getting killed. And when he makes progress in solving the mystery of what's happened to him, it's in tiny increments, gradually piling up clues until he can put the picture together. And whenever it seems like he's getting too powerful and there are no more plausible challenges, the world finds a new way to kick him in the gut.

**** Clearly our rational fiction fanbase is correlated with people who like this genre. I can see a couple hypotheses why:

- The intersection of between rational and science fiction/fantasy is large (larger than other rational fiction types)\\
- Rational speculative fiction is easy to write -> more quantity\\
- Rational speculative fiction is effective within speculative fiction, so they recieve more visibility

- The kinds of people who like rational fiction also like speculative fiction\\
- Similar excitement is gained from rational fiction and speculative fiction, so the combination is even better

- Our community has become self-reinforcing for speculative fiction in particular
