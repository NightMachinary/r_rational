**** mm? It's mostly chosen for EJ's convenience.

Unless you mean SF in general, rather than the particular shop. In which case there's not much I can do about that.

***** San Francisco in general, yeah. I understand why its there, and I'm glad you guys can meet up - I just like to complain.

******* Somewhere I can get to! Which, uh, considering the availability of my modes of transportation, means somewhere in Fairfeild county, Connecticut, on pretty much the opposite side of the continent.

Anyway, though, hope you guys have a nice meetup.

******** Interestingly, as of December 12 (i.e. this coming Monday) I will be living in West Haven. My parents live in Fairfield, so I'm down there relatively often anyway. Know any good coffee shops?

********** Neither can I, honestly. Stuff is gross. I do occasionally drink it, with enough milk to float a barge and enough sugar to drop a diabetic, but it's only for the caffeine.

I said "coffee shop" because there aren't very many tea shops around and coffee shops are good places to meet and talk. :P

***** Yeah I can definitely understand that. Obviously there's sort of a problem where you can never be /sure/ a character isn't going to die next update, but without getting into too many spoilers, the team members who are alive are in an okayish spot right now, so it might be a great time to catch up.

Even if you only pop in to look at the plans on vote day, the more the merrier :)
