** I get the feeling Kurama is slowly bartering senses off Naruto in exchange for more skills and power. And that he was purposely mucking up the chakra sheathing while Naruto was trying to practice earlier.

Could he eventually turn Naruto into a puppet, I wonder? Have our blonde-haired hero call on his power and subvert control immediately, leaving the chakra-beast functionally free and in total control of Naruto's body?

I wonder if Orochimaru's goal is to kill Kurama and the other beasts.

Oh, come on! There are plenty of ways this could play out and the obvious manipulation would be utterly boring and disappointing. Personally, I think this is a multilevel play:

- Is Naruto smart enough to detect the blindingly obvious manipulation?

- If he is, what will he do with the information? Allowing Kurama to access his body even if he recognises the dangers may serve as a costly signal that he is willing to trust him and negotiate in good faith.

- Something else I'm not smart enough to immediately recognise.

I mean, surely Kurama is not clumsy enough to play on the level of manipulation even a socially inept person like me detects immediately?

** Orochimaru's actions make a lot more sense in the context of preparing for an existential threat. (*/cough/*/Akatsuki/*/cough/*) Even if he's a complete sociopath interested only in the accumulation of knowledge, he'd still wish to prevent it. World-engulfing wars have an annoying tendency to destroy valuable tomes, and fighting for survival and/or experimental freedom is /such/ a time sink.

Honestly this seems too powerful, considering it again. How does that work?

Please put spaces between the words in CloneNaruto and RealNaruto. Camel case does not flow well in prose.

Goddamn. Thank you so much for not making Kurama an ally. And Orochimaru is an enigma as ever.

*** To add a bit stylistically, Shino did a lot of /glancing/ at Naruto (not a crazy amount, but enough that I noticed).

Also, the "modern usage" of the phrase "begs the question" can raise [[http://begthequestion.info/][plenty]] of [[https://public.wsu.edu/%7Ebrians/errors/begs.html][hackles]]. Which, if Shino's supposed to be all precise and shit, might not be entirely fitting for his character (unless you're trying to use him to poke fun at pseudointellectual "pop-Bayesianism" or something).

I consider myself pretty well read, and I have only ever heard BTQ used in the sense that I used it. The traditionalists may rail against its usage changing, but I'm afraid that the makers of Kleenex lost their fight too. Personally, the one that gets me is that [[http://imgur.com/gallery/fycHx][not using the Oxford comma]] is often considered acceptable.

I think traditionalists are better off simply using the phrase "circular reasoning", which is just as well known, shorter, and actually describes what it's referring to.

That's actually canon. I was originally going to change it to "half the remaining chakra" but decided just to KISS.

The version I'm using is actually enormously nerfed from canon. The canon version gives Naruto the memories of the clone when it pops. As a result, his standard trick is "make 1,000 clones, we all practice a jutsu together and learn 1000x faster". That trick is so common that it's the reason I nerfed it in my version.
