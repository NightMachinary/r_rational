** I haven't heard of a single one of them, and most seem too new and/or obscure to have a significant number of ratings on Amazon or Goodreads.

Can't really afford a blind purchase right now, even if it's cheap (too many books on my reading list). But thanks for telling us about this.

*** Does Newton qualify as a "REAL scientist"? Because, you know, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Isaac_Newton][he believed in Creationism.]]

I'm tempted to utter phrases ending in "no true Scottsman," since maybe your own narrow jargon will cut through better than honest conversation. But lets opt for the latter anyway.

According to Pew, [[http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/][just over half of scientists believe in a "higher power" and about a third say they believe in "God."]] I guess Pew forgot to check with you to see whether this disqualifies those surveyed from being scientists.

One can do the work of a scientist while failing to be a "Rationalist." Nearly every scientist in existence has, though I'll grant you MIRI and friends have absorbed a few people with actual training in recent years. One can be a scientist, perhaps even the greatest scientist of all time, without sharing the same dogma as Richard Feynman, Eliezer Yudkowsky, or you. One can even be a scientist without possessing only purely rational beliefs.

Few humans are entirely rational. Few humans are likely even mostly rational. Most of the scientists we know of are human. Does one's status of a scientist really come down to an ideological purity test where some beliefs get the okay from this community and others don't, based largely on ... what exactly? How offensive you find the beliefs? How well you can rationalize that these beliefs are inferior to the ones commonly held in the present day? Maybe you give Newton a pass for his era but this Carroll person doesn't get one because he has committed a sin against current dogma?

We all hold beliefs which are complete shit and wouldn't stand up to the least scrutiny, if only we even knew to apply scrutiny to them and possessed the honesty to do so. A willingness (though not perhaps a propensity) to hold beliefs which are contrary to those of the seething masses would, if anything, make me respect an individual more, not less. As a scientist and as a human.

Edit: Some phrases which, by analogy, you might have sympathy for.

- "He's not a scientist, he's a communist!"

- "He's not a scientist, he's a Jew!"

Actually, even the Nazi's didn't quite (maybe?) go this far. They bemoaned Einstein's [[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/books/review/einsteins-jewish-science-by-steven-gimbel.html?_r=0][jewish physics]], but at least they still called it physics.

Part of the scientific ethos is the solidarity of transnational, trans-ideological unity in the pursuit of truth which doesn't know such arbitrary borders. Many less Rational individuals than yourself have seen, appreciated, and abided by this ethos. If Rationalists can't, then it is they who will find it difficult to do the work of science.

**** Not a "real scientist" at all regardless of his creationist beliefs, as it happens.

He illustrates, and occasionally writes for, pop science and scifi books and magazines. He does no research, and has no credentials that I could find. Wiki has him pegged as "space artist".

***** Now /that/ is a much better reason to take issue with this author being pushed as a "real scientist."

It's also rather disappointing, especially when there are so many top of the line scifi writers who DO have training in technical science disciplines.

In no particular order and allowing both computer programmer and mathematician to count as "scientist", off the top of my head there's:

- Mark Lawrence

- Peter Watts

- Vernor Vinge

- Greg Egan

- Ken Liu (maybe? Wikipedia says he worked in "technology")

- Ted Chiang (maybe? Has a degree in computer science and does technical writing)

And I would highly recommend the work of all of the above. It'd be nice to have a broader list of such authors. Anyone have any suggestions?

**** First, mentioning Newton is a bit of strawman argument, he lived well before Darwin and he didn't any evidence to look at.

Second, for a scientist to believe in creationism means wilfully ignoring evidence that conflict with their faith. That's not following the scientific method and a scientist who disregard any evidence that do not support their conclusion is not a real scientist.

In the case of Michael Carroll, he doesn't even have a defence of saying that it's not his field. He wrote a book about creationism so that means that he had to research it, had to be confronted with the evidence against creationism and discarded it. There's no way this can be called science. And he is either not a real scientist or he doesn't believe in creationism and lack integrity.

Now note, that I did not mention religion. There can be scientist who are religious in that there's no evidence that there isn't a godlike entity. So a scientist who is Christian or Jewish or any other religion but doesn't believe things that are disproved by evidence can be a real scientist.

Writing a book series on creationism for children doesn't exactly qualify as a "pursuit of truth" by my standards. I mean, I would certainly judge the person by his actual professional scientific achievements as far as deciding if they're worthy of the title "scientist", if I knew of any. But, in the absence of actual scientific results to be used for that purpose, him writing books on creationism certainly doesn't inspire confidence.

I very much doubt that the author presents the books in a way that doesn't imply that he's engaging in a "pursuit of truth". Discussions of the origins of the universe tend to have that context. Can you really blame me for holding him to a decent standard in this case?

He would still be deserving of ridicule for believing in silly things. In fact, if he was a leader of his field, that would be all the more reason to mock him, since then he wouldn't even have an excuse of not being among the smartest people on the planet. I'd still acknowledge him as a scientist, of course. But I would be mildly surprised that he was a leader in his field, as opposed to some non-creationist person.

#+begin_quote

Evidence is evidence. If you restrict the definition of "real scientist" to people who actually make breakthroughs and significantly advance the fields, then it's not that unreasonable to say that being a creationist is decently strong evidence for not being a "real scientist".

#+end_quote

Surely I'm entitled to constructing the reference class "scientist" inside my own head in a way that I feel will be most informative and useful for me? Including the sort of person who writes books arguing for creationism (if that's all I know about them) doesn't seem like something that will serve to make the class more useful to me, so I don't. If you're going to be using coarse labels and stereotyping people (which is inevitable with a human brain), then you might as well try to make labels as informative as possible.

That said, I've looked at the other authors and the rest seems legit (or at least do not have explicit red flags like that). It's just that I'm very surprised that a publisher who decides to start a series of books written by real scientist would publish that Creationist guy as part of that series.

** I can't guarantee that the books are rational, but since you guys often enjoy hard science fiction I thought you all would appreciate the chance at these books. It's a bundle pack of science fiction books written by scientists where readers are certain to learn some scientific facts disguised as an entertaining story. The books even include fairly lengthy appendixes which explicitly explain the scientific concepts used in the books.

For the people who has never heard of the Humble Bundle before, it's an organization which sells games and books with a portions of all sales going to charity. Every two weeks or so, they come out with a Book Bundle where you can buy some or all of the books at certain prices.

Better hurry, today on September 23rd, there's only 4 days left for this bundle!
