** So, Uriel's previous estimate was 50 years of working physics in 1990, thus ending in 2040. With 20 years shaved off, that means the "present day" part of the story is at best 3 years away from the machinery collapse, assuming Thamiel didn't manage to trick Uriel again.

*** I wonder if names used by humans draw on Uriel's light reserves or on the unfiltered light entering through the crack.

If the former, then I guess that would explain UNSONG. And if we /are/ in the final years, then the 58-letter Vital Name could drain a significant amount of power - maybe enough to not even work more than once.

**** This is a really good and elegant hypothesis, but I don't see why names would be powered by Uriel's stash of light - it seems like they should be using the stream of light that's constantly flowing into our world instead. Before the Skycrash names didn't work because Uriel had cut off that flow, even though his own reserves were full. It also seems like names were working even before Uriel's reserves existed in the first place.

**** Granting a soul to something happens all the time to humans, why should it be exorbitantly more expensive for an inanimate object?

Or is there some source that the longer the Name the more power required?

***** In the first chapter Aaron mentions some correlation between length and power, the longest known so far being the Wrathful Name. Later on, it's mentioned that the Mortal Name (the shortest magical one) was the last to stop working.

Maybe artificial soul-generation is somehow more expensive than natural... but yeah, otherwise it wouldn't make sense.

******* It was, but some commenters are suggesting that the reason Aaron's name only worked once was that using it on Sarah drained enough divine light that there wasn't enough to use it again.

And potentially hastened the end of the world significantly, if it works the same as Uriel using the divine light (probably not.)

  “Taking me away from the only person who can train me to use my powers is dangerous! Life is dangerous! We're Cometspawn! If we don't do the dangerous things, who will?”

  “I will,” said the Comet King, “so that you do not have to.”

versus

  “YOU SAY WE ARE ALL BROKEN BUT MUST CONTINUE OUR WORK ANYWAY,” said Uriel. “BUT YOU NEVER BREAK.”

  The Comet King stood there on the edge of the cloud, inhumanly perfect, his black cloak and silver hair blowing in the gale.

  “I will,” he said.

Both such powerful lines. It's a versatile pair of words.

I bet she will do something like stop being her father's descendant. Or maybe she thinks of herself as daughter of Jak... instead of Comet King.

******** So repurpose a Colorado town whose name already has Kabbalistic similarity.

From a very cursory glance down Wikipedia's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Colorado][List of cities and towns in Colorado]], one that jumps out at me immediately is *Dolores*, already being named after suffering.

I'm sure you could find a better choice going down the list - Agony derives from the Greek word "Agon", meaning Contest. So kabbalistically, "A contest ending in pain". *Alma* was the first battle of the Crimean War, part of the /Great Game/ between Russia and Great Britain that ended in the Russians' humiliating and painful defeat. Any towns on the *Purgatoire* river. You could look up towns whose syllables match any of the [[https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=agony+in+hebrew][Hebrew words for agony]]. Etc.

A bit of time and creativity could easily find better ties than I could in ten minutes. The Comet King had plenty of both, and a solid motivation to weasel his way around the prophecy.
