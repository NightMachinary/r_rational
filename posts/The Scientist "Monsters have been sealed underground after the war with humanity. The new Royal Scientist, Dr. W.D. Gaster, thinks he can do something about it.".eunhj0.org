** Ah, I recommended this a few months back in the Monday recommendation thread. I was a few days late on the posting but good to see others also spreading the word.

And the first half, the rational portion, is completed. A rarity in the world of fanfiction.

** I'm gonna go against the grain here, I didn't enjoy it very much. Very very slow paced and constantly descending into melodrama. The one good part is that it really manages to give a satisfying explanation to the Gaster deal in the original game, so it's not a complete waste, but I really don't recommend this to anyone who doesn't care about that.

*** I enjoyed it a lot, I think Gaster's character arc was well realized (if somewhat cliche in some ways), but I agree it doesn't seem like it would work very well if you're not familiar with the source material.

**** Was not familiar with the source material at all (purposely avoided the game like the plague, mostly because of the fanbase,) and rather enjoyed it, didn't realize it was Undertale until the Sans bit (I thought it was a really weird reference at first.)

***** Seems like kinda a waste to avoid something just because a few assholes like it. No matter what you like, there are probably assholes who like that too; it doesn't mean the work itself is bad. I do understand the hesitation though. The toxic part of the fanbase is pretty much gone now, though I think it was a small minority anyway. In my opinion the majority of the toxic undertale "fans" were less fans of undertale itself and more children who liked youtubers who played it.

****** I tend to avoid things that are popular (regardless of the quality of said fanbase) because I dislike being inundated with the topic; when something becomes all I hear about, I tend to avoid it because I'm tired of hearing about it and have lost any interest in the subject I could have had. I didn't every think the game was bad, and most of the fans of the game I interested with were my own friends, I just grew tired of hearing about the game, and by extension, the game itself.

******* Well that seems like a dumb way to live your life that does nothing but end with you poisoning for yourself things that you would otherwise probably enjoy.

But hey, that's just me

*** From my reading so far, it seems to rely a lot on knowing the story of Undertale. Which isn't a bad thing, but it might not be what you're looking for. I WOULD highly recommend Undertale though, it's very good.
