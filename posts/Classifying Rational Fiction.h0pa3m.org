Hey everyone, I had a random thought, kind of curious what you guys think about this.

Say you were in a bookstore and looking for something fun to read. You come across a bunch of rational fiction stories that you've never read and decide to give one a try. Do you think you'd find all these stories on the same bookshelf, under the tag "rational fiction," or scattered around the store in different sections?

Specifically, do you see rational fiction a form of "genre fiction" or as an element present in many genres?

Wikipedia has a pretty good definition of genre fiction:

#+begin_quote
  Genre fiction, also known as popular fiction, is a term used in the book-trade for fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre, in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.
#+end_quote

Traditionally published genre fiction tends to have tropes specific to that genre. Murder mysteries usually drop a body in the first chapter. Romance novels end with happily ever after. Fantasy has a significant amount of world building with longer word counts, while young adult fiction must be shorter and feature a protagonist in their teens.

Since genre fiction is written primarily for entertainment purposes, and readers are creatures of habit, writers tend to follow these tropes in their fiction to be more marketable. You can find some stories that bend the rules and some that don't follow them entirely (read: literary fiction) but by and large genre fiction isn't trying to reinvent the wheel.

Genre fiction is different from a story having /elements/ of a genre. For example, a story can feature romance as a side plot, but have the characters die in the end. A story can feature fantasy elements (elves, werewolves) but follow the tropes for a young adult fiction novel. I would say most genres can blend with other genres, sometimes to the point they create a new form of genre fiction. "Steampunk" is an example of fantasy and sci-fi blended with historical fiction set in the Victorian era.

So, do you think rational fiction is its own form of genre fiction? Does it have tropes specific to the genre that readers expect when they pick up a story to read it? Could it have its own section in a bookstore that would be distinct and unique from other genres?

Or is rational fiction a quality that lots of stories from many genres can have? Is "rational" a flavoring you could sprinkle into fantasy, sci-fi, crime, romance, historical fiction and horror, blending with their tropes to create something new?

It could be both, of course. But which do you think best describes the work on this sub, or what do you see rational fiction to be?


** I'd say rational fiction is an element you can drop into any genre. As long as your world and characters are as realistic and consistent as possible, it can be an element of any genre of story and doesn't necessarily need to be the main focus of the plot. That being said, i'd say the genre fiction form of rational fiction is *rationalist* fiction, where the focus is much heavier on characters being rational and thinking and reasoning their way forward.

If a hero/villain is a rationalist he will apply the most optimal way of thinking to a problem (science) and the most practical solution (technology). This destroys most genres, or turn them into sci-fi, in all but name.

The only way to stop a rationalist protagonist from just wrecking your plot with logic, science and technology, is to make the setting explicitly run on irrational principles...which is the definition of magic, and thus, fantasy.

My comment was countering the assertion that:

As long as the protagonist pursues their goal(s) in a.... open-source kind of smart (where you see their thinking code), then you have a (potentially) rational work.

Hell, it could work in a stone-age era drama. Just an above-average caveman using his limited knowledge and cunning to survive difficult times he found himself in. Or a cooking competition, where a scientific approach (actually finding out if something tastes good, without relying on public opinion) allows the main character to find whole new dimensions of taste /(fish with strawberry yogurt?!)/, ignored by calcified 'masters'.

Rationality isn't about the setting. Nor is it a tightly constrained characterization of your protagonist. You could write an old matron who never got a formal education- as long as you /show/ her using her brain right, she can be rational too.

In order to write a story in genres outside of the broad spheres of scifi/fantasy, I think we'd need to consider how the use of rationality would actually affect their lives, and what other factors of their personality and background might need to be considered.

*** So, I suppose this could be true depending on our definition of rational fiction. Is a story "rational fic" if the characters are reasonably intelligent, don't make decisions out of character just to drive the plot, and overall the story feels internally consistent? If so, those are the markings of good writing, and should be in most stories.

If the definition from TV tropes is more accurate, than rational fiction is more like a genre, due to expectations that not all stories can or should meet.

#+begin_quote
  A Rational Fic is one which makes a deliberate effort to reward a reader's thinking. It's the opposite of Bellisario's Maxim. The World Building is intended to stand up to careful thought; the plot is driven by characters or circumstances that themselves are part of the story, the heroes generally think clearly (in ways the reader can follow), and a clever reader can deduce what's hidden or what's coming. Very often, the fic is also intended to teach the reader something about rationality.

** I agree that rational fiction can work well with other genres, and I'd love to read a variety of stories with rational characters. However, let me play devil's advocate. I would say /in this sub/ we seem to have enough common themes and tropes to form a basic genre pattern:

--Serialized fiction (long word count)

--action/adventure

--set in the future or a fantasy world

--main character has a high IQ, usually male or masculine traits, teen or young adult

--uses their intellect to solve problems and drive the plot forward

--plot is constructed to reward the reader's thinking (clues, foreshadowing)

--MC struggles with anger or feelings of inadequacy

--munchkinry and quests for dominance/power are common

--hero must succeed on their own power or intellect

--when romance, harems

--kids show fanfic but smart

--common elements: tech, AI, superpowers, video games, transhumanism

It might be fair to say that rational fiction is a subgenre of the action/adventure story, while still being something distinctly different. The pace of action in the story and its tension is less important than the internal consistency of character actions. If the city is about to be destroyed, it's not just because the Big Bad is being evil, it's because he wants something and destroying the city is the best way to get it. Instead of racing against the clock to stop his plans with an epic car chase that leads to things blowing up, we get a clever use of manipulation to trick the enemy (which might lead to something blowing up).

Regardless, it's rare to see a rational fic on reddit that follows non action/adventure tropes. You'll find scifi and fantasy, but not historical fiction, romance, horror, urban fantasy, suspense, slice of life or young adult. Rational fic in these categories is great, but it doesn't fit the sub's preferred genre, so it's less popular and not recommended as often.

I'd love to see anyone provide a counterpoint to this argument, as you might not see the same trends I do. Still, though, it's hard to ignore the patterns in reddit's preferences for rational fiction.

This one I've only seen a handful of times personally. I'm pretty sure I've read more monogamous romantic rational fiction on this subreddit than anything that comes to the level of a harem forming around one protagonist.

All that said, one can write both rational and rationalist fiction while leaving away the majority of the tropes you enumerated. It just so happens that this community (including our talented amateur writers) were often fans of a certain number of genres before they even discovered this whole "rational fiction" thing. But you can do a lot with just points 5, 6, 9, and the first half of 4.

While true I don't think it's exactly fair for most of the examples. If you make a rational character in a somewhat IRL setting many people will call it a mary sue, self inflating, masturbatory..

​

Horror and suspense can't be easily ported over without a lot of changes and work to make it compatible. Rational actors don't put themselves in those situations and if they do they will likely just fix it somehow or die while doing the smart thing which is very unrewarding for the audience.

​

Controversially urban fantasy is just an unimaginative, lazy version of fantasy. Which is often used in YA and other shorter stories for easier worldbuilding so the author can keep word count low and focus on other things like romance triangles.

To me those are entirely different genres from urban fantasy in general, granted it might just be too many bad apples spoiling the bunch or publishers grouping similar things together based on flawed assumptions.

​

As long as the relationship continues to be beneficial, and better than what they could reasonably get with somebody else it continues, with them both optimizing and actively communicating and making changes as needed for optimal returns.

I like the excuse the author uses in kaguya to make his story with intelligent characters doing elaborate things for no reason other a flawed assumption fine, but in most adult literature that kind of naive flirting that doesn't go anywhere for months doesn't really work.

I think the point is that the /story/ has to be rational - not necessarily the characters. The characters are consistent and believable, even though their judgement is clouded by emotion. Fundamentally:

- they both like each other
- they are both unsure whether the other likes them
- they both want the other to be the one who admits to liking them first because they feel like that will give them an edge in the power dynamics of the successive relationship.

Of course, making fun of how actually silly this whole conceit is, and how the rational thing to do would be just to communicate earnestly and settle matters in a mature way, is the whole point of the story. That's why I'd call it rational. The characters all have believable internal lives - their actions don't span from the need to fit a trope, but emerge naturally from who they are. Many of them are also significantly intelligent and demonstrate that routinely (not only Shirogane and Kaguya, but Fujiwara, Ishigami, Hayasaka, Osaragi, Miko... this /is/ a prestigious school after all). And the story as a whole is about a very rational approach to love and romance - illustrated, however, through both straightforward examples as well as catastrophic failures. None of the characters are entirely rational; the story, as a whole, is.

******* The story is good and consistent with itself. It has good worldbuilding and the author has above average intelligence. The characters are consistent. But I'm not 100% sure this is a rational romance or story.

It has qualities and traits rational stories have but the author fiat premise and the lack of progress in service of the medium and format make it not quite rational. The author needs the characters to both believe his made up flawed assumption, to take actions based on it and be interrupted and have forced failures constantly for there to be a story at all..

If it was a short story, novel or something similar it'd be easier to accept, but as a gag manga / anime with funny situation of the week format not so much.

I know there's some progress in the manga but I imagine that even after they are dating as two intelligent moderately rational people they'll still be in silly situations like Kaguya wanting to hold hands with BoyIforgotthename, but ending up making an elaborate plan and scenario for it to happen seamlessly instead of just asking or taking the initiative and punishing her boyfriend if he reacted in an undesirable manner, which is fine as a gag but becomes objectively irrational in service of the plot.

You can probably find those scenarios in the story already just from the anime.

*** rationalist fiction is almost always sci fi, fantasy, or sci fi flavoured adventure, because every other genre would collapse if too much rationalist revision was taken to it. Slice of life, romance, drama - the plot literally demands irrationality to create tension. Horror, suspense, thriller, require at least some irrationality to create a feeling of danger.

Rationalist young adult story would be just surreal, since rational children are unrealistic and contradictory.

Besides, if the protagonist/antagonist is truly a rationalist, then the genre always shifts to sci-fi, simply because they optimize using technology and science. The only way to stop that is to make their world run on magic instead of science: but the result is rationalist fantasy.

I feel like this example kinda disproves your claim. You're Next is an anti-horror, the smart protagonist causes the tropes to be reversed, and the whole story becomes a a subversion. The plot is not fear and anxiety inducing, its a borderline "revenge porn". Kinda like ALIENS was a reaction to ALIEN.

In other words, if you put a truly rational protagonist in a story and he fails regardless, it feels like a cheap diabolus ex machina. If the rationalist "wins" it is by defying or subverting tropes that define the genre.

Innocent person goes to prison (and similar plot - the deserted island castaway) are one of the few kinds of stories where the protagonist can be a rationalist and the story does not implode, but this is because the setting is very limited and constructed like a puzzle to be solved (how do I get past the guards/ how do I escape the island). Still, it is very easy to make the character a Mary Sue in such a setting, if not done carefully, and if the author does not do a copious amount of research first.

Stories about social movements staring a rationalist hero would be doomed: either the social leader would appear to be an obnoxious, self-righteous Mary Sue, or the author would have to cast a strong shade on the legitimacy of that social movement. Because, if the Social Movement was both in the right AND rationalists, then how the hell did they not win completely and forever IRL?

Take an example: If you made a story about rationalist MLK, then either you would need an equally convincing rationalist KKK leader to balance him out (a risky moral choice to say the least..), or the reader would wonder; why is there still racism in the USA?

In general, I would not recommend making historical characters into rationalists, let alone writing rational political and social leaders, because this is bound to insult someone.

Any of thousands of reasons? If you don't have enough power, you just don't. You can make your communication as good as humanly possible, but it won't be necessarily good enough. Do you think if you dropped someone sufficiently rational in the 1820 USA they could simply peacefully end slavery without any bloodshed, purely by political means, and leave no traces of racism either?

**** I don't think it necessarily reverts to Sci-Fi, it can always rely on how characters react within the world. A Practical Guide to Evil is a series like this. It's rational because of how the MC approaches the world she lives in.

Rational Horror could be done well, or at least suspense. Simply have the main characters make all the right moves, make all the right decisions. Make all the best plays with a bit of luck thrown their way. But have the monster still just slowly keep winning little victory after victory.

The rational character can be a person who simple acts in a reasonable and well thought out manner, it doesn't need to be a super genius or a tech wiz. The genre works so well for Fantasy and Sci-Fi is because both have been laden with tropes and over the top stories to the point that having people act like they aren't braindead in a story is awesome.

The only reason why you see less books or stories in other genres is because it's still kinda a niche genre, with a lot of it's interest originally sparking in the Fantasy/Sci-Fi crowds. Romance, Drama, Horror, Suspense, Thriller, heck even Slice-of-Life. Could be done on a Rational or rational Adjacent bent. We just don't have stories like that because the trend of rational Sci-Fi/Fantasy hasn't explicitly spread to as many fans as it needs to in order to attract those writers.

***** You can certainly have rational characters in a slice of life romance. Focusing on making the plot specifically rational is a little more complicated.

Slice of life tends to be character driven. The plot at times is less important than the relationships. As the author, you have to know the characters, how they interact with others, their quirks, their greatest dreams and fears. You have to make them likeable or interesting, and you have to make the /relationship/ between them compelling. This is different from rational fic, which tends to focus on making the plot interesting and compelling.

So, in order to make a rational slice of life romance, you have two options. Either the writer has to be amazeballs awesome and is able to somehow write compelling, complex characters undergoing growth and change AND a complex, riveting plot with no inconsistencies. Or you have to relax your standards on the plot complexity to focus more on the characters. But, while writing version 2 would make a great story, it probably won't appeal to this sub because they're not as interested in relationships. :/

Btw, I feel like Avatar the Last Airbender is a really good example of a rational, character driven story. It somehow manages to be extremely complex in its worldbuilding and plot, but also completely focused on creating compelling characters and exploring their relationships and growth. I mean, even the bad guys got character development!! And it did all that while still driving the plot forward and creating a great adventure.

I mentioned it above, but I really think the manga "Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to" fits the bill here. Not much of a plot that's not romance-driven, but there's an incredible amount of depth that goes into characterization, character development, and how that feeds into the central romance. And all of that while also being incredibly gripping anyway, not because of the riveting plot, but because of the hilarious comedy.

I don't fully agree with this because you can always make up a reason for why that work - or you could have an adult mentor character be the 'rationalist' mouthpiece, and the rest of the story merely rational, even if you felt like a hyperintelligent kid would be too creepy, unrealistic or non relatable as a main character (and then again, that's just what HPMOR is like).

** Hrm.

​

So, I've noticed that most genres will be about certain elements in a story above all others.

Milieu: the genres about setting, like Sci-fi and Fantasy. These are about the world the story takes place in and the rules and conventions of this world, more than the characters and what they do.

Idea: Or thematic genres. This is where the focus of the genre is on the ideas that it tries to convey over anything else. Some sci-fi fits in this (esp. old stories like the Foundation series) but also a lot of stories and books about politics, economics and heavier topics. I think this is where Rationalist fiction would fall, since it's less about the characters and setting and more about exploring the ideas and rational behind the story.

Character: There are some genres that put most of their focus on the characters and their interactions. This is the autobiography, and the genres that have a narrow focus, like thrillers.

Events: Some genres are driven by the progression of events in the story over the characters, or ideas presented. This is mostly for the Action and Adventure genres, where the character could be anyone as long as they go through the right hoops.

​

It's a really rough pattern, and it's also nearly 4am, but... yeah. Genre isn't the most well-defined thing out there, and is usually more for the convenience of the reader (and the marketing team). They're really just a way certain elements within a story are treated.

I think most genres have one major focus, and the other storytelling elements tend to be weaker for it, which is fine. It means that you could take any story and replace the setting with a fantasy or sci-fi world. Or you could turn any novel into a rationalist one by having the characters and narrative spend more time deconstructing the events happening within it.

***** The thing is that many of the things that you speculated might "define" rational fiction are actually just tropes carried over from the fact that most rational fiction shared on [[/r/rational]] is also either fantasy or sci-fi. And mostly fantasy I think. Things like action-adventure, predominantly male protagonists in power struggles, anger and/or inadequacy being initially acceptable weaknesses to be overcome as the story progresses are all widespread among fantasy genre fiction and thus also very frequent in fantasy genre fiction that can be labeled as rational. However one can easily write fiction (if writing a good story can ever be called "easy") that will be acclaimed as rational by this subreddit while avoiding all of those characteristics.

Serialized fiction as well has nothing to do with wether a story is rational or not. It is just the currently fashionable way of writing /any/ fiction for free online. Most long form fanfics, regardless of genre or plot coherence, are being published chapter by chapter. And since [[/r/rational]] is a relatively niche online community, the (free) writing of its members often looks like that. But especially among published science fiction there is quite a bit of material that most on here would consider rational, despite not having several of the traits you enumerated. It's just not /called/ rational fiction by the wider community of readers because the term itself isn't widespread. The same goes probably for any truly well plotted crime mystery that rewards intelligent reading and doesn't suffer from plot holes or idiot balls.

Maybe it's just a semantic issue I have. When I think of a genre I think of the primary label a fiction has, that can be used to give an idea of the setting the story is set in without necessarily requiring additional labels. "Rational" just tells me that the story aims to be well plotted out, have robust world building (if needed), rewards readers who pay attention to details, and has characters with clear motivations that keep on acting according to their motives and characterization. That's in no way enough to tell me what I'm actually reading. It could be anything from realistic historical fiction to urban fantasy police procedural.

************ Fantasy (and pulpiest sci-fi as well I guess) requires the writer to invent an entire reality, with its own logic, physics, history, etc, just to make things coherent. The more fantastical the setting, the less the author can use RL physics and ideas to prop it. Moreover, the author has to SHOW that his reality is coherent, because it is not self evident.

Worse still, the author needs for their fantasy reality it be as close to perfectly internally coherent as possible, while the reader only really needs to find one mistake or two to be discouraged from further reading.

Hence why the common wisdom about writing fiction is "Your job is harder than God's"

As most writers are not geniuses themselves, nor are they truly rationalists, writing coherent fantasy world for a rational hero to dismantle is near-impossible. Worse still if it is a fantasy fanfic, because the pre-existing fantasy was not written with rational analysis in mind, it was just supposed to be enjoyed on a casual level.

Take HPMOR for example, which I think is one of the best, if not the best rat-fic in existence. Even in it, the author had to make Harry lean on the 4th wall and basically admit that "this magical world simply makes no sense, so lets skip to another topic, shall we?" It only worked because HPMOR is partial satire of the genre.

Take another cult classic, Mother of Learning. It is probably the best rat-fic in here, but even in it the author has to frantically update and expand the lore backwards, inwards and outwards with each chapter to account for reader's rational analysis. (and lets be frank and a bit spoilerish, MoL is basically sci-fi with a fantasy wrapping)

Compared to that, writing realistic rational science fiction, especially hard science fiction is easier, because the author can always fall back on RL physics, evidently existing technologies, math, cosmology, biology etc to support his world-building, and thus cannot be caught with his pants down so easily.

The bane of the rat-fic author is the reader thinking "hey, why didn't the protagonist do the obvious thing (munchkin solution goes here)". With hard sci-fi, the author can preemptively stop that line of thinking, because if there was an "obvious solution" to some problem in a hard sci-fi story, it would also be already used in Real Life, and we would be LIVING in a sci-fi reality.

** Here's another method to classify rational fiction. Instead of looking at genre fiction as a collection of tropes, look at it as a set of expectations. If they're met, you're writing in that genre.

Expectations of a romance (female/male):

- Meet main character in the first chapter. She is usually young, twenties-thirties and single. She has a personal problem that she can't resolve (insecurity, loneliness, family trouble, illness, etc.)
- Meet main male character. He also has a problem that can't be resolved (cold, arrogant, depressed, etc.) He's usually traditionally masculine and attractive, but not always.
- Story might include a love triangle with a third character, and it's the writers job to make it clear that this character is not as good for the MC as her eventual love interest.
- While there can be other plot elements involved, the love interest is most important, so they must interact frequently. This is how you end up with contrived scenarios like "stuck in an elevator" or "there's only one bed." When characters are distant from each other, they must still interact in some way (phone call, female lead meeting her romantic interest's relative and learning a secret, etc.).
- Throughout the story, we see how two main leads help each other grow to overcome their personal problems.
- In the end, there is a happily every after.

Not all stories follow this exact format, and you can bend the rules, but you risk annoying the reader if you break too many of them. This is because readers want the experience of falling in love, and if the story doesn't do that, they'll feel cheated.

Now, I'll compare this with the expectations of rational fiction.

Expectations of a rational fiction (on this subreddit):

- Main character is usually male, in their twenties. He has a problem with the world as it is and wants to solve it.
- The lead is competent. Whenever problems arise, it is the main lead's job to overcome them using his intellect. While he might not start out as competent, he will progressively get stronger throughout the story.
- The main lead is intelligent in an analytical way. This usually translates to a high IQ. While other forms of intelligence may be present (musical, survival, EQ, etc.) the main character relies on his IQ or game knowledge to solve problems.
- The magic or science of this world must be knowable (as opposed to mystical). The main character must use this knowledge in clever ways that the reader can see and understand.
- At the end of the story, the main character must be instrumental in solving the final crisis. It cannot be a side character or an outside influence saving the day.

While a writer can bend some of these expectations and modify them, they must be careful. People have expectations when reading rational fiction, and if they're not met, the story will either be less popular or disliked. This is because readers want the experience of feeling competent, and if the story doesn't do that, they'll feel cheated.

I can't think of many stories promoted on this sub that don't meet the expectations I described here. This is in spite of the fact that a lot of popular sci-fi and fantasy does /not/ have these expectations. Therefore, we can conclude that rational fiction follows its own genre conventions.

** rationalist fiction is almost always within the fantasy and sci-fi genres. Why?

Because fantasy and science fiction are the only literary genres that can handle "rationalization" of its tropes and conventions. Every other genre would either collapse on itself, or become incomprehensible mess:

- Romance/drama: depends on deep irrationality to even work, and the whole tension in the plot only works when people make dramatically stupid decisions. Rationalists are simply happy in love or happy single, and the tension does not exist.

- Horror: rationalist horror would have a significantly more capable protagonist, and thus would be just very dark rationalist fantasy

- Western/historical/biography etc - glaringly incompatible with Real Life histories, since 99.99999% of these people were not rationalists.

- Thriller: if the protagonist/antagonist are even remotely competent rationalists, it becomes rationalists science fiction (because there is a technological/scientific solution to every danger and problem)

- Mystery/Detective: rationalist detective story would be all but incomprehensible to a normal person, heck, even to a rationalist. Mystery and detective stories depend on deep deduction, and so do rationalist stories. This would be a level of exponential complexity more fitting for a 3rd year logic exam, not prose.

- Dystopia: basically rationalist sci-fi, with a political bent. Ask Ayn Rand how well that works.

- Adventure: rationalist action/adventure story with a half-capable protagonist/antagonists becomes hard sci-fi.

Why? By that logic, rationalist sci-fi becomes incomprehensible unless you have a physics PhD. This all depends on how the story is presented. In many ways, 'rationalist detective story' is arguably what Sherlock Holmes tries to be.
