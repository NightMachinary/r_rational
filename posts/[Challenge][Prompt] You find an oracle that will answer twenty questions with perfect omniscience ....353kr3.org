*Write me some flash/short fiction.* Here is your prompt:

A person (or persons) acquires/finds/steals *[[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Oracle_AI][an oracle]]* which can answer a *limited* number of questions with perfect (or near-perfect) omniscient knowledge.

What are the best questions to ask given some system of values? What interesting answers might the oracle give? What limits does the oracle have in place? (/ex. the oracle cannot answer nested questions, or counts nested questions as being multiple questions, or must compress their answer to something that can be expressed in 15000 characters of English, knowledge of the future is ruined by asking questions about the future, etc./) How do people react to this certain (or near-certain) knowledge, or the possibility of acquiring it?

Your choice of first or third person. Your choice of what form the oracle takes (/ex. Mayan artifact, artificial intelligence from the future, creepy doll, strangely ageless boy in a Tibetan monastery, government research project, etc./). Your choice of which of the above questions (if any) to answer. *Optimize for an /awesome/ and /interesting/ and /clever/ story* rather than one where a character wins everything forever (though maybe those goals won't be in conflict).

The winner, as decided by reddit "best" sorting at the end of a week, gets *a month of reddit gold* from me.

Edit: Congratulations to [[/u/xamueljones]]!


** I bit my lower lip in worry as I stared at the paper with my Question. It wasn't fair. Every fairy tale I had ever heard of always, /always/, *always* had three chances for the protagonist. Three wishes, three quests, three trials, three, three, three...

I had the chance of a lifetime to have any possible question answered Truthfully. Not the truth were you are 99.99...% percent certain with a lot of nines trailing off with a only small niggling doubt that you /might/ be wrong, but a Truth that couldn't ever be false. A Truth so self-evident that if reality contradicted the Oracle, then reality itself was wrong. The magic of the Oracle allowed visitors to convince others absolutely the Truth of the Answer to their Question. No one could lie about their Question and what the Oracle told them for their Answer.

And I only had one question I was allowed to ask the Oracle.

Oh well no crying over fantasies that won't come true.

I dropped the paper into my Bag of Holding as I glanced up. The temple doors remained closed and the sun was almost at its highest peak. I would be entering precisely at noon and be the only person admitted in for the day. I looked at the List hanging above the doorway:

1. You get only one question. Stop asking for a repeat!
2. Yes only one question. Go away!
3. No you don't get any refunds. How do you refund a question anyway!?!
4. Be polite. This is common courtesy. If you are getting an Answer, then you could at least be polite to the Oracle!
5. Got your Answer? Then go away!!!

I got the impression that a lot of people tended to be rather annoying about their Question.

I looked back behind me at the crowd of people waiting. Well 'crowd' was a poor word. Perhaps an ocean of people? The city was called the *Filthy Ocean* for a reason. I was just glad to be out away from the smelly, disease-ridden line I had spent the past three years working my way through. You had to keep a sharp eye out for anyone willing to cut you out of the lines. Literally in some cases as I eyed the nearby graveyards.

It was no wonder that people were always so selfish about their Questions. With only one question allowed per person and with the enormous cost of waiting in this potentially lethal line, people were cutthroat about their Question. It was amusing how even though the Oracle didn't charge anything, the price of waiting in silence was still high enough to keep people away and to madden the ones waiting to the point of paranoia. No wonder people rarely asked selfless questions. They always asked for something to make them richer, more powerful, or something to get ahead of the rat pack that was life. I must be insane to be wasting my question like this after sinking years of my life into this task, but at least I'll be done with the lines after this. That was the important thing.

/OH/

The door just creaked open a crack. It was my turn.

*** Backstory:

I imagined a medival world where anyone could ask the Oracle any question they wanted, but only once in their lifetimes. The conditions...would be horrendous as the population density would be extremely high. No one would be able to force their way to the line without a bloody massacre and there are multiple factions in the area who would band together against the hypothetical threat.

Money wouldn't work either since no one has the wealth available to bribe enough people to leave after waiting months to make a difference. In addition, no one is allowed past the first tenth of the line without waiting in the line itself. There just isn't enough room!

The Temple of the Oracle is wholly self-sustaining for this reason and therefore has a catapult with disposable parachutes to help visitors get past the crowd when leaving.

Don't forget the chances of an epidemic killing off the people and the difficulties the people face in bringing enough food and supplies to last through the line. It's not a good thing for this world that Bags of Holding (from DnD) exist.

Of course I then started thinking about the game-theoretic strategies behind what Questions could be asked to give one an advantage. It became very likely that people would rarely ask questions not immediately relevant to themselves and the Oracle's power would go to waste. Hence the story of someone who hopes to improve things for the better by 'wasting' a Question to let others know the truly best possible Question to ask...

It just told you what was irrefutably /true/, so that anything it said, you could trust to be a /fact of the world/. It did not give probabilities, it gave full and complete certainty: P(thing the Oracle says) = 1.0, unable to be contradicted by anything else in the history of everything ever.

I do imagine it's being disturbingly tricksy with your questions, though, as Full Information is half the superintelligence superpower in the first place, and because frankly a lot of the kinds of questions people /think/ they should ask a Prophetic Oracle are the ones were they'll be more disturbed than satisfied by the answers. Even if the Oracle's being /nice/, as /we/ interpret "nice", it's going to conceal a lot and trick a lot, because just giving things away isn't really safe with people who don't have some analogue to the [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin][Litany of Gendlin]].

I mean, maybe it's me being stuck on this "rationality" kick, but it seems to me that when people /really want to know/, they just investigate, or pay someone else to do so, but when they want someone big and important-looking to tell them It's a Grand and Valuable Mystery, /then/ they consult a Prophetic Oracle.

You could also ask for everything you're going to write somewhere, which would effectively let you ask for any question that you'll ever answer. Or if you really want to munchkin this, you can just cause a contradiction unless you get what you want so that what you want happens. The whole thing about the future changing due to future knowledge can be avoided by asking about a hypothetical future such that the answers to the questions match the answers the oracle gives.

** Finally, after searching for so long, I turned the corner to the chamber of truth. Inside, atop a carved alter inlaid with large, striking gems, sat a typewriter. It had a cracked beige plastic exterior which still bore the remnants of a sticker indicating that it was on sale. This was strange, given that descriptions had been found preserved on a papyrus dating back to, at least, the rise of the greek empire. After locating mentions of its location in a medieval manuscript, a few archeologists set out to track down the location mentioned. My companions had, unfortunately taken ill from the local fare, leaving me, their local guide, to take a look while they recovered.

From The Typewriter extrudes a piece of paper covered in latin, greek, and other unidentifiable pictograms. The paper itself looks like something one would buy at a store. Driven to see whether the legends are true, I begin to type a message, oblivious to the question of how the clearly type-cast pictographs were created by a regular qwerty keybord.

** Inspired based on a book I'm currently writing:

Mordred returned to the temple of the Fates for the first time in ten years, the memory fresh in his mind of the day Pan took him as an apprentice and he met his brothers Fenrir and Jormungand. Knowing that the Triptych were technically his family he decided against trying to con the Fates, too much time with Pan had taught him the consequences of interfering in the realms of the other gods. Instead he chose to ask one singular question that would allow him his free will.

"What course of action must I take to ensure my life remains my own, free from the interference of the Triptych, Clothos, Lachesis and Atropos?"

Upon receiving his answer and deliberating on it within the temple for the rest of the day, he left and proceded to do the exact opposite of the answer to his question.

Because seriously, who asks an oracle of the Fates for advice on how to leave their realm and actually follows it?

Pan had taught him well.

**** It's internally consistent with my fictional universe though, the visions of the oracles are granted by the fates, and thus any answer given would be in line with the fates' interests. Within the universe Mordred is the only individual free from the wheel of fate and able to make decisions the fates have no control over. I don't write rationalist fiction so I could care less what EY has to say on the matter

****** Of course, he is an insanely clever writer and very good at what he does. It would be unwise to disregard his experience and advice entirely, but if I feel my story is better served disregarding some of the rules he sets for himself then that's my prerogative :)

** "Will I be the top comment of alexanderwales' reddit thread in a weeks time in order to win a month of reddit gold?" The voice of the nervous redditor shook almost as much as the all-knowing magic 8 ball in his hands. For a few moments he waited anxiously, cursing under breath his the shape of the oracle's form.

The words swam into being, black ink blots slowly forming into five words: "Better not tell you now".

"Darn you oracle and darn the fact that you have your own value system!"
