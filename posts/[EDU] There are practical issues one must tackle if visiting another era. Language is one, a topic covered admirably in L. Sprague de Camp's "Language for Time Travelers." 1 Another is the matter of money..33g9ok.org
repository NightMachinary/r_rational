*** Sure, as long as you're between 1850 and 1888 - preferably towards the end. Before 1846, metallic aluminium had never been synthesised, so nobody would have any use for it except as a curiosity.

If you specifically knew you were going to the mid-1880s, then an ingot of aluminium would be more valuable than gold. But everywhen else it's not particularly good for trading.

*** Yes actually because aluminum was an extremely scarce material centuries ago. In fact, royalty would eat off aluminum plates while dukes would eat off /platinum/ plates. However, when Hans Christian Ã˜rsted (I think?) managed to produce aluminum by extracting it from the reactions of two common chemicals, aluminum became insanely cheap. Imagine diamonds becoming cheap as bread.

TL;DR - Yes, more than gold or silver.

** Without having read the article yet, my first thought would be: Go to the supermarket, buy up all the salt and spices you can get your hands on. Salt is cheaper than dirt (well, potting soil) in much of modern Western society, but was highly valuable back in the day -- Roman legionnaires were paid in the stuff. Spices are high-value, low mass, and the small screw-top glass jars you can get them in will be valuable in their own right. (Granted, you'll want to buy most of your spices in bulk.)

Aside from that...hm. Medical supplies won't be understood well enough to be valuable in much of history, although you'll definitely want some antibiotics for yourself. Cubic zirconia might be a good option if you're morally flexible -- I don't know if anyone in the far past could tell the difference between CZes and diamonds.

EDIT: [[#s][I]]

One thing he brought up at the end of how to make a profit on your return. He mentions the mass / volume limits on bringing stuff back, but there's another issue: anything you bring back in your time machine won't pass carbon dating etc as being the right age. Much better would be to set up multiple caches of stuff and then simply "treasure hunt" them up in the modern era. No mass / volume limits, and everything will pass any tests people want to use, because it really /is/ exactly what you claim it to be.

*** I seem to recall that before the 18th century, diamonds were really not valuable. Sure, there were some remarkable and large pieces, but small diamonds were boring. People liked jewelry with color, like rubies, sapphires, etc. There are artificial gemstones of other types that might be of greater value than diamonds.

Interesting. Reading the article, apparently Romans liked diamonds a great deal.

Sell the steam engine. I could design a wood burning steam powered mill, and get it working in 2-3 attempts, from memory, now. I could do much better bringing back technical schematics. The only issue here is fuel. Of course with steam power, I can run a drill that pulls out more coal than the drill consumes, to power even better engines.

Don't sell today's spices at yesterdays prices, build a rail line across the middle east and sell yesterdays spices at yesterdays prices.

**** Steam engines aren't a bad idea, but I think you would run into issues with material sciences. if you were restricted to copper or bronze or brass, would you be able to create an engine that could perform enough work to justify the cost of the mass of metal required to contain the combustion and cooling systems? Systemically, it is an interesting problem. I've considered it from the aspect of a stone aged materials base with a modern era understanding of science. You would need to create the science understanding though, or figure out a way to use simple materials.

Mining coal would likely not be a good choice before high grade steel. Even iron chisels and tools would break down quickly, and your energy would have to be largely devoted to replacing the bits and the equipment to make the bits, even if you could recycle most of the iron. Charcoal from charcoal burning pits, or even wood would work though.

*** The problem with these ideas is that you don't remain in control of them, and the concept of intellectual property really has no roots going back beyond a few centuries ago. You teach people how to distill alcohol, make float glass, or design greenhouses and the effort might earn you short-term wealth, but your ideas would be stolen and used by others very quickly - especially if they are game changers.

So, if you want wealth, you need to sell the results of a process that you can manage yourself. Distilling alcohol would be a good one.

If you want to improve the world, well, that's a completely different story!

**** But, before globalization, ideas also didn't spread very far. Pick a small country, and then start continuously pumping up its GDP by feeding "discoveries" to random local entrepreneurs, while also worming your way into its politics (propped up, of course, by lobbying from the same now-successful entrepreneurs.) Whichever country you pick takes over the world at the same rate you take over the country.

(Oddly, this is effectively the same strategy [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/07/no-physical-substrate-no-problem/][posited here]] as the easiest way for an AI to get a lot of human labor-force under its control to build it a body.

***** I hesitate to believe that well-explained ideas wouldn't spread quickly and far. A lot of the ideas that we look at today as being pivotal and potentially game changing in ancient days were barely understood, scientifically, and were frequently military secrets.

Now, if you feel immortal enough to try to get into the politics of ancient governments, then you can start feeding to the military industrial complex of that nation, true. You'd best hire a lot of damn fine bodyguards, and pay food tasters though, because every new advance you generate will destroy some other important person's industry.

You would have a hard time worming your way into politics as an outsider in many nations, no matter how you tried. In others, there's no way you would manage it in any way as a merchant.

We have a very open world these days. It's hard to imagine how closed the world was in ancient times.

******* I won't say it's impossible, but trying to get into political power in the ancient world would be dramatically difficult, even by proxy. In a day and time when there was no internet and no organized postal service, figuring out who is talking to who was not hard. The more people your figurehead ruins, the harder that their enemies are going to be looking for your figurehead's source of ideas, money, whatever. Not an insurmountable problem, but, honestly, I'd rather trade as a merchant in the distant past, and live rich in the future.

** Assuming you can jump back and forth at will, take sufficient tools to perform a massive bank heist in a given era (or theft of gold, silver, or other valuable commodities), and then skip back five or ten years and establish yourself as a rich trader or foreign dignitary.

If you absolutely must stay through to the time of the heist (and assuming a single timeline), it would be trivial to arrange to be seen in public in a different city by multiple persons of impeccable word, and your own known wealth would not change (ie suspiciously increase).

As for bringing items and commodities forward in time - why not simply invest a large amount of money in the past and leave a set of instructions about how to manage and invest it over the centuries? Let compound interest and knowledge of how various industries would develop do the work for you. Have an ancient order of monks hang around for a thousand years carrying out your will.

Even better if you can just pop into the bank every 30-50 years or so as the "heir" to the previous owner. If you can find a bank that will stay open for the duration, that you can trust, you can make a lot of money.

** Personally? I'd carry razor blades as trade goods if I went back to the pre-industrial age. Good, stout blades that could be mounted in wood, brass, bronze, copper, or ceramic tools. Teach people how to sharpen them and keep them oiled. Be careful though. The military will probably attempt to recruit you for your knowledge, and would almost certainly be extremely upset if you were to take your secret of blades to another nation. Choose the nation you visit carefully, and make the stay a short one.

Trade razor blades for gold. Rinse, repeat.
