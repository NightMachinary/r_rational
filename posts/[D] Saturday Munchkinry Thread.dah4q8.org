Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** In general, there's an Earthfic/real-world munchkinry question of what a protagonist should do once rich. Surprisingly few stories focus on this question for how large it would loom in reality; "Jumper" (the novel) is the main case that springs to my mind. I have at least two old story ideas on the backboiler that imply wealth acquisition by the protagonist.

Suppose a protagonist wants to spend an average of $1000/week on having fun. How could they spend that intelligently?

*** I'm not even sure $48,000 of frivolous spending is the kind of rich most people think of. Looks like $100,000+ annual income's have an average of $66,451 a year of discretionary income ([[https://www.marketingcharts.com/industries/financial-services-2340]]) and this gets even higher as you get to higher incomes. Here's my suggestions though:

Short term fun: Eat at fancy places, party, and travel.

Longer term fun:

Find a sport or hobby you love and spend on that. It's probably the best cost/benefit I know of. Wealthy people tend to do this naturally.

Hire a weekly: personal financial manager, personal trainer and/or physical therapist, chef, massage therapist, fashion manager, maid. I'm sure there's some kind of professional home manager, get one of those. Essentially remove all the thinking and maintenance work for everything you don't love, and let professionals handle that for you. I believe this is currently highly undervalued as evidenced by the large number of professionals who struggle with many of these topics when they should just put professionals in charge of them. Doctor's struggling with food and exercise springs to mind.

Buy: very nice quality versions of whatever you use daily. 1k a week you can get one or two super nice smaller items a week and get the entertainment of researching them if you want to.

Lease a fun car.

I'm not sure the discretionary income they mean is actually discretionary. $100k is going to mean that 66k is just after taxes, if even that much. Someone with 66k after taxes can't spend it all on having fun, unless they neither need a place to live, have kids, eat, or save for retirement. And that's just federal taxes only.

*** It depends on what you're optimizing for:

Most cost-effectively? Buy and play video games. With games like Stormworks, Kerbal Space Program, ArmA 3, Skyrim, Minecraft, Terraria, Space Engineers, Factorio, Stellaris, and Civilization (choose from IV, V, IV, or Beyond Earth), you could easily have an amazingly fun time playing for over two years as if it was your full-time job and spend no more than $1,500 on the games, expansions, computer and accessories combined over the entire timespan. Additionally, if you need to lose weight, some of these games are addictive enough that (for me at least), it is possible to be so immersed in the game as to neglect meals, making it trivially easy to perform intermittent fasting. Some of these games can also teach you skills that are useful in real-life, like programming in C# with Space Engineers or with Lua in Stormworks.

Most enjoyably? That depends on personal preferences, so there's a wide range of potential answers. It could encompass movies, games, music, books, hiking, painting, hang gliding, skydiving, surfing, dancing, drinking, fucking, partying, traveling, or even just talking with friends, among many other possibilities.

Most productively? Creative hobbies and exercise. For example, building and programming a robot can be a lot of fun, plus it has useful applications. Writing a book or designing a game which revolves around some technical subjects could be fun and drive you to do some fairly in-depth research on the topic. On the other side, exercise will keep you healthy so you don't end up spending the last few decades of your life with a body crippled by obesity, atrophied muscles, and frail bones. A healthy balance of exercise and creative hobbies seems like the most productive approach.

Of course, there's also a strong argument in favor of variety. Everything gets boring eventually. It's obviously reasonable to pick some of these choices (depending on what you're optimizing for) until you get bored of it and then switch over to something else that you enjoy, and then come back to old hobbies when they strike your interest again.

*** On having fun? Well, it's a kinda obvious answer, but it seems like drugs should probably be part of that money. WHICH drugs is a highly important question, since some would lead to lower fun in the long run and thus would not be an intelligent use of the money, but it's also fairly personal to the protagonist and their drug preferences, as well as their level of risk tolerance. Certainly there are those who just don't enjoy mind altering substances whatsoever, but I think safe and fun use of mind altering substances is an area that's been underexplored in rational fiction.

If it were me, I'd spend part of that money on custom syntheses (or the equipment to do it myself) of various structurally novel psychedelics that have never been explored before. But that's a pretty personal goal, and my wish to do so is more out of a desire to explore than belief that those novel drugs would, in a manner entirely separate from that desire, also happen to provide more fun/$ and a better ratio of fun to risk (the risk is, I believe, lower than most would assume, but it's certainly higher than an already proven very safe drug like LSD).

That said, not ALL the money should be used on drugs, certainly. Drugs are, IMO, usually best used to make a fun experience way more fun, not as the only fun thing you're doing (some exceptions being drugs that offer fully immersive experiences, like DMT or salvia).

**** I don't think 48k a year gets you anywhere close to safely testing novel drugs. Even if you mean new designer drugs (known mechanism of action, new molecule to target it) I think you'd need far more to safely test them. I'd highly recommend not doing this, chemistry on a large scale still often fails at making known products using known methods even without the drugs possibly having harmful effects alone.

With 48k a year you could do a hell of a lot of drug tourism though! It's not illegal if you go to places where the laws a different! Much safer too, stick to the drugs we have historic experience with even though there still isn't nearly enough research. LSD and THC appear to be the highest fun/risk in my opinion.

#+end_quote

Assuming we're talking about 48k a year PLUS everything needed to survive (Eliezer's post seemed to me to imply that that budget is only for fun), it depends on where you put the bar at "safely" at. I'd need to look up custom synth and identity+purity testing prices, but I'd expect it to be feasible. But if you're talking the kind of extensive testing we perform on animals for each new drug, then obviously yeah, 48k a year is nowhere NEAR enough. But I honestly don't believe that that kind of testing is likely to be necessary when we're only talking about small modifications to existing structures.

As I said, I personally think the risks are somewhat lower than you're imagining, but they're certainly higher than something proven safe like LSD. For me personally, I believe that's a risk I'd consider worthwhile for the sake of exploration if I had the money to do so. For others who don't share that desire to explore the frontiers of alterations to subjective experience, LSD will do just fine and is much safer. And there are steps in between exploring truly novel structures like Shulgin did and like I wish I could do and just using the mainstays like LSD; for example just exploring the commercially available "RCs". The various dialkyltryptamines (at least the ones that have appeared so far, and likely all the others with relatively simple alkyl substituents), for example, almost all appear to be around the safety level of DMT itself (with a few key exceptions, of course, so caution is warranted), and the same is true for their 4-hydroxy counterparts with regards to psilocin. But their effects can vary greatly compared to the parent compound. For those with lower risk tolerance than me in this regard but who still wish to explore, that appears to be a very safe and fruitful area to explore, and one that (last I checked) is in a pretty good period in terms of commercial availability (but also still has some easy areas left virtually completely unexplored, like PiPT).

Reckless exploration would be, well, reckless. But it is very possible to mitigate risk by various methods, including starting at very low doses and working upwards, picking modifications that seem likely to be safe (this gets easier as the SAR of a category becomes better understood), and ideally testing at least LD50 on animals. There will be some risk, but I value exploration even at the cost of personal risk, and this is the kind of research that can only be DONE with some degree of personal risk, at least ethically. Animal research can maybe tell us if a compound is a psychedelic (with some degree of accuracy), but the exact nature of the experience could not be learned that way.

**** I'd like to put forth that there's quite a few unique sorts of psychedelic experiences that you can only have if you can afford to spend a lot of money.

For instance unlike many other psychedelics DMT doesn't rapidly build tolerance in the same way that say acid does. So if you could afford it you could potentially prepare an IV of DMT (plus some beta blockers) and trip for as many hours as you want. Given how short typical DMT visions are (not that they can't pack a whole lot into that time) this might allow your trips to become qualitatively different and may unlock all kinds of novel altered states/experiences.\\
Similarly with money you could afford your own soundproofed sensory deprivation tank to be used as much and whenever you want. So this combined with access to lots to psychedelics could allow you lots of unique experiences most psychonauts never get access to.

***** Why are NP maths "above" numerical operations?

For example, consider the problem "Solve =md5sum(n) = 00000000000000000000000000000000= for =n=." It takes a lot of time to solve on a normal computer, because you have to brute-force it, but verifying the result is trivially easy. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Pseudocode][md5 algorithm is just math]]. Taking "near instantaneous" and "any", it's possible to do the math.

Or do you think some of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation][mathematical models of computation]] aren't numerical operations?

#+begin_quote
  I'm not convinced even with the time you'd save with the input you would offset the processing power of a real computer.
#+end_quote

Classical computers won't solve the md5sum problem given above quickly. The chip, as you've described it, provides "near instantaneous, subconscious results to any numerical operations", and since the md5sum problem is representable as numerical operations, a user of the chip should receive a near-instantanous result, right?

Thus, my munchkinning.

** I have an absurdly rich fashion designer ex-Big Bad, whose wife, a damsel in distress who has recently woken up from a six-year coma, is being hunted down by his personal assistant, who can create homicidal Eldrich abominations. He has built the standard array of booby traps, but they were not enough to stop the personal assistant the last time (she probably helped), and he wants to improve them before she comes back to finish the job.

Also, I need a panic room for the wife that's as impenetrable as possible but will keep her completely in the dark to the shenanigans going on outside as much as possible.

The husband has no superpowers any more, nor mechanical or electrical engineering degrees, but has functionally unlimited money and an “ends justify the means” approach to morality. Keep in mind that any contractors he hires he also has to silence.

The married couple cannot disappear from town because Plot Reasons. The husband is reasonably sure that if he can call for help, his son the fluttery butterfly from last week can call for more heroes to save them (even if the fluttery butterfly himself is kinda useless in combat, especially in tight spaces)

*** No bunker can remain if enemies have everything outside controlled. Booby traps without follow up only effectively slow enemies.

That being said, for realistic fiction:

Arbitrarily deep shaft into the ground, that you then collapse once you are inside. The time/cost of rescuing you will be the same as the time/cost of the attacker digging you up and killing you. Have all your food, water, power, and air inside with you. This also completely seals off communication unless you can leave a cable tunnel that the Eldritch can't crawl through. Or leave that tunnel and have them fight small abominations?

Fiction suggestions:

Have fun with the booby traps, explosives, spikes, darts, collapsing sections, bait etc but the attacker can create mooks so these are useless unless you get the creator. Look into fantasy traps with modern parts, and throw in some attack drones and chemicals for fun.

Make inside the bunker interesting. Overengineer it with food, air, and water recycling. Inside over the top entertainment or security measures. Maybe it's only halfway done or doesn't fully work.

Hiding from the inside: no idea for long term. Short term hide it as checking out the bunker together, touring it, or discuise it as a Uber home theater, immersion tank, or something. Maybe it's some business data center he put in since she was in a coma (look up some that are in bunkers for inspiration anyway) Having a fake bunker entryway that hides it until later might work, gets her there and occupied without realizing until it's been sealed up and the emergency supplies are needed.

*** Here's a thought:

Last time, the array of traps mainly protected a certain 'safe room'. This was a decoy, the real safe room was in a different city; however, all communications were routed through the decoy to preserve the illusion. (The assistant broke through to the decoy room last time, then followed the communication links from there).

The assistant will be expecting a return to this. The ex-Big Bad can subvert this in numerous ways; here are two possibilities:

- This time, he and his wife are in what was the decoy room last time. He broadcasts this fact (and the location of the decoy room) to the assistant often. She assumes that this is a decoy room again and ignores it.
- This time, they're in the same room as they were last time, and the ex-Big Bad vehemently denies that they might be in the old Decoy Room. This is true - the old Decoy Room really contains a nuclear warhead, ready to detonate when reached.

Anyway, once they've been sufficiently butterflied it seems the easy solution would be to exploit asymmetrical intellectual labor. Find some successful, original animated film that exists in one universe and not the other, and then either publish it on YouTube yourself for the ad revenue or sell it to whatever big animation house is willing to pay the most. Rinse and repeat a few times and found a deep learning startup through which you can funnel live-action movies. Once the courts settle down, expand into other software & theory development and ~double your company's productivity. Then expand into other fields of inquiry, also poaching sufficiently divergent results from other companies & journals.

Once you've made a few trillion and sufficiently secured your position, consider revealing your device to the general public. Those born before the butterflies would probably be curious to exchange letters, videoed, etc. with their alternate selves, speak to deceased loved ones, etc. You could also more publicly explore what other divergences have occurred as a result of your ‘natural experiment'.

(other media could also work in the first stage --- original books would probably be easiest and least traceable --- but maybe also higher variance wrt their success. But easier to keep above board, since you could quicker contact your univers's ‘author' and confirm they've nothing similar in the works vs. doing he same with Pixar or w/e)

** You wakeup one day with two clones. Memory syncs during sleep.

So divergence can only be as long as you can stay awake, and no three brains one consciousness.

How can you use this? You'd need to sleep to beat that 1 million challenge of knowing what your sibling knows with no communication

People you know don't freak out about the clones and they get a duplicate of all your possessions including birth certificate and bank accounts. You get to choose the name during your sleep before they appear

*** If I have a few years, "insider" trading could become pretty successful or simply engaging in corporate espionage. Magic tricks ala The Prestige could be another easy form of currency, as well as running con scenarios.

Question: does memory sync when any one clone sleeps? Or only when all three clones are all sleeping concurrently, or is there some sort of "Clone A sleeps, so his memories get stored, but Clone B doesn't get them until he sleeps" paradigm? Does the memory travel faster than light? IE if I'm in Alpha Centauri and my clone is on earth, can I get FTL communication?

What about Lucid Dreaming? Do those update in real time while we're sleeping?

**** Insider trading and the prestige could presumably be done with any twin regardless of the memory sync/day old clone.

When one clone sleeps, if there are two awake clones then he gets the memory of the one that slept most recently.

Information travels at light speed or if an ftl method is invented via that.

Uh lucid dreaming, I don't know how you could tell if it was synced during dreams or not. I guess if you force yourself to wake up and your clone wake up at same time. Seems okay I suppose

*** Oh, hey, I just wrote a story about this: [[https://irradiate.space/stories/susie-plans-a-heist/]]

Long story short: to avoid inconsistencies, delegate tasks. On any given day, one you handles interfacing with the world. The other ones work on whatever projects you want to spend two-thirds of your attention on.

** I have a sort of anti-munchkinry question. There's an absurdly powerful device, and I want to find mundane uses for it.

You have a device that teleports you to any fictional universe that has some physical presence on Earth (more specifically defined as the planet where you first got this device). It can be a bunch of text documents on a hard drive, an artwork, a song recorded on a cassette, anything like that. Being physically present as neurons and synapses in someone's mind doesn't count.

The rules are the follows:

1. You can choose at what point in the history of the world do you arrive. You also have control over the exact place of arrival, down to a centimeter.

2. If you choose so, the device can make up a backstory for you, so you can more or less naturally blend into the story. Of course, if you look and/or act nothing like the native inhabitants of the world, your presence will still raise questions.

3. The device makes logic of the world consistent, creating explanations that make the existence of such a universe possible. For example, even you go to a world that's described as "everything's the same as Earth, but all forms of cancer are cured," not literally /everything/ will stay identical since there was an event that made the cure possible.

4. You can't bring anyone with you when teleporting. When going back, you are going to be restored to the state before the teleportation (the same body, the same clothes, etc). The device tries its best to prevent you from bringing any object from one universe to another. You keep all the memories though.

5. While you are away, the time passes on Earth (and other worlds, all relative to you); it will seem like you disappeared without a trace.

6. This device is literally one of a kind. There's no such object in any of the universes, and any attempt to replicate it will inevitably fail.

So, of course, you can hire a ghostwriter to write about a universe where everything is perfectly aligned with your hopes and dreams, and move here. You can create/choose a world that is one hundred percent like Earth, move to interesting points in time and learn the true history.

These are cool and all, but *what are simple, outright swatting-flies-with-a-sledgehammer ways to use such a device?* You can escape danger by teleporting somewhere and then popping back after a few hours, for example. What else?

Thanks in advance for answers!
