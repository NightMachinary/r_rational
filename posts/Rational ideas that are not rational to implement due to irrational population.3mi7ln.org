I'd like to see people's thoughts on rational ideas that are not rational to implement.

There are dangerous places the discussion can go with this, please be careful to avoid the really dark corners, or at least spoiler them.

There are a lot of really good ideas in the world that simply will not work because of irrational elements in our society. My example is an electromagnetic cargo-only launch system that we could use to shift raw materials and supplies into space, allowing us to more rapidly develop a space industry. We can do it, but it would be expensive. It would take away from other pork-barrel contracts, but it would be an incredible investment for space infrastructure.

The irrational element of society just doesn't see space as useful. They won't invest in it.

What other examples do you have?


** I think a lot of people are mistaking flights of fancy for rationality. If we don't have the tech to do it, it's not rational. If it's rational for other actors to mess with it, the problem isn't an irrational populace.

We don't have the technology to do this, and a space industry is a low priority for most. Most of the benefits come from satellites, which don't need a big space industry. We could possibly develop the technology, but till we do and know how hard it is this isn't a plan.

[[/u/topiary_quail]] in a democracy there are many competing interests, some of which are rationally against each other. Hilary Clinton wants to cut the private sector at the expense of the public sector. She as such appeals to unions, a major powers in the democrat party.

Give homeless people houses and starving people food. It's far, far cheaper to give people their basic needs so they can survive than dealing with them in jails and hospitals. Prison should not be used as welfare for the poor. People don't do it for irrational reasons relating to a fear that money will be wasted, so money is wasted anyway.

Mass vaccination, safety from common diseases. Vaccines massively improve health. Reason why it's not done- irrational fear of it causing autism. Many places are forcing people to vaccinate their children.

Those are the immediate ones that come to mind.

That was the point of the discussion. The plans are not implementable with obvious benefits, *due to human irrationality.*

Several of your counterarguments center around social irrationality of humans.

The resources available to us in space dwarf the resources available to us on Earth. For us to not be aggressively pushing the envelope in space is irrational. But for us to try to push the envelope is also irrational, because it will not be supported by people who don't see the potential.

No government will ever function rationally, because too many people are irrational. People who will vote based on a single letter 'R' or 'D', instead of based on issues, for an example that shouldn't start too much squabbling. Similar types of human fallacies will impact every type of government.

I /DO/ like most of your ideas that you bring up, and they definitely fit.

I'm not entirely certain about mass vaccination for diseases with low death rates. If we don't use our immune system, it might not be ready to deal with the unexpected, and less capable when needed. MMR and similar shots for children, hell yes. Yes to smallpox and polio vaccinations if those diseases ever make a resurgence. If we can find something that works effectively against HIV, yes. Allowing lesser diseases to infect the population every now and then is like exercise for the immune system.

A particular approach was proposed, using rail guns to shoot things up into space. You didn't argue about the pure benefit of space so much, and didn't prove your particular approach would actually work, as opposed to more mature and reliable tech like rockets.

Plus, what if due to the expense the risk of failure was too high? It might be rational to try again in a century when technology is more advanced.

You didn't do an actual analysis showing that financially, if everyone was rational, asteroid mining and colonization is currently a rational choice.

Yes, but if everyone is vaccinated, then only a few individuals will encounter the actual, live disease. Vaccinations are specifically designed to be easy for a healthy immune system to defeat. This gives the body an advantage when the live disease is encountered.

It's like eating right, vs. eating right and exercising. You might be healthy if you eat right, but you will be healthier if you eat right and exercise.

As another example, if you are in a low-risk group, and are seriously impacted by the flu, it may be a sign that there is something else wrong with you on a deeper level. Catching the flu might save your life by exposing something more insidious.

Vaccinated people frequently contract a weak-to-moderate case of the flu despite the vaccine.

The live virus clearly generates a stronger immune response, and a stronger future defense.

What evidence do you have for this statement? In particular, that people with a live virus (rarely or never?) catch the disease unless severely inadequate with their immune system?

#+end_quote

I'm not digging through the internet for articles to prove common sense. Vaccinations are intentionally weakened strains. This means they are less effective at inoculating individuals than the a live strain.

This, in turn, indicates that the immune system is stressed more by the live flu. For a healthy individual, a moderate disease stress is just like other sort of moderate stress. It strengthens the body systems that are stressed. This is true of skeletal muscles, the cardiopulmonary system, bones, our brains, and the immune system. Use it or lose it. Our body will happily devote calories and resources to other things if we don't seem to be needing our immune system very much.

Please do not come back and say that kids, elderly, and the infirm should be vaccinated for the flu. I agree with that. I simply do not agree with healthy adults being vaccinated against diseases that have almost no chance of harming them significantly.

If there's a really nasty flu that is particularly virulent, sure, I could see people being careful. I might even get a flu shot if a really horrible flu was detected. I have never gotten a flu shot in my entire life that I know of. I'm old enough that flu vaccinations were not common when I was a child. I'd have to ask my mother if I was vaccinated in 1976 for that scare.

In short, here's where I'm coming from. People need medical care. Yes. But medical care is not a substitute for staying in shape. For the healthy person's immune system, staying in shape means not sanitizing/using antibiotic everything, and only immunizing yourself against significant disease threats. I have never seen any reputable medical documentation to refute this.

Perhaps I am being irrational in this. I don't think so, and it's going to take a great deal of convincing to make me change my mind, which should be conducted by PM if you want to continue the discussion.

Common sense is silly. For some vaccines the vaccine is more effective than the natural infector, like Hib (Haemophilus Influenzae type b) and tetanus vaccines, for some it's less effective. Also, many natural illnesses have a high risk of death, 2/1000 for measles say.

You should stop relying on common sense. It's making you state well known falsehoods that are on lists of myths about vaccines. You're an evolved ape, not a superhuman intelligence, your common sense is no substitute for actual science.

Your ideas are not rational to implement because you're using common sense rather than maths and science.

*********** When the body defeats a natural flu, the immune response to re-introduction of the same strain is overwhelming. Dead virus vaccinations do not generate the same response, but it helps, so it is useful, and appropriate, in the young, old, and infirm.

This is the underpinning of vaccination theory. How you can even consider this to be in question is baffling. Maybe years later, the same strain might make headway against your immune system again, but not in the same season - unless you are immune system deficient. Your body is ready for it, sitting there, waiting like Tom from Tom and Jerry with a raised baseball bat over the mouse hole. The smallest new infection is smashed out of your system by an intense, successful response. That's how the immune system works. That's what vaccination attempts to duplicate.

Common sense is rationality without numbers, friend. Protecting the weak is rational. Weakening the strong with unnecessary medical treatment is irrational.

************* The Flu is a constantly evolving virus. It changes every year, and there are frequently multiple different strains in the same year. If it were possible to completely immunize everyone forever against the flu, then I'd agree to herd immunization tactics. I'm all for eliminating diseases, if they can be eliminated.

But it's not. The flu isn't a single-strain disease like Smallpox, which, once exposed via vaccination or survival, generates a near-permanent immunity.

Even if there were 100% flu vaccination coverage, flu vaccinations are simply not effective enough to prevent it from spreading. A very large part of our population is at risk for the flu, and those at-risk populations will spread the disease quite effectively, even if vaccinated.

I fully support vaccination for more virulent diseases, and for at-risk groups. But as noted in the article above, there's no need for healthy young-to-middle-aged adults to get a flu shot. Even if you consider herd immunity. Healthy adult flu immunization is an irrational practice because it has costs, but no meaningful value.

*************** First, Wikipedia is short on examples and specifics, but quite long on references. The Science Direct article is quite extensive and probably interesting if you have deep knowledge of the topic, and it is also laden with references. It was fairly painful for me to read, as I am not a subject matter expert, but the conclusions were written in terms that I was able to comprehend. WebMD mentions a study, and is generally a solid source of basic medical data.

If you believe that Wikipedia is incorrect to include this medical research as legitimate, feel free to try to prove it to people far more knowledgeable about such things than I am. I feel that your dismisal of these peer-reviewed ideas is premature. My belief in immunological systems being strengthened by exposure to microorganisms is not me simply making things up.

[[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867404003356][Homeostatic Expansion of T Cells during Immune Insufficiency Generates Autoimmunity]]

/Importantly, we show that immune stimulation causes an increase in T cell numbers and creates a population of long-lived memory T cells that are otherwise absent from the NOD strain. Indeed, an extensive list of stimulatory factors is reported to reduce the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice, including the following: persistent viral infection, mycobacterial infection, complete (heat-killed mycobacterium-containing) Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and other bacterial antigens (Rabinovitch, 1994). The “clean” domestic environments of Western societies resemble the specific pathogen-free conditions under which NOD mice are housed. This concept of hygiene developed from the original ideas of Oliver Wendell-Holmes, Sr., and Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis in the 1840s (Greenhill, 1966) and was subsequently popularized by Louis Pasteur with his “germ theory of disease” (Mendelsohn, 2002). However, the increase in autoimmunity in Western societies in recent years Kukreja and Maclaren 1999 and Kwoh 1992 may be compounded by the zealous use of disinfectants and antibiotics during the 20th century. Indeed, protection from diabetes by immunostimulation with bacterial antigen or infection parallels the state of non-Western societal contexts and reflects the fact that microinoculations can beneficially instruct the maturation of the immune system in infancy (Holt, 1998)./

Epidemiologists doing statistics on children discovered that there was a large and obvious difference between countries that had limited exposure to most childhood diseases and ones which due to various public health policies such as Strachan studying Hayfever in the 1950s. This meant that some certain diseases would reduce the incidence of childhood diseases. As I showed from early citations, vaccines have no effect on autoimmune diseases. Many scientists are trying to search for a magic bullet style infection- a single or small group of infectious agents which are minimally harmful and which reduce incidence of autoimmune diseases.

Respiratory track diseases like influenza, barring measles, haven't shown much of a decline and there certainly wasn't a rapid decline around when autoimmune diseases became so common.

So your pet theory that flu vaccines caused mass autoimmune diseases is incorrect.

If you want to reduce the incident of autoimmune diseases we could ban the hepatitis A vaccine, though that would have serious health implications since it's a pretty dangerous virus and you'd need to do some genetic studies first probably. You can also take children on more trips to farms to prime their immune systems with endotoxins and lactobacilli. As noted, infection with Helminth has some positive effects, although I've seen studies that have noted its protective effects may be limited against particular types of autoimmune disease like asthma or allergic rhinitis.

You can't just throw your hands up say YOLO and mass infect children with diseases and hope for the best. Some bacteria and viruses and worms improve immune function, some don't. Your theory isn't the proper one. Actual science is needed, not common sense.

Edit. This also isn't evidence that the immune system was affected by intelligent design or that infection strengthens it. The effect may be due to the immune system being weaker due to poorer health, or downregulation of the immune system by pathogens.

No. I did *NOT* say that. STOP putting words in my mouth. I want to be done with this conversation but you're driving me nuts with the strawman arguments. What I have said *repeatedly* was that healthy adults subjected to live viruses without vaccinations will have a stronger reaction to the disease, with nearly no risk of permanent harm. This results in the immune system being strengthened by use. That's part and parcel of the Hygiene Hypothesis. While a lot of studies are based around children, a lot of the studies were also based on adults too, if you care to look at them.

Challenging the immune system with threats it can successfully counter is shown to be a plausible way to improve immune system health. What I linked is actual science. You don't get to define what science is. Scientists do, and you better believe that the Wikipedia hard sciences folks would be all over those articles if there wasn't science to back them up. That is one thing that Wiki does do pretty well, provide accurate information on hard sciences.

Since many diseases worsen the immune system as your cited article noted, and many have no effect as mine noted, this mass infection would be a bad idea.

The flu, which is also a respiratory track disease, didn't decline around when auto immune issues started appearing. There's no actual evidence that flu infections improve your immune system functioning. The article also noted that they managed to stimulate long living immune cells by vaccinating them with mycobacterial cell wall fragments, not that they infected them with flu or a live disease.

So yes, you cite scientific articles, but not ones that actually support your point.

Vaccines use the immune system too, and certain ones can make it work better is what your scientific article proved.

************ So, issues with your rationality-

You're claiming that once you get infected you have some sort of superior immunity. This puts others in danger, as natural immunity is often inferior. Flu vaccines for example cover you against multiple strains, and as such are superior, and many vaccines are superior. Also, many diseases have a high risk of death, and pox parties and similar things where people seek natural immunity are incredibly dangerous.

You're disregarding science in favor of aligning yourself with the anti science anti vaccers who make absurd claims about vaccines. This weakens the credibility of other people who claim rationality.

You're claiming that healthy people with appropriate immunities don't get sick from those diseases. This gives people a false sense of invincibility and increases danger. In reality, immunity is just one element of a complex, multilayered set of systems to resist disease, and one which can fail or be evaded. Minimizing exposure is always important to minimize chances of an infection defeating your immune system. If you have too numerous an infection they may evolve past your immune system, and there are parts of your body where your immune system has a much weaker presence, like your brain.

So yes, your attitudes are very dangerous and risky for the future of humanity.

No, I am not. I am claiming that healthy people with appropriate immunities do not grow severely ill from most strains of the flu, and that is born out in any research you care to examine that isn't entirely focused on the most deadly strains. If someone who is otherwise healthy does grow severely ill from a flu strain that isn't one of the more dangerous strains, that flu infection might have just warned them about an immune system disorder or other ailment.

#+begin_quote
  This gives people a false sense of invincibility and increases danger.
#+end_quote

It is not a false sense of invincibility. For most strains of the flu, a healthy adult between 16-60 or so will be irritated, but not have their life threatened. This is proven repeatedly in flu research. Most strains of the flu are a minor inconvenience to healthy individuals between 16 and 60.

#+begin_quote
  Minimizing exposure is always important to minimize chances of an infection defeating your immune system.
#+end_quote

In the case of a disease which has a credible possibility of defeating your immune system, sure. Very few strains of the flu have any significant chance of defeating the immune system of healthy individuals between the age of 16 and 60. The immune system has evolved to encounter and react. In fact, the body aggressively seeks out disease vectors. *That's what the appendix is for. It samples the digestive tract for things to introduce to the immune system.* The more different encounters the immune system has, the stronger it becomes overall, unless a disease or infection is encountered that directly attacks the immune system.

Medicine should work with the human body to promote the body staying in health, not take over the job entirely. For mild diseases, like most strains of flu, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for universal vaccination, unless you can eliminate the disease completely. And we certainly can't do that with the flu yet. Show me a well-tested universal flu vaccination that is as safe as current flu vaccinations, and I'll take it tomorrow.

The medical community and the CDC promotes universal vaccination, because it's easier to say "Everyone get a shot" than try to explain to the public that some years you need a shot, others you don't. If you are on certain medications or have certain conditions you need a shot, even if you are a healthy adult. Etc.

Excessive, unnecessary medical intervention is not rational. Period. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria is one example where an out of control medical community accidentally created something dangerous because they didn't fully understand the repercussions of what they were doing. I am NOT saying that we're going to create a super-flu, but I am saying that we don't understand the immune system well enough to try to completely replace the natural process when there isn't a pressing need for it.

Encouraging vaccinations for low-risk groups in minimally dangerous flu outbreaks encourages more dependency on medical technology and less on staying healthy. To use your words, this is 'very dangerous and risky for the future of humanity.'

Your actual arguments are generally weak, and there's a lot of overlap between your beliefs and anti vac ones, like the belief in natural immunity being superior, healthy immune systems being invulnerable to diseases, exposing people to dangerous diseases to promote resistance. Even on their own, ignoring the anti vac connection, those are poor beliefs.

The article you linked said there were only small benefits, mostly based on an analysis of working days lost, among low risk populations. They didn't do a cost benefit analysis or anything, so it was of limited use. I never claimed there were large benefits to mass vaccination for flu among healthy adults- I was contesting your claim that it would lead to a weaker immune system through it not being exercised. The study stated something different from what you said and I didn't really care enough to get into it.

You've avoided citing any evidence for your actual core claims though.

You make up a lot of stuff about the immune system. I doubt you'll change your view, but to any readers-

The immune system develops specific counters. It develops, say, a counter to a particular molecule on some flu viruses. The next year that counter won't work. The immune system won't be any more effective or strong against a new flu virus without that molecule. The immune system isn't a pokemon. It doesn't evolve into stronger forms, it doesn't gain exp, it doesn't gain EVs. Your immune system as a general matter gets weaker as you age.

Certainly, there will be engineering obstacles, but most of those engineering obstacles can be resolved by a fusion of the technologies used for the three of these successful implementations of electromagnetic propulsion.

Launch to orbit doesn't need as much mass as a train, or the velocity of a particle in a supercollider. We also don't need to limit ourselves to the extremely short acceleration window of the weapon. We certainly don't want to use this to launch people, or extremely large masses, at least to begin with.

On the money side of things, I believe you will find that people and corporations with 'billions to spare' very rarely put those billions towards a single speculative venture.

Speculation investments in the millions is not uncommon. Venture capital in the tens of millions for a single project happens every now and then. I can't think of any speculative ventures funded to the tune of 100+ million but I wouldn't doubt they exist. (Saturn, Global Crossing, American Superconductor may have started with this range of venture capital) Billions though? That sort of money rarely moves into a single project unless it's a pretty solid prospect, run by proven industry leaders.

The problem is that there aren't any proven space industry leaders, because there is no space industry. Partly because we do not have reasonably inexpensive launching systems.

An individual with a massive amount of money who might consider exposing themselves financially to such a huge degree would have to contend with levels of risk that are difficult to comprehend. What if they put three billion dollars into the system, and then have the government shut down the launch site because someone recently discovered a rare, endangered bird nesting habitat nearby? What if there is an accident which doesn't critically damage the project, but does raise the insurance rates to insane levels?

The first electromagnetic launch-to-space project will almost certainly be government-built, because it's just too damn risky for individuals or companies to touch - at least until there is one to prove the concept.

LEO is 7.8km/s, so to reach it you'd need to accelerate something quite a bit faster than that to account for speed lost to increased gravitational potential and, the bigger factor I think, air resistance. I don't think it's easy and I have a lot of questions about whether it's sensible or feasible to even have something moving that fast near the surface of the Earth where the air is densest.

That's ignoring getting the electricity to the area, which presumably can't be too near a city since it'll be heated by the fast moving spaceships.

***** Yes, I have thought about propulsion technologies a little bit :)

The concept of a electromagnetic launcher to deliver materials to Lagrange points has been around since the 1970's, and all the fiddling about burning up in atmosphere has already been answered by people far more qualified than me. [[http://www.nss.org/settlement/L5news/1980-massdriver.htm][Here's a link]]

As a spoiler, the answer is that there would be very little ablation, because the launched object is moving directly away from Earth instead of a long path through atmosphere like all rockets attempting orbital insertion. The object is also moving so quickly that it spends almost no time in the most dense atmosphere. By the time the outer surface heats up, it's already most of the way out of atmosphere. I would also like to note that superconductor technology has come a long way since the 1970's. There are industrial applications for very large superconductors these days, they aren't all in labs. That's not to say it won't be frighteningly expensive.

Quench guns store electric charge in their coils. That means the electrical grid need not provide the power immediately, or even rapidly. Were you aware that most nuclear plants are located at a fair distance from cities, because people don't want them in their back yard? Quite a few dams and coal plants are far from population centers as well. In fact I'd guess that most power plants are quite some distance from large population centers. If for no other reason, to reduce property costs and taxes on the land. Finally, there are very extensive power grids across most of the industrialized world. We move power around to where it is needed. Putting this facility near an intersection of grids so it won't be anywhere near civilization, and will have access to power from multiple large power grids would seem like a good idea.

All those things you believe we need to worry before getting into the engineering have already been worried about, and either determined to not be a problem, or solutions have been found.

That's not to say there aren't engineering obstacles. It would be a very large project. It would be frighteningly expensive. It would allow us to start developing space.

** Alcohol prohibition. Society-at-large has proven, to my satisfaction, that it cannot handle easily available recreational alcohol. In addition to the tens of thousands of people killed every year by drunk drivers, it's hard to know how many people are hurt by the effects of addiction, which cannot be predicted in advance and often prevents its own treatment. There are some cases where alcohol can't hurt anyone (drinking in your own home if you are known to not be addicted, and such), but the current ease of access to alcohol is doing considerably more harm than good.

Unfortunately, most paths from a drinking society to a prohibitionist society are worse, what with /the mafia/. Luckily, self-driving cars will solve most of the lethal part of the problem.

During Prohibition, as part of an effort to stop people from drinking industrial alcohol, it was denatured and methyl alcohol was added, making it toxic. They thought that people would change their behavior, because if a rational person knows that there's poison in the alcohol then they'll stop drinking it. The end result was that the United States government killed ten thousand of its own citizens.

There are a vast number of legitimate uses for many drugs. A shot of alcohol a day, helps keep arteries clear. If you couldn't sleep the night before, and you have to drive, a 5-hour energy B12 drink will work wonders. If you need a pick-me-up for a presentation after an exhausting morning, something with caffeine in it might be just the thing. Cocaine, from what I have read, is actually extremely beneficial to the thought processes for a few minutes if taken in moderation, though one must plan for the downtime afterwards. The leaf of the plant is chewed by indigenous people for energy. Coca-Cola was originally a warm syrup drink made from Coca, and served to railroad workers and other hard laborers. Opium and morphine are excellent painkillers. Marijuana for appetite enhancement for chemo patients and for glaucoma. The list goes on and on.

It would be irrational to stop using these chemicals completely, without formulating replacements. It is also irrational to become dependent on them without clear reason. Most of them are harmful over time, with a great deal of use.

****** You may be right, that it's rational to use caffeine under certain circumstances. With that said, there's a difference between using something as a performance enhancer and being addicted to it, and I personally fall under the latter category. Whenever I stop using it for a day or two, I get headaches and nausea. I also have a lot of trouble moderating myself when it comes to caffeine.

I drink soda as my caffeinated beverage of choice (Have never liked coffee. Apparently it's an acquired taste, and I quite deliberately have never acquired it) and I find it much easier to buy and drink no soda than to buy some soda, and drink it a little at a time.

I'm genuinely asking this question, because I don't know the answer. Would caffeine be more effective as a performance enhancer if used sparingly, rather than used multiple times each day for no other reason than habit/addiction/preventing withdrawal?

If caffeine does indeed provide a reasonably effective 'always on' performance boost even consumed several times each day, it might indeed be rational for me to keep using it after all. I'm not sure how I would feel about that.

I do not think most rational people would want a government as oppressive as the Taliban was, even if it were not a fundamentalist religious state.

Global terrorism is funded in part by the illegal drug trade, and is more potent than ever. There are quite a few second and third world governments that are in perpetual low-level civil wars with criminal cartels that fund themselves via selling drugs to first world nations that have made the drugs illegal.

I agree with this statement, but it has to be noted where the statement applies.

"Mainstream Islam" should really be split into several geographical regions.

The trouble they cause is more comparable to "ethnic minorities everywhere in the Third World" than to the unique nastiness of /Middle Eastern/ Islam right now.

Geopolitical Islam /in the Middle East/ right now, and among transplanted /Middle Eastern/ populations in other countries, is a nasty blend of nasty stuff that basically adds up to religious fascism and a desire to make war on nearby non-Muslim populations, /powered by the oil wealth of oligarchs who spread this religious fascism for their own reasons/, even when the fascist interpretations of Islam are actually entirely modern fundamentalist movements that would normally be opposed by conservative forces within Islam (in the same way that conservative forces within Christianity split down the middle in WW2, with many opposing Hitler).

No, because you didn't take into account the opportunity cost.

The decision isn't "spend the 200 billion in the alcohol industry, or burn the money." It's spend the 200 billion in the alcohol industry, or spend it somewhere else (or save it).

Sure, but meaningful data on the indifference price for purchases of goods don't exist. The actual money spent on goods and services is at least a somewhat reasonable proxy.

Saying, "this makes no sense" over and over again is not an argument. According to the published research I was able to find quickly, the price elasticity for the demand of alcohol is somewhere around -0.50 [[http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/msceps/courses/understanding%20markets/8.%20Gallet%202007%20Alcohol%20elasticities%20meta%20analysis.pdf][[1]]][[http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com/2012/07/price-elasticity-of-alcohol-demand.html][[2]]]. Doubling the price results in a 1/4 reduction in the quantity consumed, and most of that reduction is, predictably, due to behavior modification of light/occasional drinkers. This suggests that the price of alcohol is lower than most consumers are willing to pay.

I'm confused by this. First of all, now you're asking for an estimation of positive utility, while in the quote you were talking about indifference pricing. They are completely separate concepts.

Ten dollars would be the absolute maximum that it could be worth (because a rational actor would never buy something for 39 dollars for 40 dollars).

I wouldn't say that wanting alcohol is irrational either. Drinking to excess is, but wanting to go to a bar to socialize and have a couple beers over the course of an evening is perfectly reasonable.

***** Rationality does not necessarily equate to plausibility.

If I want to build a shortest-path road from point A to point C through point B, but point B is owned by someone who refuses to allow it, then I will be forced to either abandon the idea, or modify it to be less efficient, going around point B.

Does that make it any less rational to want to build the road so it is as short as possible, generating immediate and long-term savings/efficiency during the building and commuter usage phases of the road's existence?

I would say no. Rational is rational. It is rational to build the road as efficiently as possible.

It is ALSO rational to account for the land owner of B, and build the road around them, if the need is great enough.

But not all cases have rational alternatives. What I'm talking about here are scenarios where partial implementation or modified implementation are really not worth doing, or are even harmful. Public irrationality simply breaks them completely.

The best examples I've seen here are related to substance abuse. As far as I am aware, there has never been an attempt to stop substance abuse through legal actions in a free society where it has been successful. Whenever substance abuse is made illegal, it feeds the criminal element, eventually creating a greater net harm to society.

Does that mean it is rational to stop trying to enforce drug use with laws, and start dealing with it by education and treatment?

Yes. But the irrational public won't let us do that either! The criminal element is more than happy to keep illegal substances illegal, and irrational teetotalers think that somehow what has never worked in the history of mankind can be successfully managed by their elected officials, if they just try a little harder, and pass stricter laws.

I'm a socialist and this isn't remotely true. People's understanding of why different economic systems work has been very heavily warped by propaganda. [[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black/][Here, read this propaganda article!]]

#+begin_quote
  The point is this: If a deterministic story about free markets generating optimal prices, leading to maximum output was no longer viable, then the failure of planned economies could hardly be attributed to the absence of those features. As Communist systems were collapsing in Eastern Europe, economists who had lost faith in the neoclassical narrative began to argue that an alternative explanation was needed. The most prominent theorist in this group was Joseph Stiglitz, who had become famous for his work on the economics of information. His arguments dovetailed with those of other dissenters from the neoclassical approach, like the eminent Hungarian scholar of planned economies, János Kornai, and evolutionary economists like Peter Murrell.

  They all pointed to a number of characteristics, largely ignored by the neoclassical school, that better accounted for the ability of market economies to avoid the problems plaguing centrally planned systems. The aspects they emphasized were disparate, but they all tended to arise from a single, rather simple fact:in market systems firms are autonomous.

  That means that within the limits of the law, a firm may enter a market; choose its products and production methods; interact with other firms and individuals; and must close down if it cannot get by on its own resources. As a textbook on central planning put it, in market systems the presumption is “that an activity may be undertaken unless it is expressly prohibited,” whereas in planned systems “the prevailing presumption in most areas of economic life is that an activity may not be undertaken unless permission has been obtained from the appropriate authority.” The neoclassical fixation with ensuring that firms exercised this autonomy in a laissez-faire environment --- that restrictions on voluntary exchange be minimized or eliminated --- was essentially beside the point.

  Thus, free entry and multiple autonomous sources of capital mean that anyone with novel production ideas can seek resources to implement their ideas and don't face a single veto point within a planning apparatus. As a result, they stand a much greater chance of obtaining the resources to test out their ideas. This probably leads to more of the waste inherent in failed experiments --- but also far greater scope for improved products and processes, and a constantly higher rate of technological improvement and productivity growth.
#+end_quote

In fact, the /original/ Communist argument /in favor of/ central planning was: "Look, the largest capitalist firms all operate on an /internal/ basis of centralized, hierarchical planning, so clearly /the very success of capitalism/ shows that central planning is the most efficient, effective way to do things!"

Then the liberal-capitalist rebuttal to this was, "No, because only markets can generate optimal allocative efficiency."

But the actual truth was, "Certain kinds of markets - namely markets with an egalitarian wealth distribution, easy entry/exit of firms, low economic rents, and low levels of moral hazard - enable many good and bad experiments to be tried in parallel, with the good receiving additional investment and revenue as it grows and the bad being cleaned up by bankruptcy." This has a major implication for our current era of neoliberal authoritarian capitalism, in which increasing portions of social life are subjected to markets, but the /genuinely positive/ features of capitalism are being /reversed/: capitalizing new firms outside the tech and FIRE sectors is increasingly difficult, bankruptcy is getting harder while debts are more stringently enforced, investment capital is getting concentrated into small cliques of de facto planners, economic rents are rising, and moral hazard is rampant.

So to the list of things that Just Don't Work In an Irrational Society, we should add, "capitalism", because people kept trying to worship it as a god rather than understand what made it tick.

We've seen communism attempted in quite a few different countries. All of them failed to produce a state that I would volunteer to live in. Of them all, China is probably the most successful, and they are no longer truly communist, having accepted elements of capitalism.

I do not think that any government can function properly if it is governing humans. However, some governments are more resistant to irrationality than others.

This is another superbly /bad/ example, in that while Trump is a populist with broad support among his party, he's getting that support by using his wealth to spite the oligarchs of his own party. While Clinton is an appointed politician-princess, and Clinton is pretty clearly more rational than Trump, /Clinton's party is spending its effort to ignore everyone who's not Clinton/. This means that, for all of us who are more left-wing than Hillary Clinton - and this includes, say, the Barack Obama of 2007 who ran against her in the Democratic primaries - the /correct and rational choice/ is one that the established system is too oligarchical to put before the public.

So if you really think that, "People are irrational, and that's why we've got shitty candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump", you're ignoring the fact that a real, operative democracy might actually result in Bernie Sanders facing Ted Cruz or something.

TL;DR: If you've got a system that's 70% oligarchy and 30% democracy, then your prior for blame for the faults of that system must be allocated 70% to oligarchy and 30% to democracy /until you see evidence that more oligarchy would have helped, and that means actually-existing oligarchy rather than philosopher kings or FAI./

You say that as though it naturally follows that good men would settle their differences in mortal combat just because they carry mortal weapons. I suppose I can see why that might be, they carry these things around, they must attribute them some use, dueling is as good a use as any. But I wonder if you could erect a more stable culture. A culture where the gun is like the sikh kirpan, a symbol of adulthood, never to be used in anger(do not agree to a fight until both you and your opponent have disarmed), only in self defense, standing as a symbol of the adult's willingness to shed blood to defend the lives of their people. In peace times, the gun's purpose is to go unused, and in this sense it may also serve as a symbol of tact, and self-restraint.

********** Well, I actually think governments should be attempting to reach post-scarcity eutopia, and that actually includes pretty much every bad consequence ever. But the system you describe makes sense to prioritize pre-scarcity concerns, although I might add that where losses on stock or financial hardship from a bad degree threatens one's life, well-being, etc, the government should still prioritize their security over the derivative of growth. As a country's economic surplus increases, more resources are available to improve the minimum quality of life, and I'd argue that that's where more focus should go.

However, this is all strictly theoretical. No one is arguing that governments are all shit, I think.

For sufficiently well-thought-out values of "bad" and "eutopia", sure.

I think that depends what you mean by "their security". The security of individuals' life and health, yes. The security of anyone's economic wealth, no -- that's the way to moral hazard.

******* The latter is a normative claim, so it's not actually something that that question applies to. I could make an argument that it is based in terminal values that we hold in common, but I'm not interested in that discussion, nor am I certain that we hold common values sufficient to make a successful argument. I honestly shouldn't have commented, since I wasn't interested in discussing it.

********* It is simple. If you put value in the lives /and/ quality of life of imperfect human beings then you are in favor of not submitting said humans to extreme punishments for mistakes in risk-assessment. Being homeless because in the past you had the "stupid" decision to choose a larger food palette over all the right insurances is an example of unfair punishment in many people's eyes. The answer to that is to force essential insurances on everyone while pushing down its cost by decreasing the profit per capita of the insurance providers. Or in other words, government based healthcare.

*** The problem with expecting people to be rational about health is that it by nature makes people irrational. Take 10 people who all believe in total self support and personal accountability for health expenses. Let's say they don't have much money.

Let's say they all get injured. Some percentage of them are going to seek care that they can't afford once confronted with the pain and risk of permanent disability.

Or to weaken their rational resolve even more, let's say it's their child or parent that gets injured. It's one thing to make a principled stand on your own health but are you really going to tell your 5 year old daughter that she gets to die of leukemia because Obamacare destroys freedom?

Of course not.

Sick people will always seek care, whether or not they can afford it. After all, it's the rational thing for them to do.

Society and government has to structure itself to provide that care at minimum cost to the rest of the society.

This can be through a single payer insurance system like Taiwan or Canada, it can be through a completely free system like the NHS. It can be through Singapore's system which forces people to save 8~10% of their income and put it into an account that can only be used for health expenses.

But in all cases, the government has to force rationality.

It helps that these socialized systems are /actually cheaper/, on a per-capita basis, than "Now everyone just save for expected expenses and let your permanently disabling injuries permanently disable you when they happen if you don't have the money!"

** Anarchy (as a political / governmental method, not as a state of chaos), legalized psychedelics, and in-general civilizational optimization.

Anarchy (my personal agency is never forced to follow another's) falls apart if you have even a small subset of the people not trying to make that rule true for everyone, but everyone having maximum agency makes a lot of sense.

Legalized psychedelices because I really don't think people can handle a $0.10* thing you can get a the corner store that /will/ change your life. * Economies of scale, lack of price increase due to black market.

In-general civilizational optimizations because people get attached to things like weird windy streets, or grid layouts, or are otherwise unable to process that group optimization can lead to better individual optimization than individual optimization can. See, as an amazing example, "Braess' paradox"

I've never read much on anarchy as an actual societal system. My first question would be "how do sewers get built and maintained?" Is the idea that people will simply volunteer to do that since it helps everyone?

**** [[http://www.bigheadpress.com/eft?page=1][here]] is a complete webcomic with one such society in the asteroid belt and a mixed system on mars in the near future. It is a bit campy and certainly an author tract, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

in a real example I've read that in some places instead of a governing body providing services private citizens manage utilities like businesses. so you could theoretically pay someone for sewers, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3p6quCz-Y0][firemen]], and security, but not pay to maintain roads you don't use, parks, or schools if you don't have kids. It is quite easy to abuse one such system though.

*** I agree with anarchy, because anarchy as a political system can really only work if people are fully rational, because even a few irrational individuals can cause an immense amount of disruption in an anarchic system.

Legalized drugs being irrational, I do not agree with. Making them illegal has never worked, and will never work in anything short of a police state (It's frequently failed in police states too.) All you gain from making the drugs illegal is a higher price which just makes people who are addicted poorer (addiction by free introduction to drugs is common practice.) Stigmatizing addicted persons as criminals makes it more difficult for them to make the decision to seek treatment for addiction. Prison time for drug users costs more than treatment. Criminal organizations form and coalesce into their own underground government and black market, frequently engaging in wars and expanding their criminal activity beyond the drug trade. The educational system has a very difficult time educating children about which drugs are highly dangerous, and which are only moderately so. (Alcohol and marijuana are far less problematic than crack and meth.)

Braess' paradox is fascinating! Atlanta needs to experiment with closing some streets, I think. Other than that, I believe you are referring to things like standardizing building codes, educational standards, vehicle safety requirements, in larger and larger blocks until there are uniform standards? If I am understanding right, how does this impact innovation? If everything is required to be the same, it's going to take a lot more effort to generate change.
