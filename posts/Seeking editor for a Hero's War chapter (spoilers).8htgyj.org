Hi, I'm the writer for A Hero's War, a fic that sometimes shows up here.

Currently, I've finished the next chapter, which contains a series of very important plot points and need someone who read the entire series to check it over for consistency.

I did write it out of my notes on the setting, so I hope I managed to avoid major errors, but would like someone to check just in case. Maybe I missed something that should have been explained or an earlier chapter contains an observation that contradicts what happened here.

Since this is a very important chapter, having a second eye on it would be good.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rDriCxVr99vUvSTQK7kDjJeL4bkaGyYTF0rR9ezS9JE/edit?usp=sharing]]

Comments, observations, etc. welcome. Grammar / spelling check is fine too, since I haven't published it and minor edits are easy.

EDIT: just to say that the chapter will eventually be posted, I'll be checking it over for the rest of the week but will post it around Friday.

EDIT2: Thank you all for your suggestions! I have posted the chapter and the google document will no longer be editable.


** Hey, to preserve spoilers, what you could do is offer to PM people who ask for it the google drive link, instead of just having it out in the open. It's a bit more work, but I personally prefer doing that because it minimizes the people who just try to read an incomplete or even incorrect work just because they wanted to see the newest version soon, rather than to productively edit for you.

Ultimately it's up to you, of course.

*** Hm, I don't think spoilers are a bad thing actually. Just that I know other people do and that was why I labeled it spoilers.

That said, you do make a good point but I think it's too much work. After all, I am pretty sure I did get things correct... hopefully.

Maybe.

Hm.

** Oof, I dunno if I can re-read everything to check it over, but I'll totes edit this chapter. How should I get edits and notes to you?

*** I'm not expecting you to re-read everything of course, just someone who has read everything already.

EDIT: I've put it on google docs, so you can make comments there.

** Small edits and notes are up.

Broader notes: Overall, I think you should use more descriptions. Try to convey the experience of the things and events rather than just their occurrence. Example: "A messenger from the ISL outpost slid down next to Morey." What did this messenger look like? How did they land - smoothly, awkwardly, etc? You don't need much, just a few words, but they'd go a long way I think.

Otherwise, it's good to see more the ancient world fleshed out, and the resolution of existing plot (Morey's rebellion) and the introduction / re-uptake of new ones (the Gate at Landing, and getting home).

*** Thank you all for that! I've replied to various minor edits, changing the text along the way and so on.

Yeah, the descriptions has long been a problem I keep forgetting about. I'll see about adding some in later.

** A Google Docs link might work better for the editing, since people can highlight and leave comments on problematic parts.

** I'm usually pretty swamped with work until my night. But I'll see if I can squeeze this in. I probably won't be able to, but will try nonetheless. Fyi, I just finished catching up to 110 today and its getting a whole lotta fun. Can't wait for the reasons for zombies, who's left up north and that metal thing on selna!!
