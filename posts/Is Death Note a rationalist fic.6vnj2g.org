Why/Why not?


** See this [[https://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity][essay]] that details how Light completely squandered his initial advantage of anonymity.

tl;dr:

#+begin_quote
  /Death Note/ is almost a thought-experiment---given the /perfect/ murder weapon, how can you screw up /anyway/?

  *Mistake 1:* Light's fundamental mistake is to kill in ways unrelated to his goal. Killing through heart attacks does not just make him visible early on, but the deaths reveals that his assassination method is supernaturally precise. L has been tipped off that Kira exists. Whatever the bogus justification may be, this is a major victory for his opponents. (To deter criminals and villains, it is not necessary for there to be a globally-known single supernatural killer, when it would be equally effective to arrange for all the killings to be done naturalistically by third parties/police/judiciary or used indirectly to crack cases.)

  *Mistake 2:* Worse, the deaths are non-random in other ways---they tend to occur at particular times! Just the scheduling of deaths cost Light 6 bits of anonymity!

  *Mistake 3:* Light's third mistake was reacting to the provocation of Lind L. Tailor. L narrowed his target down to 1/3 the original Japanese population, for a gain of ~1.6 bits.

  *Mistake 4:* Light's fourth mistake was to use confidential police information stolen using his policeman father's credentials. This mistake was the largest in bits lost. This mistake cost him 11 bits of anonymity; in other words, this mistake cost him /twice/ what his scheduling cost him and almost /8/ times the murder of Tailor!

  *Mistake 5:* If we assume Penbar was tasked 200 leads out of the 10,000, then murdering him and the fiancee dropped Light just 6 bits or a little over half the fourth mistake and comparable to the original scheduling mistake.

  *Endgame:* At this point in the plot, L resorts to direct measures and enters Light's life directly, enrolling at the university. From this point on, Light is screwed as he is now playing a deadly game of Mafia with L & the investigative team. He frittered away >25 bits of anonymity and then L intuited the rest and suspected him all along.

*** yeah, he should not have used heart attacks for the bulk of his killings. First step should have been to use the deathnote to acquire more traditional forms of power - money, political influence (possibly through proxies to avoid suspicion.) Market manipulation is a simple anonymous way to get started. (plane crash kills CEO of competitor to company you've invested in)

Quietly weeding out corrupt and immoral politicians and world leaders is a next logical step. You can do a lot more long term good reforming the system than just instilling general fear of punishment.

I'd actually like to read (maybe write) a rational fic with an honestly intelligent and utilitarian Light (not egocentric as depicted.) I know there are a few deathnote ratfics out there but haven't seen one that really captured me.

    Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

    Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

In-universe, L is globally famous, and everyone recognizes his name, which is why he needs to take such precautions to hide his face and voice etc. All the police know him instantly, IIRC.

Even if you grant that Light reasonably didn't know about L or suspect L would come after him, he certainly knew L was brilliant after L revealed how he had tricked Light with the Taylor TV trick, so mistakes 4 & 5 can't be covered by ignorance. Mistake 1 & 2 also do not require you to be worried about superintelligent adversaries, as timing and correlation attacks are rather ordinary things in computer security and law enforcement. Mistake 3, the TV trick, is a little more excusable since very few people would arrange something so clever - but merely responding to such an obvious provocation by getting angry is itself a serious mistake and demonstrates the hubris that would kill Light! No superintelligent detectives required.

This wasn't technically a mistake, but rather a gambit/sacrifice. Light was hoping that by revealing that Kira has police connections, L would suspect the police, and the police would suspect L, and may then drag L up to the surface for light to kill. And it did work (in the anime), Light eventually got to kill L thanks to this gambit.

Light's true mistake is bothering to fight L in the first place. Just let L keep bragging about being unkillable.

Then I would write "X dies BY LIGHTNING on Sunday at 1:56pm GMT" for every X I wanted to kill. So every week there would be a mass lightning strike killing tons of criminals at the same time.

** The ending of the manga made no sense. It's not fresh in my mind, so here's something I wrote when it was:

#+begin_quote
  Why didn't Light know that Near knew that he knew that he knew that something was up?

  In the final showdown, what did Light think that Near thought that Light was thinking? Near wouldn't have come unless he replaced the Death Note with a fake. Light would know that, and thus wouldn't come unless the Death Note that was replaced was also a fake. Near would know that, and thus wouldn't come unless he replaced both the fake and the real one. That should continue forever making the final confrontation impossible, but somehow, Light missed that last step, and Near missed the one after that.
#+end_quote

Another way to look at it is Aumann's agreement theorem. They both had common knowledge. They both knew the other was pretty smart. So how could each expect to win the confrontation? Once they see the other fail to back out, they should start worrying themselves.

In general, the whole thing seemed to me like a bunch of people that thought they were smart doing stupid stuff. It was an attempt at a rationalist fic by someone trying to write characters that were smarter than they were.

*** From what I recall, the chain of reasoning breaks down because of Light's ultimate mistake in underestimating Near's ruthlessness in using the DN on someone (to control Mikami); this leads to Light's mistaken confidence in terminating the reasoning at 'Near's ploy is replacing Mikami's DN with a fake to disarm him but Mikami can't be tricked as easily as that' and so explaining why Near is willing to show up (Light mistakenly thinks Near is mistaken in believing the swap worked). The reasoning cannot continue indefinitely once you think you have found a mistake in your enemy and have deduced his object-level plan; that breaks the symmetry in reasoning. Errors and mistakes and bad luck are always highly likely. Of course, rather than being one level below Light in the hierarchy, Near was one level above, and willing to show up for the same reason, and won. This is ironic and adds some literary qualities to the otherwise confusing ending, because Near wins only by abandoning L's refusal to kill and by exploiting Light's belief that L's successor would live up to L.

Because he would simply trust Mikami as part of his plan, which is the assumption of a /single/ error which breaks symmetry. After a single error, the recursion is over, it's done, it doesn't infinitely regress. A single error ends the regression at that level and the plots unfold and they see which of them made the error.

** Not even close.

I'm sure that more hardworking and insightful people than me have weighed in a hundred times over already in different parts of the internet, but Light was an idiot, and he was an idiot from the very first second he started killing convicted criminals. He was a lazy, stupid, idiot.

You don't change society by killing people who've already been tried and found guilty. Society's already caught them. Meaning that they were neither truly dangerous (since they got caught) or capable of distorting the system any longer. When's the last time we've seen an evil billionaire go to prison??? Light said that he wanted to make the world better, but I saw no evidence of a plan to do that, aside from killing people who committed obvious crimes and were /stupid/ enough to get caught doing it. What a stupid plan. What a waste of time.

No, to change things, you pinpoint the points of distortion in society (there are dozens, hundreds of these people - not the thousands to tens of thousands Light was killing. But it's hard to find them, and it takes a lot of hard, hard research. You never hear about the /really/ evil people. And /then/ you go to town on them, and do it in such a way (using the Death Note's more obscure powers over controlling the actions of people in the moments prior to death), that you never get caught. You don't let people even /begin/ to suspect that there's a supernatural killer on the loose.

But, no, that would have been a boring story to watch. A competent Light would never even have attracted L's direct interest.

*** Several points:

1. Light was operating on a theory of deterrence. He wasn't literally trying to kill /all/ the criminals out there; he was trying to kill enough of them that the rest would start fearing the wrath of this mysterious god capable of striking down evildoers with heart attacks, and stop committing crimes /because/ of that fear. At the same time, he was attempting to create a social and cultural setting in which crime would have been discouraged to a far greater degree than it currently is, and criminals pursued and punished with a far greater fervor. (This secondary aim is the main reason Kira exists, aside from Light's own hubris.)
2. In the very first episode of /Death Note/, Light mentions killing non-criminals that are nonetheless "leeches on society" (or a similar term; I don't remember the particular phrase he used) using accidents and diseases. This is more or less what you say he /should/ have done in your comment, but you don't seem to have realized that /he did this as well/. People simply focus on the "Kira" aspect of his killings because, well, that's what stands out the most, and because that was what L focused on.
3. The reason Light didn't target high-ranking, influential people at the beginning of the series was because Kira was a relatively new phenomenon that, despite having /some/ public support, didn't have /nearly/ enough to pull this kind of thing off. Had Light showed willingness to kill, not just lowly criminals, but high-ranking people as well, there would have been a backlash from practically every country in the world. This not only makes it much more likely for Kira to get caught, it also interferes with his plan to create a society that accepts Kira as their god. Note that in the second arc of the story, Light (or rather, Mikami under Light's direction) /does/ in fact target people in high places, because at that point Kira has accumulated enough public support that he can /get away/ with that.
4. Calling Light a "lazy, stupid idiot" is more than a little exaggerated, and I don't like that kind of rhetoric; it's the sort of thing you might find on SpaceBattles. (In fact, what immediately came to mind upon reading your comment was the massive Cauldron debates they like to have, most of which contain very little in the way of actual content, but a great deal of "lol Cauldron was fuckin' dumb".) Using high-intensity words too frequently drains them of their meaning; if you're calling /Light Yagami/ an "idiot", what word will you use for /actual/ idiots?

I'd say the rule only applies to the story itself, and not the backstory. The point is that the characters have actual control. Things happen because of what they do, and not just because of what the author wants. But they obviously have no control over the backstory, since it already happened.

Edit: Though I should add that three different death gods get involved. The first one gets a pass. The others are more of a problem. Sure we've established that it's something that can happen, but deciding exactly when is still a literal deus ex machina.

***** Misa isn't that unrealistic. You know about how death row inmates and serial killers (to say nothing of Charles Manson) get very serious fans and conjugal visits. And what is Light but a serial killer on a vast, global scale?

  Ok, how about why Light gets Misa? There's no real reason why she'd meet with him and fawn over him throughout pretty much the entire series, except to give him a super-loyal accomplice because he needs one because plot and fan service.

I'm pretty sure Misa was more of a hindrance to Light than a boon, at least at the beginning. Saying she existed solely to be convenient to him is... disingenuous.

*** I've heard it said that the premise of a work is unassailable. This is to say that one can't really argue that it's irrational that a guy from another planet gets his power from the sun, is invulnerable, and flies, as that's part of the premise. The story is "what happens /given that/ superman exists and he's on earth", and if the dominos that fall from that don't fall properly, /then/ it's irrational. It's sort of like arguing that HPMOR is unrealistic because "magic exists", even though the story itself gives us no concrete explanation for the phenomenon. That's part of the premise; so long as the magic is more or less consistent and the actors involved use it in a not-stupid manner, then it doesn't impact the rationality of the work. If this weren't true, then no rational fiction could possibly exist that was set anywhere but "Earth, present day or recent past".

Similarly, the premise of death note is "Light gets the Death Note". This part is unassailable. So what if it was a bored demigod, what matters is the ramifications of that event.

Even if that weren't true, I'd argue that an immortal being that literally feeds on human deaths deciding on a whim to fuck with humanity sounds like the most natural result in the world. What's unrealistic is that this seems to be the first time it's happened (at least in a long time).

**** My [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/3r320c/heres_a_list_of_anime_ive_seen_sorted_by_how_much/][anime rankings list]] has a "loved" tier and a "god" tier, where the god tier is shared by only two shows, Death Note and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. They are very different but I find them both approximately equally captivating. Obligatory plug for [[/r/haruhi]].

***** That is good list. It's not often one sees Death Note in Loved and Code Geass in hated. But I absolutely agree on your assessment of that anime. Main character is smart, genius level intelligence but far too many things there happen out of the blue, because that would be cool, or because he needs rescue and in the last moment someone enters a scene to save him. Will check the others if I have some spare time.

    The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them. More or less...Though the death note rules aren't all known in advance so the story doesn't 100% pass this bar.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I don't think /any/ RF story tells all the rules of its system in advance. In fact, Harry discovering the rules of magic via experimentation one of the central plot points of HPMOR.

I agree that sometimes the rules are introduced late enough that readers can't reach the same solution as the characters using previously-provided information, so DN wouldn't qualify as Rational/ist/, but it pretty clearly meets the RF criteria.
