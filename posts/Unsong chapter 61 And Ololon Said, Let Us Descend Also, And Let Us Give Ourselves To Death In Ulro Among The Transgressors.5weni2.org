  “These things don't actually bind me, you know. The books of black magic say they do, but nobody ever thinks to ask who wrote the books of black magic.” [...] “Good,” said Thamiel. “I like deals. But just so you know, my BATNA is killing you, wearing your body like a suit, and slowly poisoning the lives of everyone you have ever loved until they scream for death.”
#+end_quote

It was previously speculated that Ritualist-era Dylan Alvarez is very different than the placebomancer!Alvarez, and that perhaps the Thamielic leakage from a summoning could explain it. That makes this passage especially interesting.

*** Yes... and for that matter, Thamiel could've even prompted his whole placebomancic terror campaign. I hope this's one of the things we'll get an answer to before the end of the story.

** Thamiel calls her plan a hope, a wish. Could the wish part be a reference to the "fervent wish" in the Shem haMephorash? (I had originally thought the "hope" part was, too, but I was misremembering the "joy" line.)

**** It has to be cheap enough that he would part with it for just one soul and body. But precious enough that she would give everything she has for it.

Either there's some mutually agreeable intersection of these seemingly incompatible​ sets, or they're going to use the plot to take more than he thinks he's giving, or she's getting less than she thinks she is.

Sadly, my money is on the third option.

BIG NEWS! I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT!

(also, I wonder how everything's going to be fixed so fast? And for that matter, just how much is going to be resolved in the final arc?)

***** Hm... There are 344 chapters in ASOIAF. If we posit a hypothetical web serial version of ASOIAF whose first chapter was released in January, with subsequent chapters being released every month without delay, then we'd be getting the first chapter of The Winds of Winter in 2024.

What do you want to bet that fans in the Song of Serials and Webfiction universe will still be getting their Winds of Winter fix before the fans in this universe, though?

****** Sure, but if we started the AOIAF web serial from the publication date of GoT, (assuming one chapter per week being released starting august 96) we'd have started getting TWOW chapters in march of 2003, and the series would have been completed over a decade ago.

******* Oh sure. I was just stacking it that way to make the joke that, even with the slow release schedule, people in that hypothetical timeline would still be getting their fix before the fans in this universe.

Different question, but one that I find interesting: Martin could conceivably have written the series faster, at a cost of quality. In order for the final book to have been published today, how much of a drop in quality would you be willing to accept for the whole series? Is a version of the series that is only 90% as good, but complete, better than the series as it stands? How about 80%?

(As an author myself, the question seems very pertinent)

********* I'd put it the other way around - Dance is relatively solid (its greatest flaws come from the fact that the climax of the narrative arcs was pushed to book 6), but Feast was a mess (featuring dozens of characters we didn't need to see) with little point to it.

**** I believe apocalypse actually comes from an ancient Greek word meaning "revelation".

That said, even if things do end happily (which is not certain right now) it's entirely possible they'll get way worse before. The Drug Lord striking a deal with the Other King to get names and bring forth Thamiel sort of worse.
