One of the goals I had for this summer was to write and edit a longish rational novella and I was hoping to get some help with the consequences of the system of magic I've come up with.

First, people in this world slowly build up a reserve of magical energy that peaks in early adulthood and slowly diffuses over the course of the their life. While it is possible to cast magic, it's consistently weak and people can only cast the equivalent of a [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists---sorcerer-and-wizard][cantrip]] a thousand times or so before exhausting their personal supply of energy at which point they can't build up any more.

Second, it's possible to inscribe runes into objects so that whenever people spend time and effort doing things, the tools they use gradually soak up that experience and gain magical properties related to their use. So for example, a blacksmith's hammer and anvil will produce much higher quality goods after a decade of work than if they were just inscribed or an old woodsman's bow would shoot arrows further and more accurately than one newly carved. Things with multiple uses will gain a wide range of varied but weak properties, while single purpose tools become exceptionally powerful at their designated task.

Third, these tools can be passed down over many generations and eventually people can use them to cast spells related to their purpose; in terms of scale at the lower end a Judge's scepter could let him tell if someone is lying or not and at the higher end a dynasty's heirloom sword could actually cut through an army. Unlike the case of people casting spells however, the amount of magical energy used to fuel the spell is only a fraction of what it would be for a person trying to do it without a tool.

Fourth, not all tools can be maintained indefinitely; as parts of an object are replaced because of repairs it loses a portion of its magic. If you're familiar with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus][Ship of Theseus]] problem in philosophy, the answer in this universe is that magic and identity are tied to every piece that makes up the whole of an object rather than the sum of the parts. The amount of magic lost directly relates to how important that replacement is to the use of the object, so changing the grip on a hammer wouldn't affect it's magic much but if somehow the head cracks or breaks, you're fucked.

tl;dr

1. People absorb then gradually diffuse magic, but casting spells is difficult and inefficient.
2. It's possible to trap magic in tools and make them better at what they do.
3. Eventually tools gain enough XP and absorb enough magic to cast spells at a vastly more efficient rate than people can.
4. Replacing parts of tools costs your tool XP and magic, more if the thing you're replacing is important.

**** So, since I have read it, there's all kinds of ideas I can toss in here from it... like prisoners being forced to practice up tools for rich people, including wearing clothes for them if they happen to be the same size, and having prisoners housed against the outside wall of rich people's houses so they can try and break in with deliberately inadequate tools to practice the walls up in their ability to keep people out.

** Here are my first, somewhat unstructured thoughts (I would assume that most of these are things that you've already thought of):

You never cast "naked" unless you're really desperate. Because magic depletes and never recovers, you always cast "clothed", i.e. with an heirloom.

Heirlooms are always made from as durable an object as feasible, even if this takes it outside the bounds of what's normal for its type.

Heirlooms are one of the primary spoils of war. They can also be taken for ransom in certain cases, as part of negotiation between countries or when stolen by a thief. Heirlooms represent a lot of power, which means that security needs to be really, really good around them so that a large, irreplaceable chunk of material wealth doesn't go missing.

Some heirlooms will wear down faster than others, just by their nature. A sword needs to be sharpened often, and there's wear and tear associated with fighting with it. That's less true of (say) a war hammer, which can be as simple as a glorified chunk of metal on the end of a stick. Heirlooms that don't actually have wear and tear are the best.

Heirlooms come with a future-oriented mentality. You don't plan on making the best heirloom for yourself; you plan on making the best heirloom for your grandchildren, who are going to be the ones to get the most use out of it due to the ramp up in power.

*** Contrasting to your idea of not casting naked spells, and possibly adding to the idea of dynasties, maybe there could be a tradition of some sort of "death spell". If you could cast 1000 low level spells in a lifetime, could it be advantageous to save up all your magic for the moments before you die, in order to do some sort of really awesome spell to benefit the family? Or infuse your magic into an heirloom? It could be a tradition to come up with a really neat spell that essentially marks your death in the eyes of the family, like a "life's work" kind of thing, something that people would be able to remember you by. In lieu of a tombstone you remember Uncle Jerry's spell that makes it so everyone in your family never has trouble opening a pickle jar, or something.

Poor families could sell their final spells to high paying dynasties, serfs could owe their final spells to their dynastic lords. Tossing some stuff out. It's a neat idea.

***** Ah if that's the case then it'd be more interesting with the serfdom magic tribute thing. A way to keep the lower class low and the higher class high maybe? Then maybe the serfs could rebel, each fit person making their "final act of magic" or whatever something to power them all up and take control? Could be used to interesting effect.

So like if the serfs had to give a fealty in the form of magic the knights and nobles would get to keep theirs in order to fight wars and make conquests and tools and such, while simultaneously keeping the rabble in check, with limited magic they have limited ability to harm them. Same with POWs, you make them do a final blast of magic and then kill them. Or, rather, make them do a final blast of magic and then keep around doing menial tasks, I think there was an example someone talked about having prisoners using objects in order to instill them with magic properties.

**** i was thinking about how this could make dynasties separate from family connections. maybe the blacksmith doesn't leave his hammer to his son, but to his best apprentice? there could also be heirlooms attached to an office or a title rather than a person.

for that matter, would, say, a constitution become an heirloom? it isn't used in the traditional sense, physically, but every time its laws come into effect, it is in a sense used.

  The *Code of Hammurabi* is a well-preserved [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia][Babylonian]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_code][law code]] of ancient [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia][Mesopotamia]], dating back to about 1754 BC. It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi][Hammurabi]], enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a human-sized stone /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stele][stele]]/ and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" (/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_talionis][lex talionis]]/) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man. Nearly one-half of the Code deals with matters of contract, establishing, for example, the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_behavior][sexual behavior]]. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently. A handful of provisions address issues related to military service.

** One consequence is gratuitous tool use (AKA "grinding")

Example: A young man may start using walking sticks to aid in walking despite not really needing it so that when they are old they have super-powerful walking staffs which enable them to walk at superspeeds.

This can very quickly get ridiculous, as gratuitous tools seeps into every possible aspect of life.

(Oh, better train my cup instead of scooping water with my hands. Never carry /anything/ in your hands, you could be increasing the size of your bag of holding. I'm gonna crack peanuts with my mighty and ancient Peanut Cracker, not with my fingernails.)

You can fix this kind of by making body-part use count as tool use, with people's bodies getting some intrinsic power as they get older. That does have a cool side effect that bones and corpses might be magically interesting. But people might still do gratuitous tool use if they want something a little more long lasting than bones to pass on.

Explanation for those not familiar: David Brin novel, the more an object is used the better it gets at what it does. Look at a mannequin, it gets more lifelike. Use a handkerchief, it gets softer and more absorbent, etc.

Note that in TPE it's the objects themselves that are gaining new qualities. OP seems to be saying that the objects become better at reducing the cost of casting cantrips but do not themselves do magic.

** This world is probably ruled by the first person to inherit an artifact designed to provide immortality - or even longevity, since it would grow in strength over their lifespan. They'd be vastly more powerful, since they'd have the ability to actually create items instead of just cooperating acausally with past generations.

Admittedly, coming up with such an item is tricky; but if this setting is thousands of years old, someone should have done it by now. And they should be the most powerful.

The explanation for how this works seems to suggest that multiple people "using" the same object would increase it's power much more rapidly; and the explanation for why buildings and locations aren't vastly powerful seems to suggest that smaller objects should be correspondingly /more/ powerful (jewlery, for example, or small tools.) This seems broken; I'm not really sure how to fix it consistently, but I'd say there's a way.

You mention in the comments that reusing components from Heirlooms allows you to reuse some of the XP they had soaked up; as long as you don't alter it too badly (a handle should probably still be a handle, for instance.) Could you use this to give, say, a fairly new knife the handle of an epic-level Heirloom screwdriver to create a powerful weapon? That sounds useful.

** If I was administrating a country in this world, I would make sure to have some very powerful industrial utility heirlooms - tools that can summon harvests from fallow fields in a moment, a pick axe that can summon a mines worth of ore from the earth with a tap, a weathervane that can predict daily weather years into the future - and make operating the heirlooms a civic duty, one that's fun. Citizens would get to enter lotteries to wield the most powerful artifacts, there would be leaderboards of who managed to use the artifacts most effectively, you would be compensated for your time using the artifacts, etc. They would be closely guarded, of course, but not threateningly. Convicted criminals would be prohibited from using the highest-profile national artifacts, but criminal labour would be used to tune new or experimental artifacts up to an efficient level.

Entertainment heirlooms would be held by the state and leased to companies that supported the state's message. Symbolic heirlooms that could achieve effects without accruing wear and tear - a ceremonial sword that literally empowers people by knighting them, for example - would be highly prized. Where possible, sheaths or treatments that protect the artifact from damage without removing material would be added.

Imagine a stamp that could mark a thousand bills at once with a mark conceptually impossible to fake. It would be a lot easier to move away from the gold standard.

** What about modular machines, like a farm, a violin, or a car? Things where the wear-and-tear is concentrated on one section, so you have a violin that goes through dozen strings a year and needs it's bow rehaired every performance, but the wood, varnish, everything else is ancient and seeped in power? Does it lose some of that each time it's rehaired, or does the spell count the ephemeral parts as ephemeral and unimportant? You mentioned the metaphor of Theseus's Ship, but what if it's only the sails that change - do they take a bit of power with the each time? Do separate components have to be engraved separately? Can I bury a marked waystone to represent a street, or does every individual cobble need to be marked?

What would be really awe-inspiring, though, would be the churches and cathedrals. Ancient structures /designed/ to inspire awe, and /constantly used/ in rituals of /awe/. Imagine a church bell in a little countryside village that's stood for the greater part of a millenia - what spells could it cast? An effect that can push a message to the minds of every man in the country? A call that summons hordes of wild animals to a town's defence?

More on repair: If an object needs periodic but infrequent repair to stay in perfect working order, is it possible to fill it with magic faster than it loses magic without going to extremes?

If symbolic objects can cast spells as well as actual tools, then they would become much more valuable much more quickly - a judge's scepter doesn't get a lot of wear-and-tear, and neither does a well-made, well-cared for ruler or compass. An ancient glass lens might work better in a telescope than a modern one, for example, even if that violates physics.

Or does the computer just sort fast magically even though the program on it should not be able to do so?

Are you just incapable of practicing things that work in reductionist ways, such as computer programs? If that's so, can't anything be described in a reductionist way?

What exactly does it mean to use something? If you keep throwing a spear at a target and you miss 60% of the time, how does the magic know that you're practicing the hitting and not the missing, so that the hit rate of the spear increases with XP and not its miss rate? And if your answer is "it depends on what the person using the item thinks", do they then have to understand how an item works? If someone falsely thinks that the spear keeps missing the target because the target is magnetic, does the XP then just make the spear more capable of hitting magnetic targets? If someone doesn't know that cars have engines, and they practice the car, does the engine gain any efficiency?

** Some tools would become very resistant to degradation as they gained XP. Anything that has "prevent damage" as part of its purpose would eventually overpower other heirlooms, as they would never need repair. Shields and armor are the only examples that come to mind, but I'm sure there's more.

** If it at all possible you would see people trying to associate things with large objects that are unlikely to fall apart or break up. You would also see a far more organized work structure as instead of having ten people working away using their own tools it is far more worthwhile to have one person only working and to share the same tool.

Obviously going on to that you're seriously changing the cost-benefit analysis of things so that making cheap objects that don't last so long isn't worth much any more.

Things like does tilling and other farming techniques magically imbue the entire earth? Does swimming in the water imbue the ocean, does breathing imbue the air?

What I'm saying is that the earth itself is a tool? If it isn't why not? How does it define what is a tool? I'm using the ocean to swim, I use the air to breath these are the tools I need to do something.

Or something useless normally - a weighted bag of air, for instance. Useless, until its accrued enough power to change buoyancy, supply endless air, etc.

Depends how it works right? If I inscribe on a canteen or cup or something and drink from it, does the water I fill it with become more clean or more potent, or is it just the canteen that gains powers.

Is a depression not the container of lakes and water? If I inscribe with food colouring onto a still water then I could form a rune like that. Does that work? If yes, why, if not, why?

The soil is a tool that trees use to grow, can I inscribe that? Can I take advantage of other beings magical energy production or is it only humans?

What if inscribe myself, obviously I can do every piece of clothing, shoes, etc? Can I inscribe my children, they are the tools of my DNA, etc. My teeth?

So many questions!

** Wouldn't the magic in such a world be negligible for most purposes compared to normal technology?

I mean it really depends on the rate by which items gather magic but from your description it sounds like the rate is really slow. And when you combine this with the inevitable wars for any item which becomes close to a gamechanger which might very well cause them to be destroyed over time would cause a situation where most items will just not be worth it.

I mean sure you might have an ancient cannon that can hit a target 50 km away with pinpoint accuracy but you do not win wars that way. you may have the best hammer in the seven seas but it won't help you produce a microchip. In the end items get deprecated, and mass production wins. That is unless magic gathers pretty quickly, in which case it would really depend on the speed of the field.

**** An important aspect will probably be the fact that the rate would need to be different for different fields and human evolution(culture\technological that is) to keep a relatively constant delta.

Though it depends on how you model it, in theory if the infusion rate is high enough to make technology useless early enough then people will not even bother, which might mean stone-age society with super items.

This could make science more of a thing, but will relatively shortly make magic even less useful.. i mean again once mass production is a thing it will just overwhelm any item.
