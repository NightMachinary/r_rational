So, in my dream I had a golden ring, about the size of a finger ring, that when you put anything through it it vanished. The other side was always dark, except occasionally in the dark you could see flickers of light. Vary occasionally there are sounds and muffled voices.

Part way through my dream which was otherwise about as logical as dreams usually are, I realized that it was a two way portal to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island#Caves][a cave on Easter Island]] several hundred years ago. The other end presented as a similar ring, and was located in the cave, and someone at the other end was using it as a source of light and air while hiding out in it. Of course things went weird and irrational again after that, but I remember that detail.

It seems like this is the kind of magic plot device that could become world changing if (im)properly abused. How to communicate with the people at the other end? Sound doesn't travel very well, and nobody understands the written language of the Easter Islanders.

[Edit: sound is muffled, and so is light, but you can push objects through and they arrive intact and apparently undamaged... the forward-time protagonist has received pieces of litter probably including bits of vegetable matter that are still alive]

[Edit: to make it clear, there is a multi-hundred-year time gap between this end of the portal and the other.]


** I don't know anything about it besides what I heard in my spanish III class, but Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is part of Chile, and it is inhabited by the Chilean descendents of Easter Island natives, and maybe some other immigrants from the main land.

This could make a good story. Maybe the person who's trapped in the cave is either from the distant past, or he's a modern chilean/easter islander archaelogist that got trapped in a cave in while studying his ancestors or something. Although then I'm not sure how the protagonist (you) even finds out he's from Rapa Nui if you can't see where he is through the ring and if you can't understand spanish or whatever native language he's speaking. If light is coming out of your side of the ring, and you can see him through it, then he should also be able to see you.

Figuring this out would of course be part of the story. Possibly by attempting to communicate by pushing coiled pieces of paper through?

(Of course, in-universe I would spend a while covering flaws and details ("how do I gurantee future-me to find the ring?" etc) in the plan before executing any irrevocable stuff.

***** There are so many ways for that plan to fail. Including the fact that the caves in Easter Island have been well explored over the past several hundred years, and even if by some miracle the ring is anywhere near there now... odds are that the person on the other end of the wormhole in 2215 or 2615 or whenever is probably not future-you and is more likely to be feeding you the equivalent of a cyanide capsule...

Plus you're kind of assuming a closed loop timeline. You just changed the past, the new timeline where the ring is still in the cave in 2015 probably doesn't have you in it. You're better off extracting what value you can from a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peripheral][stub]] Easter Island.

I'm not sure that there's a good lower limit on that. As soon as a decision gets magnified to the point that it has any observable effect on any human who survives to have progeny, you're probably screwed after more than a few decades. The butterfly effect on male sperm cells will completely change the population of the planet at the rate of communication between societies. Easter Island was "discovered" in 1722, so anyone born in Europe after, say, 1800 would be different.

So the fact that you still exist means it's probably a new timeline.

******** Okay, so this ring is just a portal to a second Earth that happens to currently be in the state our Earth was in a while ago. Obviously robots that build more robots is nonsense, since if we could do that we wouldn't need that ring.

New goal: Harness the Ringearth's manpower and wealth. (Secondary: Find out the ring's nature, origin, workings, and any further "magic" that might exist.)

Assume some thousand dollars of starting capital. What do we want?

- RC vehicles: Drones, a few blimps, cars, boats, etc.
- Cameras, microphones, radio chips, a miniature beamer or two or maybe a flexible screen.

Get caveguy to assemble the stuff, using incentives like food or drugs. Leave.

Why are we using drones instead of people? I'm not sure how smart these people are. If they at some point realize how the ring works, my might ends - until I have gundrones, I'm just a voice that trades in information and small objects.

Research celestial events and tell the approximate year by observing the night sky. If it is early enough, we can emulate the European colonists and trade modern novelties for gold.

Such trading attempts would of course not be done with the ring present - that one is constantly hidden in a remote place, while single drones carry goods to trade. A default place would be "carried by a team of drones above the clouds", since the combined might of Ringearth's humanity would be hard-pressed to reach it there. (Hmm. Trained birds? I can probably fly higher than birds can breathe, in a pinch, though the winds might get harsh. China's fireworks may prove a problem.)

And so our capital grows by an order of magnitude or two. (Up to this point, I'd expect to be able to deal with a fence on our side without arousing too much suspicion.)

What's our end goal? Amusingly, I'd still say "Make sure the first AI is friendly.". One avenue would be gaining major funds and going philanthropic, another would be to start educating the Ringearth's population on FAI theory and get them working on the problem.

(This might be an interesting story to tell from the point of view of Ringearth's population: A european country is visited by the devil's fingers in this world, offering knowledge and magic for gold or willingness to learn about demonology...)

********* One problem: I don't think Easter Island had much in the way of gold. It is literally the most isolated place on Earth. The nearest inhabited land is Pitcairn Island, which is itself notorious for its isolation. It's 3500 miles to Chile and the greatest extent of the Incan Empire.

Given the risk of having your ring fall into the Peru-Chile Trench, you might be better off building up a cult to pull a reverse Kon-Tiki.

It doesn't seem /too/ great - redundant vehicles and sufficient electrical power (note to self: get a backup power generator!) go a long way towards calming the risk. I should probably check how well drones perform above clouds first, though. Maybe rent a wind canal.

In the unlikely event that no dronery works and the ring falls into the trench, we can cut the cables on the level of the ring, dropping them into the ocean, have a balloon prepared sticking through the ring that we then blow up with air or helium depending on whether we like the current trade winds/currents, allowing falling back on a civilization of our choice. (We'll want to have it prepared because otherwise one atmosphere of water pressure per ten metres of water depth are about to start rushing through my side.) Maybe add a straw next to the balloon so we can blow air in the direction we want to get away from.

#+begin_quote

Yes, I meant that I feared that they aren't stupid, and thus I shouldn't trust them not to figure out how the ring works and shut me down. Ergo, drones.

** Several hundred years ago?

If that is a very long time prior to Easter Sunday in 1722, you might be able to start working to educate the Easter Islanders with the scientific method before the Europeans arrive? Working slowly of course, passing rolled papers through, and receiving them in return.

Since you exist, you clearly aren't interfering with your own timeline, but you have a connection to that other timeline/dimension.

The first thing to do is determine the state of the people on the island. If it's early Easter Island, it's a pretty ideal place for people with plenty of trees and other resources. Trees are important. If they have already chopped down all their trees, you need to start sending them seeds and teaching them about forestry so they can maintain that resource.

If they still have trees, you need to teach them conservation and forestry so they don't run into the same problem in that timeline as they did in ours.

Educate them through the ring. Create an erudite society. Teach them what you can, and hope they are willing to learn. As they develop, you can teach them where easily accessed natural resources are located in the world, like the Comstock lode, and they will likely happily share wealth with you.

If you plan to make this a story, you need an opponent. Perhaps every now and then, someone shoots an arrow through the ring. Perhaps the ring is thrown into a fire, and you have to quickly find water to pour through the ring to put out the fire before the ring melts.

**** They don't have a whole lot of portable wealth yet. Maybe they never do. That's a plot point. Research would be needed on modern day Easter Island to see if there are valuable resources there. I suspect there aren't, or there aren't many.

Time as an opponent is going to be an extreme challenge if you are writing to entertain. Opponents that people can understand on a visceral level are almost required, unless you are a damn good writer. Stephen King manages a non-existent antagonist in "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" (The only reason I know this is because I am currently reading a book about plot and structure - I've never read it.) The book I am reading specifically warns against antagonists/opponents that aren't physical beings of some sort or another, and what they say made sense to me.

You could always flip the story around so that you are the primitive...

There's an alien on Easter Island that has managed to create a dimensional portal with remnants of a very advanced starship drive.

They need help, but they are trying to judge your intelligence and rationality before asking for much. The native islanders are not very helpful.

In the end, the alien sends you a picture of themselves - a very small body with a great, elongated head.

Or perhaps a small piece of a colorful scarf. (Tom Baker was the best Doctor)

However, there would certainly be people who would object! At first, the villagers, later, perhaps other villages. Eventually, the rest of the world.

All sorts of conflict potential there. The ring becomes the most valuable artifact on the planet if people know what it can do. The story could even revolve around how to keep the existence of the ring a secret.

A secret society? Illuminati?

But what does the advanced technology side of the ring get? Just mental satisfaction?

Perhaps small electronic recording devices can be passed through and the Easter Islanders start recording documentary films of the alternate history?
