Any rational novels based on the real world, or a world very similar to the real one? I've seen a lot of rational fics that take place in alternate realities and with different laws of nature than our own, some of my favorites being "The Study of Anglophysics" by SlateStarCodex and "The Two-Year Emperor" by EagleJarl.

I was wondering if anyone has ever or would ever write a rational fiction that takes place "in the real world" so to speak, preferably with a rational protagonist. I think it would be really interesting to see that. If no one's done this yet, what do you think it would take to make one?


** The problem is, whenever I consider writing rational fiction set in the real world, I am immediately set upon by existential anxiety that I am not already doing the things my characters would be.

Well, it worked for Ayn Rand. :p

*** Ack, yeah. Real life seems to be primarily about navigating webs of acausal cooperation protocols and trying to figure out what one's goal actually is, which makes actually applying instrumental rationality to everyday problems the last thing on one's list of shit to do.

"Build an AI that can figure out what one's goal actually is" is a nice subgoal, it's a fairly concrete thing one can work towards right now. But you still have to wrestle with the facts that doing any AI research imminentizes UFAI, and deep seated doubt as to the inaccessibility of the human's end-goals to the human itself, I mean, how the fuck could the human's end-goals be less accessible to the human than to the machine the human builds? How could that be right?! Surely there's a more direct route to self-actualization? What if that route can be traversed quicker than UFAI but FAI without self-actualization can't, and focussing on AI research instead of walking that path would damn us all?

** Here's a webserial of a rational character who seems to be set in the modern day world, but for all I know there will be some supernatural stuff coming up.

[[https://jdogmoney.wordpress.com/][Charlie]] is only at 5 chapters and the author hasn't updated in a month, so don't get your hopes up too high. But I think it's worth following for the potential update.

*** Sorry about that. Mild delay. Charlie is, in fact, going to continue. Honestly I kind of lost interest in it, but if people want to read it I may as well write it.

**** Thanks for responding.

I got the notification about chapter #6 today. Is there a reason for why it's only a sentence long?

The only reason I can think of, assuming that it's intentional, is that Alyx just interrupted in a way that's different from how the reader would have expected. By stabbing him in frustration is my guess.

***** Something like that. It's entirely intentional. I'll post the next chapter as soon as it's done.

** I can think of any number of examples. Both SF and mainstream fiction are full of works that the author clearly believed to be rational, objective, and objectively presenting a rational world-view, from various renaissance utopias onward. Try /The Moon is a Harsh Mistress/ for a rigorously (for the time) hard SF example.

** Try Andy Weir's "The Martian"; it's been linked here a few times.

Fair warning: start reading it in the morning, when you don't have any commitments for the rest of the day. That way you don't flake out on anything and you get enough sleep.

*** Seconding that warning, though the story is a bit too contrived sometimes to be Rational, IMO.

** I'd be willing to bet that you could find some fiction based on law enforcement, military, firefighting, private detective work, etc. I don't follow that sort of fiction, but it's not for any dislike of it, I just don't seek it out.

*** Those areas are a good avenue for rationalist fiction because they allow for a lot of domain-specific rationality that actually helps in your everyday job. (And they're exciting enough to write about.)

** Not a novel but Baby Steps is an anime that is set in the real world and is a rational fiction. The setting is tennis tournaments and the protagonist is driven by careful analysis of gameplay and incessant training.
