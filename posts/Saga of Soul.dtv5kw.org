*** Note that he broke those 4 years on December of 2018, so we're back a full year without an update already.

** The good thing about Saga of Soul's abandonment is that all of the immediate plot threads that were in flight were more or less wrapped up. More long-term ones remain, and a couple new ones were introduced, but it's not the worst ending I've seen.

  The story begins when Eriko, an introverted bookworm, suffers a near-death experience. Instead of walking toward the Light, she takes it upon herself to perform scientific experiments, which leads to her acquiring magical powers. Soon enough, she finds herself involved in a complex conflict as several factions of mortal and supernatural entities alike make their play.

** The story seems interesting, but the way it's written is grating to me.
