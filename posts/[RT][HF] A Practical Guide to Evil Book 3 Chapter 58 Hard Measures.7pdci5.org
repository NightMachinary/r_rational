** The last-ditch effort of Good has failed, as expected. Does Cat get these kind of redemption chances (2nd one now!) because she's a Squire and hence can transition into Good? Or is it related to the continuous fight for Callow's soul, which has never been on the side of Evil?

The real question is this: was this the temptation to lure the protagonist from her rightful path or a last chance at redemption before a tragedy? It very much felt like an inverse of a scene where the main character is tempted by some great evil only to fully commit to the side of the good.

** Let's hope that Akua really needed those spies now, because crippling your force by removing twenty-something officers (including one senior officer) just before the battle can't be good. At least, neither Catherine nor Hakram said "no way that could possibly go wrong" when discussing their move.

As for that talk with the Sister, I don't know what to make of it. Said like this, Cat's way of thinking sounds like "IDGAF, YOLO". Never been a winning argument. Unless the point was to make it extra clear that Cat is Evil, so deep into that path that she can't even understand why people would want to be Good?

*** Because Cat's binary thinking has rephrased Good and Evil as Passive vs Active in a bloody, violent way. So now she calls herself evil, but has rationalised it as being able to decide the course of her own fate.

'If we all cross the same finish line the only thing that matters, the only thing that can matter, is how we get there.'

'So what if we all cross the same finish line? Down here in the mud is what really matters. What we make of it. And if I only have so much time kicking around Creation, then I'm the one who's going to decide how it's spent.'

So close, yet so far Cat. That was the point the priestess was trying to make.

***** Cat controls supply within her own legion. I really really doubt that a lot of magical stuff slipped past her and Ratface and Masego and Juniper and Aisha. Just Cat, sure, but all of them at the same time? Plus every other high-ranked Cat loyalist?

Then there are distribution problems. Suppose traitors somehow got the materials. Now they gotta distribute them to all soldiers so that they would drink them, and insure they keep doing that for a while. I doubt food is cooked in a single place for the whole legion (seems to make more sense to have one kitchen for 2-3 hundred people instead), and each such place probably has dozens of cooking pots, so this means they have to consistently put poison into dozens of pots all over camp without getting caught. How many traitors do you think there are, several hundreds? How do they insure nobody defects and sells the scheme to Cat? How do they insure they never get caught? They can't very much kill anyone who notices, because that would /definitely/ be noticed.

It just isn't plausible.

****** They were drinking from/camping by a river, mentioned half a dozen chapters ago. They could have just put it in there and the traitors were told when they did so to get the timing right to drink.

Also, that's not how it works. You drink the chemicals and then anyone can activate the change by magic, otherwise there's no difference unless you're scanned. There's no gradual change.

  “Our understanding of the process was incomplete,” Diabolist conceded. “It took me several months instead of the theorized one to reach the ideal concentration. The process was accelerated when I held the only available source of water, of course. As you can see, it is temporary for you to have the largest army on the field. That can be remedied in the span of an hour should I wish it.”
#+end_quote

It takes a couple months to drink the chemicals when using Ubua's process to do it. They put it into dozens of rivers as the legion moved all over the place? At just the right time when everyone was taking water for cooking, because otherwise it'd get carried with the water downstream and be lost? Without being noticed by sentries or anyone else as they conspicuously leave the camp each day at the time cooking is done with backpacks of supplies and return without them?
