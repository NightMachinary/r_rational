** I don't know why a sport game is on here.

There's no story to tell.

** Is this just some bot spamming us? The account's 5-year status argue against it, but the accounts evident comment deletion and the fact that some of the comments the account has made are very definitely empty nonsense argues in favor.

Even if this is not random spam, I'd still argue for deletion. I enjoy a similar game, and tend to enjoy both the narratives of individual games (what decisions shaped the game? why did this team win/lose? etc), as well as the narratives of tournaments, their results, and the associated players/personalities - the story of comebacks, where individual game wins and losses are a smaller part of a broader picture, etc. A lot of these games are decided by careful decision making in an instant under pressure and uncertainty, and that sort of narrative can be great to watch.

However, this sort of thing has a huge burden of knowledge to understand or make comprehensible at all - I am a 4k DotA 2 player, which places me somewhere in the top decile of players, and even knowing a similar game extremely well, and having tried LoL several times as well, I was still lost for almost the entire video.

I don't think that this sort of content is likely to be interesting or enjoyable to the members of this subreddit.

**** It can be great to watch... if you have the high level of contextual knowledge to actually appreciate what is going on - what people are doing and why they are doing it. Otherwise, it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing.

I don't link really awesome games or tournaments of DotA 2 here, even when they have really interesting stories happen in them, because I assume that the background rate of DotA 2 players on this subreddit is close to the same as anywhere else - probably less than 1 in 100 - and of that vanishingly tiny fraction who could theoretically follow what's happening without dozens of hours of study, most of those are probably subscribed to one or more of the Dota 2 subreddits and are already aware of things, making a [[/r/rational]] link totally superfluous.

**** The real world follows those 4 guidelines. That's the point - fiction that works according to rules of logic similar to the real world.

And the trouble is, this isn't fiction. This is sports commentary.
