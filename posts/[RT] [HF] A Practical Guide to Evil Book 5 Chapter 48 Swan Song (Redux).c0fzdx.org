** So she's destroying the crown, the same way Black destroyed the doomsday weapon. That sucks.

It didn't actually give the immediate outcome though, or say what Cat was doing, like it had at the end of the previous Swan Song. It isn't impossible that Cat uses her contingency for the Saint before she gets to the crown. I wouldn't count on it though. They're in Arcadia, where the story matters more than anything else.

Edit: Is this why the Bard wanted Kairos to live? So it would lead to this outcome?

*** Maybe the Bard wants Kairos to wear the crown. A court of twilight that can't keep up an alliance for more than 2 minutes is about the best long-term solution to the unified fae court.

Saint striking at the Pilgrim (or his general direction) is also a dangerous precedent.

** I mean i can't say that i like the Saint anymore after this chapter but it and the previous few does kinda give her a lot of implicit rationale. I mean she's not super wrong and i think it says something that she's even willing to admit that Cat might not be as treacherous as she could be, i'm not sure if she means that much more than that but, well it is a concession. It's really interesting to see it in comparison to Cat's speech to the Drow previously to be better, to not be dragged down by the 'pettiness' that is can so easily become an existential threat. That to compromise with evil gives them the kind of legitimacy that well let's the fox into the hen house writ large.

​

It also kind of is diminished, because of her own lack of action oh say the invasion of Callow? Or the years of occupation in which their previous Good aligned culture was overwritten. If anything if she really believed what she was saying then she would definitely be trying to destroy Callow outright not Procer... wait.

​

Also can you imagine how Masego is going to feel after Cat and party bring a God (or is it god?) into existence, without him there to watch and be a part of? And for the G/god to potentially be Archer? Also it was interesting to see that there were some kind of limitations to the Pilgrim's ability to Forgive deaths I wonder if that's like a bug or a feature.

*** Well, in a world where heaven literally exists resurrecting someone who died a legtitmately heroic death in the service of good would be pulling them back out of heaven and ruining their heroic reward, like how Buffy's friends fucked up and did to her. That's probably why he can't reverse a heroic death.

**** It certainly makes sense, but i'm not sure if we have enough evidence to suggest that a truly heroic death, or sacrifice if you will, is enough to prevent him from forgiving the death, hell he seemed uncertain about Archer after her revive, not necessarily uncertain that he could revive her and man would that have made a different story if the Dead King overestimated the Pilgrim's ability in the first place. But uh that in his interlude he said that those he brought back " Resurrection left a scar on the soul, always. No one could be ripped from the embrace of the Gods without finding Creation and faded and brutish place for the rest of their days, even if the memory of the Heavens was withheld." this was in interlude kaleidoscope II. Which i guess also brings up the question of where Archer ended up considering she came back with knowledge of the Pilgrim's past as a priest.

​

Man how meta would it be if all she saw the chapters that we see on the website?

Bringing someone likr that back isn't just repairing physical damage, it isn't even just wrestling a soul from the Gods - it's a Sysiphean effort to push a boulder that has /ontological/ weight.

*** From what we've learned of saint before, I feel like it is.... her. If that makes any sense. While I didnt see the crown being given to Indrani, that the Saint would not accept it was certain, and the rest of the chapter kinda felt like a car crash - watching things happen that have been set in motion, but it being too late for them to change.

Personally, I think she goes for Indrani or the crown, and I dont know if she survives the next few chapters or not.

**** Oh no i completely agree it certainly makes sense that she would be as, if not more vehement as Black was when he was certain Cat and Malicia(?) were making if not a mistake then THE mistake. In that lens it makes a lot of sense that she would be willing to act in what seems to be a extreme fashion.

​

I do have to wonder now if the Bard's plan was to get rid of Saint by way of inter-party violence that is kind of inevitable with the way Tyrant has an almost pathological need to push people's buttons. I mean Pilgrim was previously thinking that Saint was going to be needed in the fight against the Dead King.

*** I think a large part of why she seems extreme is that she treats good an evil like abstract metaphysical entities not aspects of human minds, which to us seems insane. But in the guide verse it is genuinely the case that there is an insidious metaphysical force that will exploit any weak point to manipulate the world. So a zero tolerance attitude makes a lot more sense. Particularly since with the way stories work a "precedent" has metaphysical power of its own.

(I'd say the meta level mistake she makes is equating Good (the metaphysical force) with what is morally good, and vice versa. As arguably the heavens are just as bad for humanity as the hells. But if 90%vof the time Good is pushing people towards niceness, community and hugs, and Evil is pushing them to burn things down, mass murder and death then its an understandable position to take.)

**** She certainly has the feel of a Puritan Inquisitor of Warhammer 40k to me, as in one that shuns the other, kind of rightfully so given the hostile nature of most if not all of the others in both situations.

The other thing that i think is pretty telling is about the consistent emphasis on the trying to be better by both White Knight and Pilgrim. That to fail is almost expected if not outright so.

It is really kind of unusual given our view of the more "enlightened" evil i guess, the more institutional rather than personal power, that for the majority of the time evil meant the kind over the top evil that might have made individual improvements but for the most part would fall into the doomsday weapons that arguably Cat, with her portals previously, and Ubua and Malicia with the Hellgate, all fell into the trap of. I think that for the most part Saint's mistake is thinking of Cat being oldschool evil like most if not all the villains she's encountered but Cat is something new or at least new-ish in being concerned with the governing more than the conquering for instance. At the same time the institutions that she's working toward kind of have the implication of potentially being the death knell for Good societies as whole so Saint's certainly not wrong that Cat is potentially as threatening to Good as the Dead King.

*** Is that an outcome that they would want? Like Saint was kicking a Winter powered Cat's butt by herself not so long ago and shoving an entire Fae court's worth of power into her seems less than optimal to be honest. At least if the crown is destroyed there's a chance they still get the portals working, but beating Saint plus more power seems like a lot for our spent party.

Also how like an RPG to have a party member go from fighting equal-ish to the other members to being a threat to all of them at once. Granted it's usually the other way around from a boss to being downgraded to a party member.

****** I'm not sure if her domain would tolerate the transition-swords are straightforward. Statecraft is nuanced and complex.

******* It might be something more complex in practice, while a sword cuts without morality, she herself has much more of a stated position that she holds to. As in she might well be unable to make the transition as she is, but a mantle seems to have some amount of effect on mental state. She might start out as a sword(that cuts) and end up more idunno The Sword(that cuts out corruption) or something.

​

Like she's clearly not just the sword to the point that she's simply a sword, a sword has no morality, a sword doesn't choose what it cuts it merely cuts things, where she's firmly on side of Good to the point that she's willing to burn out a Good country as a way of getting one over the Dead King.

** So no matter what happens, this is probably the rift between the Saint and the Pilgrim that sets the stage for an impending factional conflict amongst the Good powers of Calernia:

One side willing to compromise with Below in order to fight for shared interests lead by Pilgrim amongst the Heroes and the Principality amongst nations, and the other side who won't accept an alliance with Cat even as the dead march south, lead by the Saint and (probably) the Dominion.
