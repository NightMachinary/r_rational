** I played lot of interactive fiction recently and IMHO these are the best games of the genre:

[[https://www.choiceofgames.com/robots/][Choice of Robots]] You are brilliant constructor creating new revolutionary type of robot. Your choices will shape your robot, your life and whole world. Lots of branching paths. Some events seems unavoidable but there is way to prevent them. Also, Singularity is an option.

[[https://www.choiceofgames.com/user-contributed/tin-star/][Tin Star]] - Western. It's one of the longest interactive novels, but it doesn't sacrifice interactivity and has lots of ways to roleplay and choices that actually matters. It has Deus Ex wealth of options. If you want you can kill every major character or you can go through game talking your way out of problems and not killing anyone. Great characters, even simple bandits have depth.

[[http://www.inklestudios.com/80days/][80 Days]] - steampunk retelling of /Around the World in 80 Days/. Really captures spirit of the novel with planning out routes, worrying about time and the misadventures of unfortunate Passepartout.

[[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_A_Succession_of_Bad_Days?id=tYyxCQAAQBAJ][A Succession of Bad Days]] - It's about a group of students learning to be wizards in an incredibly hazardous world with ~30k years of history and the results of hundreds of insane prior evil overloards genetic experiments roaming the countryside.\\
It's really unlike anything I've ever read before.

The characters are fairly rational and the whole social and political situation seems like a rational response to the world.

[[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_Safely_You_Deliver?id=Oju2CwAAQBAJ][Safely You Deliver]] is the third in the series with the same characters. (Just came out, reading it now)

The first one in the series is [[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_The_March_North?id=MoIOAwAAQBAJ][The March North]], mentioned here for complteness. Some of the characters are in the second books, but this one is not particularly "rational".

Also, thanks so much SaintPeter74! I was the one to recommend the series on the subreddit before and didn't realize there's another book out.

By the way, do you know if there's a way to track or follow authors on Google Play? There doesn't seem to be an obvious way to do it, but you are posting about the book the day after it was released, so you must have some way to do so.

I think the thing I liked best about it was that, despite it being a fantasy, it was so well grounded in the "science" and in tactics.

It's not fiction, but there's a relatively small youtube channel dedicated to thorough, honest critiques of video games.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ][Joseph Anderson]] is never negative just to be negative, and he doesn't gush over every little thing his favorite developers do. He also tempers his own opinions with contradicting views, and admits his limitations as a single individual with a single perspective. He first got popular with a harsh but honest [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-3kxiOzMOg][hour-long review of Hearthstone]]. Not all of his videos are that long, but his huge [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A34poZ6paGs][Fallout 4 breakdown]] is probably my favorite.

*Movies*

I don't watch many movies, but if you haven't watched [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/][No Country for Old Men]], you're only cheating yourself. The directing takes huge influences from Kubrick: Long shots with no dilaogue--only action moving the plot forward. And everything is done with honest intention, even if at times misguided. Oh, and there arguably is no main character, so you can rest assured no one has plot armor.

*Books*

I dunno how this sub is about light self-promotion, but I honestly believe my book will appeal to fans of rational fiction.

[[http://www.amazon.com/Perjure-Book-1-Welcome-Multiverse-ebook/dp/B01CF3MYLW][Perjure: Welcome to the Multiverse]] is my best attempt at blending the complexity and world building of A Song of Ice and Fire with the prose and brutality of Blood Meridian. It's a big, 600 page first entry in a series that tries to mirror No Country for Old Men in its equal treatment to all characters.

The subreddit is [[/r/wttm]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/wttm][if you're interested]].

*Music*

Oh god, please listen to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKqjs_6Qc-w][Pillow Talking by Lil Dicky]]. Even if you hate rap and you don't like his style of humor, I feel like everyone in this sub will relate with the subject matter. It's a song that recounts an argument Lil Dicky supposedly had with a girl after having sex with her. It touches on religion, aliens, pizza, veganism and Uber vs Lyft. It's amazing.

*** I read all of "A Practical Guide To Evil" a couple of weeks ago; pretty fantastic, though I wish more was out! The only part that stuck out for me about it being "a little bit SJW" was that the main character is bisexual, and openly announces that (although it takes a while).

I also really enjoyed the "Hero" chapter interludes in book 2, especially the one talking about why Good needs to win over Evil. Up until that point I was thinking "Man, Evil is pretty good!" But Bard convincingly points out that this is a deviation from the regular behavior of Evil. At its best, Evil is efficient; at its worst, it's brutally genocidal. So while the Empire might be a better place to live in now than Callow was, there's no guarantee that it'll stay that way - and if history is any indication, when that pendulum shifts, lots of innocent people are going to get massacred.

Ah, but in a world where war between Good and Evil is a fact of life, you probably would if you were a pragmatic villain.

And its clear that, although parts of their culture have been preserved, they have largely assimilated into the greater culture at this point.

Though, speaking as someone who has lived his whole life in North Dakota, having been born in Bismarck and currently going to college in Fargo, it gets a bit weird when the state or the city gets referred to as this barren winter wasteland with only a smidgen of civilization.

I did like that the recent oil boom was integrated into the story, with the huge influx of people moving into the state for that, as that is absolutely what happened.

Readers might want to make a note of my email address (crumjd on the gmail system) in case it does and they need me to get them a PDF of the last half of the story or something.

I'd hate to leave anyone hanging...

***** The story, in its current online form, reaches the end of the second "book", so readers who start now will get a complete piece.

It could be continued with another book and I may do that some day in some form. As to what's currently written I wanted to explore self publishing options once I get it cleaned up and starter serials comes down.

** Well, seeing as my most recent obsessions have all been Roleplaying Quests on SufficientVelocity, I'll list some of the best ones I've found. Here's an [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/intro-to-questing.12494/][Intro to Questing]], for those who don't know.

- *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death: A Rational Naruto Quest]]* - This one has been posted here a few times. Written by Velorien and EagleJarl, with two other guys helping with mechanics and worldbuilding. Out of all the quests I've found, this is still absolutely my favorite. Great worldbuilding, unexpectedly brilliant mechanics system, and expectedly great writing. Updates twice a week, and in need of more regular contributors.

- *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-man%E2%80%99s-dream-never-dies-a-one-piece-quest.23728/][A Man's Dream Never Dies: A One Piece Quest]]* - I've never really checked out One Piece, so I was wary about this one, but the writing quality quickly won me over. This Quest follows the journey of the pirate Morgan D. Bartholomew, the Captain of the Black Suit Pirates and known throughout the world as Black Bart. The story starts in the aftermath of your ship being attacked and destroyed by Admiral Kizaru, with your whole crew either dead or captured, and Bart being critically wounded. But this is no reason to give up. Your dream is to become the Pirate King, and nothing short of death will stop you from achieving that. This quest is something of a Shounen/Seinin story, and the writing is extremely good. We just passed the Timeskip, with a new arc just getting started, so it's a good time to jump in.

- *[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SayakaQuest][SayakaQuest]]* - Complete. This quest takes place in the Madoka Magica universe, from the perspective of Sayaka Miki, [[/s][PMMM spoilers]]. Words fail me when trying to describe this thing, but just know that it will always be one of my all-time favorites. The original designs of the Witches and Labyrinths are extremely impressive, creatively speaking, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. Here's the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sayakaquest-story-only-thread.9401/][Story Only Thread]], which has all the material for the first 10 parts, and you can find the rest in the index on the first page.

- *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema-story-only.9091/][Puella Magi Adfligo Systema]]* - Another Madoka Magica quest. This one's by far the most popular quest on the list, amassing a huge regular following and sitting as the largest quest thread on the entire website by a comfortable margin. Story starts with a girl named Sabrina waking up in the streets of the Madoka-verse in critical condition. She cannot remember anything about her past, but does have full knowledge of all Madoka canon, including the Walpurgisnacht and the whole Incubator system, and is determined to stop the incoming disaster from happening. The writing of this one is really quite fantastic, and the questers have done a pretty good job with everything so far.

*** Backing up the recs for PMAS and SayakaQuest. The latter is shounen but in a good way. The former is surprisingly scientific in the way the players interact with the world and the writer works very hard to make the world react realistically. Obviously since I help out with Marked for Death I can't exactly give a non-biased rec but I've certainly been enjoying it.

Maybe I should look into A Man's Dream, since it's being recced alongside 3 other things that I enjoy.

***** There's a few I've enjoyed though I'd hesitate to call them rational. I'd only fullheartedly rec the first, though I did enjoy the other three.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/alchemical-solutions-worm-exalted-thread-21-unsuspecting-union-undergoes-unfortunate-upset.23984/page-186#post-5608380][Alchemical Solutions]] is of high quality and rather long, though sadly has gone without an update these past 5 months. It's on its 21st thread at the minute. Does a very good job of melding Worm with Exalted, and characters manage to act very believably. Definitely recommend.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/asukaquest-final-thread-i-told-you-so.1436/][Asuka Quest]] by the same person who wrote SayakaQuest is essentially more of the same if you enjoyed that story. Story is complete.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-gardens-of-enoch-terrascape-academy.25206/][The Gardens of Enoch]] has high quality writing but suffers from serial escalation problems as the writer seems to be bribing the playerbase with constant powerups. It's like a bag of gummy bears: nice while it lasts but not completely filling. Updates at least once a week so far.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/witch-quest.232691/][Witch Quest 1]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/witch-quest-thread-two.247174/][2]]. The adorable story of a not very smart Witch-magical girl in PMMM who gets in funny misunderstandings, makes friends, and dies repeatedly. Fun, but dead.

****** Thanks. I'm actually almost done with AsukaQuest, though it isn't nearly as good as SayakaQuest, as a lot of the latter's problems are amplified in this one.

Already following Gardens of Enoch due to it being Rihaku, though just reading updates and not actively following the debates. The prologue and Imperia are the best parts about it, so it's at least worth keeping up to date with. The way it's run does have huge problems though, I agree.

Read Witch Quest ages ago, and did like it, but it died so not much point anymore.

I am hesitant to check out a quest that's on indefinite hiatus, but I will if I run out.

** Some fun pieces of original fiction available for free on [[http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top][Project Gutenberg]], in no particular order... (The word counts are somewhat incorrect, since I haven't bothered to remove Project Gutenberg's headers and footers from most of the files.)

- The D'Artagnan Romances (1m words): /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][The Three Musketeers]]/ (233k words) is a very fun action story, and Project Gutenberg's translation of it is nicely lively. Its translations of the other books in the series ([[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259][1]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609][2]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681][3]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710][4]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759][5]]) aren't the best, nor are those stories' plots quite as entertaining (so much court intrigue!)--but they're still interesting to read.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1840][The Financier]]/ (198k words) is an extremely interesting story that details the rise of a prominent Philadelphian banker in the middle of the nineteenth century. Irksomely, however, in [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3629][the sequel]] the protagonist seems merely to repeat the errors that he committed in the first book; I've twice failed to complete it.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/86][A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]/ (122k words): A nicely-funny story about a person's attempting to bring technology into medieval England.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145][Ben-Hur]]/ (202k words): A surprisingly-fun historical novel that doesn't get boring until it starts in the later chapters to deal with the religious stuff that the reader was expecting to show up much sooner. "Down Eros, up Mars!"\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10007][Carmilla]]/ (31k words): A nice little vampire story.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345][Dracula]]/ (164k words): A longer vampire story.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/829][Gulliver's Travels]]/ (107k words): Fun sojourns in fantastical locations.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32528][The Lusiads]]/ (165k words): An epic poem for /Portugal!/\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/558][The Thirty-Nine Steps]]/ (44k words): A fun little adventure story.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39858][Trilby]]/ (106k words): Mind control in the nineteenth century.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5231][The Way We Live Now]]/ (358k words): British aristocrats being unbearably stupid. (I cringed out at the end of Chapter Forty-Nine, personally.)\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/972][The Devil's Dictionary]]/ (64k words): Humorous "definitions" for many words.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/82][Ivanhoe]]/ (196k words): An /extremely/-awesome piece of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe#Historical_accuracy][historical]]" fiction, featuring John Lackland and Robert Locksley as major players.

*** I'll second the recommendation for the Dumas books (Three musketeers and the rest of the books). They're a lot of fun and the historical aspects of it is well researched for the most part (there are some editions with a lot of footnotes detailing the historical aspects which are great).

Ivanhoe is also a great read.

Outside of Project Guntenberg, if you're interested in historical fiction, I recommend Azincourt by Bernard Cornwell

** I'm going to trust to the idea that there's some inscrutable similarity of thought pattern between people reading here, and that things I like that aren't necessarily "rational" will have good odds of also being things you might like... so these might be a bit all over the place. I figure that's more interesting than rounding up the HPMOR continuation-fics again.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_Time_Travel][/Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel/]]

Not sure how easy it is to find a copy to watch, but it will be a fun time for anyone who enjoys time travel movies and comedy. What with it being a comedic time travel movie. No promises with regards to the absence of plot holes, except that I was too busy enjoying it to notice them.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/user/lindybeige/videos?flow=list&view=0&sort=da][A youtuber going by lindybeige]]

I've recently been enjoying working my way slowly through the back catalog of videos from this guy - he talks a lot about medieval/ancient weapons and tactics, with emphasis on the fact that most fighters from the period would have been quite invested in staying alive. So contrary to Hollywood opinion, one doesn't [[https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://i.imgur.com/agtRUV9.gifv][rush in recklessly]]; great care is taken to avoid the pointy bits of enemy weapons where possible.

Endearing old-school-youtube style of turning on the camera then going on a bit of a rambling discourse with tangents, while frequently saying "I should really start scripting these" and "I forgot a bit from last time, here's one more point on that". Also occasionally talks about swing dance and other matters, because he is a man of many interests (but those can be easily spotted and skipped if you're not into that).

- /Better Call Saul/

Has been my TV program of choice lately, is pretty good from a "creative solutions to problems" stand-point, and also excellent from a "cinematography and general TV-making" standpoint. Doesn't /require/ having seen /Breaking Bad/ but as a prequel it will make more sense that way, and also Breaking Bad is very good so I feel no qualms suggesting you watch that too.

** I really enjoy reading Jonathan Strahan's /[[http://www.solarisbooks.com/post/575][The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year]]/ anthologies. Here are two of the memorable stories from last years anthology which are available for free courtesy of tor.com:

/[[http://www.tor.com/2014/05/28/the-insects-of-love-genevieve-valentine/][The Insects of Love]]/ by Genevieve Valentine: One sister goes disappears into the desert, the other tries to piece together her life to find out why. Her journey is complicated by multiple realities and a lack of clarity about what's real and what isn't. The end is left open to interpretation, but I think clever readers are intended to figure out a specific timeline/history (I'm apparently only half-clever, and am hoping some of you will read this and discuss theories about what happens!).

/[[http://www.tor.com/2014/04/02/the-devil-in-america-kai-ashante-wilson/][The Devil in America]]/ by Kai Ashante Wilson: A story about a black family living tinged with magic, living in the American south in 1877, and their daughter that makes a deal with the devil. This story is pretty racially charged and gets graphic, but is a good read. I really enjoy settings like this (and other things like O Brother, Where Art Thou? and the first season of True Detective) because they tend to feature a really sinister form of evil that I find both terrifying and riveting.

I would write more but am about to board my plane!
