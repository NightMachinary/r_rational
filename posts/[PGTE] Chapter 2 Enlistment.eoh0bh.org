** This so good. Anyone notice he has one good eye and one eye that shines blue? Now who does this remind you of? A certain someone that told Cat she will forge a groove for the necessary villain into creation.

The callback to Kairos is so fucking good.

**** “I find it most amusing that your good intentions will haunt this world for centuries to come, if you truly win,” the Tyrant grinned. “Ah, the necessary villain. The hard woman making the hard decisions when trouble has come calling and all others are flinching from what simply /must be done./ I wonder how many atrocities will be poured out of that mould in years to come simply because you scratched that groove deep enough onto the fabric of Creation.”

I took this from the pgte subreddit, so i dont have the chapter number, but i think its late in book 5.

** Objectively speaking, the kid saved thousands of lives by sacrificing about a hundred. Given that he couldn't make them listen (and what village elder will listen to a petulent child?), he did do the right thing.

But he can never know that. To know that his atrocity was the best he could have done, given the circumstance, would lead him into the same trap Tariq has fallen into: that of thinking such atrocities are always justified. Only unlike Tariq, the Scorched Apostate will never have the whispers of the Ophanim to moderate that conviction.

And so, he will become another Catherine, rather than another Tariq. He will continue to make hard choices, continue to do what will turn out for the best, but he will always have that little ball of doubt in the back of his mind. He will always wonder if it could have been done better, if only a better person, a better tool for the job, had been there. He will always wonder if fewer had to die, had fate seen fit to send a finer tool than him. But he will never see that musing such counterfactuals is pointless, for the world he lives in is the one where he, with his gifts, was sent. He /must/ never see that, lest he become convinced that his way is always right.

That way lies the Throne of the Dread Empire.

*** The one time we were in the thoughts of a named coming into one, (Catherine in the first book) we got this thought bubble.

#+begin_quote
  Awareness flooded back into me. I was Catherine Foundling, daughter of no one and nothing. I'd fought people for gold once, but earned only silver. I'd taken lives, and justice had come for me with a sword that cried like a grieving man. I was apprenticed to a monster but dreamed of making a world without them. A traitor to all causes but my own, and my path had brought me to this moment: bleeding out on the floor, surrounded by fire.

  The other claimants were all dead, and I was the Squire.

**** We also get a little perspective from Wekesa becoming Warlock: "Eventually he was able to see again, and he felt his Name fill like a glass of wine " though that doesn't tell us a hell of a lot.

***** It seems that, for free as part of the process, a Named gets to know their Name(-tag) label, which the Gods chose rather than the Named themselves; and their Aspects and a broad outline of what their Aspects can do, which may just amount to knowing the definition of the Aspect's label word.

So PGtE to some extent averts the “experiment with my powers to figure out what I can do” trope (though Cat and Amadeus and a few others are presented as highly experimental) and definitely “pick a superhero name for myself” trope.

As the Scorched Apostate discovered, they /don't/ know which specific God(s) (have any individual Gods ever been mentioned?) granted the Name or necessarily what their “marching orders” are except as implied by Name and Aspects.

Suppose someone comes into the example Name of Winged Fury. According to my model above they know that Name, and they know their Aspects: *Fly*, *Seize*, and *Rend*. Presumably *Fly* happened at their “moment of truth”, maybe they took a leap of faith off a cliff. They manifest wings and inherently know how to operate those wings, but not necessarily exactly how fast they can fly, how high, what happens if they fall or crash-land, etc. They are aware that they can manifest talons with which to *Seize* but do not necessarily know their weight limit to lift or how that affects their flight speed and maneouverability. They do not know what types of armour or hard objects they can *Rend* through.

****** They don't know their aspects in the beginning. They discover them when they come into them, seemingly prompted by their nature and a need or desire. That's my take on what we have seen with Cat, Hakram, and Masego, anyway. There's no indication they knew what their aspects would be in advance.

******* OK. So from an RPG perspective (and PGtE is very heavily influenced by the FATE RPG), the Name is initally character knowledge, and the Aspects are initially player knowledge but become character knowledge once the player works with the GM to create a scene revealing them.
