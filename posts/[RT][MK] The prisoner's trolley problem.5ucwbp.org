** This doesn't look like rational fiction to me - maybe post it in the off-topic or general rationality thread?

*** Probably should have been tagged [D] instead of [RT], but I think this deserved its own thread on the basis that it was, after all, posted in its own thread to begin with.

** I noticed this while idly checking out [[/r/goldandblack]] and thought it was an interesting problem to solve.

I took a stab [[https://np.reddit.com/r/GoldandBlack/comments/5uag3p/introducing_the_prisoners_trolley_problem/ddssone/][here]] to try and figure it out with game theory, but I'm iffy about how well I did. What do you guys think?

*** There's a solution none of the comments there seem to have come up with... why don't you just establish a state to enforce mutual cooperation?

**** I actually addressed that-- option 3, the utilitarian God Emperor.

Of course, that was posted in [[/r/GoldandBlack]], the anarcho-capitalist subreddit, so I don't think they'll be particularly in favour :P.

***** Ah, you're not from there? I was going to give you shit.

An ancap would have talked about voluntary social contracts and enforcement organizations and then I would have told them "son, what you're describing there is a state", and then they would have been enlightened.
