Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I'm trying to work out the inciting incident of a novel idea.

In this high fantasy world, many of the nobles are given magical superpowers by ingesting an herb. They have used these powers for centuries to fight off monsters in order to allow civilization to develop. The commoners are kept in the dark about the existence of the herb and led to believe that the powers are genetic in order to keep the nobility in power.

The MC is a peasant who, through some occurence, eats or otherwise ingests this herb and gains powers. Then the bulk of the plot happens while he goes to magic military school.

How could this happen? All of the noble families would have some access to the herb, but they'd probably have it locked up tight. I have an idea where the MC would have a friend who is in the nobility but still, I'm not sure how he'd get the herb, because even the kids wouldn't readily have it since it's so valuable.

*** Plants get everywhere. If they are growing the herb, its going to show up outside the secret gardens.

Any peasants who manage to get accidentally exposed can easily be assumed to be some nobles byblow, possibly even a generation or two back. "Yes, old sir Reg, got around, yes he did".

The real problem is that you need most of the nobility to not actually know the truth either, or you are violating entirely basic tenets of information control. You cant have an entire social class keep a secret and not have it leak. I mean, sure, you get secret jews, and the like, but people damn well knew there /were/ secret jews, even if they did not know the list of names.

Simplest is to have a religious or civil rite when the children of nobility are inducted into the school and put it in the ritual wine.

#+end_quote

This gets suspicious if everyone is gaining their powers at around the same time right after drinking the wine, whether they're good or bad students, and despite nearly a year of age difference between the oldest and youngest.

A better way to do it would be to make it an individualized ritual that is supposedly a celebration of each students' development of powers. For example, after completing some minimum education, students continue their schooling but begin to be tested on a daily basis. The test consists of an interviewer rolling six six-sided dice behind a screen. The student is asked to meditate and draw upon their knowledge of the unknowable to say each of the six numbers that came up. Though that may sound quite difficult, it's actually just 1/462 probability, and there's a 55% chance of getting it right within a year or less.

When the student passes this test, it is believed that they have begun to develop their powers, but it is not certain. Very rarely, we are told, pure random chance will cause students to pass the dice test when they are still unprepared for the dangers and rigors of magical training. To ensure the accuracy of the test, each month there will be a gathering of the students who have passed at the institute of magical studies. They will line up in order of age, with the oldest at the front, and go before the headmaster. The headmaster will ask each prospective student to drink a glass of poison to prove their readiness. In people with these magical powers, we are told, the poison will cause them no harm at all. In those who are not ready, the poison will make them sick but generally will not kill them.

In the background, the headmaster's office receives copies of records on the behavior and performance of each student from the noble schools on a monthly basis. When a student passes the dice test, the headmaster reviews their records to see if they really should be getting magical powers. If they've been getting disciplined for bullying or aggressive behavior, they could become a danger to others if they had magical powers. If they're doing poorly in their classes and demonstrating slow mental development, they could be a danger to themselves with magical powers. In either case, the poor candidates will get a low dose of foxglove while the good candidates will get a dose of the magic herb.

With this approach, it makes it seem like there's probably some amount of intrinsic power in each student before we involve consuming any substances, and the only substance that people consume is a poison which does seem to sicken some students while leaving the truly magically-gifted students unharmed.

*** Well if it's a herb, it can probably be found naturally. Perhaps it's usually quite poisonous and the powers granted by the non-domesticated strain are generally weak enough that the few people crazy enough to eat it don't notice, but for whatever reason he mistook it for another plant, ate it, and it happened to be either a mutant of the non-domesticated variety (if you want to grant him aberrant powers), or simply an isolated patch of the domesticated variety, the result of a long-ago cultivation effort that failed and was improperly cleaned up.

*** - The MC finds a centuries-old book on herbology that survived the information purge about the herb.
- The herb is dangerous and carries a risk of adverse reactions in addition to superpowers; the MC works as a gravedigger and notices the odd smell of the herb on the corpses of several noble children, all at the same age, and decides to investigate.
- The MC moonlights as a smuggler or courier and is tasked with delivering a dose of the herb; he is accosted by city guards or bandits respectively and eats the herb to destroy the evidence. Now the MC has to work out what happened and deal with both the sender and receiver of the herb being disappointed.
- A local noble was testing different strains of the herb on kidnapped local peasants, mostly with lethal effects, and the MC was lucky enough to both survive and then escape. Now the MC has at least one enemy, and his first ally is only interested in the MC's use as blackmail material against the noble.
- A noble is mortally wounded protecting the MC from monsters and chooses to give the MC a dose of the herb so that he can survive the next wave of monsters, on the condition that he maintains the secret and enters the service of the noble's family.
- A local figure is secretly a noble who was exiled or faked their death and acts as a paternal figure to the MC; they decide to give the MC both the herb and their desire for revenge.
- There are indicators for one's affinity to the herb and the MC is an extreme outlier; consequently a noble chooses to adopt the MC and pass him off as a full-blooded son of the family.

Surely it gets securely transported around the kingdom at times, and it could get attacked by a larger-than-expected threat (bandits, monsters, foreign army scouts), leaving an abandoned bloody cart with a well-hidden herb.

****** Probably the easiest way to do this would be to have some sort of red herring. One of my favorite "red herring" approaches is to disguise solutions/boons as problems/ailments.

Something like: protag eats herb, gets sick. Showing up for the first day of field training with dysentery doesn't escape the notice of the health officer/medic/whoever is responsible for such things; the doc gives protag a tonic to assist with his recovery. Since the doc isn't quite sure what's causing the ailment, and protag seems to be suffering (almost to the point where he might be fatally sick), doc decides to go with a drug cocktail, mixing a dozen of his most potent remedies.

After 24 hours of bedridden night terrors and cold sweats, protag wakes up and over the coming days discovers that he has some new magical powers. Now, which conclusion seems more logical: a) the green thing that made me terribly sick also gave me powers, or b) gee, doc must have put some powerful stuff in that drug cocktail.

This could potentially send protag (or others) on a chase, trying to discover the cause of his new powers: which of the 12 ingredients in the drug cocktail gave him these powers? Given that all 12 ingredients have been used without any recorded instance of the recipient receiving powers, it's likely that it wasn't any /one/ drug, but a combination of drugs interacting in unexpected ways...cue someone creating a chart and trying to figure out all of the possible combinations of ingredients. Someone (protag, or his friends, or doc) might take to experimenting in his off-time, trying to re-create whatever it was that gave him his powers.

****** Oh, you definitely could. How much you want to foreshadow it is up to you, but if you wanted relatively little foreshadowing, you would probably open with the herb being gathered in a way that's incidental to the scene as a whole, then the transformation and/or gaining of power looking (from a narrative standpoint) as though it's just the normal inciting incident that everyone expects.

Why /those/ herbs at /that/ time is an interesting question for our protagonist, who was ... taking a longer path in their foraging than usual? Being unusually experimental in what they put in their stew? Watched an animal eat the herb? Ended up starving right next to the rotted out cart? But that's nothing insurmountable. How much attention you draw to the herb determines how much the reveal gets foreshadowed.

** I'm currently working on an urban fantasy/superhero setting I'm tentatively calling the Mythosverse, which I'll probably have to change to something more distinctive at some point. Its mechanics are inspired by quite a few different works, most notably the Parahumans series, Pact, Shadows of the Limelight, and Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere setting.

​

The essential premise is that perception is a force, with thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and perceptions being reflected in a sort of 'psychic plane' called the Narrative. As more and more complex social intelligences evolved, the beings inhabiting it became more and more complex in turn. With the dawn of humanity came an entire ecosystem of narrative patterns, colloquially referred to as the Fae. The most powerful of the Fae are the gods, demons, spirits, heroes and monsters that we all love, hate, worship or fear. Broad, vague concepts are spread too thin and drawn from by too many beings to have any real agency of their own. More specific narratives concentrated the power and could have personalities of their own, projected onto them by their believers.

​

The vast majority of Fae have little influence on physical reality, able to mess with perceptions a little and move small objects but not much else. They essentially only think if they are perceived to think, and the bottom rungs of thinking Fae are made up of abandoned imaginary friends, toys, characters from books that were never written, distorted caricatures of people and the like. Fae feed off of the perceptions and attention of living beings much like plants feed off of sunlight. Every person is reflected in the narrative, since even if we never talk to anyone we still perceive ourselves. Our own perceptions of ourselves could be called a soul, a living record of every thought and feeling we've ever had making up the core of our narrative pattern. Unlike Fae, living creatures can always avoid being swept up in the tides of the narrative regardless of how they're perceived, but this comes at the cost of losing the power those perceptions granted them.

​

As more and more narrative power is concentrated in one pattern they are increasingly able to effect the world, the ability to affect perceptions gradually pushing more and more towards directly warping reality; it should be noted that this directly burns up their very beings as fuel and can only be used in thematically appropriate ways. Before the dawn of human history there was a vast and terrible war between the gods that threatened to destroy the Earth and all its children. In a last act of desperation the cooler headed among them enacted a plan to seal those unwilling to cooperate in a prison outside of reality where nothing existed and nothing could exist. They created a veil between reality and the narrative, preventing all but a tiny few from perceiving or interacting with the Fae and punishing those Fae that threatened to reveal the existence of the Narrative to the remnants of humanity. The gods then retreated to other worlds or pocket realities of their own creation, bringing or creating living beings to worship them and preventing all out war with treaties and careful doling out of power to trusted subordinates.

​

Earth was left fallow and humanity slowly began to rebuild, almost entirely unaware of what they had lost. The Fae that remained were left in the margins, forced to seek out attention in subtler ways lest the Veil devour them and erase the evidence of their meddling. From there history goes along as it did in our world, Earth's population increasing exponentially as technology advanced. It wasn't meant to last.

​

On January 1, 2000, people began to spontaneously develop powers in moments of life-altering trauma, loss, change, or triumph. Eventually dubbed 'Allohumans' by science, and 'Abhumans' by their detractors, these extraordinary people have slowly begun breaking down the Veil by opening the public's eyes to the extraordinary. Unbeknownst to them, the source of their abilities was none other than the Forgotten Gods long sealed away by their kin. A foolish, greedy trickster opened just a crack in their prison in the hopes of accessing the vast power hidden within, but that was all it took for them to burst forth and wreak terrible vengeance on those that imprisoned them. They were mad, broken, driven to horrific extremes by millennia of endless, pointless conflict and struggle with one another, desperate beyond all else to affect the world again and fulfill the purposes instilled in them by their believers.

​

The Veil stood strong against their attempts to warp the world directly, made easier by their utter inability to cooperate or coordinate with each other in any meaningful way. But some among them were clever enough to find a workaround, realizing that the gods had left an allowance for empowering their followers. They sought out people with circumstances and temperaments compatible with their goals, waiting for just the right moment to reach out and connect with them. Not merely granting Narrative power, but partially merging with them and carving channels into their mind, body, and reality itself in order to facilitate specific abilities normally beyond the reach of any but the most powerful Fae or wielders of Fae magic. Allohumans have two paths for growing their powers, either pursuing the purpose of their divine fragment and being rewarded for it or by receiving attention and belief from people directly. No matter how famous you get you're not going to spontaneously develop new, unrelated powers, just get better at the ones you already have.

​

The story starts in 2016, right when the first second-generation allohumans are starting to come on the scene. The Veil hasn't broken down completely yet, but the existence of many things once thought mythological have come to light like the existence of Atlantis or the presence of a Martian civilization. My question is essentially just how society would try to adapt to the existence of allohumans, and how the incentives inherent in how powers work might shape Cape culture and society at large. I should note that there's no direct equivalent to the Parahuman's series 'conflict drive', so there's nothing preventing allohumans from using their power to build infrastructure or heal people if it's good for that sort of thing. They tend to get into conflict regardless, as the goals their powers reward them for pursuing are almost universally incompatible with each other in at least some small way.

**** Strength is hard to quantify for such a wide variety of abilities, but generally powers are always at least somewhat useful and always have some kind of limitation or blindspot. For every defense there's an offense capable of penetrating it and vice versa, if a power is harder to block or more devastating it generally acts on a smaller scale or has some kind of limitation or set-up, for every extra-sensory ability there's another capable of hiding from or disrupting it. There are also powers that effect powers or allow the granting of minor, temporary abilities.

​

Essentially a sort of balance is achieved by there being no single winning strategy, regardless of how much raw power you have.

​

Edit: Something to note is that if an allohuman doesn't bother cultivating their power at all through fame or by pleasing their divine fragment it will slowly lose its potency over time until it's only a tiny fraction of its original strength as it's forced to rely on only your soul for power.

His actions and influence have strongly affected people's perceptions of allohumans.

Not long after a woman going by Professor Silica popped up, with the ability to enhance herself through technology and create energy weapons. She's all about embodying the corny silver-age villain aesthetic to the point where it's basically a pathology.

Signing up with them isn't like signing up with the military or anything, it's essentially a deal to follow certain guidelines in exchange for resources and occasional legal assistance. AAMS has a number of allohumans working for it, though they tend to be a great deal subtler than most.

*** How does the attention/fame part work? Do you get "points" for fame and infamy or only the former? Could a villain send out a heinous tweet (or the AU alternative) the night before enacting their master plan and receive a power boost from the increased media attention? If so, I could see this generating something like the reverse of "virtue signaling" in the villain community, with all sorts of interesting consequences throughout society. If this move was used too often people would begin to see everything capes do as mere posturing. It would also likely incentivize villains to be as odious as possible and would put the media in a particularly bad situation were covering the content would help their ratings but they would literally be supporting the criminals they covered and potentially liable for future crimes as a result. A consequence of this is that the media may refuse to give platforms to capes, which could drive capes into the arms of governments since social media would have been one of their best options for making money independently (this is especially true for heroes). A company willing to produce a neutral platform for both heroes and villains with an untraceable way of paying their content creators would likely be in very high demand as a reaction to government gaining more power over capes. I can also see an industry forming around high quality (perhaps by drones) footage of cape fights.
