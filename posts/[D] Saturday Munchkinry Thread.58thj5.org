Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Reverse munchkin:

It is currently 11:00PM. Suppose that you are told that tomorrow, at 7:00 AM, someone will gain the ability to go back in time, Groundhog's Day style, every time they die, and that this ability cannot only be activated by dying. This time looping power will send them back to their "checkpoint", the moment they first gained the power.(ie. 7:00 AM tomorrow.) They will also be fully aware of their power and how to use it. Their goal is to kill you at least 10 times out of 100 years of subjective loop time, or else the god that granted them their power will devour their soul. If they succeed, then the moment of your death will become their new "checkpoint", and they will be able to use their power forever without any restrictions. Basically, they're on a time limit, ironically enough.

You, of course, will not be able to remember any of their previous time loops if they use their power. Your only advantages are:

1: You know how their power works, and when they will get it. This information was given to you by a separate god. The only other advantage this god has or will give you is 10 hours' worth of rest concentrated into a single moment, which instantly refreshes your mind so that you can prepare properly.

2: They start the loops unaware that you know this information. This means that they will start the loops unaware that you are aware of their ability and their desire to kill you. This means that they will likely underestimate you in earlier loops, but less so in later loops.(assuming, of course, that they haven't tortured the info out of you in a previous loop yet, which is always a possibility. Keep in mind that the more experienced they seem, the more loops they have likely lived through, and the more likely it is that this has already happened.)

Your goal is to, of course, convince them to rebel against their god, and/or survive for 100 years worth of time looping. You have 8 hours to cook up as many anti-timelooper protocols of engagement, plans, contingencies, and preparations for yourself before they gain their power.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that you always start every loop unaware of how many previous loops have occurred, what happened in those loops, etc. Only your opponent is aware of this info, and that if you want to find out, you must come up with a plan to get them to truthfully tell you the information while simultaneously accounting for the possibility of them already knowing about your plan due to you executing it in a previous loop. This basically applies to any and all plans you come up with. Also keep in mind that they're limited by the amount of total time they spend looping,(100 years) not the number of times that they loop, so there's no advantage to them living out each loop to the maximum possible duration.

***** If that's the case, this is really easy. Just figure out a way to get a huge amount of explosives and plant them around his house. Then, set them to explode exactly 1 second after the time loop starts. Looper spends 100 subjective years being blown apart every second.

Edit: I just realized I suggested going full Grey Boy on him. Ouch.

Also, explosives aren't the best method. If you know exactly when the time loop starts, you just need to break into the guy's house and shoot/decapitate him the moment it starts.

Also, neither of you will learn the location or identity of the other until 7:00 AM, because otherwise you'd just be able to assassinate them before they gained their powers, which is too easy.

******* All right, now it gets more interesting.

I'm going to take chaos theory as true for the purposes of this solution. My basic plan is to drive as far as I can in 8 hours, then about two hours after the loops start use Random.org to choose a random direction to go. Their random numbers are chosen based on fluctuations in radio waves, which are sufficiently chaotic that different actions by the looper should result in different directions for me to go.

Now he can't find me. I erase all traces of myself online, ditch this phone, and start somewhere else. The primary advantage of this strategy is forcing him to find me somewhere new in each loop.

*** Step one: Attempt to force divergence in some way.

It's probably fairly straightforward to get myself and my alternate to diverge somewhat, especially if we /try/ to diverge. Then we can attempt to leverage divergence in others, by interacting with them in different ways.

Now, normal trading between the two worlds won't help much. Both worlds have the same resources, the same needs. Of course, that doesn't mean that trade is /impossible/. It just means that what we trade needs to be /information/.

So, step two: Force profitable divergences.

Talk to people whose currency is /ideas/. Physicists, open-source programmers, scientists in general. Provide means for them to collaborate with their alternates (I can easily run a network cable through the portal, though I might need to talk to an ISP about a high-capacity line once this picks up enough). They can either work together, or agree with their alternates to each pursue a different strategy.

Research (both in general and into multiple universes in particular) gets a massive boost.

Also, by creating a portal and collapsing it at will, I can pretty much cut anything, though that seems less useful at first glance.

*** I live in Universe A. My parallel lives in Universe B. Therefore, since both universes are identical, me and my parallel must be identical.

What this means is that every time I use my power to create a portal in a given location in my universe, my parallel will create a perfectly identical copy of my portal at the exact same time, at the corresponding location in his universe. If I then walk into my portal to come out of his portal in his universe, he will also simultaneously walk through his portal to come out of my portal in my universe. All this really does is allow me and my parallel to switch locations, and since we are, for all intents and purposes, identical, this has no effect on the universes.

In other words, it is impossible for the universes to diverge, assuming that they are deterministic. The portals are essentially magic hoops that do nothing.

You could fix this by making it so that me and my parallel are explicitly divergent for some nebulous reason, despite the rest of the universe being identical. If that was the case, then the universes would begin to diverge almost immediately. Although, if this is the case, I have to ask, what is my parallel's personality like? Are they an evil doppelganger archetype with a total blue-orange morality, or something more like an identical twin?

Since no information can leave the Box, the explosion inside the Box will have no effect. When you remove the Box, you get a cloud of smoke, which is a whole lot better than the original explosion.

Do you have to be present to create the Box? If you can do so over long range, i.e. via a TV broadcast, then it becomes even more powerful.

Since it's totally impermeable, it also makes a great shield. Hmmm... and since information cannot leave the Box, you can use it to sneak metallic objects past a metal detector (look, my box doesn't make your detector beep).

Therefore, the inside of the box cannot experience acceleration. (Because if the inside of the box can experience acceleration, then it gains the information of the direction that said acceleration is happening in).

/Therefore/, the inside of the box cannot experience /gravity/. The environment inside the box must perforce be weightless.

*Therefore*, if the box has any appreciable height, I can use it to generate free energy.

I have an apparatus consisting of a wooden pole holding up a magnet, and a heavy iron weight - too heavy for the magnet to hold up. I enclose them in a black box. Free of the Earth's gravitational field, the magnet pulls the weight up... and then I dismiss the box, and the weight comes crashing down again.

Apparently boxes portal cut things upon appearance. I suspect an easier form of bomb disposal is to cut the bomb in order to remove critical elements.

Presumably when I portal fut something with the box it cuts enough space for the box to fit, which means the outer dimensions of the box. Unless the walls are infinitely thin there will be a certain amount of mass that is overlapping the walls. What happens to that mass?

Edit: how precise is the cut? ie, how smooth are the edges of the box / the edges of the cut?

******* You said information can't enter the box, which means there's no way to put anything in it other than to have the box appear around the object. Now, someone down below mentioned that objects inside the box cannot experience acceleration.

- Can the box be moved while there is something inside it?\\
- Suppose I create a box around a falling object, bring the box to a halt, then allow the box to disappear. The object reappears. What is its velocity?
- Suppose I make the box appear around a battery-powered video camera+flashlight combination. I move the box around, then let it disappear. The camera+flashlight reappear. What is on the camera?

Edit: What is the perceived mass of the box? Presumably it does not vary depending on what I created it around. This sounds like a great way to launch dense materials into orbit.

******** The mass of the box does depend on what is inside it initially. That doesn't count as information moving through the surface, since the surface formed around the contents.

The box can be moved, though as described before its behavior is odd.

If you form the box around a fast moving object, the halt the box's movement, then allow it to disappear, the object will also be halted, and depending on the exact initial velocity may also be noticeably hotter.

In the case of a video camera and flashlight, I think that all the camera would record is the light beam refracting off of whatever air was inside the box along with the camera, before hitting blackness at the inner faces of the box.

So time passes inside the box. Good to know. That does mean that I can extract data, though -- put two things inside, one of which is a camera. When they reappear I will have seen the effects on the other object.

Actually, you said that the inside of the box was pure black and the box itself is a horizon. That implies that photons that hit the box disappear. If so, that makes it a perfect heat sink.

******** The case of losing an arm does not change the size of the box. Your arm span at the time of gaining the power is remembered and not changed.

The smallest box you can create is the smallest box your unaided eyes can resolve at the time of gaining your power. This value is also remembered.

The placement of the box is always always within arm's reach, as per the remembered value of arm span.

Then the object is scrambled in a random configuration of particles that is legal and which conserves energy, quantum numbers, and so on.
