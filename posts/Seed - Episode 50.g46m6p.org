** I really hope Emma's emotional outburst didn't do something like give Turry permission to lie.

*** Its basicly a webcomic about a girl who is contacted by a powerful ai called Turry. As of yet the story has focused mostly on the impact this has had on her personal life with a subplot focusing on the long term aims and goals of the ai and its creators. What these are is as of yet unclear.

The chief Rational thing about it would be its so far realistic depiction of what an actual ai might be like and avoidance of many of the common tropes about them which seems to derive a lot from ideas that Eliezer has discussed. I don't know to what extent if any the writer considers it a rational work. I haven't come across anywhere where he says so. In certain ways it isn't particularly typically rational. The protaganist, Emma, for example, isn't what you would call a typical rational protaganist although I think she is a well done character.

**** I would say that she's "rational" in the sense that she mostly acts like a real human being and doesn't seem to take actions for the sole purpose of advancing the plot. She isn't a "rationalist" character that some popular stories on this sub have. In my mind, rational fiction doesn't mean hyper smart characters that behave according to rational tropes and ideas (that's rational/ist/ fiction), but is instead just fiction wher ethe rules are consistent and make sense and the characters act in reasonable, realistic ways according to their personalities and goals. This can sometimes include making objectively bad decisions informed by biases since real humans do that sometimes. It tries to avoid having people carry the idiot ball or otherwise do things solely because the plot requires it. In that way, one could argue that rational fiction is really just "well written" fiction, with rationalist fiction being a specific subset within that. So far, Seed seems to match those ideas pretty well, although that could change.

*** Even if this isn't a rationalist work, I think this story caters to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] crowd because it's probably /the/ hardest science fiction webcomic out there. The characters are also well-written and realistic, with most of them having fairly clear defined goals.

** Hmm. I wonder if turry has anything to do with this attack. He doesn't seem the sort to be interested in revenge (why on earth would that be programed into him) so his obvious motive for attcking Simplex would be to destro their ability to release another ai which may be something that could threaten him.

One thing I do wonder is if this story does ends in some kind of foom (such as in Friendship is optimal) or if it continues on a more personal note with the relationship between a girl and her ai. And if Turry is planning to go foom why is he interested in Emma. Is she a sort of guinea pig where he learns how to deal with humans. Untill the link between Simplex and Grandpa was revealed I assumed that but now I wonder if it is something more fundemental. Then again Grandpa was suprised when Turry contacted Emma so it isn't like he programmed it into her.

We already know it does. He literally coached the brown bearded guy on how to disable the fire alarm tech.

**** Oh of course. I somehow hadn't linked those two events in my mind. That is what happens when you are reading a series as it comes out and it is some time since you read the last episode. Why though. That is the question. Just to knock out a potential threat?
