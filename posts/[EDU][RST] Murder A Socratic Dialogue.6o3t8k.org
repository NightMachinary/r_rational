*** That has its own problems:

#+begin_quote
  Out of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months, name one that - because you consumed it - allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life, your career, your business - compared to what you would have known if you hadn't swallowed that morsel of news.
#+end_quote

That's bad for the same reason that LessWrong-style "is that your true rejection?" is bad: people often don't make decisions for a single reason. No single news item changes your decisions by a noticeable amount, but the cumulative weight of many news items may do so.

*** I actually agree with this one. The biggest problem with information gathering used to be a lack of availability. Nowadays we have the exact opposite: We have so much junk information flooding our systems, that it's impossible to effectively sort through all the information, [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-library-of-heaven][effectively making it so that each extra bit makes us less informed than before]].

The reason I still read the news is because if I don't know what /just/ happened, everybody else will think I'm an uninformed lout. But I far prefer to read a single encompassing piece that exhausts all of the arguments on both sides of a political issue, rather than having to sift through a hundred crappy opinion-pieces in search of one that has something worthwhile to contribute.

*** Ugh, that entire exchange frustrates me so much. Caplan says that the left hates free markets. EY comes to the rescue and says "no no, the left doesn't /hate/ free markets - they're just too stupid to understand them!" Thanks a bunch, mr. rationalist.

Here, let me try my hand at defining the two sides: The right is afraid of loss of socio-economic cohesion, i.e. as brought about through immigration or radical policies. The left is excited about the potential for socio-economic progress, i.e. as brought about through income redistribution and social justice. One side is young and intuitively risk-taking, the other tends to be older and risk-averse.

And guess what? Both sides have an entirely valid point! Inviting a million unvetted refugees into America ala Germany really does sound incredibly stupid. There really is an income inequality problem in America, and there really is still systemic racism. What irritates me is that both sides constantly try to pretend that the other side's point doesn't even exist: "It's not that Trump voters are all racist - they're just sad that they don't get enough government handouts." The people linked to above somehow fail to understand /either/ perspective.

I'm starting to see why Yudkowsky wrote that politics is the mindkiller. Bloody hell.

** There's a fine line between a Socratic dialog and a straw man.

"Spartans are fellow Greeks, and Persians are not, so we should not do things to prevent Spartan crime that we should do to prevent Persian crime" does not imply that you can just redefine "Greek" and make the argument about anyone. "Greek" is a preexisting category; you don't get to pick what goes in it; and if you honestly think being a fellow Greek has no implications for how you should feel or act towards someone, you're not only weird, but weird in a way which only exists in Aspergers patients, sociopaths, and internet-rationalists.

It's also odd that Socrates says that he doesn't care much because he doesn't personally know the victims--why does he think that "personally know" is a meaningful reason to care but "is a fellow Greek" is not?

Also, if I take this argument literally, it's opposed to effective altruism. Socrates is arguing that he shouldn't care about all murders, not that he should care a lot about all murders.

** Caplan falls prey here to the classic consequentialist error: Looking only at absolutes instead of deltas. There is a vast difference between not allowing people into your country versus banishing them, just as there is a huge difference between not giving someone any money vs. giving it to them and then stealing it back a few years later. Under this very basic logic, rounding up all the Muslims in the country is wrong, but vetting your immigrants is a-ok.

It's a classic mistake made by both libertarians and liberals / democrats: "Why are you complaining? You have more money now than you used to! Why would you long for the past? You had less stuff then!" Yes, Ms. Democrat, and that's precisely the problem: It's not what you have right now, but whether or not things are getting better. Hope for the future is harder to measure than GDP, but it's a heck of a lot more important when it comes to happiness.

**** The problem with saying "America is already great - the stockmarket is doing fine" is not that there's a problem with the stockmarket, but that it completely fails to reach the average Trump voter, who are justifiably not excited by how well the stock market is doing.

Globalisation has been a huge boon for people in China, for example. And that's great. But you can't expect people in America who suffered from it to vote for you on that account. Making that argument just makes it seem like you're telling people you're not on their side.

****** Fun fact: Women's happiness has steadily declined since the 1970s. Also, there was like a five-fold increase in the imprisonment of black people between 1980 and 2000. Are you going to tell me it's racist to long for a time when people were happier, the media wasn't lying to you every day, politicians weren't all horrible like they are now, and the country wasn't fighting 6 wars at once for basically no reason?

Let me explain what I mean by the classic consequentialist error: Yes, it seems like you can increase total happiness by harvesting people's kidneys against their will and giving them to others who need it. But if you think about it for a second, it becomes obvious that this would not /actually/ result in better outcomes. In the same way, taking people's jobs and culture away from them and demanding that they're happy because others are doing better now could result in unintended consequences, i.e. Donald Trump being voted into office.

Listen, you just can't expect people to be Jesus. Most humans are selfish creatures who value themselves and their family first of all. If you design policy without taking that into account, you're going to be in for a rude awakening.

I'd be interested in seeing a source for that.

Edit: Forgot to address the bit about black imprisonment, and yes, that's pretty bad. At least we're moving towards an end to the "War on Drugs".

Back when it was just the Pentagon Papers and Watergate and Iran-Contra, or some other time when politicians weren't horrible and we weren't militarily involved elsewhere? Yellow journalism isn't new, either. Although I can believe that some people were happier, so I'll come back to that later. Some I know would attribute it to animus, though I'd argue rose-tinted goggles.

Doesn't that seem a little melodramatic? Sure, new jobs due to trade aren't necessarily in the same industry/location, but that's why (liberal, at least) consequentialists are arguing for retraining/relocation assistance and social safety nets. I'll confess I don't even know how to respond to the culture part.

Certainly I'm no Jesus, or I'd presumably sell all I have and give it to the poor. However, I do have some baseline expectation that people will realize that others are also worthy of moral consideration, even if they are strangers, or of a different ethnic group, or live far away. Atavism isn't necessarily bad, I suppose, but when it involves overlooking so many people's interests, let alone their rights, that is something I don't understand.

A quick google search for "woman's happiness" results in multiple corroborating sources. Also, if even the Hufflepuff Post admits it, I figure it's probably true.

The explanation for this is more ambiguous, of course. But Scott's "having to work sucks" sounds pretty logical to me.

I'm not saying things were ever perfect, but don't you think Nixon and Bush Sr. were better than the current batch of republicans? Nixon at least created the EPA, and now his party wants to destroy it. And at least with Watergate, people actually /cared/. Now it's like every day is worse than the last one.

You can argue that Nixon would have been even worse if the situation had allowed for it, but you can't help but see a declining line. Of course the irony is that this is precisely what empowers Trump, as he's supposed to be the 'fixer'.

To you and me, maybe, but there's a definite bubble going on here. People in the south have an honor culturue which is totally different from ours, somewhat similar to islamic honor culture in fact (though they'd hate to hear me say it). And the so-called coastal elites have been very systematically and intentionally working to destroy that way of life. I mean, we're literally tearing down their flags and statues. Can you imagine what that would look like if we did that to another country? Do you not see why this would cause people to feel attacked, and respond accordingly?

Try going to a Native American reserve, declare them to be a bunch of superstitious primitives, and tear down their religious icons. See how that goes over with the Left.

Ok, sure, but doing better in the future is not the same as being better right now. The point is that if you try to implement your ideal utopia right away, it's not going to work because people are going to balk at being forced to conform to your ideas. You can't just skip the step of having to actually convince people.
