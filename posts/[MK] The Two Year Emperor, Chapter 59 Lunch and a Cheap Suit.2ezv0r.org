** I hate gods.

If Arros' behaviour shows how the gods /normally/ treat humans who are on their side, Loki's been impossibly nice to Jake so far.

I think Loki has a more personal stake in this matter. If this was just the war between the gods, Team Life vs Team Death, then you'd expect all the Team Life gods to be equally helpful to the humans, modulo differences in personality. And the God Of Playing Cruel Pranks is not the one that you'd expect to be straightforward.

Either that or Arros doesn't care as much as Loki about the outcome of the war. Afi's minions have a lot of spellcasters among them, so Arros doesn't really stand to lose a lot if Team Life dies out. Not as much as the God of Chaos loses if everybody is replaced by mindless servants.

Yeah, that's probably it actually. Still, I'm keeping an eye on Loki's motivations. There's a lot we don't know.

I'm taking a somewhat non-standard view of Loki. In many of the myths he was a cruel, evil trickster, and he had a big hand in setting off Ragnarok. In some myths, he was an ally of humanity -- he taught them how to make fishing nets, for example.

The Loki I'm using leans more towards the later view, and is heavily mixed in with Coyote and other trickster gods. The "trickster is evil becuase plot" thing bores me; I wanted someone more mercurial and unpredictable.

There is at least one more major reveal related to the gods that will clarify your questions. Right now, I don't think I've given out enough information for people to reasonably figure out why everyone is doing the things they're doing. I promise I'll get there, though.

***** Why not? After all, if someone does enough legendary things, they become legends themselves. And it's a small step from praying that a god will save you to praying that the legendary hero (who lives just over that hill) will save you. Once you've had a 'Big Damn Heroes' moment a few times and saved the day for people who were praying you would (even if you didn't know they were)...well, at that point you're probably at least half-way towards having honest-to-you worshipers.

******* The gods most likely LOVE FLEA. FLEA gets lots of people up to high level, which means they don't need to be saved as much. That means they'll look to other people to save them far less. Also, it generates at least some clerics of different gods (though they are focusing on a single deity at the moment).

Lots of high-level people means that there's more powerful worshipers, and when level 60 people are common, it's a lot harder for a single person (or party) to become legendary.

Infinite Wish loops are a threat to the gods because they can produce a single mortal (or group of mortals) with improbable levels of power. Individuals or groups about whom tales will be told...and those tales are a form of power.

How many people will tell tales about how bravely Flobova shouted 'Reducio' to slaughter unsuspecting monsters in a trap that others prepared? Especially when there are 300 others who have the same story?

********* Basically. by far the most powerful divine ability "Alter Reality" is just wish at will with the restrictions cut off.

*Alter Reality*

*Prerequisite:*

Cha 29.

*Benefit:*

This ability is similar to the wish spell. The deity merely thinks of something and then makes it so. Doing this requires at least a standard action.

*Notes*

The deity can duplicate any spell of 9th level or lower as a standard action. The duplicated spell has no material or XP component, and the DC of its saving throw (if one is allowed) is 20 + the deity's rank + the deity's Charisma modifier.

The deity also can duplicate a spell with any metamagic feat (so long as the metamagic feat is available to characters of 20th level or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 round for each level that the feat would normally add to the spell. It still takes a standard action to use this ability, so there is no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell.

The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect: 10 minutes per level of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total Hit Dice of creatures affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value.

+The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like the Create Object ability (including the required rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.+

+The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using the Create Object ability except that all rest requirements are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the deity's own realm.+

+The deity can create temporary magic items or creatures. This works like the Divine Creation ability (including the required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot create permanent magic items or creatures.+

+The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of material to be reshaped requires 1 round of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube shaped after the work is completed.+

You'll notice I scratched out a lot of that. That's because it will never, ever be used. Because there is a spell, somewhere that does it better than that paragraph, and the deity can cast that spell with the ability.

I mean seriously, who writes this?

It would help, but not solve the problem. It's not just the people at the resurrection that are at risk; if the people doing the resurrecting miss whatever Neklos sent back, the entire population gets screwed. And Neklos is smart enough not to send something back every time. As Drifa said, they miss something about one time in four, which is why they don't do many resurrections any more.

Well, think of it in a real world scenario: you're the security guards at a major airport. There's a steady stream of passengers going through. You know that many but not all of them are terrorists. Failing to identify a terrorist will result in hundreds or thousands of deaths.

Some of these terrorists are carrying bombs, bioweapons, etc on their persons, making them relatively easy to identify with a search. Some ARE bioweapons (they gargled with Ebola before getting on the plane). Some are sleeper agents. Some are mules for information or weaponry. Just to make life extra special, some of the people going through are totally innocent.

What do you do?

Mummy rot, yes. It's a curse, not an actual disease. A plague...probably not, but I'd need to go back and re-read the IA spell description more closely. If not, that would be one way to identify IAs.

************ I thought Ice Assassin had only half the levels of the original caster? Something like that tickles in the back of my head... (I have never read nor played D&D) [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/frostburn--68/ice-assassin--1279/][Reading the text of the spell]], there's a lot of stuff in that spell.

- Passive: dragnet in 1 mile radius around caster due to Scrying on IA.
- Passive: magic cast on original caster *can* affect IA's, meaning 1 spell buffs n+1 Landguards. (n=#IA)
- Passive: killing the IA results in 20 feet ice shrapnel at (x/2)d6 damage (x=caster level; Landguard IA thus 10-11d6 damage)
- Failure Mode: Oughtn't they be dispelled by the antimagic swordclanging? I suppose the IA would be reduced to protecting Grǫfhamr.
- Intelligence: Making IA of intelligence targets and mindscraping them. According to the spell description one needs some material component of the original for casting IA, though.

I assume the Landguard took the 21st level in Paladin so their class remains the same? I remember you mentioning there being no Epic tiers or something like that; my assumption is no extra skills and stuff. So aside from the class issue, the only advantage of having 20+y levels in a class is those tied to class level, like the extra damage to Smite Evil, right?

While I see the advantage multi-classing (I'm thinking of more options and synergy), wasn't one of the advantages the Paladins had their effectiveness without magic? I don't know to what degree this would be increased with more levels though.

So mostly I'm wondering, to what degree does multi-classing out-compete more levels in magic-independent classes?

#+end_quote

According to RAW, if a paladin takes a level in another class they lose the ability to progress as a paladin. According to my house rules (chapter 10) they can multiclass freely as long as their paladin level is higher than any other, and they don't take rogue levels.

#+begin_quote
  I remember you mentioning there being no Epic tiers or something like that; my assumption is no extra skills and stuff. So aside from the class issue, the only advantage of having 20+y levels in a class is those tied to class level, like the extra damage to Smite Evil, right?
#+end_quote

Pretty much, yes. Might be a few others -- I'm away from books at the moment.

#+begin_quote
  While I see the advantage multi-classing (I'm thinking of more options and synergy), wasn't one of the advantages the Paladins had their effectiveness without magic? I don't know to what degree this would be increased with more levels though. So mostly I'm wondering, to what degree does multi-classing out-compete more levels in magic-independent classes?
#+end_quote

At high levels, casters are strictly better than any other class; wizards can out sneak a thief, out fight a fighter, and blow everything the hell up at will.

The fact that the Landguard seem effective is because I've put a lot of work into it, and because of the brains and force of personality of their members. Strictly speaking, a smart wizard could kill them all even without munchkining.

On the other hand, casters top out at 20th level. Without Epic, there is no reason to keep progressing as a caster past that point...hence why the Landguard went multiclass.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Trémaux's algorithm, invented by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Pierre_Tr%C3%A9maux][Charles Pierre Trémaux]], is an efficient method to find the way out of a maze that requires drawing lines on the floor to mark a path, and is guaranteed to work for all mazes that have well-defined passages. A path is either unvisited, marked once or marked twice. Every time a direction is chosen it is marked by drawing a line on the floor (from junction to junction). In the beginning a random direction is chosen (if there is more than one). On arriving at a junction that has not been visited before (no other marks), pick a random direction (and mark the path). When arriving at a marked junction and if your current path is marked only once then turn around and walk back (and mark the path a second time). If this is not the case, pick the direction with the fewest marks (and mark it, as always).. When you finally reach the solution, paths marked exactly once will indicate a direct way back to the start. If there is no exit, this method will take you back to the start where all paths are marked twice. In this case each path is walked down exactly twice, once in each direction. The resulting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#Walks][walk]] is called a bidirectional double-tracing.

Especially for the landguard, swapping out sorcerer for it would give them some very powerful abilities.

Level isn't all that matters, brains and experience count. The Landguard are brand new to their new classes and won't know all the tricks.

We know that Afi was inclined to cut some ice assassins lose because he did, but then wiped that knowledge and reverted to a person who didn't know he'd done that, that is, the kind of Afi inclined to create another Icefi. So he presumably would have cut loose some more and wiped the memories, restarting the cycle. And so on. At the very least, he may have figured out that he did it, as he knows Mindscrape exists and is obviously smart enough to think of the plan,as he already did. How many assassins does Afi have anyway? Was a few thousand a noticeable drop?

Also, will we ever meet any of the other refugee colonies like Grofhamr, which I believe I recall being mentioned?

The BDH (Big Damn Heroes) don't know.

There might be. There's no evidence available one way or the other at the moment.

All that's been revealed so far is that Afi has AT LEAST four 9th level spell slots per day, and he's had 11,000 years to use them. The BDH might have destroyed or captured all of his IAs already, or he could have another ~16,000,000 of them. Or he might have far more, if he has spell slots from other classes or found some other way to cast the spell more often.

Really, they just don't have a clue.

I would like to, but it's not looking likely to happen in the near future. The plot doesn't call for it at the moment; I could force it, but it would end up looking clumsy.

So multiclassing means you get the spell slots for all of the classes? If you multiclassed wizard and sorceror, would you get 10 9th level spell slots a day? And as sorceror appears to have way more spell slots, balanced by learning very few very slowly, and it shares the wizard spells list, could you cast the spells you learn as a wizard in your sorceror slots? If so, those classes synergise extremely well.

And could you use mindscrape to learn the spells someone has memorised?

Yep.

Indeed. Although 6 of them could only be used for casting spells that your sorceror side knew.

#+begin_quote

Nope. Your spell casting is effectively compartmentalized between the classes. You cast just like a 20th level wizard. You also cast just like a 20th level sorceror. Never the twain shall meet.

#+begin_quote
  And could you use mindscrape to learn the spells someone has memorised?
#+end_quote

Nope. Mindscrape is totally broken on fluff, but quite weak on crunch. As to fluff: you learn everything the target knows, so all troop dispositions, passwords etc. As to crunch: you know all the words, spelling, and grammar that they know, and you have years of memories on how to speak French...yet you have no skill ranks in Language(French) so you can't speak French.

Learning spells is the same thing. There's rules for how to do it and how long it takes, and those rules trump the idea that just have detailed memories of actually casting the spell should be enough.

There's actually some sense to this one: a prepared spell isn't just words committed to memory, it's a ritual which you started in the morning and left only a few word left unsaid. Since the person using Mindscrape didn't do the ritual, they can't cast the spell that it presages.

****** Looks like the GBOS was brought up in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2d233e/the_two_year_emperor_chapter_56_fire_and_water_is/cjlq8zf][this thread]]. That's the most recent one I could find, and your reaction to it made me stop searching cause it seems like the first time you had seen it.
