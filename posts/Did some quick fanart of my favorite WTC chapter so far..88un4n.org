** I am now going to picture void rifle as a literal block of text:\\
(This is how a Void Rifle\\
looks like.)

Everyone just subconsciously assumes that they /know/ how it looks like, and feels uncomfortable when "watching" it for too long. While light and other natural phenomena interact with it like with a normal rifle, several illusory effects simply aren't compatible with it, glitching out in a variety of ways.\\
This makes it an intriguing tool, employed by rare few warders and mages. In-depth research on it characteristics is strongly discouraged, as both the damage to sanity as well as the inexplicable fatal incidents end the life of prospecting scholars well before any breakthrough can be made.

Just like Val lacks a soul, so does Void Rifle lack an Image. The Image pointer glitches out and Game Master hastily patched it by making this placeholder. Same patch is applied to a number of obscure objects and game-breaking Images. An example is the Look-a-like Cube, which turns anything that looks at it into said cube. Due to having some weird definition of an observing entity, it would normally Grey Goo 79% of the world in barely a few dozen cycles.

Your art is good. The fact that you provoked me to write bullshit worldbuilding for Worth the Candle is fantastic.

*** The Look-a-like Cube is the stuff of nightmares. I did not understand it at first, and I thought it /stopped/ being a cube once someone else becomes the cube. This way you don't risk greygooing your planet, you just have and existential game of "you're it" going on.

I'll probably use this in some world, mmh. Thank you for the idea.

**** There's a problem with your solution:\\
How many observers can become a Cube at once? Even if it's only one observer, the chain reaction of "get looked on-become Cube-get looked on" still continues, this time leaving an empty void instead of Cube mass.

An additional qualifier for observing entity (like "must also be a sentient, living being") would solve this problem.

***** Yes, I was thinking of it more as a "Curse of the Cube" where one person (whater that means) becomes the cube when they lay their eyes on it.

** Here are some extra sketches I did very early-on during my readthrough as well! They're not as accurate, though.
