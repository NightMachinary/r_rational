One thing I found very interesting about the mother of learning was the shaping exercises. Each shaping exercise seems to try and take complex task and try and distal them to their simplest forms. I am trying to come up with out shaping exercises.

Divinatation

Foresight: take a automated dice roller and predict the roll of dice. has the problem of false positives and general guessing if someone can come up with a better exercise please say.

Transmutation: The exercises in the story already are very good so I am trying to think of the next steps for them.\\
Distill the salt out of salted water.

I would like a shaping exercise for dimension magic, teleports, illusion and soul magic.

If anyone can come up with other shaping exercises that would be cool.


** I put way to much thought into this, but I'm not entirely sure that you can come up with shaping exercises for most of the things that you want. There is just too much complexity, it'd be like trying to break a complex algorithm down into assembly. It's technically possible, but not practical in a usable, on the fly, sort of way.

Lets take illusion for example. An example shaping exercise for this would be something like changing the refracted color of a marble from red to orange. Because I don't have anything else to compare this to, to equal a DnD wizard's shitty first level illusion spell, silent image, the wizard would have to shape the refracted color of whatever size patch of air would be needed for the illusion. That's an insane amount of complexity, even without getting into how precise the illusion would have to be to not be obviously an illusion, or the other senses like sound and touch. A human going through time loops would literally become insane before mastering any of these fields through shaping, from what I understand of the Mother of Learning magic system at least. (Except maybe soul magic? Not well explored yet)

TL;DR: It's easy to come up with shaping exercises, just decide how magic makes a thing happen, then break it down to the finest manipulation that you can.

*** Well I doubt anyone could do any real illusions as pure shaping exercises. But there should be shaping exercises to help with illusions. What should they be?

**** These already exist. Zorian Starts by making colored balls, then works on producing different colors of them, then works on changing the color on the fly, then makes them move around, etc.

He creates illusions of floating butterflies pretty early, and both they and the balls seem capable of existing just fine without his full attention (He distracts Kiri with them, then regularly creates them, "forgets" to dispel them, and impresses his school advisor with them.

Later on, he's capable of creating impressive illusions of a wizard fighting toad monsters, all while on a train that has a magic disrupting field.

** Also magic missile. The spell seems simple enough that it could be a shaping exercise. Send force at a target. I imagine that learning magic missile as a shaping exercise would really help in doing a "properly" cast magic missile.

*** One thing I always envisioned would be Zorian trying to add modifiers to his missles. At the moment, they're simple volts of pure force, with some optical leakage that should be ironed out. But I want to see missiles that have elemental modifiers like heat or lightning, or a variety of other magical effects. Hell, even soul magic.

Additionally, while not a shaping exercise, I hope Zorian extends his invisibility modifier to his other spells too. Invisible fire would be pretty badass.

**** Heh, when you mentioned soul magic I automatically thought of this:

"Xvim?! How did you manage to get a marker for the Time Loop?"

"Shaping Exercise." Xvim then proceeds to (somehow) pelt Zorian's soul with marbles.

***** Well now I can't help but wonder what a soul magic shaping exercise would look like.

As Xvim said (paraphrasing), "There's shaping exercises for all forms of magic. Why wouldn't there be ones for this?"

****** Hmm... how about attempting to take out a rat's (or any other small animal's) soul and embed it in a marble? Fiddling with small animal's souls seems a lot safer than fiddling with your own.

(or as I suggested in my post, you could attempt to topographically map a soul onto a marble with some illusion magic shaping, assuming a soul is mappable of course)

** Hmmm, here's some ideas I can think of:

For Dimensional magic one can move a small object (heh, marble) as accurately as possible in a single dimension. An example would be to make it disappear and reappear exactly 1mm to the left / right Perhaps, even more simply, one could simply move it 'up' and 'down' in another (presumably unseen by humans) dimension that allows for it to disappear and almost instantly reappear in the exact same location to our eyes. Extra points if you don't waste any energy in the form of excess light / sound.

Illusion magic could be taught by modifying individual senses or modifying the real world to hide/show something. The former could be by trying to make a tasteless marble taste like apples or something, or attempting to magically make oneself colorblind to an increasingly specific hue. The latter could be done by tinting a marble a specific color, attempting to fake an increasingly 'pure' (sin wave of a certain desired frequency) sound, making transparent marbles opaque (as well as the opposite) or even attempting to bend light around the marble such that everything behind it can be seen squished up against the edges of the marble. (like light passing around a black hole and being focused back at us)

Soul magic would probably be much like he's already doing. Getting a feel of one's soul and attempting to poke it at a certain location as accurately as possible. Something interesting would be to attempt to visualize it well enough to map the 'surface' of it to a marble. (you'll have to use illusion shaping exercises in order to color the marble to match your mapping of the topography of your soul or something)

Of course, one could just combine these with any existing shaping exercise in order to make it even more of a challenge.

EDIT: So yea, pretty much what Tellan607 TL;DR'ed. Just decide how something is done and isolate a single aspect of that and then apply it (somehow) to a marble.
