** I have such mixed feelings for this story. On the one hand, it's just /nice/. On the other hand, orthogonality thesis! The author seems to just have /defined/ the shard's notion of "mentally healthy" as correct, and it just weirds me out that nobody questions where her power's definition of "sane" comes from. It's all a bit too /unquestioned/, which just ... does not /at all/ put me at ease, given the situation. It reminds me of the Madoka quest where the players make a character with the power to make people "better", and it takes about six updates for her to start mindcontrolling people into being her friends. Like, that's /tragic/ but it's how you'd /expect/ it to go... this story is going /too well/. It makes me suspicious.

I should probably go finish it.

[edit] Okay, finished it. Um. ...... I get the WAFF, but it seems kind of like ............ it's not a very good /ending/? Like, it's a good /outcome/ but it doesn't seem to have any narrative connection to what came before it. It's the kind of ending you write when you've gotten all you wanted out of a story and just want to close it. Like in /DM of the Rings/, where the players get kinda disinterested and the DM just ends it all with [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1293][one dice roll]] about an event hundreds of kilometers away.

I think one thing that often differentiates professional authors from amateurs is the use of /arcs/. If you're looking at fanfiction, what you often have is a desire to play with a few concepts and see what happens, but no notion of what happens beyond that. So once you reach the cool stuff you wanted to do, that's it, it's done, nothing comes /of/ it. Like, if this was an arc-based story, you'd actually show how sanity improves the decisionmaking of the heroes that Sanity helps in a practical way that comes back around to help accomplish Sanity's goals of a more capable world, in a way that connects back to Sanity's personal story. Instead, the Shard, a minor character at best in story terms, solves everything because what is agency?? (Oh also, nothing bad happens to her in the Birdcage; her fear is entirely unfounded.) It vaguely reminds me of a story that I fuzzily remember reading as a child that /literally/ ends with "and then Jesus returned and solved everything." It's not very narratively satisfying.

*** That's all fair. It's the first time I've actually written anything, so I expect it to be bad.

I'm not sure why it was posted here, honestly. It's not rational fiction, and I gave up on trying to make it a ratfic less than half the way through because the Wormverse is nearly impossible to make rational, and also because I didn't want to devote that much time and effort into trying to make it make sense.

**** It's pretty good as a first try! The important thing about being a writer is that you keep reading, keep analyzing and /keep writing/. Stick with it!

[edit] Something that helped a friend of mine, was try to find a story schema such as the [[http://blog.janicehardy.com/2013/10/how-to-plot-with-three-act-structure.html][three-act structure]] and /explicitly/ stick to it, beat by beat, scene by scene. It may seem formulaic and boring but it's a tried-and-proven framework for good writing. Remember, explicit rote genre writing got us the Dresden Files.

This is /damn/ good for a first attempt. Amazingly so, in fact. The simple fact that you've got good grammar, spelling, and copyediting puts you above 90% of fanfic. The fact that the story is actually engaging puts you above 50% of the remainder.

My complaint is that things seem a little easy for Taylor. Her power keeps her sane so she has no internal conflict [[#s][]]. She is objectively improving people's lives, so they are on-side with helping her. Her one weakness is that she's squishy and not very combat capable, but [[#s][]] get rid of that PDQ.

I think the real missed opportunity was with Dragon's halo scanner. You had a chance to explore the moral and psychological implications of forcibly changing someone's mind. From an outside view there was no difference here between Taylor curing people and Taylor turning people into happy pod people loyal to her. There could have been some real conflict there that would have made for a great story, but having Dragon definitely say "nope, s'all good" killed that plotline. Indeed, everything is a little too easy for her.

Please keep writing. I look forward to seeing more of your work.

**** Yeah, we pretty well fleshed that argument out in the comments rather than the story. Perhaps I should have done it in the story instead, but...live and learn.

** This isn't rational, earth is either a post-scarcity society if Panacea - or any other sufficiently powerful parahuman - isn't insane or alternatively the Simurgh kills Taylor.

Additionally the story has blatant bashing of characters, who themselves act completely out of character.

In fairness, they act out of character because they have had their mental issues fixed. Everyone in Worm is broken, so it's not surprising that when you take away the broken they behave differently.

** Wow. Two chapters in. I just finished reading another Worm fanfic called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mixed-feelings-worm-oc.375923/page-46#post-25708409][Mixed Feelings]] and this is literally helping to cure the stress that story caused.

It's a pretty weird feeling for a Work fanfic, but interested to see where it goes.

** Thanks for writing this, [[/u/Frommerman][u/Frommerman]]. I can't wait to read your Speedrun idea next.

Synopsis:

#+begin_quote
  Clearly, the Queen Administrator is too powerful. What if Taylor got a different shard, one accidentally broken when Eden collided with Abbadon and received the Path shard? What happens when, for the first time in the history of the universe, there's a shard that is /actually trying to help/?

*** I've gotten a start on the first chapter for that one. Both the speedrun and the Death Note idea have some really cool scenes planned out in my head, and I'm not actually sure which I want to do first.
