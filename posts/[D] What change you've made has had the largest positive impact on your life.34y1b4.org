***** It might be more on-point to say that isolation is bad for mental health.

In my observation, one pattern that seems to work for introverts to stave off isolation, is arranging many regular meetings with a few well-known people. Not being an introvert myself, I can't comment on whether this is actually less draining than 'accept social events by default' , but it sounds like it should be. In any case, since I see this actually happening, I guess it must seem to work out positively to the introvert in question.

If the event is not interesting and there will not be anyone I know there, then I won't go. I rather meet new people through my friends, classes, or the social events I like to go to.

For comparison, I'm a mild introvert. I prefer my own company most of the time, but I take the time to interact with others and I do find it enjoyable meeting strangers if it involves something related to my interests.

- What field do you work in? Would you say it's a field with obvious floors and ceilings to productivity, or is it a field where it's realistically possible to be 10x, or even 50x as productive as the average worker?

It could simply be being up early, and not the actual sleep. I certainly did sleep in before, though my sleep was very inconsistent. So it might be the consistent wake time, the wake time being early, or just consistently getting a similar amount of sleep rather than the raw amount of sleep itself.

I'm an actuarial student. Still looking for my first entry level job. But I notice a HUGE increase in my ability to retain information as a study for my next exam (actuaries take a lot of exams) as well as a significant increase in my practice test scores. I'd say that an estimate of three times as many brain-fart type mistakes while on less than a full nights sleep would be reasonable and probably conservative. I can go from getting 10 questions (out of 35) wrong purely out of stupid mistakes to making only a few mistakes. It is /very/ noticeable. Honestly, I think back on all the tests I got very little sleep for in high school and college, and all the stupid mistakes (on said tests) I couldn't believe I made... ugh. Not fun to think about.

At the moment not very. I just study, apply for jobs, and tutor on the side. Its really the information retention that I see such a difference in, as well as the elimination of "brain farts." Brain farts being mistakes that I clearly shouldn't be making given my comprehension of the material.

The three times thing is based on my ability to do practice problems combined with the lack of dumb mistakes. Its just an estimate.

** Give up drinking any sugary drinks = low-hanging fruit to eat more healthy. Ironically I'm often underweight due to my quick metabolism, but that's been slowing down since I entered college. So I also have friends to go to the gym with. Quick way to go cold turkey is to drink nothing but water for a few days. Soda will taste overly sweet afterwards.

...

Double-major = Not the best choice for everyone, but it's been pretty good for me to know that I will have a lot of flexibility in my future career when I graduate with a BA in Cognitive Science and Computer Science. Just the increased confidence in my future has been pretty helpful. Therefore I recommend having a solid plan for the next few years to get a sense of security.

...

Finding a good role model in my older cousin = He introduced me to HPMOR and I respected him so much that I wanted to be like him. Since we were pretty similar in personalities and how we lived our lives, I had a sneak-peek into how my future might look like and could anticipate certain choices I would be making. If you can find someone who acts like you and can from similar circumstances or lifestyle but is living a good life, then ask them how they got to that point and copy them. Multiple role models would be good in this case.

...

Join a social group = I joined a group with a common interest in computers and as a result I'm invited to a lot more social events and my introversion doesn't 'trick' me into staying in my room all the time. Find a club or social activity you can go to weekly or more often.

...

Learn a second language = I'm learning ASL now and it's so invigorating to be able to 'talk' in multiple languages and to understand another culture. The problem most people (in the US anyway) have with learning another language is that they try to learn in a school setting and when they fail assume it's because they are inherently bad at it. But if there is one subject that the public school system is bad at teaching above all others is foreign languages. Taking the time to join a club which meets weekly to have conversations in the foreign language will teach you more in days than months of classroom learning. I recommend buying or renting a textbook to learn a few phrases and the culture behind the language for a start. Then find a class/club to join. The public school system is bad because of the focus on grades, but a class/club available for anyone of any age to join tends to be more focused on actual proficiency and is more of a casual environment to learn in. A quick way to tell if a class/club is very good is if the teachers require you to only speak in the foreign language while in the classroom (it's okay if they allow speaking in English for the first half or something similar).

Most people don't have the self-direction necessary to front-load their learning in life. While you're young and in school, you can spend waaaay more time on study, and subsequently research, than when you get to be a "real adult" and have to keep money coming in all the time. This applies whether you choose a "career in" industry (where you have to write and ship productive code for your boss all day) or academia (where, as a full professor, you would have to keep grant funding coming in for your grad-students).

Most people [[http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/][half-ass their youth with everything they've got]], or just /entirely/ half-ass it. I did the former, and now wish I hadn't.

You can do much more interesting stuff as an adult if you've front-loaded your learning, and you can also do much more interesting stuff as an adult if you /keep/ learning, rather than if you do like some of my friends and let yourself forget everything you learned in school once you've got a job.

Undergrad research is designed for undergrads. You can have a good time being someone's "trained monkey". (I have heard undergrad researchers /actually referred to this way/, being a grad-student.) However, once you're in grad-school, you need a /much/ more solid mathematical background in your subject than you needed to get through undergrad.

I did not know real analysis, optimization, abstract algebra, category theory, or statistics when I entered grad-school. At the very least, I managed to leave knowing some bits-and-pieces of optimization, and a solid grasp on statistics and machine learning, and a fair grasp on the Coq proof assistant and type theory. My actual thesis was in empirical software engineering, partly because that was what my advisor did, and partly because without a lot more background, I couldn't do anything more mathematical.

(Which is why I'm studying a bunch of maths in my spare time right now! Think we should do a textbook recommendation thread?)

Also, grad-level research is more stressful, because it is your career riding on doing rigorous research /and getting positive results to publish even though rigorous research sometimes doesn't yield those./

That depends how you define "can handle". If you are well-organized and can take care of yourself well, you can complete a PhD without acquiring any new mental illnesses. But it will be stressful, no matter what.

But then again, industry work is usually /also/ stressful, but often far less in-depth and interesting.

Undergrad can be. But it seems to me most people who say that are like the people who said similar about high school: they're spending more time not-working than working, and so will be screwed when the next thing happens and society didn't allocate them a Designated Job to step right into.

I also recommend cog-sci, on grounds that it's actually a rigorous science. Far be it from me to claim human cognition is the only possible kind, but imagine trying to design an aeroplane if you can't explain how and why a bird flies! No, what you need is not a theory of flappy-flap, but you /do/ need one of /aerodynamics/, and both cognitive science and theoretical neuroscience are much more closely investigating the information dynamics of cognition than AI, which [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/m5c/debunking_fallacies_in_the_theory_of_ai_motivation/cc0v][seems to focus on taking a bunch of philosophical theories and thinking very hard about their philosophical implications]], rather than on figuring out how an actual embodied mind has to work to do its job.

** This is kinda weird, and almost the opposite of the thread's implicit purpose, but...when someone gives me advice, I attach a high probability to it just not working. People love to give advice, and it's frequently well-intentioned advice, but a great deal of the time it's just cliched nonsense or patterns inferred from insufficient data. Giving useful advice that generalizes across differences in individual circumstances is /hard/, and to a first approximation, no one can do it.

I've found it much more useful to sit down, analyze the situation explicitly, write down my assumptions if I'm uncertain and imagine each one being false (this is like the #1 most awesome thinking/debugging tool I've found), and then build my own solution. Use advice and the experience of other people as /information/ you can use to build your own solution, not a solution in and of itself.

There's a lot of literature written by highly successful people, saying things like "I used these 3 principles, and went from rags to riches". People often jump on these like maniacs, ignoring the fact that random factors are always a major component. A few principles do seem to work, but they're hard to find and rarely guarantee success. It's easy to fall into the trap of using the ones that feel good or profound or something like that.

My position on advice developed once I read a Quora thread on intellectual giftedness that was full of fairly obvious things about being gifted. The one post that got my attention was that advice that works for normal folks will fail for gifted people, because giftedness has some correlation to cognitive unconventionality. So attempting to force yourself into standard patterns is likely to fail.

Following /that/ principle has paid off well, and I don't think it's limited to gifted people at all. Individual variation is way too great to let yourself be fully defined by your culture, or religion, or society, or what have you. Much better to become a "nation of one" and use the intellectual flexibility that comes with that.

And...er, bear in mind that this post may not generalize well to other people either. ;)

Want to lose weight? Surround yourself with healthy people.

And, of course, the reverse is true as well.

Want to be productive? Stop hanging out with lazy people.

Overweight people are at a significantly increased risk for multiple diseases and conditions due to their weight. This is not healthy.

Yes, there are genetic factors. If your genetics are bad (cause you to be overweight, and thus at increased risk for other diseases), then you are not healthy.

If you have a disease that causes weight gain, you're not healthy, you have a disease.

If you're overweight, you are consuming more calories in food than you expend through activity. Reduce consumption, increase activity. If you have a disease or genetic condition that makes you prone to weight gain, you will have to reduce consumption and increase activity more than a person without those issues. But no matter what condition you have, it does not defy thermodynamics.

After you lose the weight, there may be underlying conditions that still require treatment, so consulting with a physician may be a good idea, if some ill health remains.

"Healthy" overweight people will tend to still have the kind of bad habits that cause being overweight. If you associate with them, especially in social settings that involve food, you will continue to have those habits reinforced by your social group.

If your social group meets over 430 calorie frappuccinos and has 2 of them while socializing, it's not going to be people who are thin, unless they are also extraordinarily active.

If your social group meets for a participatory athletic event, it's generally not going to be people who are overweight unless they're consuming said frappuccinos afterward.

    You observe food choices and portion sizes and physical activity levels.

  These are the things that make up a calorie deficit. These are the habits you will absorb.
#+end_quote

Assuming your body functions sufficiently similarly to theirs that you can do roughly the same activities and eat roughly the same amount of the same types of food and end up at roughly their weight. Choosing a social group that has lost weight doesn't guarantee that, but it's better than chance.

#+begin_quote
  If your social group meets over 430 calorie frappuccinos and has 2 of them while socializing, it's not going to be people who are thin, unless they are also extraordinarily active.
#+end_quote

Which brings up another point: you're going to do the things appropriate to the venues and activities you meet for rather than strictly aping your peers. If your social group meets over coffee, you're not necessarily going to notice that you're choosing the 400 calorie drink while everyone else is choosing 50 calorie drinks. By choosing a social group that has lost weight, they're more likely to notice it, mention it, and choose venues and activities that make those habits less available.

Yes, I'm assuming you're a human, meeting with other humans. Human biology is not that diverse. Genetic variation in metabolism isn't going to account for more than a few percentage points of difference in calories in vs calories out.

I'm also assuming that the change in your social group is part of an intentional effort to lose weight, where you are inclined to pay attention to your own choices.

Like I said, it's not sufficient, but it helps.

Pulling numbers out of thin air, if you're 50% likely to lose weight without altering your social group to include more healthy people while committing to reducing your weight, you're 60% likely to do so with altering your social group. Yes, these numbers are made up. No, I don't have a study to back them. They are a guess based on personal experience.

Do you have any citations for that? because i've been hearing and seeing mostly the opposite of what you are claiming here..

Also from a recent article which seems to disagree with your claim:

********** No, I don't have citations, beyond the hypothesis that if there were that significant of a variation between two organisms, they would be less likely to be the same species.

As for your article, it indicates that a transplant of gut bacteria from an obese person to a non-obese person can cause the non-obese person to gain weight. This does not implicate genetics (it was a mother-daughter pair, so the genetics are already similar) it implicates gut bacteria.

It is more likely that the obese daughter had gut bacteria that processed food in a different way from the gut bacteria the mother had, and the mother did not update her diet properly to the new gut bacteria.

It is, in my opinion, more likely that the gut bacteria of the daughter were made sub-optimal by the daughters unhealthy eating habits, than that the daughter had genetics sufficiently different from the mother that she wound up with a different set of gut bacteria and resulting obesity.

When the sub-optimal gut bacteria were transplanted to the mother, they contributed to the mother's obesity by performing as if they were in the daughter, perhaps extracting nutrients in a more efficient manner, perhaps extracting the wrong nutrients, and the mother did not adapt her diet correctly in a timeframe to avoid obesity. In no case whatsoever did the mother gain weight due without consuming calories in excess of what was actually expended in activity.

*********** Just taking your hypothesis as fact and living by it without any actual data seems hardly rational.

Here's some anecdotal evidence for you: When I compare myself to some of my slightly to moderately overweight friends I eat roughly double the daily amount of food as them and of roughly the same type (lazy student food). I, however, am /underweight/. I also eat more than anyone in the family, including sweets. Yet I weigh less than any of them even though only my father reaches me in height. My sister isn't even an adult and weighs more than me (slightly overweight). Again, I know for a fact that her food intake is less than mine and also that she is more bodily active than me (not difficult when taking into account that I don't do /any/ sport and frequently spend a day or two mostly in bed.

Of course I could be some kind of mutant but I've noticed more people whose food intake didn't seem to be on par to their body weight so it can't be /that/ rare.

Looks like even after accounting for genetics, it's diet and exercise that make up obesity.

*********** i dont think the point was genetics so much as significant variations(i.e. more then "a few percents") between different people.

the article was supposed to show that, not genetics specifically.

About you guess regarding the cause, as far as i remember the point was that the women gained all of this weight by eating medically mandated food rations as before the surgery.
