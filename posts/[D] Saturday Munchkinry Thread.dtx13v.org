Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have the ability to silence literally anyone with an intimidating glare. Courageous soldiers, hardened criminals, fearless madmen, no one is immune.

As long as (1) You are glaring at some target X, and (2) that target X is aware that you are glaring at him/her, the target X will not be able to speak a single word. Specifically, target X will feel extreme fear towards you whenever he/she tries to speak, fear enough to paralyze his/her vocal cords. Target X can still do other things, like use sign language, or write words, or move behind an obstacle to avoid your glare, or attack you.

Your ability works through the photons that bounce between you and the target X. So your glare can work through reflections and other ways of bending light. But does not work through cameras and screens. And does not work in total darkness.

What can you do with this power?

*** Ultimate heckler. Show up at any speech, comedy routine, debate, etc. and make some kind of eye-catching gesture. Then, glare. This will cause them to catch their words,thus appearing incompetent. They might even glance back a couple times, attempting to divine the source of their inexplicable fear, in which case they will again be silenced. They will be seen as a stuttering fool by the majority of those watching, reputation=destroyed.

**** Problem: the target must be aware that you specifically are glaring at him/her. They will not need to divine the source of their inexplicable fear: they either know it is you or they won't feel any fear.

You can destroy their reputation using this method, but they will know you are responsible.

On the plus side: any bystanders that you aren't glaring at won't notice anything magical happening. So if the silenced celebrity tries to blame you for their silence, people will be confused by why the celebrity is so cowardly as to be silenced by a mere glare.

*** "Enough fear to paralyze the vocal cords" is a lot of fear.

The strength of this power depends on the mechanism. If it's "target cannot talk but is not particularly afraid," it's pretty limited. If it's "generates enough fear that people are prevented from taking any but the most basic actions," then it's powerful indeed.

The way fear usually works isn't, "your vocal cords are paralyzed specifically," it's "your thinking is interrupted." So if someone cannot speak, then they can't use sign language either, although they can probably make basic communicative gestures.

Most peoples' response to that much fear is to flee or fight, not to realize "my vocal cords are selectively paralyzed so I should attempt sign language."

It's enough fear that it should provide a significant advantage in combat. Courageous soldiers and hardened criminals have probably practiced being combat effective through fear, but even then that's generally expected fear, not fear striking them suddenly. Even so, the best combat use is probably generate fear > they focus on you > your accomplice stabs them in the back.

**** The mechanism: when you simply glare at the target and the target is aware, nothing magical actually happens yet. The target simply feels a mundane level of fear from being aware that he/she is being glared at by you.

The magic happens whenever the target X attempts to speak. At the moment when X is about to speak, X will magically perceive your glare as being massively intensified. Any bystanders will not notice anything magical happening, but the target X will be intimidated to the point where X cannot speak, for as long as X attempts to speak.

But once X stops attempting to speak, the magic disappears (until X next attempts to speak). That is why the target X can take other actions, but not speak: No magic happens except when they try to speak.

â€‹

So if you try to use this in combat as a distraction, it would only work if your opponents are chatty. You can taunt them to respond to you, to manipulate them into trying to talk to their allies, etc. But if they are the silent killer type, your ability won't be any use at all.

*** Could try running for President. You'll probably win every presidential debate this way.

There's also the ability for long-distance glaring. Focus binoculars or a telescope on the person, then have a drone, megaphone or other wireless speaker in the person's vicinity state that "I am glaring at you." Since it isn't specified that they have to actually see you when you do this, you'd be able to snipe anyone with your glare.

Or lob them an easy question that they can launch into their talking point on, and then prevent them from doing so while castigating them for purporting to support a certain bill, candidate, product, or whatever but being unwilling to actually put their voice to it.

** All towns in the medieval land of Generica may muster special soldiers of three types:

TANK

- Trained to use personal shields which allow them to generate a 10-foot sphere of influence that redirects all harmful attacks (including traps) toward the tank's center of gravity.

- Tanks cannot move when their sphere is active.

- Activation / deactivation time: 0.1 secs. Accomplished by entering a trained mental state.

- Sphere deactivates when shield breaks or tank loses conciousness.

DPS

- Swordsmen and Archers are trained with two-handed weapons capable of shattering any shield in three hits.

HEALER

- Once every 12 hours, healers can restore the health of one active soldier or repair the personal shield of one.

- Healing and repair requires physical contact.

What tactics would you use in a 3 vs 3 battle, assuming your opponents are one of each unit?

How would you munchkin these abilities in general?

*** In a face-to-face fight without sneaky stuff, take two Archers and one Tank.

Consider: Each Tank is effectively able to take three hits without trouble.

A Healer can re-set a Tank to zero hits (by repairing his shield)

An Archer hits once a round.

So, this enemy group can effectively shrug off six hits, during which time their own Archer is letting off shots. (If the enemy group has a Swordsman instead, then take advantage of the range advantage to kill him).

If I send in:

- All Tanks/Healers: My group can last nine rounds with no damage (as long as at least one is an actual Tank, not three Healers). However, as I have no attacking power, their Archer will destroy my group eventually.

- All archers: First round I do three damage, destroy their shield. Their Archer kills one of mine, their Healer fixes the shield. Second round I do two damage, their Archer kills my second Archer. Third round I smash their shield again, their Archer kills me last Archer. They're vulnerable for the next twelve hours, but they still win.

- One Archer, two tank/healer (at least one an actual Tank): Draw. It all comes down to who gets their first shot off first.

- Two Archers, one Tank: First round, their shield takes two hits, mine takes one. Second round, their shield gets smashed (assume their Healer is really on the ball and repairs it /immediately/ - if not, the second attack kills their Healer and they go down quickly) and then their restored Shield gets one hit. My shield gets a second hit. Third round, their shield is smashed a second time; mine is smashed the first time. Fourth round, their Archer kills one of my guys - doesn't matter which one, because both my Archers shot their Archer in this round, so he goes down. Worst-case scenario, I now have one Archer and one Tank facing one Tank and one Healer, with both Tanks' shields down and the Healer has used his Healing. Two more shots and my team wins.

Of course, all of this may well become moot once Sneaky Stuff comes into play.

*** Redirecting harmful attacks towards one's center of gravity sounds like a bad idea. For example, if the attack is a molotov cocktail (or other incendiary), you are looking at serious injury or death if you use your shield, whereas you might be able to escape unscathed if you don't use it. That seems like the easy answer to this. Something like a launching crossbow with small flasks of flammable liquid could essentially force tanks to drop their shields or die in a single hit, and could also be fairly effective against other targets.

*** Questions:

- Tank shields state that they can redirect traps. Who is making these traps?
- DPS can shatter shields in three hits, but shields activate and deactivate in 0.1 secs? Does that mean you need 4 coordinated attacks in 0.1 secs on a non-tank target within the shield in order to hit the target?
- Alternatively, does shattering a shield mean the tank can no longer activate it until repaired by a healer? So a tank shield can only redirect 3 attacks before being broken until healed?
- What happens if two tanks have overlapping shields? Where are the attacks redirected to?
- Is the redirection of attacks instantaneous? Or can a skilled tank flicker its shield to bend the path of an attack without making it hit the tank? Since it can bend any attack towards the tank, if this works, a tank + archer combo should be able to build up tons of arrows circling a tank with a consistently flickering shield, turning the tank into something like a fragmentation grenade.

#+end_quote

It doesn't matter. Any attack or trap made with harmful intentions is redirected.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, if you wanted to be 100% sure of ambushing a target standing beside a tank with an active sphere. 3 attacks to disrupt the sphere (by breaking the tank's shield or rendering them unconscious), with the 4th attack aimed at your target.

#+begin_quote
  does shattering a shield mean the tank can no longer activate it until repaired by a healer?
#+end_quote

Yes. The shield allows the tank to activate their sphere of influence.

#+begin_quote
  So a tank shield can only redirect 3 attacks before being broken until healed?
#+end_quote

Yes, if the attacks hit the shield. But a tank who sees the attack coming could choose to let it hit their body instead of their shield, or pull someone else in the way, etc. They know attacks are attracted to their center of gravity.

#+begin_quote
  What happens if two tanks have overlapping shields? Where are the attacks redirected to?
#+end_quote

Attacks are redirected to the user of the first sphere the attack touches.

#+begin_quote
  Is the redirection of attacks instantaneous?
#+end_quote

You can think of it as a magnet redirecting attacks. Eg: If you threw a rock at a target within a tank's sphere, the rock's flight path would redirect the moment it became influenced, curving toward the tank's center of gravity.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Interesting. A few downsides:

- The arrows' velocity would bleed off as normal, limiting how long you could keep them circling and how lethal they'd be once released.

- Tank can't move while sphere is active.

- Mental exertion of "flickering" probably can't be maintained for long. I can't even rapidly alternate saying "ON / OFF" without soon slurring my words, let alone entering a specialized state of mind.

- High risk. (Hope the tank doesn't get distracted.)

- Obvious setup. I wonder why those massed archers are aiming at that tank by our front lines?

- Situational. Traditional archer tactics possibly more effective?

A coordinated tank / archer team could bend arrows around obstacles tho. Creative possibilities.

***** Thinking about it further, I'm somewhat confused by how the tank shield could redirect all traps.

Consider a simple pitfall trap. An ally walks over the trap while in the tank's sphere. Does the revealed pit magically move below the tank faster than the ally can fall in? What happens to the material that was under the tank? What if the ally was carrying the tank on his shoulders?

#+begin_quote
  Attacks are redirected to the user of the first sphere the attack touches.
#+end_quote

Ooooh! Double tank plays! They can flicker overlapping shields in alternation to constantly bounce attacks back and forth between them. That's much much easier than the orbiting arrows idea.

Also outside of the 3v3 combat situation, you could setup a chain of tanks with overlapping spheres, each deploying its sphere after the previous one, and when an an attack enters the sphere of the last tank, it will be chain redirected all the way to the first tank, possibly accelerating along the way like a railgun. Though the first tank would probably be sacrificed in the resulting blast.

That's what I get for speaking in absolutes lol. A simple pitfall could be an effective anti-tank trap, as there's no physical attack to redirect. Just a long drop and a sudden stop.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Nope. This isn't a reality warping technique. It's simply magical magnetization.

#+begin_quote

No. The momentum of an attack (eg, an arrow) would decrease as normal over time and distance.

Fighting alone against a pair of coordinated tanks in hand-to-hand combat would be a pain to deal with. But the tanks would have to be careful about friendly fire. In that situation, I don't know if the best tactic is getting close or staying away from the pair.
