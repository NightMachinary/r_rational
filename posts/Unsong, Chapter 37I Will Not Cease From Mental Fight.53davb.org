** Ana asks Aaron to reveal the name to her, to help him before the Drug Lord gets it.

Ana is actually the Drug Lord.

Jane asks Aaron to reveal his location to her, to help him before the Other King gets it.

Jane is actually...

**** If "she" hadn't, he'd leave Trump Tower the moment he wakes. As it is, he might wait for her. And if he doesn't wake, then the warning doesn't really matter.

** Let's talk about the Kabbalah of Trump Tower.

Trump is connected to the French verb 'tromper'- to fool.

In the Tarot deck, the Fool is either high or low, like the Ace. The Trump card, if you will. This is not a coincidence etc.

Aaron acted foolishly, and he is high on peyote, and high at the top of Trump Tower. No points for guessing what value the Fool has in this game.

The obvious interpretation of Tower is the Tower of Babel. Hell, it was specifically mentioned in this chapter. The story of the Tower is that mankind was punished and divided for building too close to Heaven.

So would Trump Tower mean 'To overreach in your deception'? A bit like what the Drug Lord did.

** Apparently Jinxiang means "gold hometown". I'm trying to think what that could be referencing. Is there anywhere in the US that's called the "golden city"? There's Golden State I think, and San Francisco has the Golden Gate Bridge, but I don't know enough US geography to come up with better candidates.

** Typos for [[/u/ScottAlexander]] :

#+begin_quote
  “I didn't *said* you would have to.”

  I was Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, Tezcatlipoca the smoking mirror, Huitzilopochtli the left-handed hummingbird.
#+end_quote

The first comma is inconsistent.

#+begin_quote
  The Drug Lord looked down at me bemusedly, smile still playing on his features.
#+end_quote

Should probably say "a smile".

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention that if I told you the Name, the Drug Lord, who's listening in on us for sure, would *overheard*.

  what I felt when I said I was coming to rescue me.
#+end_quote

Really confusing, are pronouns swapped here?

#+begin_quote
  [I'll trust you,] I thought [if you can answer me one question]
#+end_quote

Missing punctuation.

#+begin_quote
  [..and if I ever make a pun
#+end_quote

Should be three dots for an ellipsis.

#+begin_quote
  you should just assume I'm possessed by the Drug Lord again]
#+end_quote

Missing period.

***** This chapter is based at least in part on asking DMT entities to factor very large relative primes. 37 is a prime number, and its only factors are itself and one. 38 is a relative prime of 2 and 19. This is not a coincidence because nothing is a coincidence.

Thus, the only possible chapter number for this chapter is 38, and your memories of it having been 37 must have been falsified. Perhaps by a DMT entity.

And the story has mentioned that idea around marriage at least in part( and not listening caused something bad)
