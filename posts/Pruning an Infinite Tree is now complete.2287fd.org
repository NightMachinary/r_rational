** Yes, okay. But, in your words, /what is it/? And why should people care?

*** I'm not the author.

Are we doing reviews now? I try to include one in most of what I post, but it doesn't seem like that's really a thing.

But it's a pretty clever piece of scifi. It does drones well, which isn't something any novels really do yet. None of the characters are stupid. The explanation for how it all works is pretty clever. Reminded me a bit of the style of permutation city, although there was nothing really in common. That or some of qntm's more esoteric stuff.

It has an interesting premise, but you don't really see that until closer to the end.

**** Wait. One doesn't see the "interesting-ness" of the premise until the end? Doesn't that make the thing drag, if the most interesting part is saved?

Or am I misunderstanding, and you mean something like, "the final reveal is the most interesting part?" Which might or might not be questionable world or plot building, but makes more sense as a subjective evaluation of a good rationalist fic.

In any case, I'm not looking for or demanding a review myself, but a blind link seem a little pointless. For example, I thought it was fantasy, based on the little post icon I got. A single sentence, or a short explanation like you gave, helps me know why I should spend even the ten seconds to follow the link.

***** Not the ending itself, but towards the end. The beginning explores the world a bit, but you don't get any explanation for the powers until probably the last third. The world isn't bad, but the mechanism behind the powers is obviously the point. Everything else is backdrop.

I'd say it hits its stride at around half-way point.

Most of the links that get posted here seem to be pretty much blind :/

I see what you mean, but there are tags that are most often used that give a hint. The odd name of this title caught my eye, and the rest is me-being-lazy-and-chatty history. This conversation was helpful in resolving those burning questions. But wait, there's more.

--------------

Thanks to the interest generated by OP answering my original comment, I went to read the "Introduction" section for this story. There are, well, /problems/ with composition and grammar even there, in the first thing a new reader might see. That isn't a good sign.

I'm interested in whether the rationalist fiction experience payoff is worth a slog through the apparent first draft hell of the work of an author with very... /casual/ English usage, and a questionable commitment proofreading. Does my even complaining about this answer my own question?

Right now, I seem to be having more fun talking about it then I am currently estimating I'd have reading it. Obviously.

******* Heh, I know what you mean. It doesn't bother me too much, I managed to enjoy saga of soul despite the really weird formatting.

There's a bit of a content glut right now, so I figure better to post then to not. But it is a bit iffy.

** I really really enjoyed this story. It was nice and brief-ish, fairly well paced, has an intriguing premise, complexities seem to make sense. Yatta!

**** Thanks! No more yet. If and when I finish something else I'll put a note on the pruning an infinite tree website. So you can track the RSS feed if you want to be notified.

*** Chapter 5, you repeat a paragraph halfway through. On purpose?(haven't read further yet, still going.)

**** Fixed. Not in my canonical copy, so I must have duplicated the line when structuring it for the website. Thanks!
