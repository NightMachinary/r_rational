** Too-short plot summary: A man wants to open a pickle factory. His family helps out. Some complications ensue.

This story is something I've had trouble finding: An exploration of what could be accomplished with real-world munchkinry, without any magic or questionable superscience. The basic premise is explained in the first chapter: A few centuries ago, a set of ten families pledge to support each other over king and country, founding a sort of cabal, the titular Pfand, which has slowly grown to the present day.

The main plot of the story, in which [[#s][spoiler]], and how the protagonist gets caught up in it all, may not be spectacular, but forms the stage on which the Pfand's various details get explored.

(Rating note: Despite the hosting site, this story doesn't contain any titillating sexual content, though sex is referred to and it does include mention of prostitution as a significant job, and there's reasonable amounts of violence.)
