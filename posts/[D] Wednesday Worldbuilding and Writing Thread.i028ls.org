Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Related to worldbuilding: does anybody here use mapmaking software? I'm looking at Wonderdraft; the free version of Inkarnate is junk and I don't want to pay a monthly fee for something I'd be using sporadically. Wonderdraft, you pay and you're done, it's yours. There's also something called Campaign Creator (I think?) but I've read that it's fiddly and tends to crash a lot.

*** I've used the RollForFanasy map creator in addition to MS Paint to great effect. Searching up 'dnd map creator reddit' showed a couple results with people asking a similar question to yours.

** [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XdKfhcpd9xnfjPEwRIEQZXmxF42gW2ImOcqBrsyBp0/edit?usp=sharing][I've been working a lot on world-building a fictional country]] for the past few weeks that utilizes many certain obscure government institutions like Futarchy, and actually solves the low hanging coordination problems described in [[https://equilibriabook.com/toc/][Inadequate Equilibria]] and various writing in the rational blogosphere. It ends up being if not utopian then far better than existing governments, though that is a /very/ low bar.

I'm interested to hear feedback on this and ideas to further extend it.

Essentially it started out as an exploration of a parallel timeline Venezuela that invested its natural resource wealth like Norway. Though it ended up pretty starkly different from any existing government, especially shortly after the regime came to power in the 60's or 70's. This period is also one I'd like to flesh out far more because it's the weirdest, due to how big of a cultural change the dictator is trying to impose. I also haven't thought very much about how much world history is going to change in this timeline, just due to the culture of this timeline's Venezuela bleeding over to other countries (even if the government doesn't meddle with other states like say the US).

*** From your description:

"So instead higher education would become primarily focused around studying to pass public or private professional exams."

When a measure becomes a target of optimization, it ceases to be a good measure.

Also, now you have exams holding exactly the same place as college degrees.

Not sure what to do about that.

To an extent this is true, but national tests are considerably less game-able than the tradition college system. Having employers pay the cost of vetting their hires outside specialized degrees with national exams also provides a profit incentive to develop effective tests, or purchase them from third parties. It's also much easier to optimize the quality of a test than an entire college, since you can look at the predictive power of past test questions.

This is sort of the point, as I said in the doc [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/19/the-gattaca-trilogy/][colleges are generally filling the roles of tests for employers and are comically terrible at the task.]]

** How would a society function if there was a taboo /against/ monogamy and jealousy? (in other words, if all people were expected to be in open relationships, at least sexually, but preferably completely poly, and monogamists were considered creepy weirdos at best).

What would be the social, cultural, economic and political implications of it?

*** there would be less expectation that any given child of a male's partner is one's progeny, but also more partners' children to care for. or to put it a different way, familial communism. so it either shakes out as less investment on kids being "theirs" or less investment in their kids over all. i'd imagine that they'd still shun deadbeats.\\
it would be clear who the Mother of a child is, so we could wind up with a matriarchal family unit.

Put like that, it's not that difficult to see /why/ people from such a culture might find monogamists creepy. it's possessive.

** So, I'm working on a story, sort of a side project to my serial to keep my brain from ossifying. It's basically about a child going through a botched vampire turn after stealing some blood. Thing is, the vampires in question are on the /Twilight-Luminosity/ deliberately a bit OP end, so I'm trying to think of a way they could get said blood without permission.

So, scernario, kid (they're about tennish, quite canny, basically trying to be a rational fic protagonist but not quite suceeeding) works as a gopher for a twenty year old drug dealer. Is threatened by him, only for vampire girl to murder said drug-dealer. They manage to have something resembling a friendly conversation, enough to learn that turning is possible. He assumes it involves drinking vampire blood, because pop-culture osmosis.

So, how could he concievably steal a bit of this girl's blood? Doesn't have to be very much at all. For context, she's extremely strong and fast, not unfriendly, would probably turn him if he asked, but he's afraid she's say no. About his size.

Actually, while I'm here, the setting is also meant to be a literal Young Earth Creationist world, about a hundred thousand years old or so. Supernatural beings like vampires are all descended from Lilith, first wife of Adam, with various other creatures. Vampires specifically are descended from Lilith mating with Abel's corpse.

Possible implications of such a set up? It is a misotheist setting, in that God is willing to design the world deceptively.
