*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the biweekly challenge, post recommendations, ideas, or general thoughts below.*

To start, two recommendations:

- /Hatchet/ by Gary Paulson
- /The Martian/ by Andy Weir

I think that, like mysteries, Man vs Nature stories will tend to be rational (or close to rational) unless the author screws something up. Man vs Man stories and Man vs Society stories allow far more room for fudging, and there's more counterplay between the protagonist and antagonist -- which gives a lot more room for railroading.

Man vs Nature stories have, at their core, an unthinking opponent, whether it takes the form of a natural disaster, a death world, or some kind of animal. If you're writing a story about problem-solving, that's a boon, since you only really need to model one mind, and there's no need for complex recursion (e.g. he knows that I know that he knows). Despite that, or maybe because of that, Man vs Nature stories can be very satisfactory in terms of vicarious problem-solving. They can also offer a welcome respite from back-stabbing, infighting, etc. (unless you want to make that part of the fun).

** Could the original Halloween movie be considered as fitting into the guidelines of man vs. nature? Michael Meyers is a dude, sure, but he's a noncommunicating dude that can't be reasoned with, and at least in the first movie is only defeated through sheer force. Would that qualify?

*** Well...in my opinion, you could if you were to spin it in such a way that Michael Meyers is mentally impaired enough that he's little more than an animal following certain base urges (I've never seen the movies myself). It would be sort of a modern humans vs. caveman sort of deal; the caveman is physically stronger and has better survival instincts whereas modern humans are more intelligent. I could see you taking that spin and running with it.
