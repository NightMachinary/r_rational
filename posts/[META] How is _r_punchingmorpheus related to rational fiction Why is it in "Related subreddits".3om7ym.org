**** Objecting to removing it (and sorry I'm in late).

[[/u/DaystarEid]] runs that sub, and had specifically asked for it to be featured on the sidebar. It addresses a form of irrational worldview and belief, and addresses it via informing people of how things really are. In particular, it addresses misconceptions that people visiting this sub (eg: people in the LW-o-sphere) are /actually more likely to have/ than randomly-selected redditors.

***** It stands for Less Wrong, which is a community that is really dedicated to rationalism. At one point a while back there was a post on their site that was assumed by some to be a memetic hazard (though it isn't really) called Roko's Basilisk, and a lot of people freaked out about it. That's what the subreddit they're discussing references. Some googling can tell you more if you're curious; I know Eliezer Yudkowsky talked about it in depth on the xkcd subreddit a while back.

****** I think memetic hazards as rather silly, and the idea of a past-venging future AI entity as self-contradictory unless it was aself-made problem (the only reason a rational AI that decides to take revenge on those who didn't contribute to its creation would be created is if the people who created it designed it in a way to take revenge on people who aren't of their group).

** Funny story. It was originally a sub dedicated to the abolition of sleep on the premise that the art we produce now is more thrilling than dreams -- instead, they said, we should spend that time making and consuming rational fiction. Sadly lack of sleep did a number on their heads, and their tired logic suggested that even bothering with art was useless because relationships provide a more primal pleasure. So between sleepless promiscuous nights they're now trying to perfect those through a Dr. Bronner-esque philosophy that we're held in a false entrapping Matrix, termed the Blue Pill, of political correctness and effeteness that dilutes the primality of our desires, but from which the only and equally wrong escape is the Red Pill, representing the domineering view that women are weak and worthless. In short, there is no escape. I repeat there is no escape. Neither pill is acceptable. All we can do is avoid sleep to see the horror with more clarity.

The sleep is behind me right now, isn't it?

**** Not from my perspective.

I would trade my right arm for the ability to never have to sleep again, and never being tired in the sense of feeling like I have to sleep.

I doubt that I don't dream, but I have never been able to remember one, or even have a vague feeling of having been dreaming. I naturally find it more than a little difficult to fall asleep unless I'm exhausted, and once I do fall asleep, I wake up with no time having passed from my perspective.

Unfortunately, if I don't get 7+ hours of sleep, I feel like shit for the whole day.
