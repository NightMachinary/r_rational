This webnovel is a rational fiction based on a D&D adventure run in the 5th Edition Ravnica setting. Ravnica is a massive, sprawling city run by ten carefully balanced guilds. 76 years ago, that balance shattered, and even now tensions between guilds are high despite tenuous order being restored to the city. The characters navigate this delicate landscape as they seek their own destinies. Updates twice weekly.

** Did the title give anyone else hope that it was One Punch Man rational/crackfic?

** Super unrelated but does anyone know if this supplement is canon to actual mtg lore?

*** Yes, the Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica (GGR) sourcebook released by Wizards of the Coast for D&D is canon! MTG and D&D are made by the same company, so their material is generally consistent throughout and they did a great job with the GGR.

We do our best to maintain consistency with the lore in our webnovel as well, and have good reasons for diverging when we do.

Ravnica is a super fun setting, I recommend it :)
