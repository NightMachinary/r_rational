** Hm.

The rules strongly incentivize finding a way to perfectly hide bodies, as it guarantees victory. The rules also do not state that a player cannot sludge, murder, and dismember another player, then dump pieces of him or her somewhere completely inaccessible for non-dismembered humans.

Speculation: this is why the game will get lethal.

*** While I can see someone murdering for this amount of money, they're still on national television. Or at least they believe so, and they are definitely being recorded. Committing murder on a television show is a nice way to get arrested for a long time. Until something crazy happens, I don't see murder and dismembering happening anytime soon.

*** Right now, I don't think that the game implies murder. The game entirely scratches the mystery itch as it's currently laid out, and any extra intrigue necessary to elevate it is covered by the supernatural stuff already implied, and all the weirdness attached to it.

** I really like this so far (extremely Danganropa though it might be) but I can't help but note that we're not on three-chapter-per-day mode yet.
