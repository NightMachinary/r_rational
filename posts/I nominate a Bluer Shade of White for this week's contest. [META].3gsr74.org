Exactly what it says in the title. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][This]] should be a part of this week's contest.


** Hmm. There's probably a range of opinions on this, so good idea on making a meta thread.

The way I'd deal with it is to allow nominations of your or someone else's prior work as suggested reading, a separate category to original work written for the contest.

And since the author of A Bluer Shade of White is the guy running the competitions and set the theme, I'm sure he's aware of the possibility of submitting it. Perhaps he will.

*** I imagine he'll withhold it, but when I saw the theme and started thinking of what might be useful I couldn't help but remember the only story in our cannon that already qualified.

**** I'll withhold it. I'm not averse to entering the weekly challenges, but if I do it will be something new, submitted under a throwaway account.

I /am/ hoping that we get some good ones this week -- I think the sort of children's fairy tales that make up the Disney canon are ripe for it. Wish granting genies! Miraculous powers used in stupid ways! Plots that can be solved within the first twenty minutes by using open communication!

** I had no idea [[/u/alexanderwales]] wrote that! I hope it's at least recognized, it's pretty fantastic.

*** Sadly, the flair field is not big enough to include all of his fantastic works. /alexanderwales [Metropolitan man, A bluer shade of white, Shadowsofthelimelight, The last christmas] is too much for reddits puny engine.
