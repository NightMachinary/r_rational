*** I actually hate having to wait for chapters on things. I was extremely glad that Worm finished up while I was reading it so that I didn't have to wait, especially since I've never read something so... intense.

I almost want to wait until things like Mother of Learning are completed to read it, but you never know when authors are going to stop working on a project.

**** I hate waiting for chapters too, and far prefer attacking a completed work. It's even worse when you've been chewing through hundreds of thousands of words and reach the end, since then you have to wait for weekly or even monthly updates (and that's not even counting the ones that never get a proper ending because the author loses interest).

I've been trying to decide whether it's worth reading Mother of Learning given that it's unfinished, but I suppose it depends on how much longer it's going to be before it's officially complete.

***** Quite a while, unfortunately I can't seem to figure out how find out when each chapter was uploaded, or maybe it's a crappy website and lacks the feature. But I digress, I believe I recall the previous updated status was over a month ago. Also, he has a FAQ on his user page

  Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

  Not even close to the end. The story basically has 3 arcs, and we're only getting close to the end of the first one. I'm really going to have to speed up the pace if I want to finish the story in anything resembling a reasonable time-frame.

** I just got caught up to this one last night. I really want an editor to attack some of the early chapters, but it's a nicely told and engrossing story, with some clever world-building that I only wish owed a little bit less to D&D. I'm looking forward to the next chapter.

**** I spent a lot of today thinking about this, mostly because I realize that I made my criticism in (very nearly) the least helpful way possible. My starting point is that there's nothing inherently wrong with borrowing from whatever your influences are, even if you're not trying a deconstruction or reconstruction. There's nothing wrong with elves that commune with nature and fire their bows with uncanny accuracy, so long as you're telling a good story. I think /Mother of Learning/ is shaping up to be a good story, and so it's not really that the ideas have their genesis in D&D that bothers me. Hell, I have my own D&D inspired novel-that-never-went-anywhere.

Anyway, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it boiled down to two words; Magic Missile. I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons for nearly two decades now, and when I see that on the page I immediately start thinking of the spell as it exists in the game. Worse, it gets introduced as little more than "rod of magic missile", which sort of cements the association for me. So then every time I read "magic missile" for the rest of the story, my brain kicks me out a little bit to say "Hey, like in D&D". But magic missile in the story isn't actually the same as magic missile in D&D, because it follows its own rules under the magic system and shares relatively few properties beyond the base appearance. Magic missile is just an example - there are a number of places where the interesting things done with stock D&D tropes are put later in the fic after my brain has already gotten restless - a quest to kill spiders in the sewers, a vast dungeon beneath the town - some very interesting things are done with these, but you don't get the interesting stuff until you've already stuck it out for tens of thousands of words.

So to suggest a fix (which I've always believed is the polite thing to do when you're making criticism), I would rename magic missile to something less obvious and more original, and I would introduce the lore behind the vast Underdark area much earlier. Those at least would help with my immersion problems. With that said, serial works hardly ever get edited after the fact, and certainly not while they're in active development, so I doubt that this issue is going to be resolved. And despite that, I still liked the story.

***** Magic Missile isn't the only thing he ganked from D&D. Off the top of my head:

- Tenser's Floating Disk

- Fireball (although that's a freebie; the name is super generic)

- Shield (again, super generic)

- Explosive Runes

- Winter Wolves

- Mind Blank

Probably more. That's all that comes to mind, though.

I like the idea of a city on the entrance of the Underdark, though. Very cool setting.

****** I had similar feelings about D&D terminology being used for things that don't actually match up with D&D mechanics. I like how he deviated from standard D&D magical theory - in fact, I think the magic system is great. I just think that the similarities to D&D are /just enough/ to make it awkward when the deviations occur. Using D&D names makes me jump to incorrect conclusions.

A few more:

- "Torch" is the "Light" spell from D&D (he even calls it Light in one instance).
- There's a "Darkness" equivalent, too. (I think he called it de-illuminator?)
- A few variations on Disintegrate are used.
- Feather Fall
- Spider Climb
- Zorian uses cubes that erect Walls of Force, which are basically a variant on Cubes of Force, a standard D&D item.
- Various fae races, elementals, etc.
