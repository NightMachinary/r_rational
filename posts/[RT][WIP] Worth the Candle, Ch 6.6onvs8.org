** u/cthulhuraejepsen:
#+begin_quote
  It's a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul.

I've been updating this at a pretty steady clip but don't want to spam this subreddit, so will probably post here once a week in order to keep from annoying people by having lots of chapters.

You forgot the most crucial request: the firstborn's soul for a steady update rate. Something needs to push the soul cycle to higher speeds after all.

** I really, really like this. The first chapter was decent when you posted it, but now that there's a fair chunk of writing to bite into, I know enough to judge - and I think the story's excellent.

Thanks for sharing it with us!

** Mmm, nice.

I don't know how many other people there are like me but I skipped every single segment discussing your old life and your dnd group, and will probably continue to skip them. I hope they continue to be plot irrelevant.

Also, the coterie minions seem way too much like meaningless NPC goon automata. I'm guessing you didn't intend that, since you don't comment on it in-universe.

But really those are mostly nitpicks, everything else was pleasantly excellent and I'm really looking forward to reading more!

*** Personally, I liked the backstory segments. A lot of rational fics lack emotion and the backstory segments help fully develop the character.
