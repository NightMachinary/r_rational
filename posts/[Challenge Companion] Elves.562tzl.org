*tl;dr: This is the challenge companion thread, post recommendations, comments, or ideas below.*

This challenge topic was chosen because of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53tkpo/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d7wgzcj][this thread]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53tkpo/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d7w628c][this thread]] from two weeks ago. The extent to which the Fair Folk and Elves are synonymous is up for debate, but it largely depends on the author; elves are one of the most varied of the fantasy races, in part because they've been around so long.

So what's there to rationalize? The differences wrought by different lifespans are one place to start, I think; you necessarily have a different outlook if you think that you're going to live another thousand years. Values conflicts are another, though I think there's a risk of simply using fantasy races as reskinned human cultures; elves are French, dwarves are Scottish, and nothing about them is actually all that different from what humanity offers to the author. There's a real opportunity to branch out when you have a whole different race. One interesting way might be to take a random psychological disorder and apply it to the entire species, then see what sort of society might grow out of it. If everyone has narcissistic personality disorder, what does their social system look like?

For recommendations, I would suggest /Lords and Ladies/ by Terry Pratchett and /The Nightmare Stacks/ by Charles Stross. Both are somewhat late into their respective series, but I think both are also thoughtful takes on elves.


** From /Lords and Ladies/, this is the best quote to summarise his take on Elves:

#+begin_quote
  Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.\\
  Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.\\
  Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.\\
  Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.\\
  Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.\\
  Elves are terrific. They beget terror.\\
  The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning.\\
  No one ever said elves are nice.\\
  Elves are bad.
#+end_quote

Basically, Discworld Elves are humanoid dragons. They captivate humans utterly. They are the personification of contemptuous arrogance. They are beautiful and graceful---if you fall prey to their glamour---and utterly unconcerned with the fate of non-elf life.

Of course, there's also a kind of Discworld-logic learning weakness:

#+begin_quote
  *Granny Weatherwax:* You call yourself some kind of goddess and you know nothing, madam, nothing. What don't die can't live. What don't live can't change. What don't change can't learn. The smallest creature that dies in the grass knows more than you. You're right. I'm older. You've lived longer than me but I'm older than you. And better'n you. And, madam, that ain't hard.
#+end_quote

So they're closer to animals than humans in terms of intelligent thought, largely incapable of innovation.

** In addition to the elves mentioned in the OP, I quite like the Dragaerans (called elves by many humans) in Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos novels. They have a lot of significant cultural differences that add up to something genuinely different from most other elves; it feels like Brust puts a lot of effort into making them different and interesting. The books themselves are fairly gritty fantasy novels about a human in an empire of Dragaerans, where magic is extremely common and powerful, and things like teleportation and resurrection are both fairly commonplace.

** This discussion in the comments on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/558at0/can_an_elf_and_a_human_grow_up_together/][this post]] from [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] provides multiple interpretations and a lot of interesting material to work with just by examining if and how human-elf friendships would work. My personal favorites are one that says humans all have ADHD in comparison to elves, and another that says since elves live so long they tend to learn a wide breadth of skills while humans have to specialize.

** Huh this seems [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDDTh1F80oiQy82DtKQcEilFgYfBgxwaOvLnIabAMO8/edit][Relevant]], Feel free to use anything that might inspire. I made it mostly as a gift/exercise for myself so I don't feel possessive of it.

*** That's some really interesting stuff you have there.

I'm curious about the Orcs. Why do those that stay behind tear everything down in their old homeland? Why not keep the larders and storehouses and whatnot?

More generally, have you done anything with all that world building? DMed some game or other for instance? How did it work out?

**** The reason why orcs deconstruct a lot of their infrastructure after the Summer is because most of it is empty. They consume it at vastly increased rate so as to increase the likelihood of the orcs who leave successfully founding new settlements elsewhere.

With a reduced population density in the old home, much of the infrastructure becomes unnecessary, and beyond that, they may no longer have the manpower to maintain all of it. So in stead of leaving it to rot, becoming potentially dangerous for future generations to scavenge from, they deconstruct it into something more manageable.

**** Not done much with these projects, I just like world building things 'properly' I guess?

I did turn one world building project in this vein into a interactive webcomic.

The main reason the orcs tear down what's left behind is in order to nourish and revitalize the soil as well. It's not just destroying, its a selective combination of burn, livestock slaughter and flooding. Everything that can be kept for decades, stored or fermented is, everything else is torn down in order to fuel the regrowth for the later generations.

The orcs practice a kind of controlled apocalypse on their civilizations in order to foster STRONGER resurgences when their population boom is ready.

** One thing that is interesting is that elves almost always exist in worlds with multiple humanoid races. Its very rare for it to be just htem and humans, and almost unheard of for them to be the only race. To some degre in rational fiction you need to justifiy why there are all these different races existing simultaneously before you talk about any one race in particular.
