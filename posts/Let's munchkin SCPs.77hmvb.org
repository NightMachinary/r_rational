For example:

- Encase Professor Umbridge, a redshirt, or a D-class in a cyllindrical object with a hole on the top and the bottom.

- Attach a laser pointer so that it is aimed through both holes in the cyllindric canister, and would go through if the expendable subject weren't in the way.

- place [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-272][SCP-272]] where the laser would hit if the subject weren't in the way, the 'shadow'

- Attach cylinder, person, and laser aparatus to a crank and a generator, rotate cyllinder with motor to create piston action to rotate generator, by moving the shadow and causing SCP-272 to move the subject so that the laser shadow stays on SCP-272.

Or:

- Expose Professor Umbridge and Rita Skeeter, or 2 redshirts, to [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3513][SCP-3513]].

- If possible, remove the beak that forms in their brains; otherwise, cut a hole in the subjects' brains and string one of them upside down above the other.

- Place a funnel in one beak, make sure the other is positioned above the funnel.

- Pour water.

- Add a generator in between.


** I don't think infinite energy is up to par here. Submitted munchkinry should ideally constitute Global Victory, such as by solving the Halting Problem, receiving friendly advice from the distant future, or transporting humanity into a pocket dimension of your personal omnipotence.

**** The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem#Programming_consequences][Halting Problem]] is that you can't necessarily tell if a program will finish running given a certain set of inputs, becuase it will take at least as long to do that as to just run the program and find out. Not sure what that has to do with predicting yourself and then doing the opposite (that would just be a deliberately bad prediction).

****** Shouldn't that prediction then take into account that intention to do the opposite? I would expect an indeterminate prediction rather than any such ability. I'm probably just misunderstanding, though.

**** Anything that can predict any program is not a program, otherwise another program could use that one to predict itself and do the opposite. If some SCP can predict any program, one could prove some math theorems by checking all objects they talk about, or run universe simulations to receive (not necessarily friendly) superintelligent advice.

** One I've come up with a while ago is based on [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-674][SCP-674]]. You precommit to performing some action (such as attempting to kill SCP-682 with a certain SCP) if a given person dies. Then you have someone shoot that person in a security camera, and have them report what happens.

** Christ where to even start, for one given the stuff 294 has dispensed you could likely get it to dispense anomalous materials that would let you achieve world domination, or potentially a cup of grey goo preloaded with an AI that would take on the most consistent version of your utility function or something similar.

Also there's that SCP that is a child with godlike power (so they could probably be relatively easily used to do damn near anything with slight persuasion), plus there's an SCP that is basically god and yet is portrayed as human enough that you could potentially convince them to take actions which would let you achieve world domination either directly or indirectly.

And I mean those are /just the one's I can think of off the top of my head/, the full list of one's you could use like that is probably in the dozens. However, the ultimate issue here is that given the canon of SCP actually trying to do nearly any of these things is likely to end in some horrifying eldritch horror eating the universe. Simply because the world continuing to exist is so much due to luck and precarious balance that trying to do nearly anything of consequence probably dooms humanity (or at least dooms us perhaps marginally faster than we would have been otherwise).

***** This would be a fun munchkin challenge itself. The world conspires to create a fixed amount of "narrative grimdark."

I think the basic idea would be to find the world's sacred values. Then look for plans that would trigger an appropriate amount of ironic suffering in return for concrete, non-sacred improvements.

** SCP Foundation's site has a story centred on this already: [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld][/Visions of a Better World/]]. It's a collaborative work which works like this: someone comes up with a way to muncking an SCP, describes the Foundation doing so; next person writes how it went horribly wrong, and adds another munckinry idea.

Of course, these stories are deliberately written to go wrong, but this is sort-of canon: it's the Foundation's policy to not use SCPs in its work /because/ it's quite likely to backfire. Munchkinry /isn't done/ in this universe, not with anomalies.

--------------

Did that ever stop [[/r/rational][r/rational]], though? Ha! My idea:

Put 1 [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-963][SCP-963]] and 1 recording of any simple memagent capable of putting a slight suggestion on the target in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-914][SCP-914]], refine on "1:1" setting. Iterate until you have a two-stage memagent which rewrites the mind of the victim with the mind of someone who first perceived it. Use it on a trusted operative.

Then infect [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandrewswann-s-proposal][SCP-001.Swann]] with it.

Did someone mention "Global Victory"?

*** This is SCP-001's reaction to your munchkining attempt:

SCP #: SCP-██

Special Containment Procedure: Feed SCP-██ to SCP-963 under the setting "Very Super Entropic Coarse", with a cleaning crew nearby to witness.

Description: SCP-██ is some dude from [[/r/rational]] who thought he could munchkin SCP-001.Swann. So we wrote an SCP for him.

**** That'll never get approved! SCP-001.Swann is self-policing: it will not allow such a low-grade article into the database, because the majority of it would not want that. It breaks the Foundation's character, and nothing which breaks the narrative would be accepted, while anything which is /good/ for the narrative could be implemented. This is a huge weakness, a weakness most authors exhibit that a clever meta-character could exploit.

Additionally, SCP-001.Swann does not, in general, have self-preservation instinct or anything similar. Likely, it doesn't consider anything happening in the database/simulated world "real", and would find attempts to munchkin it /entertaining/, rather than dangerous, more entertaining than smiting "people" who try to munchkin it. It will happily approve such attempt, if framed remotely fine.

Naturally, that would be its downfall.

  But we found out that there is a God, and it is SCP-001.

This is my interpretation: SCP-001.Swann is the only non-fictional SCP. SCP-001 exists. SCP-001 is the SCP universe, and everyone who has contributed to SCP is part of SCP-001.

Your best bet to munchkin SCP-001.Swann is to hack the website, become admin, and change articles. Or buy the website from its owners. Something like that.

And yes, my little story will never get approved.
