I wonder if Banksy II is the successor to the BFG as well as the well-known subversive graffiti artist. Banksy II got mentioned in the first and last chapters-- they're responsible for launching JUROR's career as well as changing Chili's heart. Perhaps it was Banksy II who is responsible for Mahuika's vaping, too?

--------------

Edit:

I was so wrong with my guesses lol.

I really ought to have figured out what Mahuika's best course of action was. It was pretty heavily foreshadowed in chapter 21 when Mahuika vaped. And in chapter 20 when Mahuika vaped. And in like one or two other chapters.

So, my bad, but not /that/ hard to miss.

Went back searching for "juice" in previous chapters and stumbled on something else. I don't know if anybody else figured it out, but the BFG is the one who makes the better vapes than Wonkaland.

The BFG is totally putting dreams in the vapes, so that's pretty rad. Dunno what the other product would be, but I wonder if it's also dream related.

I had also assumed, maybe incorrectly, that the other product Bucket's beat at are suspenders, since we know Urkeldelphia is the number one exporter of them (and human suffering).

In retrospect, it's also amusing that Charlie's got Urkeldelphia beat for suffering -- just not the export of it, and not human.

this is racist. straight up anti-semitism, no qualifiers.

I don't like isreael either, but that's not what he said. he said jews as a race have a character trait that provokes people, and that implied that this is what provoked hitler to murder millions of them.

******* I disagree with both counts. Often racism is just thoughtless or malicious bigotry, but when there is a larger context, it's important to consider it and look at it through these qualifiers. Otherwise you're falling into the trap of labeling things and arbitarily drawing a line on the floor for "bad as fuck." It's attractive to hate something that deserves to be hated, but it also perpetuates the cycle of hatred. Dahl's case especially isn't black and white. He says he's not anti-Semitic, but if you consider this statement unambiguously racist, then where do you draw the line for "racist as fuck"?

Also, I don't see how that statement is "straight up anti-semitism." It's a syllogism that wouldn't be out of place in some book explaining why Jews in particular have such a long history of persecution. I don't have any feelings toward Jews, but growing up learning about the hatred spanning since biblical times, I've wondered what about Jewish culture triggers this ancient abuse. So if I look at this long chain of empirical data and conclude that there must be something about Jewish culture that provoked it, does that make me racist as fuck?

yes. First, lots of cultures have been conquered over the years. there is no "long chain of empirical data" that supports blaming something in the jewish character for the suffering they experienced under Hitler. It's atrocious victim blaming.

********* There's several problems here, some of which may be fundamental differences in worldview.

1. Lots of cultures have been conquered - what's the follow up? Are you arguing that Jews have been laboring under the "conquered" status for the past few millenia and barring that, there has never been a reason why they've been persecuted beyond the circular "they are victims because they are victims"? Also your statement is completely incompatible with Dahl's "empirical racism" against Israeli Jews (he's against them because they victimized others, not because they're victims).

2. You're emotionally conflating premise with outcome (Dahl's statement that Jewish culture provokes animosity with the implication that they deserved the Holocaust/suffering). You're also conflating the WW2 instance of anti-semitism with every other instance.

3. That opening is certainly nothing new. But there's quite a difference between "I'm not anti-semitic. I'm anti-Israeli." and "I'm not anti-semitic, but Jews deserve their suffering." Again, think context, not just grouping things together because they share surface characteristics. Though it feels like you're arguing against my words without having read the wiki at all.

P.S. sorry, looks like I cut the full quote before:

*********** Mm, in the context of everything he's saying, it's less likely "generosity" is meant fiscally than as an allusion to the insular nature of Jewish communities.

I already hinted at it above, but I think you're falling hard into confirmation bias. You're just ignoring any inconvenient context since you've already decided to label it as clearly evil racism. Part of the problem is we're talking past each other (beyond the fact that you're ignoring everything I say and cherry picking the easy jabs). Racism and anti-semitism have different nuances here. He makes a blanket assertion about Jewish character provoking animosity, which meets the definition of 'racist', but that's about as racist as saying Americans are arrogant and entitled, except much more sensitive given history of persecution. That's different than the kind of anti-semitism you're accusing him of - saying there's a reason for something is not the same as condoning the Holocaust or saying they deserved it.

Yes, his statement is "racist" (there are always degrees), but it's not "straight up anti-semitism."

************ And I think you are biased to try and provide excuses for a plainly antisemetic statement. You stretching everything you can to try and weasel out of reading it exactly as it is. I'm sticking to the core points because those are what matter.

I'm not claiming he condones the holocaust outright if that's your concern. But he minimizes it, victim blames, and displays gross racial prejudice. Saying the Jewish character causes people to hate them is racist full stop. Saying Hitler had his reasons is racist full stop. Using terms like "a filthy old Syrian Jewess" in your writing unironically is racist full stop.

No amount of qualifying changes this.

************* I'm not providing excuses, I'm pointing out the context. Neither am I stretching anything - I'm going off exactly what he said, whereas your interpretation relies on a lot of assumptions of his meaning (textbook case of FAE), most of which I've refuted above. When you say you're sticking to core points, it feels like you're really saying you're looking at what he said in a vacuum and you don't care for "shades of grey" or context because you've already made up your mind.

Yeah you don't claim that, but you are implying that he thinks they deserved it - which is a grossly overreaching interpretation of his actual words. Otherwise, I agree with all 3 counts (minimizing, victim blaming, prejudice). It's an extremely insensitive racist comment. But it doesn't make sense to attribute malice to his meaning when the core point of his statement is a plain syllogism. Which is why I disagree with using blanket statements from the opposite side to simplify racism and lump all cases together as "racism full stop" or "straight up anti-Semitism". I think there's an unfortunate tendency with sensitive topics like racism to trigger this kind of black and white labeling and stonewall any attempt to look at it from a different angle.

I'm not a Dahl scholar and he really may have been anti-semitic to the level of condoning hostility against all Jews, but I don't see that here.

P.S.

#+begin_quote
  Saying Hitler had his reasons is racist full stop.
#+end_quote

What? Regardless of the validity of those reasons, he had reasons. Every other anti-semitic group through the millenia had reasons. From a purely empirical POV, postulating that there's a reason Jewish culture consistently provokes animosity is "racist" and insensitive, but academic.

#+begin_quote
  Using terms like "a filthy old Syrian Jewess" in your writing unironically is racist full stop.

The pace of releases (which is happening after a month in which there were suspiciously no posts) reads to me like gazemaize took a month to write the entire climax sequence, and has been posting the stuff he wrote in that month in quick succession.
