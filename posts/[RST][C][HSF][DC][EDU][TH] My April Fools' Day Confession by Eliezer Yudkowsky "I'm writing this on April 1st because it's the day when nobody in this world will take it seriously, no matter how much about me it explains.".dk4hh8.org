** Most of the story is a fun worldbuilding exercise, but I've always thought the ending was kind of insufferable. It's basically "My ideas are so unprecedented and good, and my writing is so revolutionary, and the above worldbuilding is so clever that it's vanishingly unlikely I could be a mere human who grew up on the same Earth as the rest of you." It's a little too self-congratulatory to be in good taste, IMO.

**** No, I don't think you believe you're literally from another world. I /do/ think that the long paragraph near the end, where you list off a bunch of your achievements like "oh clearly it's more likely that some rando could do all of this", is written with intentional irony. On the surface, it denies the "from another world" interpretation. The between-the-lines reading, which is not exactly thinly veiled (and I don't think you meant it to be), frames the listed achievements as so improbably impressive that the "/not/ from another world" interpretation is made to sound absurd. And that does read as self-congratulatory even in the context of April Fool's, because it's about things you've actually done, and the story is set up early on as a "haha, what a funny joke...but /maybe.../" thing, and the paragraph I mentioned is one of the parts where your goal seems to be to introduce that doubt.

To put it more concisely: I don't think the parts where you state you're from another world are sincere. What I do think is sincere is the implication that your achievements are so impressive as to plausibly introduce even a hint of doubt that you're from Earth.

This isn't me looking down on you. I've enjoyed much of your work. I'm just not a fan of the ending of this particular story.

***** Seems to me like you're doing the thing where some people quote /me/ as saying "I see little hope for democracy as an effective form of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims complicit in their own destruction." Admittedly, a fanfiction about an alternate Eliezer Yudkowsky might in one sense seem like a more plausible candidate for something I secretly sort-of believe, than the words I put in the mouth of Literally Voldemort. Except for the part where, since the beginning of time, not one unusual thing has ever happened. Nobody in the history of time from Newton onward and backward was ever "so impressive as to introduce a hint of doubt that they're from Earth". /I know that./ I am a good enough reductionist to teach others how it's done. It is, or ought to be, /much/ more plausible that I see little hope for democracy and am writing that cryptically under the guise of Literally Voldemort. You have mistaken the voice of a character for the voice of the author. And I say again that in one sense this is a more understandable mistake, since on surface level the character seems so much more based on me; and yet I also say again that it should have been much less plausible that my true opinion sort of resembled his, because I tried to teach you to reject even the /slightest hint and insinuation that one unusual thing had ever happened./ I learned at a very young age not to be impressed by the sleight-of-hand that assembles a clever-sounding argument for why there might be a teapot in the asteroid belt, even or especially when it was my own brain generating the argument; that was where my journey began, with the search for a kind of thinking that /couldn't/ argue impressively for any conclusion. I assure you I am no more impressed by a clever-sounding case for why someone might be a reincarnate from another world.

It's all well and good to remark on how the argument seems self-congratulatory, but the conclusion of it is impossible. Literally impossible. It's supposed to look like a self-congratulatory argument for violating conservation of momentum. "I am so awesome that 12 is a prime number" is perhaps less of a boast than it might sound to the mathematically unsophisticated. Now maybe the argument for my transdimensionality seems less like that if you do /not/ know down to your core that not one unusual thing has ever happened, or if you are seeing through the eyes of people who think that the world is soft around the edges and has some room for arguments to push it just a little. In a similar sense, somebody who thinks there's a little softness around the edges of mathematics might wonder if "I am so awesome that 12 is a prime number" is maybe being spoken by someone believes it just a little and thinks that 12 is a tiny bit less prime. But that I am of the Earth alone is a very solid truth that is not friendly to any arguments trying to push against it, and it is not impossible to guess that I would know that too.

****** You seem to be hung up on the idea that I think that you believe there's a nonzero chance that you're from another world. I do not. If I thought so, I would have called the ending bizarre or deluded instead of insufferable.

A hyperbolic brag is still a brag. If you say "I did X, Y, and Z, which is so awesome that 12 is a prime number," it doesn't sound /less/ like bragging than "I did X, Y, and Z, which is so awesome that I must be in the top 1% of geniuses." Doubly so if you write "I did X, Y, and Z, which is so awesome that 12 is a prime number" into a story where 12 actually is a prime number, when in the real world you actually did X, Y, and Z. Doubly so again if the premise of the story is that if 12 /were/ a prime number it would explain how improbably great you are.

If you feel I misread your intent in this story, I think it's worth asking yourself why so many people have apparently misread it in the same way, and what the common denominator might be. Maybe you intended readers to think, "Even though these arguments about the author's real-life achievements, delivered via his self-insert, are being used as evidence for something that's true in the universe of the story, that thing is /not/ true in real life; therefore the aspect of this that is the author sounding obnoxiously impressed with himself must also be fictional." But that's a charitable read, not an inescapable conclusion. A reader can be 100% certain that alt-universe bodyswaps can't happen, and also 100% certain that /you're/ 100% certain of that, and still read the list of your achievements as boastful. It's boastful to imply that it was extraordinarily improbable for "some guy" to accomplish what you have, even if you still think it's /less/ probable (and in fact impossible) that he's a body-hopper from another dimension.

Still--whatever you say your intention was, I'll believe it. Only you know your own mind. I would ask you in turn to believe me and others who have said the story /comes across/ as profoundly arrogant.

I hesitated a lot about writing this. On the one hand, you and CeruleanTresses have seemingly came to a mutual understanding and if I try to lecture you after that, I will feel like a dick. On the other hand, it took you three messages to understand his point - the point that was amazingly, wordlessly obvious to anyone non-status-blind from his first message. (Another thing that was obvious to me at least is that CeruleanTresses is not a hater from a place-that-shall-not-be-named).

You were not accused of saying " I am so awesome that 12 is a prime number". You were accused of saying "I am so awesome that it's more likely that 12 is a prime number than that I am not awesome. Yes, I know that 12 is not a prime, and I know you know that. But I can say what I said in public and get away with it, while if you try the same, you would just be laughed out of the room". We know that's not what you meant, but that's what you, in fact, said - just not in so many words.

(I did not think about your arrogance when I was reading your "confession" for the first time - I still have trouble predicting such reactions, but now I at least can recognize and understand them.)

Hope I helped!

While you are on that topic, have you considered how the original audience's infatuation with Voldemort even as he committed increasingly heinous acts (I can recall people still defending Quirrelmort even after he AK'd the centaur) kind of mirrors the draw of the alt-right movement? It was pretty obvious that Quirrelmort was evil to me after the Azkaban Prison arc. But from what I recall of audience reaction on reddit and less wrong, nerd contrarianism and utilitarianism worked together with the fact that you made Quirrelmort just too damn cool and awesome and so many readers failed to internalize the fact that he was outright evil.

The obvious fix (if you can ever bring yourself to edit HPMOR), is to make Quirrelmort less awesome/more pathetic in a way that mirrors real life fascist wannabe's. You might have Quirrelmort quote a few out of context statistics that Harry latter finds to be blatantly wrong, or quote some medical "facts" about muggles vs. wizards that Harry learns to be wrong, or add in an anecdote about how Voldemort's spam AK has backfired before but then Quirrelmort refuses to admit this in his conversation over the effulgence potion making. Just a few cracks to the facade of all around awesomecool mcbadass aura that Quirrel has going would go a long way into cutting into his image.

Of course, given your luck and the direction your image has been going... if you had Quirrelmort quote parodies of racist crime statistics and/or racist human biodiversity pseudoscience a portion of the internet would take that unironically seriously and celebrate your promotion of their racist cause and another portion would cite it as evidence that you've gone full alt-right, so maybe actually ignore this advice....

Well now I have an idea for a recursive fanfic parodying Quirrelmort by having him spout off some pseudoscience over tea with HJPEV while Harry in response takes a milquetoast centrist response (because surely Quirrel can't be that mistaken).

*TLDR*; The problem isn't that you failed to make Quirrelmort blatantly evil, it is that you made him too awesome and cool.

I kinda think the Watsonian explanation there is that, as a society, they /choose/ to build their large cities in areas with this particular geography.

There's actually a surprisingly common effect in the real world, where the "rich" side of town also just happens to be built on a more geologically stable surface, where the "poor" part of town isn't.

That's why rich people tend to live in areas that the locals refer to as "the hills" - generally hills are places where the local bedrock is easier to get to and build on.

The problem with this split is that the houses the poor live in tend to have a higher incidence of foundation and infrastructure issues (cracking, basement flooding, etc) due to the poor quality of the area for building on top of, which you'd imagine is something they would want to minimize in this story.

*** You don't have to drill a tunnel. You can build the tunnels above ground and then build the city's structures above them. This is cheaper and makes handling drainage vastly more feasible.

If you were modifying an existing city to adopt autonomous electric cars, you could start constructing buildings and public spaces over existing roads. If we take NYC for example, imagine constructing a new "street" level over the existing streets. On this new level, instead of roads you might just have wide sidewalks with plenty of trees, separated bike lanes, public parks, vegetable gardens, greenhouses, etc. This is the level where you'd have all of the buildings establish their new front doors. The old ground-level doors would get closed off to help prevent people and animals from wandering out into the tunnels, and the old first floors would have an area get converted into a drop-off/pick-up point for people traveling by the autonomous cars that serve the entire city. You could leave a space for several cars that remain on standby so anyone leaving the building can get just inside, state their destination, and be on their way immediately. A phone app could be used to communicate with the car to handle billing and provide a built-in address book, so you can instruct it to go to so-and-so's place and have the car bring you to the correct address.

If these 'tunnels' below the new surface level are about 32 feet tall, you'd have enough room for two levels of traffic including loaded flatbed trailers. With this approach, all upper-level traffic could go north/south and all lower-level traffic could go east/west (with the roads that were formerly going in other directions being converted into on/off ramps to the other level). That would get you EY's aim of having the cars move without traffic lights, and would plausibly end traffic jams in NYC. With fully autonomous vehicles using these tunnels designed like highways, you could also safely increase the speed limit to 125 kmph as EY described (~78 mph). As an example of the impact that would have, it looks like the fastest travel time from the World Trade Center to Harlem right now is about 36 minutes considering traffic, but this approach would likely reduce that to about 7 minutes.

This would certainly put a lot of people out of work. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, valets, parking attendants, traffic police, etc. Combine that with drastically reduced travel times and you'd free up absolutely enormous amounts of human time that could be better spent. In a sane economic system, we'd welcome automation, but obviously we don't and we'll have to fix some rather substantial problems before we can achieve some semblance of a rational economy.

**** He didn't discuss moveable foundations, he discussed modular foundations. The foundation or platform the house sits on is stationary but designed so that a building can be lowered on top of it and fitted into place. In turn, the house structure itself would have to be designed with a support structure under the floors which can support the weight of the house either on a modular foundation or on the mobile supports that lift it and transport it.

I'm not a fan of his idea to basically have massive stationary cranes that are kilometers long. Engineering that seems difficult-to-impossible, and the likely initial costs plus maintenance seem unreasonable for the benefit it would provide. A much more plausible approach would be to have the modular houses and foundations, but use a portable house-lift to pick the house up and move it. It's not too hard to imagine a road-transportable house-lift that could lift a house over any trees or other yard obstacles and then suspend it up in the air while slowly moving down narrow residential streets until reaching a street large enough to set it down on a transport vehicle in a less precarious position before hauling it off to the desired address.

****** Crap, good point. It does seem feasible to use the tunnels, but it would be tricky. If the tunnels are large enough to allow for flatbed trailers, you'd have about a 14-foot ceiling to work with, but you might use up 4-5 feet of that for the wheels and structure of the vehicle. That still leaves potentially enough space to transport a modular basement, then each floor, and finally the roof, so you should be okay if you can break the houses up into modular layers.

Supporting the layers during this process could be somewhat tricky. You'd have to lift the rest of the house off of the basement and then pull the basement out by itself. You might temporarily install a ground-level house support that could hold the rest of the building after it's been lifted up a few feet, then start sliding the parts out one-by-one.

I'm not really sure how you'd handle the sides of the building and the ground level if you're using this approach. The roof presumably sticks out past your walls, so the first floor presumably has some exterior ground around the walls that extends out as far as the roof does. Still, that would have to leave a little gap in the ground as an error margin, and that gap could become a problem for drainage and erosion, as well as issues with buildup of insects and debris, aside from potentially looking ugly. The best bet with that is probably to put down a walking path that goes over the gap, both to help seal it shut and to conceal it. Picking up that path and moving it could be somewhat annoying, but it might also be something that could be automated if the path is composed of parts with standardized sizes, shapes, and weights.

There's a [[https://equilibriabook.com/molochs-toolbox/][chapter]] where a visitor from a "relatively well-functioning world" picks apart our civilization, and it's really amazing.

*** God that chapter is hard to read. It's riddled with over-generalizations and simplifications of people, and engages in some questionable ideas:

- There are consistent themes that a planned economy with ever-increasing specialization will somehow work better, with no acknowledgement of the possibility that each specialization increases information asymmetry. Furthermore, specialization leads to EE's much maligned red-tape.
- Prediction markets would only work if it was a mandated part of a job. There's always other shit to do.
- /"And on our planet, Uber and Lyft are currently fighting it out with taxi companies and their pet regulators after exactly that development." -/ Or, they're using massive amount of venture capital to drive competitors out of business so that they can seek to extract rents later while arguing that they are responsible for no part of their actual business.
- Regulation is seen as something that only prevents change from happening, rather than something that also protects idiots from Radium toothpaste. This also seems to follow the mid-college idea of assuming there are no malefactors, or that malefactors have no real power and only follow incentives. The problem is there are malefactors, a lot of them. Just look at the opioid crisis. Or global warming.
- This shows a pernicious underlying bias towards people choosing the best and choosing factual information over lies. Political science seems to be pointing otherwise.
- There's an unrealistic degree of trust expected in the system of planners. Results based metrics (which somehow don't fall victim to Goodhart's fallacy) for everyone! Somehow this will not create a noise-ocracy, where everyone is bombarded by even more information attempting to fix the fallacies of the last measure or the definition of the measures themselves won't be subject to regulatory capture.
- There's very little dealing with local monopolies. This is especially germane to rural medicine.
- The political section is particularly bad. Politicians are seen as 100% responsive to what the political consensus is, without an acknowledgement that they're independent actors with their own beliefs that help form consensus/ the Overton window. Furthermore, there's not much talk on how voters frequently align to stances the party takes.\\
- There's not much acknowledgement of the fact that /solving metaproblems means that several groups loose power/. Let's take a widely known one: switching to a Parliamentary system would generally result in a more Democratic country as well as a more democratic one. Republicans know this and so resist meta-reforms. This isn't new either; change the party names and country, and it's one of the reasons pre-Revolutionary Americans weren't offered seats in Parliament.
- There's the textbook Econ fallacy of assuming a rational consumer in healthcare. When there's an emergency, the average person is not going to comparison shop even if the info is available. The patient goes in the ambulance 911 sends.

I have more issues, particularly with the ever-present libertarian problems of ignoring how poverty affects the current system and proposed solutions, and the magical belief that their proposed systems are incorruptible.

*** Would you be willing to summarize the chapter's punchlines? Or even just your favorite bits? Skimming it there seem to be interesting ideas but the author's a bit... wordy. Some odd bits stick out though, e.g.

#+begin_quote
  You see, during the first half of the twentieth century, it became conventional to measure something called “p-values” which imposed a qualitative distinction between “successful” and “unsuccessful” experiments... somebody who tried using unconventional statistical methods, even if they were better statistical methods, wouldn't be able to publish their papers in the most prestigious journals. And then they wouldn't get hired. It's similar to the way that the most prestigious journals don't publish mere replications, only discoveries, so people focus on making discoveries instead of replications.
#+end_quote

This hasn't been true, in my experience.

**** I'm not a published researcher, so I don't have personal experience. If you have, your observations may be more relevant.

But it echoes a position expressed several times on schischow, an exceptionally accessible and generally well-researched look into scientific academia. Scientific research is a trade, and scientists depend on income, via grant money or new patents for their employers. There is significant economic pressure to publish original research rather than peer review.

***** oh yeah, there are definitely lots of structures in place that incentivize the production of poor research, and maybe ones that incentivize the worse sort of underpowered, biased NHST that the passage dislikes (e.g. scientists need to churn out enough LPUs for tenure and don't have time to learn newfangled methods that better accommodate uncertainty, measurement error, etc. and give them less-sexy results), it was more my reading of prestigious journals disliking

#+begin_quote
  unconventional statistical methods, even if they were better statistical methods
#+end_quote

directly, rather than the low-quality datasets that they might be applied to. In my experience, journals love newer, fancier methods, often to their own detriment (e.g. when the invented method is wrong and there exists an actual solution the authors are unfamiliar with, or they just toss some newer buzzwordier technique at a problem over something simpler)
