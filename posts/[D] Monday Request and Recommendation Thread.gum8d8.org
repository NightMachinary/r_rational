Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Any good, rational time travel stories? Ones that really explore deep into the ramifications of its mechanics.

An example in HPMOR is when Harry tried to use time travel to pull answers out of nothing through logically using a closed time loop. The result was finding that time itself worked like the funny-illogical format of HP magic.

*** Have you played the flash game called "No one has to die"? It's a very interesting take on time travel where your consciousness is transferred with a machine to a set time in the past and when you transfer into the past, you end up in a parallel universe but can't really know which parallel universe you jumped into. It involves brute forcing with a brilliant experiment to find out if the machine actually worked, time travel hell and discussion about said time travel mechanics. The gameplay isn't much and isn't that great, but it serves the purpose of narrating the story and the story is all that matters.

I would like y'all recommendation for stories where the main character is an AI or other such created intelligence.

*** I have two recommendations, as long as you don't mind that they are not strictly sci-fi.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission][Mud's Mission]] This is a fun story from the point of view of a mud Golem. The mechanics of it are treated almost identical to what you might expect from a robot, even going so far as to have "The three rules of Golemancy."

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] This one is from the POV of a biological weapon with a loose human personality framework stapled to it.. Less of an AI in the traditional sense, but it is still a constructed intelligence with underlying directives driving its motivations. Worth noting that this one has a tendency to vacillate between super campy and body horror.

The AI had been with him for years, learning to observe his brain state and perceive through his senses but unable to communicate with him, but has just become able to do so through freak chance. And because this protocol of non-communication has been broken, this instance of the AI and the man must work together to survive or else they will both be destroyed.

Generally rational approach to intelligence gathering regarding the various threats and mysteries, in terms of what the heck is going on and how do you protect yourself from threat when facing the reality of such a gross invasion.

I will note that the first few chapters include some pretty extreme body horror (self-mutilation), but that this aspect tapers off significantly after that.

** Recommending [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26494/path-of-the-whisper-woman][Path of the Whisper Woman]]. It follows a girl who wants to become one of the right-hand women to their spooky goddess.

I'm recommending it here for two (and a half) reasons: The worldbuilding is done well, in that it's not just infodumping information on you, but is instead revealed organically; while the story is nominally about the viewpoint character's quest to become a "whisper woman", it's also largely about dealing with the psychological trauma of dealing with manipulative/abusive/narcissistic parenting, and so spends a lot of time examining thoughts and thinking processes and whatnot; reason one half is that I just think it's really good and ought to get more eyeballs.

The main character gets powerful pretty quickly, but even now where he is regarded among the most powerful mages, it's pretty clear that he's missing a lot of the knowledge and power that other people at his station have. Highly recommend for its vibrant world and good characters.

***** I'm about 40 out of 81 chapters in, and I'd say that's sufficient background knowledge for you to read and enjoy it. The general framework for Origin of Species is based off of the Kanto region which is the first gen of games along with Pokemon up to the fourth gen (Sinnoh region - Diamond and Pearl). Not all Pokemon are physically described as they appear so you might need to google what they look like as you read if you want a picture in your head.

Most of the major side characters like gym leaders are from the first gen so remembering who they are adds enjoyment. There are a few insider Pokemon culture jokes that might go over your head but I wouldn't let that stop you at all from reading. I highly recommend reading it, been having a blast with the story!

You might miss some predictable outcomes and some jokes like Oak scolding Red over the phone for biking indoors, and I suppose the lack of knowledge about the actual pokemon might be a little annoying, but nothing is really left unexplained so you won't be lost.

The real draw of the story, I think, is the quality of the character development and the talent the writer has for promoting a way of thinking without losing the feeling of genial broad-mindedness (after the early chapters at least).

** Recommending [[https://storiesonline.net/s/73545/island-mine][Island Mine]] by Refusenik. It's a completed Rationalist story about an alien artificial intelligence that crashes to Earth and makes contact with an ex-military college student, and the lengths that the government will go when you have something they want. It has a very "fight the power" feel, reminding me of Cory Doctorow's /Pirate Cinema/ and /Little Brother./ Overall it's very well-written, with a smart protagonist and a satisfying payoff.

I'm not sure if it's "artsy" in the same manner, as I haven't read the novel, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]] has significantly more advanced prose than most rational fics. It's a Harry Potter fanfic, where Hermione is born in the 1920ies and somehow strikes up a not-friendship with young Tom Riddle, who becomes not quite as monstrous in his youth. They both attend Hogwarts eventually.

*** I mean, if you liked Remains of the Day you're probably somewhat different than me, but on the other hand, you're asking for recs here...

/You/ by Austin Grossman is quite good. Um, I'd describe it by comparing it to Tad Williams' /Otherland/ crossed with the classic play-within-a-play gag and set as a nostalgic retrospective, but that's a bit of a niche reference.

Or if you want something more classic, Herman Hesse's /The Glass Bead Game/ is really good. The first section at least.

Iain Banks' /Feersum Endjinn/ was fun.

/China Mountain Zhang/ by Maureen McHugh actually isn't super literary from a prose perspective, but it's good, and it's about people.

Oh, and how could I forget Gene Wolfe's /Book Of The New Sun/. Literary out the wazoo.

*** I've only seen the Hopkins film for The Remains of the Day, so I might be missing the mark. I'm guessing you might have read the first two.

/Kokoro/ by Soseki. Protagonist on vacation takes to a man he calls "Sensei" and slowly hears his story. Never finished it but the writing is great.

Murakami's /Norwegian Wood/. Also never finished but the writing is great.

The classic /Night on the Galactic Railroad/. Needs little introduction besides saying that it was more mature than I expected.

You might like the anime films of Shinkai Makoto. I never got into them much, but I didn't dislike /The Place Promised in Our Early Days/.

The visual novel /Symphonic Rain/. A somewhat complicated love story involving a young music student protagonist who sees a fairy that no-one else does, and his childhood friends and classmates. Excels at atmosphere.

** Random question: what's up with the capitalization of words in some rational fics, and rationalist writings more generally? (Or: am I completely making up this phenomenon?)

I can try to dig up examples if desired, but I have a strong sense that frequently Eliezer Yudkowsky writes sentences along the lines of, "Curing death would be Good", or, "It would be Madness to do artificial intelligence research without pondering the control problem".

Does this come from Terry Pratchett perhaps or something? Am I totally making this up?

*** Sometimes it is used to differentiate between descriptors and perceived universal laws. Think in terms of D&D; chaotic and Chaotic are very things, same with good and Good. Good is a fundamental property of the D&D universe that even the gods must adhere to, while good is just the opposite of bad. Capitalizing it refers to the platonic ideal of the concept rather than a specific instance of it. This is likely what most of what you're seeing from these sorts of writers.

More generally, it is making the word into a proper noun. The white house in your neighborhood is different from The White House, where the capitalized one refers to a specific, often famous version of the more generalized noun.

Also, as [[/u/Flashbunny][u/Flashbunny]] said, it might just be someone mistakenly capitalizing something. All nouns in German are capitalized, so Germans who learn English often have a hard time determining whether or not they're supposed to capitalize a word since it depends a lot on the context. I'm sure many other languages have similar differences in capitalization but I'm not as familiar with them.
