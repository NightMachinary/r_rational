** PRT for pseudo-rational, and not because the Parahuman Response Team is monitoring everyone who views this, definitely not....

*** "Hey Dragon -- start dictation."

This was surprisingly readable, considering I haven't read any of the previous chapters.

** Really enjoying this fic. It's total crack, which is like a drug to me. Glad to see the /Worm/ crossover part is more than just in name. Looking forward to see where author-surrogate-aka-"Dragon" is going with this Endbringer stuff, and see if the rest of the S9 show up.

**** Sorry, bad joke was bad. I honestly don't know what to think of Dragon's transformation from (what I thought was) a piece of programmable technology with no personality, to a sarcastic artificial intelligence. (Just putting "sarcastic" and "artificial intelligence" in the same sentence makes my head hurt, but by all means, so whatever you want so long as it makes it as fun to write as it is to read ...)

***** Well, Hermione is basically a Tinker now, so maybe Dragon fell in love. Nothing like a romance story between a 12 year-old girl and an ancient magical artifact of power.

****** ಠ_ಠ

But at the same time, yes omg, anything to make this fic crazier

ETA: On that note, do you happen to know where I can read that fic where Hermione ends up in the Very Potter Musical world, and then ends with a thinly-veiled rant at Eliezer to write faster, dammit?

******* Did...did you want to? Because that's what this fic was. I...really? I could put it up as an alternative version, maybe at the end of this arc, if you want me to....

******** You don't have to incorporate it into the fic as it is now, since you have an awesome plot and alternate versions could interrupt the flow, but yeah if I could read that again I would appreciate it because I laughed for 10 minutes.

But I really love the story both ways, so /internal conflict/ It's your thing, do what you want
