I'm starting chapter 8 and I'm worried the story's going to go in a direction where I won't enjoy it anymore. What do I mean? Basically, I really dislike evil characters. I'm worried that this is gonna be a story about Catherine falling down the slippery slope of Evil, caring less and less about the morality of her actions, and being warped by her Role.

Is there a ray of hope throughout, or does it keep getting worse?

I'm not bashing the story, I just don't want to spend my time on something I know I'm gonna hate.


** Without getting deep into spoilers territory, Catherine never stops caring about the morality of her actions. She /is/, however, an "ends justify the means" sort of girl, but she doesn't often get to a position where she's easily confident that she's at the right point on that Laffer Curve, if you will.

** Spoilers for up to Chapter 12. I think I made it vague enough that you can read the spoilers, but you might want to wait until after reading that chapter. She'll do something very evil in Chapter 12. Don't expect anything much worse than that. It gets mentioned later on as one of her biggest regrets; she thought it was necessary at the time, but in the long run it wasn't really.

Another vague spoiler, for an example of a notable atrocity: A certain group massacres/enslaves tens of thousands of people. After defeating them, she has the people directly responsible crucified. Hundreds of them

In any case, the story isn't really about a good person becoming an evil one. It's more about trying to create progress in a world that's designed not to go anywhere. Or maybe trying to make something that will last in a world where a single person could potentially have the power to destroy entire cities. Main character doesn't commit any horrible atrocities lightly, at least. No slaughtering civilians/non-combatants, nothing evil done without good reason.

** Catherine is sort of similar to Taylor from Worm in that her morality is very much shades of grey. There is some degree, as well, of protagonist-bias towards viewing Cat as moral. She does some terrible things, but she also does some great things.

Remember that in this context "Evil" = agency and free choice while "Good" = unthinking worship of the gods. More or less. Cat certainly doesn't worship the Gods Below or Above, and there's a reason a lot of readers went into a lot of discussion about the possibility of her somehow creating a "Neutral" third faction.

In short, this is NOT a book about a character falling down the slippery slope of Evil, so if that is your concern, don't worry about that. She's not really going to become a paragon of virtue at any point either, though. Cat is practical and seems to have a knack for subverting the narrative tropes that drive the world, and she can be ruthless in pursuit of her goals. But it's not a slippery slope story.

** I just finished binging over the last couple weeks and caught up yesterday. Depending on what your threshold is for "down the hole to evil", you will probably be ok. That being said....the author needs an editor REAL BAD. There are a ton of sentence structure mistakes in nearly every single chapter that are usually just enough to make me re-read the sentence a time or two to figure out what they intended but occasionally make a sentence completely unintelligible. A fresh set of eyes to help catch those would make a world of difference. As I just finished the binge, it obviously wasn't bad enough to make me quit the story, but it would be nice to not have to get through those every time.

You seem to dislike the dark moral trajectory, so my point was that the title doesn't exactly increase the chance that the main protagonist will turn into a beacon of morality in the next chapter, right?

For what it's worth, I don't mind evil characters, but I did not really enjoy this story.

******** TGAB is like a palate cleanser if you dislike evil characters, grimdark settings, and character death. It's like the anti-Worm. I really enjoy the banter in it, and the world building is fantastic. The story has been teasing a big payoff when it reveals exactly why the gods are bastards, but 15 volumes in and there are only some educated guesses.

It does have some major weaknesses though, which keeps it contentious on this sub. The first few volumes definitely feel like the author was trying to find his style, and most of the characters feel similar in voice. He gets better as time goes on, but the narrative structure can vary greatly volume to volume. The cast of characters is big and since hardly anyone dies, it just keeps growing. That can mean you may hear nothing of certain characters for months or years at a time... And it's not at all uncommon to not remember who they are at first when they reappear.

Finally, personal preference territory, but some readers seem to disapprove of the author's perceived social and political views. I honestly don't have a problem with having a huge, diverse character list, but some see any inclusion of LGBTQ characters as frustrating. That said, the story is so huge, anyone who criticizes the story in, say, the first 10 volumes has probably had a counter example to their criticism show up by now. Then again, odds are they wrote it off years ago and now are rehashing outdated points. Take opinions with a grain of salt if they comes from someone who made up their mind and stopped reading early on.

I'm not anti-LGBT by any means, I just don't find any writing about it to be compelling at all. At least with hetero romance I can relate, but I usually avoid even that. To me it feels like too much of the meat of some characters is tied up in stuff I don't care about, so I'm looking forward to the extended cast.

Anyway, WAYYY too much rambling about myself. How long is a volume? Would a given volume be all of 1-X, or 2-X etc? If so, how long is a normal volume?

********** Ah, I misused the terms; there are 15 books, but it's usually 4 or so books per volume, and we're on volume 5 (book 15) now. The books can vary immensely in scale. Book 3 is the shortest by chapter count (10 chapters) while book 12 is the largest (64 chapters). No clue on word count for each of those, however. There are also a variety of side stories (59 chapters so far) that can be read at any point in the series as they mostly take place before the events of the main plot, but are probably better when you're through the first 10 books (first three volumes). They don't spoil anything, but you probably won't know all the characters or understand the context for their events until then.

The complaint about the the social and political views stuff seemed to boil down to some common refrains:

- Simplifying complex economic issues to "do these simple things and society will become better."
- Every non-hetero character or pairing is portrayed positively (or at least as a victim, never a villain or aggressor)
- Masculinity is portrayed as toxic and heavy-handed, feminism is portrayed as just and virtuous.

As said, all of these have been countered at some point, but they are the most common criticisms I've read (and continue to read) by people who gave up reading in the first half of the series. I don't find any of these overt or biased enough to detract from the series overall, but your feelings on the matter might vary from mine. Honestly, the only thing that broke my immersion were some references to pop (nerd) culture. There was an early one mocking Drizzt which I found pretty funny. When [[https://pdsh.fandom.com/wiki/Jenny_Elsewhere][Jenny Elsewhere]] shows up, when World of Warcraft became part of the canon of the universe, when dryads became enraptured by jazz music from /Cowboy Bebop/, and when light sabers started making appearances, it got to be a bit much for me. Thankfully most of that was confined to only a book or two.

*********** SPOILERS YO HO

Unrelated question, but I just got to 2-1 and I'm wondering if Arachne Tellwyrm and Trissiny ever become likable in any way. Worse, the author seems to think Gabriel is in the wrong and what Trissiny did isn't that bad, which is mental. Gabe's being a lot more reasonable in general than everybody (incl. the author) seems to think, from my perspective.

Oh and Tellwyrm just psychologically tortured a vulnerable man into suicide just to send a message. He did bad things, but then again he knew since 8 years old that he would get literally eaten alive (which he saw in person at that same time) if he didn't go along with it.

Basically, some of the characters are batshit and horrible people and the story doesn't seem to realise this and treats it like they're in the right. It's pissing me off.

I could just be mistaken, and I'm sorry to unload this on you, but I needed to write it out somehow. Do you know if my problems are ever addressed? Even just an in story acknowledgement of "Yeah these are horrible people" would be enough. Instead it's like Hot Magic Elf Lady can do no wrong because murder is quirky and fun, and only matters when it happens to young girls.

#+end_quote

Eh, kinda. Arachne's defining characteristics are: badass, pain in the ass, stubborn, and super powerful. She can be very kind when she wants to be; she can also be incredibly cruel when she wants to be. And usually even when she's being kind, she'll still needle at whomever she's "helping." She's a walking contradiction in a way, because she's smart enough to know she can't keep doing whatever she wants without consequence and actively tries to live with that in mind, but she's so set in her ways that her first instinct is to rain destruction down until she gets her way. She kinda strikes me as a baby boomer who knows Millennials are the future and her own views are becoming outdated, but is constantly trying not to get pissed at them for messing up and not doing things how she would do them.

Trissiny definitely becomes less prejudiced and pig-headed, but she's still one of my least favorite main characters. She's not a Mary Sue, but she checks a lot of the boxes, and that just doesn't appeal to me much. Out of the freshman class Gabriel definitely becomes the most developed over time. All of them get additional screentime and fleshing out, but an entire book later on gets dedicated to Trissiny and while I enjoyed the worldbuilding in it, I mostly found myself frustrated about not going back to my favorite characters until the book ended.

I haven't read the first book in a long time, so I don't recall having this impression, but I promise that EVERYONE calls Trissiny out on her behavior later on. Trissiny herself being her most vocal critic down the road. Her behavior here is the watershed moment that defines how her arc and growth will develop from here on out.

************ Absolutely! To avoid spoiling those who haven't read yet:

1. Economics is a tougher one to tackle, because a lot of time things just kind of "work out." Still, the role of the Eserite and Vernisite cults does help explain why some issues we have in reality don't have as easy a time cropping up in TGAB. Eserites tackle bullies (so rich nobles who would otherwise force businesses and commoners into submission aren't allowed to easily do so); Vernisites ensure that capital is always flowing (so consolidation of wealth is a sin against the God of Money, and when her members run almost all the banking industry, they call the shots).
2. Basra. 'Effing. Syrinx. It's not fair to place all the world's sins on her, but she's a terrible person and an easy example. But there are other cases where this fails too. Plenty of non-hetero characters are sexual aggressive; Eleanora is a rather "grey" person morally; Tellwyrn as well; the dryads are perfect examples of sexual creatures who can be very aggressive and seemingly villanous; November is openly in love with Trissiny but pisses off everyone around her. And there are homosexual relationships with issues too; Basra is the easy one, but Toby had a bully take advantage of him in the past.
3. Basra shows Avenists aren't all virtuous, but she's hardly the only example in the cult. There have been mentions of misandry among other Avenists too, and Trissiny's first big trial in character growth was learning to look past her inherent preconceptions and biases - which were inherited from and enforced by Avenist theology. Any Avenists aren't the only feminist cult; Izarites are feminists too. And their cults are always at odds about what feminism really means, with the impression that neither of them gets it right. Syrinx is horrible, but it's become clear that Snowe is almost just as bad... and let's not forget Justinian is an Izarite. And while Shaathists are obvious examples of toxic masculinity, Ingvar's entire story is about positive masculinity (and a positive portrayal of someone who is trans) and how Shaath's teachings have been warped by lies. Even before we get that far in the story, there are positive examples of Shaathists as well; even when polluted by toxicity, sometimes manly men who love hunting and violence can be forces for good. Andros, for example, is the bishop of his cult and yet mostly even-tempered (though still dogmatic).

So yeah, plenty of counter examples exist. The only real credit I can give to these kinds of examples is that at first glance, they might not have had counterexamples right away. And perhaps the author read the criticism and expanded the story later to add them. Or... maybe it just took time for things to gradually be revealed. There have been a lot of twists and turns over 15 books!

** Idle musing: if at a point where you're worried you might regret if you continue reading, it could be worth throwing the dice by reading a few of the latest chapters, or else arbitrarily-chosen chapters much later than your current position. If it increases your inclination to read other chapters, then benefits outweigh costs; if it decreases your inclination to read other chapters, then there are only benefits and next-to-no costs (where 'costs' are spoiling of events which you would otherwise want to read).

For myself, somewhat echoing [[https://www.reddit.com/user/werafdsaew][werafdsaew]], I tend to (ideally) read for as long as I enjoy something, then drop it if I start no longer enjoying it. Ah, but if there's a fiction which I've enjoyed overall and later find I'm not enjoying, I'll often drop it for the time being, then much later read the latest chapter occasionally, then resume reading if I find it fun. At that point, reading backwards through previous chapters, again stopping the filling-in if reaching a point from the other direction not found enjoyable.

** Ah yeah, you might want to turn back on this one. Catherine's slippery slope is a little less tolerable than Taylor from /Worm/, for me at least, because /Worm/ spent the majority of time with villain-on-villain battles, and put more effort into making the heroes genuinely flawed (but interesting) characters. APGTE has a little bit of this, but for the most part, Catherine and her allies resort to killing (first) to solve most of their problems, she spends a lot more of the time fighting much more sympathetic characters, and the fact that she behaves rationally in a setting that's purpose-built for narrative plot devices stops feeling clever about the time she and her friends shoot the head off of a pompous hero during his monologue. (after that point, it just feels like she and her legion of terror are going around kicking dumbass puppies) I still think it's worth reading, because I had a lot of fun with it, but if you can't stomach the fact that Catherine's character arc is as predictable as a rigged carnival game, you might not want to continue.

(Side note for everyone else who has read the story: you get an explanation for the setting's technological stasis pretty early on, and I can't be the only one here that /really fucking hates this/. The setting itself is interesting, but the fact that there's really nothing anyone can do to get out of the medieval squalor kind of puts a damper on any achievement. I stopped reading at around the end of book three while I was waiting for book four to end, and I really hope that this changes sometime in the final two books.)

The real world didn't need some dumb explanation about progress being impossible to have thousands of years of pre-industrial technology. By defining /why/ there is technological stasis, an author has created the concept of technological stasis where it previously didn't need to exist, and that throws up a whole bunch of complications, especially if your protagonist is clever. Like: why hasn't anyone done this clever thing the protagonist has done before? Or: if someone else was stopped from doing this before, why is our protagonist granted special exceptionalism? You /can/ answer these questions, but without technological stasis, you don't need to. APGTE answers those two questions very well, but it didn't actually need to at all. Moreover, by introducing the concept, it's creating an unresolved (or unresolvable) conflict. Black is legitimately distressed by the Red Letter, and then he drops on us that there's nothing anyone can do about it? The guy who is currently throwing up a huge middle finger to the gods is going to lie on his back like a puppy? It's rational, but it's not emotionally satisfying in the slightest, and it really does a lot of damage to his character.

I find it kind of funny that you're implying, by saying that progress isn't only technological, that there isn't /also/ this massive sociopolitical stasis in APGTE. The Dread Empire has remained mostly unchanged for /fifteen hundred/ years, and it's only with Black that things have started to shift. Sure, there's the in-story justification of Names, but Names didn't necessarily have to lead to sociopolitical stasis - it's not the only logical conclusion from the premise. After all, even though it feels like the tropes of modern fantasy stories have been around forever, they're only really a couple of centuries old. This stasis puts a massive constraint on worldbuilding because there is a big gap in what historical events are relevant to the plot - it's either stuff that happened hundreds of years ago or stuff that happened in the last three decades.

Again, I greatly enjoyed my time with the story. It was really fun to read, and it has a lot of great moments. I plan to continue with the rest of book four and five sometime very soon. But I feel like it was in spite of some really glaring worldbuilding oversights which made the story feel a lot less satisfying than it could have been, purely because of the historical context. I think, at the end, when Catherine and co. have made some real, irreversible historical change through their actions, my opinion on this will ease up a bit, but until that point, it feels like the chance of them changing anything is tenuous.

***** A /rational/ story certainly needs a answer to why there is tech stasis, when it's been shown that Evil nations are actually pretty innovative.

****** I don't think I phrased that well. A rational story doesn't need to invent an explanation as to why there is a medieval level of technology for thousands of consecutive years, when a better, more robust one can be found in nature. Science takes time, superstition is easy, people are poor. Creating an explanation for "tech stasis" that is more complicated than that is injecting complication where it doesn't need to exist, and can interfere with the sanity of other pieces of the story. And it also strikes me as kind of petty. Like, the author is so proud of the setting that they've made that /nobody other than the protagonist/ has permission to change it.

So what if the evil nations are innovative? So what if, in two-hundred years, they learn how to invent machine guns or something? The /present/ of the story shouldn't have to be concerned about that. The only thing that needs to be explained is why they don't have machine guns already. The author of APGTE chose "technological stasis" and then wrote an infuriating gnomes-did-it explanation, which reads like the book version of "because I said so". But the author could have just as easily, I don't know, removed the ridiculous requirement that the Dread Empire be a /fifteen-hundred-year-old/ institution (because it oozes rationality to say that the caricature of an evil, unstable empire is more stable than 90% of the nations that exist in real-life history), or started them off with stone-age weapons, or claimed that the constant war and changing leaders impeded progress, or even better, a combination of all three.

So the argument is that, by inventing an explanation for technological stasis, an author is extending a simple problem about explaining the past well into the future of the story, for the sake of a setting that /didn't really need any help/ in order for people to suspend their disbelief about it.

******* The problem is that Calernia is supposed to be a backwater continent. Given the level of innovations shown in Calernia, the industrial revolution should already have happened on some of the other continents, so an explanation is needed for why there isn't flying ships trading with Calernia.

***** They didn't have to /necessarily/ lead to technological stasis, because reality isn't something that tries to tend to good and only does evil when it cannot be persuaded otherwise. If evil has a 20% chance of happening, then two out of ten times, evil will happen.

*** Spoilers for Worm and PGTE Something that is very important when comparing a work of high fantasy or mediaeval times to one based in a modern relatively progressive world, the baseline for morals is completely different, this applies extra to works in which morals are defined by a higher power or god, in PGTE the morals that the main character grew up with and learned as she matured are vastly different from the morals we were taught as we grew up, murder is much easier to consider in a world with wars that a character may have to participate in happening nearby, to the people that grow up in these world's, the idea of killing for what you stand for is the same as dying for what you stand for, is Cat a little to quick to choose killing as an answer to her problems? Maybe, but I don't think that makes her definitively evil based on the moral baseline of the setting. It's important to judge anything within context, and although Worm and PGTE have a lot in common, I feel like they are both rather good in vary different ways.

**** I don't live in that setting, though, and I feel like it's reasonable to dislike a story based on how it makes you feel as a result of morals. I personally don't think I should need to engage in miniature worldbuilding to find characters likeable, I prefer them to just be either likeable or unlikeable based on my honest reaction to them.

** I'm halfway through Book 2 now and still haven't quite gotten sucked into it like I was hoping I would be. It has some good moments though, and most of the good guys you meet are kind of annoying so you want Catherine to win.

I've never thought of Catherine as chaotic evil however. Every time she gets ruthless it seems justified.

That said, it's more utilitarian than evil for evil's sake. I'm honestly a little disappointed she doesn't lean into it harder. She's fundamentally a character driven by good intentions and noble goals that has to get her hands dirty.
