This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for [[http://nanowrimo.org/][National Novel Writing Month]], which started November 1st.

- Want to check in on making some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?
- Just need to vent about your story?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

** so lately in my writing I've started aggressively doing this trick where if i spend more than 15 seconds stuck on a word or a phrase I'll write a TODO and then just move on. Usually the TODO is for something like a physical description or a scene description, although it might also be something where I'd need to pull up my spreadsheet and look up a worldbuilding fact or time range.

The reason I do this is that is that I try to remain in the focused state without getting interrupted. I'm trying to hold the characters in my head and generate their conversation, and running off to check some fact or figure out the right words to describe a setting or something always takes me out of that headspace. It's a lot easier to go write those descriptions later while I'm in a headspace more suitable for description.

anybody else do things like this?

(I think this is an instance of something that makes writing kind of tricky, which is that you need a bunch of different mindsets for it: you have to think about how your scene operates in the context of the overall plot, you have to get in the mind of (multiple!) characters and how they think and how they talk, you have to describe physical things, you have to write good words and have balanced sentence structure... it seems to help to try to separate them out a bit, I think.)

*** I do that somewhat frequently, especially for /Worth the Candle/, which is approaching 800K words, and has absolutely horrific amounts of continuity to keep track of. It's added a ton of work, especially with regard to names; I spent half an hour the other day trying to figure out whether a character's two sons had ever been given names. If I stop in the middle of what I'm doing to look up stuff like that, it represents an enormous break in flow.

That said, I think the biggest downside is scene continuity and the temptation to write around the TODO. If a person's appearance is TODOed, then you either end up with a lot of TODOs, or you just never mention their appearance after the first TODO, neither of which is great, especially since appearance can be a good part of speech tagging/tone (e.g. someone loosening their tie, adjusting their cuffs, fiddling with a button, running a finger along their bushy eyebrow, etc.).

Wait, you mean they /aren't/ called "Sir The Warrior" and "Lord A Scholar and Administrator"?

**** This is a good point, I'll watch out for it. Now that I think about it, there are two characters that were meant to be important, but I've almost TODOed them out of existence because I haven't described or named them yet and as a result I don't think about them very much. This is probably something I should fix sooner rather than later.

(Usually, though, it's little things, like, "find the words to describe the way she swings her sword that conveys her uncanny superhuman precision". Doesn't really affect the rest of the scene and even if it did, I know what the intent was supposed to be.

***** I was actually just thinking about whether or not git would be a good way to backup a story. People always talk about having multiple backups and hey, there's already a version control system that I use quite a bit.

****** Git seems like massive overkill for backing up a story unless you are doing something really unusual like writing multiple versions of the same story in parallel.

I mean, if you are familiar with it and already have it set up for other projects, sure, but if not I'd say dropbox gives you all the features you want for like 5% of the hassle.

******** I figured as much, that's why I added that qualifier to the second sentence. Git is one of those tools that is an enormous pain in the neck to learn how to use, but then becomes invaluable as soon as it clicks.

#+begin_quote
  In fact it was somewhat surprising to hear you say it was a hassle, until I remembered how difficult I found git when I first learned it years ago.
#+end_quote

Oh, I know that feeling. See also, TeX, Vim, various IDE's, TFS and a whole bunch of other tools.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, I like having full history of my work.
#+end_quote

The following should in no way be construed as me endorsing it as a version control system, but dropbox does have a (kinda shitty) document history tool.

yup, it's great to have around as a last resort and for peace of mind, but i'd never center a plan around it

******* I mean, google docs keeps the history of version revisions automatically and without even prompting for anything, so why reinvent a bicycle via dropbox or git.

** I'm really enjoying doing nanwrimo this year. Before November I was doing ~500 words a day, and was struggling with staying motivated and enjoying writing. Now that I've had to pump up the pace at which I write, I'm writing about twice the words in the same amount of time, and I'm feeling really excited about my story again.

I'm not sure if this was because I was being too complacent with my writing schedule or what, but it's had a positive effect on my attitude and with the quantity and (hopefully) the quality of my work. I'm thinking of changing my daily word goal to 1500 after November, especially since after this December I'll be essentially done with school (asides from two classes). Has anyone else felt similarly with a change in their writing schedule?

** Well, today managed to surprise the shit out of me, because first off I got 3800 words down and second both the narrator and one of his housemates had a rebellion against my intentions and whoops that is not how I envisioned her character. Or his. What are you doing, my characters? What madness have you wrought?

I know that's how authoring is "supposed" to go, your characters surprising you and all. It's just the first time it's actually happened to me. Feels weird.
