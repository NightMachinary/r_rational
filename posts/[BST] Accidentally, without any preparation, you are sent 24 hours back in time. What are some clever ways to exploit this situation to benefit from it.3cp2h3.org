Variation - you had 5 minutes to prepare.

More specific rules and mechanics(whether it's parallel timelines, or your consciousness is transported into your body, or there's a second version of you that can interact with you from the past) are up to you - whatever is more exploitable/interesting.

** Two bodies is /much/ more exploitable, even with no preparation.

After you've gone back and realized what the hell's going on, plan carefully. You will wait until the next big lotto drawing (hope this is a day of the week a big lotto is actually drawn on...use the biggest-payout one available, obviously, even if it's a "crappy" daily). Make careful note of the numbers. Now contrive to send these numbers back with the original you in some way you won't have noticed...while original-you is asleep, slip them between your gym and blockbuster cards in your wallet, or safety-pin them into the hem of the pants you're going to be wearing (ideally both, lest things devolve into a comic hunt for the hem-note that fell off and was caught by a gust of wind or something). Code the numbers in some simple way so someone else who finds them will not have the actual winning numbers.

Examine your plan for any obvious flaws, adjust as necessary. Think about it for at least five minutes, but 30 would be considerably better. Every time you find and patch a flaw, add five minutes. Once you're confident, check your wallet (and/or your pants hem, etc).

If you find numbers, go buy your ticket. If you find mysterious bloodstains, you're probably screwed (given a fixed timeline, abandoning the plan at this point won't help, that blood's gonna come from /somewhere/), but don't give up...pick up some emergency medical supplies and soldier on. Consider concealable body armor as well if your current finances permit.

Assuming you did find numbers, when you get to the lotto place, you may be tempted to buy more than one identical ticket so if there are other winners you will get a bigger share. Consider carefully how officials will react when you claim your winnings in that manner...do you want those questions asked? Decide you want at least a small hedge against sharing. Buy several camouflage tickets with one of the numbers increasing incrementally, then skip a number, then buy two of the winning ticket, then several more cover tickets increasing normally. "I had a dream but I couldn't remember the last number exactly...weird fluke that I accidentally bought this ticket twice, eh, Lottery Commissioner?"

When you catch up to "the present", you may be tempted to try to observe original-you at the moment original-you was transported back. Consider whether this knowledge is worth the unknown risks of being present - take into account you are now wealthy and have "more to lose". Even if you decide it's too risky, consider setting up video equipment in your stead...even a slim possibility of learning how to trigger the event again would be of extremely high value...

At all times remain hyper-vigilant for the sound of your own voice. Record it and play it back so you're sure you can recognize it. Remind yourself to react instantly to any shouted warnings from yourself, as they will /probably/ be in your best interest. Try /not/ to look around too much though, so as to leave hypothetical future-yous as much room as possible for stealthy assistance should additional loops somehow occur. Do not allow the latter caution to result in you being hit by a car or something - be sensible, insofar as the context permits it.

Pretend to be a slightly unhinged psychic. It came to you in a DREAM, you saw the RIVER of BEING and the DRAGON of KNOWLEDGE, and he SPOKE to you, and you were BLESSED by his PRESENCE!!!!1!!

(This is why you bought 20 tickets with the same numbers.)

Seeing as how there is zero evidence available to link you to any kind of scam or pre-knowledge of the numbers, the most they can do is get the cops to administer a drug test to you. You come up clean, and there's no actual rule against being bonkers.

At the very least, you might create a bitter nemesis out of the other winner, who still has 1/21th of a lottery jackpot to work with. :)

This should really be your default assumption. A time-travel password can also be given by mind-readers, duplicate selves, memory-manipulators... all it shows is that something impossible has happened, you can't guarantee that it was under your control (any version of you).

Though I'm assuming a fixed timeline in my response, which implies you will /not/ interact with yourself anyway, because if you will (had), it presumably wouldn't then have been unexpected when you traveled later.

If it's not a fixed timeline, you'll discover that in due course, but explicitly testing that (by deliberately trying to make a change) is a /bad/ idea, because if it /is/ fixed, whatever happens to prevent you from your intended change may be unpleasant or indeed fatal.

** With no preparation the question comes down to "What information did I learn and remember during the past day that I could exploit 24 hours ago?", which is almost entirely dependent on what happened in your life in that period (and perhaps how good your short-medium term memory is).

With 5 minutes of preparation the most obvious answers would be lottery numbers (if a drawing in your jurisdiction occurred in the period in question), or failing that stocks that gained or lost a lot of value in that period.

Alternately you could use the 5 minutes to gain information you wouldn't normally be able to get without unacceptable consequences. You probably wouldn't be in a position to do anything like corporate espionage, but if you had something you wanted to ask or tell somebody but were afraid of their reaction, you could use that 5 minutes to call them on their cell phone (assuming they have one) as a test run.

If you physically went back such that there were two copies of you that opens up some other possibilities. You could establish an ironclad alibi if needed, or simply try to come up with an epic prank or magic trick that left everyone wondering if you had a secret twin. If you're in a relationship you could even give your SO a special threesome :)

"Four commercial planes will be hijacked this morning with the purpose of flying them into buildings. The targets are World Trade Center North Tower, World Trade Center South Tower, The Pentagon, and an unknown fourth target.

It most certainly is. Luck plays more of a role the closer two players are in skill, and the precise score between two players is affected by chaotic divergence in quantum-sensitive components for all that we know. Just because it is not the only thing does not make its effects negligible. Even if quantum effects were not truly random, the effects of going back in time

I am claiming the nature of our universe is probabilistic, which lies on the spectrum between determinism and randomness. More specifically, I believe that the determinism we do see is a result of emergent effects from the quantum state, which is in fact the case. I have said nothing that would imply that newbies would win against professionals any more frequently than they already do. Citing the MWI doesn't do anything for this either, as that pushes the random effect from "what happened in reality" to "what reality am I in."

I get a permanent clone. That's the main benefit of this scenario. The clone has limited future knowledge; in the best case scenario, we can use that to win a lottery, clean up on some sports bets, etc. In the expected scenario, we draw lots to see who keeps a 9-5 job and who does something else. Maybe one of us would go into consulting and work from home -- having an extra me would mean somewhat increased cost of living, plus having two of me working would mean an earlier retirement (assuming shared living expenses).
