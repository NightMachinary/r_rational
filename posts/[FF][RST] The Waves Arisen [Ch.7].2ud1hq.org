** Good to see Naruto thinking through the possibilities, and the potential to use other means than direct confrontation to obtain the other scroll. I know Kiba's team aren't meant to be the strongest people Naruto will face, but the confrontation came off a bit like they were "ignorant normals" being led around by the nose by superior rationalists who had outmaneuvered them. I'm hoping Neji's team will use some of the same strategic thought and maneuver Naruto's team are using to make their face-off more interesting. Given Lee's outburst in the first part, and the single-mindedness the Hyuuga have displayed so far, it'd be very cool if it were Tenten were the brains of the outfit. Her canon tendency towards weapons and seals suggest some good munchkinry potential, at least.

** Great chapter. I really like the pacing of this story.

Some comments:

It wasn't clear to me that time passed between this:

#+begin_quote
  The chuunin exams officially began a week later, though the foreign guest ninja had been gradually trickling into Leaf for some time.
#+end_quote

and this:

#+begin_quote
  the first phase of the chuunin examinations had officially begun.
#+end_quote

Also this line really confuses me for some reason:

#+begin_quote
  or one tenth of the total number for each year it took to make chuunin rank
#+end_quote

Also:

#+begin_quote
  There was a story that his mother had once assassinated an almost-invincible foreign ninja by jamming spiders down her throat, and building a web to clog up her lungs.
#+end_quote

Nice.

**** Ugh really sorry to be annoying but I'm still not sure this makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  A few days later the examinations were due to begin, but foreign guest ninja had been gradually trickling into Leaf for some time.
#+end_quote

This can either mean something like the following, just as general background information:

#+begin_quote
  A few days before the examinations were due to begin, foreign guest ninja had already been gradually trickling into Leaf for some time.
#+end_quote

But then it's weird it say "had been," and "later" doesn't make sense because it puts sets the "current time" as "a few days before the examinations were due to begin."

Or it can be a sentence that "takes place" in the narrative timeline a few days before the tournament. This is weird too, because there is just some background information and then,

#+begin_quote
  The three of them sat quietly in the waiting room
#+end_quote

which takes place three days later. There's a timeskip of a few days, but nothing happens in the first "time period" except for some description, and it isn't clear why the information couldn't be given while they are sitting in the waiting room, even if it is given before you state that they are in the waiting room, in which case it would turn into something like the revised version quoted above.

Does that make sense?

** No exploration of the Byakugan? What.

As described in chapter six, it's essentially a super power. Seeing through everything from every angle as far as normal eyesight? That's local omniscience.

The caveat is that he can't keep it on all the time, or at least not for all his clones at once. Plus severely worse Hyuuga relations.

How much does it take to keep active? We know it costs 100 times more to activate than to keep active per second. We know a normal ninja replenishes 86k mc per day, (if they can handle it all) and that Hinata apparently can keep it running for "a few hours" before she has to rest. Presumably this is due to her total mana cap, which may be ~100k mc. At three hours to emergency reserves (10k mc), this is ~10 mc / second to maintain and thus 1k mc to activate.

This is sufficiently small to cause the original Naruto to always keep it on for himself, due to the increased security plus the sheer learning potential seeing everything at once gives you. It makes sense if he wants to avoid antagonizing the Hyuuga for a short time, but he will have to use it openly at some point, and it's very suspicious for two teammates to have eye patches.

However, it should be obvious to the Hyuuga that Hinata has switched eyes. She returns to her clan to sleep. They could easily see her eyepatch or different eye color. With this as the case, Naruto might as well just get an eyepatch and keep the eye technique permanently active.

*** Clarified goggles and chakra. Cost is correct (10,1000) but Hinata's reserves are >100k, foreign territory requires very large safety margin.

**** In all the costs, have you at all considered the losses? I mean, that people often don't have a good chakra control.

Naruto had sucky control in the beginning. Did his techniques use more chakra than they do now? Would someone else get kagebunshin at 1mc per clone with perfect control and someone with really bad at 3mc? It looks to me, like your costs are fixed and the control does not matter.

** I'm not sure the numbers in this chapter make sense.

We were told repeatedly in previous chapters that genin die like flies during military missions, but now it turns out that 80% of them actually die during /exams/, and it would appear that /chuunin/ actually do a bulk of military dying (unless they also mostly die during jounin exams?).

I suppose, this makes more sense, that chuunin are baseline soldiers, while genin are recruits in a sadistic boot camp from hell, but it still seems inconsistent. Am I missing something?

I should note here, just in case it's relevant somehow, that I have no prior knowledge of Naruto canon.

*** It does make sense that chuunins would die more. There are more chuunins than genins, and genins apparently are saving cats and building fences. Chuunins are going to actually dangerous missions.

Like Naruto thought, most of genin deaths happen in the test.

***** True. Genins should be on real missions, not rescuing cats. That was stupid in the canon too.

If genins rescue cats and chuunins are team leaders already... There should be something in between.

** Shadow clone is OP. Being able to make a copy of an object that can become the original across large distance is to unidamned powerful. If all it takes is chakra coating then the shadow cloned object becomes a sort like a quantum entangled photon, when one is destroyed the other becomes real.

Being able to share memory between multiple clones with no mental problems is a few steps away from having all of the info in the world and a possibility to solve any sort of problem, I hope there is a conflict escalation where Naruto has to use all of the knowledge just to survive.

Marriage counseling part was nice, that's a good application of psychological knowledge on a situation with people who have too much power in their hands, I hope there will be more of this on used on other people and their problems.

*** FTL communication isn't immediately exploitable in this setting. Transporting an object still requires a copy of the object to be moved. I don't think shadow clone is described as making the 'original' a clone, too.

Living with the experience of twenty people (and then twenty people with the experience of twenty people, and so on) is insane, though.

Spiders aren't insects. My suggestion: just add "and the like" after "insects" in the above quote, or change it to "bugs" or something.
