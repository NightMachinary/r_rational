***** And Delve's slow spot was really awkward too. There was really no reason for it to be dragged out as long as it did, there were so many weeks where I thought the weekly chapter was completely unnecessary and extraneous.

Hell, there's literally an entire month's worth of chapters of Rain stuck in a literal hole in the ground doing diddly squat, which could've been entirely summarized in one chapter or shorter. 4+ chapters were spent on him being trapped in a hole in the ground.

I'm glad we've moved past those arcs and have gone back to plot progression, although I will admit I still wish these chapters were faster. I wonder what the end of this lair will bring.

****** People keep complaining about the 'stuck in a cave' arc, but I'm going to whole-heartedly defend it. i liked that arc. Yes, it was long and had no action, but it was a transformative time for rain, both for his in-story development, and narratively. If the arc had been short, or briefly summarized, it wouldn't have had as much impact. Instead, it gave Rain time for real introspection, and set up aspects of the longer narrative.

Delve is by nature a slow-grind web serial. The earlier chapters were similarly, it's just that no one was reading them when they came out, but instead binged them all in a go. The cave arc similarly would be a noticeable slow point if you were reading these chapters all at once, but would not come across as overly-long. If you want a fast-moving story, you should either not read serialized fiction, or stick to faster-moving serials. Delve, in my opinion, has been consistent between what the author promised and what was delivered.

#+end_quote

You say this as if Rain isn't navel-gazing most of the word-count away through action chapters, too. The balance in the early chapters was already skewed towards introspection, and were perfectly fine for it. But there was still stuff /other than/ introspection going on.

****** I agree, but on the other hand it's tricky to convey the experience of being stuck if it only takes a moment to read. Well, evocative prose can do it, and the obelisk sequence managed it quite well with less idling. Nesting two separate being stuck alone sequences back to back inside a being stuck in a dome arc was a bit much. If the author wanted to explore the theme of stuckness, it would have been more effective to have it present in different domains, say system, physical and mental, instead of having two physical stuckings nested. Twice in a row.

Perhaps give Rain himself a bit more angst about being stuck in a dome. And also about being stuck mechanically. Tune it up to eleven in the pit, make everything he tries to escape fail, have the end of a single chapter be a deep downer, where he gives up (with soul rupture contributing). Then in the beginning of the next chapter have Dozer do an interesting thing and Rain be "Huh, interesting" and realize that in his original world all the progress people had was learning more about the world and improving their skills, not Skills, he shouldn't let a weird system arbitrate his sense of purpose. With this motivation, he could have the original digging and training montage, and finish the chapter with detecting the rescuers.

Then the obelisk entrapment could be framed as him now refusing to get stuck. The way Rain just keeps going despite all the ridiculous hardship and seeming lack of options in the void is really impressive. The prose could celebrate that more, and framing it as him applying a lesson from the pit would achieve that nicely.

Well, it's always easy to say stuff like this after the fact; that's why published books go through editing passes. Consistently producing a chapter a week is no joke.

****** It felt to me like it moved away from being an adventure story as soon as he got back to the city after the first lair. It's not nearly as exciting when events are happening to the main character and he's reacting as when he gets to make decisions and decide where to go himself. That's what got me into the story in the first place, the feeling that he's in this new world and he gets to go out and explore, not get caught up in the politics of people a hundred times as powerful as him.

******* I don't think it was ever that story. A low level guy simply doesn't have that much freedom on his own. And someone who has no idea how the world works with regards to magic, politics, customs etc. isn't going to be able to be decisive either.

********* Right but you seem to think the author wanted it to be a story that you wanted it to be, rather than what he wanted it to be. Unless my take of what he wanted it to be is wrong and he wanted it to be the same type of story you want it to be.

Rain seemingly not being able to go explore the world so early on to me indicates a much more rational take on isekai into a world like delve.

********** I don't understand your point. Criticizing a story isn't allowed since this is just how the author wanted it to be?

A story can be both rational and exciting. Having a slow pace doesn't somehow make it more rational.

************ But that is how the story was written. The first sixty chapters or so were a very typical isekai where the main character figures out the world he's arrived in and goes on adventures. The worst thing he had to deal with was a pissed off guildmaster and his ex wife.

Then suddenly the whole thing takes a 90 degree turn and suddenly we're dealing with armies and city wide magic artifacts and people powerful enough to squish Rain like a bug. And not only does Rain have to deal with all that, there's no path to him growing powerful enough to deal with them. For like 50 chapters basically nothing about Rain's personal plot advances at all.

And then another 90 degree turn and we're right back on track as an adventure story where he can make choices that affect his fate again. Global politics have all but vanished completely. I don't think it's the slightest bit out of line to call that bad writing.

It seems kinda silly to argue about how someone criticizes a story. If you did like the pace yourself or how the author wrote it then that would make sense. But just saying the author gets to decide how the story flows and criticising it is out of line is a bit ridiculous. People have been criticising stories for as long as authors have been writing them. There aren't any rules.

************* I disagree in part with what you've said. It wasn't a story where he would go on adventures, he left the city twice, not counting the nearby forest. It was all still focused on worldbuilding and him understanding things.

I very much agree that the dke attack was a radical shift in the series, like...idk, the Seanchan or tower revolt in WoT, or kvothe losing his family or joining the university in Kingkiller. But more jarring in some way. Oh, I know, like the mass teleport in Mushoku Tensei!

I think it would be quite ridiculous if he DID have a path to getting powerful enough to deal with the Watch or Velika, it's raise the question of why the hell isn't everyone that powerful if Rain had a path to it. I'd consider that bad writing

But on a different level he did have paths to grow more powerful to a more reasonable degree. Rains main issue is that he has skills without the experience. Now he's becoming more battlesavvy, especially with his macros.

Now to say that global politics have vanished completely when he only left a backwater city about a week ago and thus this is bad writing just....it boggles me that you could think that. This isn't the modern age where cities, or countries, can be reached in a day by armies. If I read historical fiction where some guy leaves one of the Greek city states during wartime and doesn't get hassled by an army, I wouldn't be surprised. And the continent they're on is a lot larger than Greece. Besides the war is between the Empire and the DKE and he's not heading to any DKE City states, or to the Empire.

So yeah, I think it's kind of out of line to call that bad writing /understatement.

And to say all criticisms are justified is kinda silly. If there were no rules to criticising, we wouldn't have people considered respected critics and others who are ignored. Criticisms need to be valid.

***** But was it actually really long or did it simply feel long because of how the story is serialized?

The story is apparently close to 600000 words, which is lengthy in word count, but I'd still reckon the cave section would go a lot quicker for a new reader
