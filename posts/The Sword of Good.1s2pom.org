** A short story by Yudkowsky that exposes a very interesting view of fantasy worlds.

*** I prefer the version that was posted to LessWrong, in which the commenters immediately point out that we've got no reason to believe the Lord of Dark or whatever his name was will rewrite reality into something /better/ than it already was.

***** The sword tests /intentions/. It certainly means his spell will rewrite reality into something /he/ thinks is better. However, anyone frequenting this subreddit should know damn well that individual agents' senses of goodness will not necessarily correspond to those of all the other agents. I mean, what if the Lord of Dark just really likes paperclips?

** It actually seemed pretty boring to me. Instead of deep characters; it felt more like trying to express the failings of cardboard cutout types. I actually prefer his Gary-Stu Harry to this because at least Harry expresses emotions and objectives beyond "I wanna be good!"
