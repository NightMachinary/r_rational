`url:youtube subreddit:rational` gets me only top-level posts, not links in comments. Any ideas?


** If it's important enough to put in the effort, sign up to the Google Cloud Platform free tier, and run

#+begin_example
  SELECT *
  FROM `fh-bigquery.reddit_comments.2019*`
  WHERE subreddit = 'rational'
  AND body LIKE '%youtube.%';
#+end_example

Note that you might also need to search for the shortened =youtu.be=.

Unlike most forms of searching, this is fairly exhaustive, but comes with no sort of ranking and requires exact search terms. It's also missing some more recent data.

**** Hit the "Tools" button/text just to the lower right of the search bar. It'll add a dropdown menu where you can select a time range.

*** You mean "site:https:// [[http://www][www]]. reddit .com/r /rational/ YouTube" (without spaces or quotes) since Google doesn't know r/ links and FUCK I can't get it to display right

How did you do red text?

**** In old reddit/markdown mode, you wrap the text in backticks `like this` to produce text =like this=. With the new reddit "fancypants editor", you hit the "inline code" button (which looks like </>) to style the text as you would with bold or italics.

** There's always [[https://redditsearch.io/][pushshift]]. I believe it's run by the same guy as the google cloud dataset mentioned above, but as it's a web UI more like a classic advanced search page and doesn't require a google account, it might be more approachable for a one-off query with a reasonable output size that you don't care to export for later re-use.
