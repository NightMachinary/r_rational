So.....they are not only actively watching but also actively /policing/ her thoughts, even if it is just [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology][Insistent Terminology]] for humours sake.

Like all of her interactions with them this chapter, it fell completely flat to me. EE is writing them as if they are the Woe, the old buddies she has known and worked with forever, but they /aren't/. They are two of the oldest, most blood drenched monster there ever was. And we /still/ don't know the specifics of their relationship. We saw /her/ act of faith but their response was obscured.

At this point they are still just a pair of overpowered assholes with more death and chaos because of their incompetence then anyone else in the world.

Yeah, the best they could squeak out in their attempt to avoid it was a monument to deranged viciousness. It speaks very poorly of their capability.

As much as I dislike Malicia, she has at the very least been /competent/, until recently. Cat traded a vicious but successful boss she was almost free of for a vicious boss who needed her to empower them and whom she is now tied to in ways that are deliberately obscured.

#+begin_quote

No, the most harmful thing they have done is the *millenia of ritualistic slavery and drow sacrifice*. And then fucking up their own apotheosis badly enough they needed a godling unwilling to exercise her power (and therefore far easier to take) to stumble in.

#+end_quote

Even in jokes, there is a strict hierarchical line. She needs to ask /permission/. She needs to talk them into /letting/ her do things.

This is an entirely new kind of relationship, something as yet unseen in the narrative, for good or ill. Whether or not someone likes it, it shouldn't be written the same as other relationships have.

As yet the relationship itself is worryingly undefined and has been for far too long. We badly need to learn the specifics of their arrangement. In the mean time, not having this new Goddess-Priest relationship written with the same casual informality which defines her relationship with her oldest and most beloved friends isn't a lot to ask.

It's almost like the Twilight Sages' fuckup has left them with only one possible solution and nothing to pay for it. Reread their conversation with the Envoy: they weren't malicious, just desperate, and the Below twisted their arms into pretty much everything you blame them for. I'm not saying it /isn't/ unimaginably horrible, just that no currently present character was there in time for better options to be availiable.

Only for the stuff that affects the drow (either long-term or the immediate commands), which is reasonable, considering that Cat cares about the drow only as long as they further her agenda and they all know it. This also happens to be near all of her decisions of import, since the only people in her army that aren't going to have to follow her decrees as the Priestess of the Night are Archer and Diabolist - but then again we didn't see them even close to those two's interactions with Cat, so far (and even then I'd argue that Akua is disposable enough to be fair game). Besides, Cat was going to do pretty much the same thing, only with Winter making the slope even more slippery and no supervision from the conquered drow, so this is arguably fair. I'd withhold the judgement until we see how firm is their grip beyond that.

I think it's more a combination of Cat sassing any higher power she comes across, the crows barely classifying even as half a divine avatar each, and Sve Noc having absorbed a mantle of power with Cat's soul inscribed on it (see also: Diabolist changing her narrative arc by leaning into the same influence).

Justifications only matter to the Just.

I am not really condemning them as /people/. My only real interest in them is as Cat's new masters and, frankly, I don't consider them worthy of that. Their story was one of failure and horror.

#+end_quote

Did you mean the most harmful /unprovoked/ thing? Because there was that whole thing with the tearing open her soul.......

Anyway, that isn't really relevant. My issue is characters crammed into the story so quickly we needed a literal tour through their memories to establish them in time, given such authority over the protagonist when they have neither the moral standing nor the record of success that would make them worthy of it, while the narrative and author do everything possible to hide the actual details and facts regarding their new relationship.

Them having not done much to her is part of the issue. At least if they had I would know what they were about. Malicia is an asshole and I can't wait for Cat to set her on fire but I always knew what their relationship was, nuanced as it might be.

This seems like a quick and hasty excuse more than an actual reason.

Even if it ultimately comes with a great excuse, it is still a problem for me. EE is fucking incredible at banter and sass, but that can't be the protagonists /only/ way of interacting with people. This is a unique and distinct relationship, it should feel that way.

Right, but what does that /mean/? Rumena is apparently in command of this expedition. Is that in command the same way Juniper is in command of Callow's army, where she still answers to Cat? The fact that he is reporting to Cat strongly suggests as much, but he isn't showing her the obeisance typical to drow when interacting with a superior. Then there is:

#+begin_quote
  It had amused the Sisters to send what little remained of the army I'd once led against them on the southern expedition. I wasn't complaining: the oaths binding us might have been broken, but they were quicker to obey my orders than most drow.
#+end_quote

So, most drow are hesitant to follow her orders? Or are the drow she previously worked with just /really/ quick to obey?

What is Cat's place in their culture and society? How much of a commitment is it? Is she allowed to leave? If so, does she keep her partially healed body? If so, does she keep her powers? Hell *what are her powers?*

How does all this factor in to her rulership of Callow? How much authority does Sve Noc have over her? They can hear her thoughts with no effort, can they also alter them?

All other forms of authority have been granted transactionally - Further Black's agenda by being a Callowan Named working for the tower, get broad authority and a legion of her own. Is this the same but with the transaction hidden from the audience, or is it different with that difference hidden from the audience?

Either way I don't know shit and I don't like it.

#+begin_quote
  Everything else aside, if I had just given Cat (of all people) that kind of authority and power I'd certainly want representatives there to watch over her.
#+end_quote

Rumena strikes me as an appropriate agent. Permanent mind reading is something we have seen twice before in the narrative - In an absurdist tyrannical dictatorship, Bellerophon, and from Above's agents as they use Pilgrim. Both cases are very clearly not good things.

***** We've had a grand total of one full chapter (this one) from Cat's perspective since the Underdark arc came to an end. I'm sure quite a few of these questions will be answered in time, through further insights into Cat's thoughts, her interactions with Sve Noc, and other bits of plot and character interaction.

I'm not fully sure what you're expecting, here, to be honest. Sure, we could get the information faster, but I think an info dump as rapid/dense as you seem to be looking for would basically put every other bit of plot advancement, character development, and character interaction to a halt for at least a full chapter.

In real world time, it has been over five weeks.

I have nothing against EE taking a break. Everyone needs work-life balance and it /was/ the holidays. But there are too many questions that are too important and have remained unanswered for too long.

None of this would be an issue if he hadn't concluded chapter 82 on a cliffhanger. I get it, they are utterly essential for a serial where the success of the work and the authors livelihood itself rest on pulling people back, but if you leave people dangling off that cliff too long they fall.

This has gone from being my favourite series to teetering on the edge of being dropped.

I'm sorry, I misspoke. When I said one full chapter, I meant one regular chapter. Which is the only one that is really super relevant here.

Interludes rarely, if ever, have much to do with Cat, and if they do they do so tangentially. Epilogues and prologues briefly touch on Catherine (a couple paragraphs, vs. several for other characters). Bonus chapters again, touch on Cat tangentially at most, and usually take place in the past.

Like I said before, I'm just not sure what you want done differently? Would you have preferred EE to skip out on Triptych, so that we'd miss how things were playing out in Procer and with the dwarves? The epilogue, so we wouldn't see what was going on with Tyrant/Heirarch and Black? The prologue so we wouldn't see what was happening with Malicia or Cordelia? Spend a bonus chapter, which have always provided story on someone other than Cat, on Cat?

Spend all of this chapter on a giant info dump of Cat's terms with Sve Noc, regarding the mind reading, her role in the Night hierarchy, her new powers, how this all affects Callow? Sure, it would answer your questions, but it would be awful, awful storytelling.

Sure, but this is Rumena and Cat we're talking about.

#+begin_quote
  So, most drow are hesitant to follow her orders?
#+end_quote

My impression was that, while she does have explicit authority over the drow, most of them don't know who she is and obey Sve Noc rather than her.

As for everything else, I agree, I want a lot more detail regarding what's actually going on in their relationship and I think it will get old if it takes too long before it happens.

*** The process through which the crows were made was described as pinching off slivers of divinity. The crows were made with the specific purpose of letting Catherine communicate with her goddesses in a way which she finds intuitive, and to let them keep a close eye on her from a perspective that wasn't inside her own skull. Both of these goals are facilitated if the crows are things Catherine enjoys keeping around. She wouldn't talk to minders she hates, after all.

Therefore, it makes the most sense for Komena and Andronike to make the crows out of fragments of themselves which seem most agreeable to Catherine. It isn't that the goddesses are now Cat's old buddies, it's that they created constructs which would behave like old buddies of Cat's in order to best serve their own purposes.

In particular I am curious why you say this. It is reasonable speculation based what little information we have but you present it as fact so I am wondering if it is something I missed.

This part, though, I particularly like as an explanation. I still don't think Cat should be barter-sassing back and forth with them the way she does others (variety is important - the protagonist can't interact with everyone the same way) but this serves as a functional justification.

**** Because if they conquered Callow they'd be surrounded by Praes, Procer and the Golden Bloom, none of whom would ever tolerate having the drow for a neighbour, especially if they'd just conquered an entire human nation.

They aren't fighting the Dead King because of a bargain with Cat. They didn't even know about her Keter settlement plan when she gave them her power. They're fighting him because it's one of the only reasons the dwarves would let them go, and because they recognise that the best way to rejoin the wider continent is to do it in a way that benefits the surface nations.

If they emerged in any other way they would be a net drain on the surface world, earning the enmity of every other nation, which would be disastrous in the long term. Especially with the Wandering Bard out there to shape the story against them. With Cat's plan however, the forces of the continent will likely actively help the drow rather than hinder them.

***** What are Praes and Procer going to do about it? From what we saw pre Sve Noc becoming a literal god with all the power of the Winter Court and the power of the Night, a power which becomes stronger every time you kill someone they aren't anything.

That one Mighty from near the start who was a nobody from the boonies could decimate everythingeither kingdom has except maybe Pilgrim, Saint and Warlock. Of those 3, Warlocks dead while the Saint and Pilgrim are actively working against Procer.

The Golden Bloom fucked off to Arcadia and Procer and Praes are both only technically still kingdoms with arge, active elements trying to burn them down.

****** That's why I said long term. Yes, neither Praes nor Procer are in any shape to fight the drow right now. But there's a reason the Dead King, by far the most powerful being in Calernia, has never seriously tried to bring down the Principate or even expand his territory. Because the last time an all-powerful villain swept across the continent, killing and conquering with sheer magical might, she was brought down within five years of her victory.

The drow could destroy Procer with ease, but every victory would produce more heroes and add weight to a counter-story that would soon be irresistible. That's the entire point of Black's teachings -vast magical power and demigods at war work well at first, but in the end they are always, always brought down by a peasant with a magic sword.

******* The problem is that we've never seen that once. Dozens of heroes appeared post conquest and the Calamities dealt with this issue by murdering them all. Against the legions 50,000 men and 14 heroes with the story of a crusade against evilto prevent them from being able to open permanent hellgates wherever they want vs an army with all their big weapons comatose and did nothing. The White Knight and his band went against the most stereotypical villain possible who actively screwed himself for funsies and only lived by the will of Mighty Bellerophon, Greatest of the Free Cities.

Heroes are built up as some great threat with the scales weighted in their favour by an elephant but every time they fight they get slaughtered. The one victory against a villain we've seen involved the Bard actively fiddling and required a dead hero as fuel. We saw a peasant with a magic sword rise up against the Empire to cast off their chains and take vengeance, the story of Callow. He was slaughtered and his plan ended up as fodder to resurrect a villain.

Talking about epistemologically suspect theories over here when you guys are just as wrong or more wrong than the theories in the PGtE subreddit. You guys get basic plot facts wrong that we don't.
