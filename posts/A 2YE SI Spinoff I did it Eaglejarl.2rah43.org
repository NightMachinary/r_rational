** Please continue. I'm curious how you'd fuck up the universe, and it'd be fun to read.

**** Well, obviously I'm an idiot who can't even scan a screen's worth of usernames properly. Damn.

***** I'm sorry if I missed your sarcasm, haha. I guess it didn't resonate with me?

****** Sorry. That wasn't sarcasm at all although, on re-reading, it is entirely clear how it could be perceived as such.

It was meant to be a small act of public self-flagellation. I did actually "look" at the list of previous posters. I did actually miss EagleJarl's name. I deserve the label "idiot" for that.

Also, thank you for pointing it out in the first place and for replying to my response to let me know how you interpreted it. It's genuinely valuable for me to (re-)learn that online text-only comments can be easily misunderstood.

*** I lost interest in it, so rather than have people wait for a chapter that was never coming, I opted to take down the entire thing. I can email you a soft copy of the story if you'd like.

**** Yes, please.

For future reference, I think ff.net lets you mark a story as 'abandoned' or 'canceled' or some such.
