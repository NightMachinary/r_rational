*** Thank you 8-). I never really went away, although I did take a longer break than planned. My effective average writing speed has slowed down by about half for the last year or so. Many pro writers have the same problem, so I'm counting myself as lucky that I'm not looking at deadlines on stuff that pays the rent. I also have a /lot/ of empathy for all the prose and graphic creators of near future SF that are in the middle of series or serials. The interesting-but-plausible near-future zone has been moving around a lot, and I'm not the only one who has had to scrap stuff because of it.

That said, I have the the big bits of cool stuff at the climax and end of Maker's Ark worked out and they're in sight. I just have to figure out how to fit in something that really should have happened about ten chapters ago without killing the pacing 8-)

You mean because of progress in AI, or something else?

***** Implicit political background; This hit Stross's Laundry series particularly hard.

** Pacing and tension--always the trickiest parts for me get right as I approach the climax of a serialized novel. But the pieces are falling into place.

*** That bomb seems oddly applicable if he can exclude it from affecting the solar system, and the lizards system, and well anything on the ark other than the home-well invaders approaching.

Edit: Somehow I think we might see this bomb dropped into a home well if they don't knock off their omnicidal habits.

**** Doc is /way/ more talented at building bombs than is useful, safe or he is comfortable with. That's why he hates them so much--remember he came up with his block after he unintentionally built a bomb that could wipe out life on Earth when he was trying to destress after breaking up with his first girlfriend when he was fifteen.

Utility and delivery are trickier.
