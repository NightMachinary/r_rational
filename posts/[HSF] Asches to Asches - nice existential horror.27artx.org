  When submitting a post, please add one or multiple of the following labels to the title to enhance search results:
#+end_quote

- [RT] rational;
- [DC] deconstructionist
- [HSF] hard scifi; [HF] hard fantasy
- [WIP] work in-progress, if you're writing something; [BST] brainstorming, if you're talking about writing something
- [META] about the subreddit
- [Q] questions about anything; [D] general discussion about rational fiction or writing rational fiction

In this case, hard scifi refers to the genre of science fiction which concerns itself with scientific and technical detail of how things work, or which endeavors to maintain some semblance of scientific accuracy.
