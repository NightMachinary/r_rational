**** Yeah, I get that feeling more and more. First there was HPMoR, and it made me want a name for fiction that demonstrated and taught the critical approach Harry had to the world, and the consequences of it. I think "rational(ist)" was originally intended to capture that, but then people started coming up with explanations why their favourite authors were actually writing rational fiction, and it's become little more informative than "realistic fiction".

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationaly and The Origin of Species are the two fics I consider "rational(ist)" (though I'm sure there must be some I've simply not read), and I'd do away with the whole "rational" category as too nebulous, instead specifying "munchkinism" or "transhumanist themes" or what have you.

***** Perhaps because the rationalist parables in HPMoR are the weakest part of the work, and so many people find the realistic fiction part is its real attraction.

***** I my opinion the main cause for such descriptions is the same as how people can't seem to differentiate between "good story" and "story i enjoyed". similarly people just take it a step further and think "i like rational stories", "i like this anime\book\fic" = > "this anime\book\fic is rational".

I do think that in most ways the list of defining elements, which is on the side, that make up "rational" stories(especially the first two) would occur naturally in like 90% of well written stories, though some of them are not mandatory. so there is some value in the distinction between well written, and rational.

Because this community did not invent rational fiction. We just named it.

There is a tendency to overcredit, though. And the munchkin works don't help.

** Granted I only watched like 2 episodes of this, but I can hardly call this anime rational.

Sure there's some interesting trivia regarding bones. But the show is basically "sherlock holmes" if he was a young(ish) woman which instead of actually being a detective(with knowledge in a very wide set of fields ) was a osteologist, so needed much more convenient cases so as to give the MC a particular edge.

And by episode 2 they were already resorting to DEUS EX [[#s][episode 2]]

*** Wasn't Bones completely bullshit, though? Unrealistic and hollywoodesque to the core?

I didn't ever watch it, but I remember seeing a few choice scenes on youtube that made it look like that.

***** I recall watching an episode where their computer caught fire because someone encoded the bones they were scanning with malware. It was one of the dumber things I've seen on network television.

**** /shrug/ I watched it as a drama, in general I think most evidence dramas work on Hollywood science which is equivalent to equivalent to Hollywood AI, so I try to ignore it
