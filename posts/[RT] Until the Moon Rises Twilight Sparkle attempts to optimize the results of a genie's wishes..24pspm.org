** I really enjoyed the characterization of the genie and Twilight in this, and while it is a one-scene one-shot fic, it's a lot better written than simple talking heads fic.

The story is told from the genie's POV, and the dramatic reading linked at the bottom of the description is great quality for amateur voice actor/audio editor.

As a side note, it's perfectly readable if you're not familiar with the series.

*** It really was a sort of "my first genie" story, though. Nothing much was explored that experienced readers haven't seen dozens of times before. It even ended in the [[#s][obvious]].

** The link description is a bit misleading. It's more about the fact that [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/][wishes are dangerous]].

*** Any well-read person knows that wishes are dangerous.

The problem lies in that people who /know/ wishes are dangerous /think/ that knowing that immunizes them from the danger.

** Why didn't Twi just get Luna to stop the moon so she'd have more time to think about the wish?

People suck at locating solutions that fall outside their normal paradigm.
