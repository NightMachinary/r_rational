For example, I suppose V for Vendetta seems rationalist enough, even if not strictly so. Do you have any better fitting suggestions? The real reason may or may not be that I'm out of good shows to watch.

** Elementary.

Now, this isn't a rational detective show, those are from my prespective pretty much impossible to do with presenting, investigating and solving a murder in an one hour runtime, and much of the criticisms that might apply to the classic Sherlock Homes and its derivatives apply here too. Yes, even to the spectacular "Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century" which gaves us the Hound of the Baskervilles on the Moon.

And although I do enjoy how the writers do try to use real concepts in plausible cenarios, even I will admit that they do take quite a bit of shortcuts and usual tricks which do not reflect reality in service of drama. And that's fine really.

Because the truth, is that Elementary is a rational sociological show.

Its interest comes from how the people work and live in belieavable ways, how they give themselves goals and work towards them, how they react in realistic ways and how they change and adapt their goals based on what happens. Contrary to the inferior example of BBC Sherlock in my opinion, here a grumpy or insulting Holmes is called out on his actions and words repeatedly, both when he's only trying to disguise his social bias with pseudo-science words and when his actions are in fact counter-productive to his objectives because he's human and his errors are human as well.

It also has one of the best portrayals of addiction and its dificulties I've ever seen on a show.

And now here's a series of spoilerrific examples from the first two seasons and the beginning of this new third one:

[[#s][Joan]]

[[#s][Holmes]]

[[#s][Moriarty]]

It's really a wonderful show, which might not use the common 'rational' elements that fit all the checkboxes, but on the aspects that it wants to improve and stand out as such, it does so beautifully.

Also, it has [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-aB2hU3axc][this trailer]].

** I haven't seen it in years, but I think Sunshine ([[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/]]) at least attempts to be a rational story. There are lots and lots of movies where characters have some sort of a mission that will decide the fate of humanity, but this is the only one I know where the characters actually seem to understand what it means, the gravity of the situation, and try to act with a kind of pragmatic ruthlessness, as you would.

I can't guarantee that this is a 100% successful rationalist movie. I am sure that if I re-watched it, I'd notice lots of stupid stuff, too. But at least the movie had its brain in the right place and tried.

  */Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television/* (1978) is a book by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Mander][Jerry Mander]], who argues that many of the problems with television are inherent in the medium and technology itself, and thus cannot be reformed.

  Mander spent 15 years in the advertising business, including five as president and partner of Freeman, Mander & Gossage, San Francisco, a nationally-known advertising agency.

****** Oddly, since the book is mostly specific to the medium of television (and not all vapid enterprise), there is little irony. On some level, if your prior estimate on the probability of television being unfixably deficient is so low you /do/ need the entire book to convince you, it is likely a testament to the spectacular power of television to hide or attempt to eliminate all complexity of those potential issues (you'd be surprised how many people say "well, it's just a medium, message is what matters" as if this is a mega-powerful knockdown argument that had not at all been considered by someone who worked in the field and did enough research to fill a book -- attempting to explain that it isn't that simple has led people to just keep repeating themselves at me... it's somewhat alarming).
