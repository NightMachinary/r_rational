** Just finished the trilogy last week. As a computer scientist, this is by far the least frustrated I've been reading about AI in science fiction. Second book was probably my favourite in the trilogy, but they're all pretty different in terms of the scope of ideas covered.

Methods of Rationality podcast started reading this a while back - episodes are available [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1958][here]]. If you listed to HPMOR and you're used to listening to those voices, you'll probably enjoy that production.

*** Woah. But aren't books two and three non-free? How will the podcast handle that? Normally a commercially available audiobook still forwards a part of the proceeds to the original author.

**** Eneasz said at the beginning that he will stop somewhere before the end of the first book. So this won't be an issue.

Also if I remember correctly the books will be free after the first five or so years. So if he wishes to continue he could wait.

****** He talks about it in the first episode I think. If I recall correctly he says the arc is finished at a specific point and after that it begins to start the arc that continues into the second book and it would be dissatisfying to end with that

**** I wondered this too. I think Eneasz might actually mention something about this in the first episode (in the context of talking about tweaking the exact point where the first book ends).

***** Book by Greg Egan. It's got some flaws in how there's not really a solid overarching story, just a bunch of little slice of life episodes about a character, but that's fairly common in his work, he can jump from idea to idea a lot.

The specific scene they're talking about is freely readable here [[http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html]]

** I enjoyed the first two books. The third one lost most of the series charm for me because the primary narrators became the human side characters instead of the Crystal AI. If I wanted to read about a romantically confused young woman or a badass cyborg mercenary, there are other stories that do it better.
