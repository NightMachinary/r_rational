[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3kb87f/weekly_challenge_defied_prophecy/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Defied Prophecy". [[/u/coadie]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3kb87f/weekly_challenge_defied_prophecy/cv137ec]["The eye of prophecy"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations [[/u/coadie]]!

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
This week we'll be dipping back into the TVTropes pool with "[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][Blue and Orange Morality]]". It's not good and evil, it's not law and chaos, it's some third axis that (tends to) lie perpendicular to normal human political axes. Cthulhoid monsters, paperclipping AI, benthic creatures, fey nobles, and starfish aliens are all a good starting point, though don't be afraid to use simple humans with their own strange ways of thinking. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, September 23rd.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

   :END:
Next week's challenge is "Dangerously Genre Savvy", which it's hard to believe that we haven't done before. Here's the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerouslyGenreSavvy][TVTropes link]]. In short, this is the person that defies genre conventions whenever those genre conventions would put them at a disadvantage. They know how things go in horror movies and don't want to end up as the next victim. They've seen too many heroes escape from elaborate death traps. And they're definitely not going to tell you their plans if there was the slightest possibility that you could change the outcome.

*Next week's thread will go up on 9/23.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]]. If you want to discuss the week's theme, feel free to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/submit?selftext=true][make a post about it]].

*** From the very beginning they are described as having ships whose navigation is disabled through light but in the end Atlas is described as a bug himself. Also they have varied roles yet all seem to be night active. Are the characters the bugs or are they piloting the bugs and, if the second, is each one just piloting a single bug? With their ignorance of any type of vertebrae I was actually thinking that they may be some kind of micro-organism within said bugs.

***** Who are the guys actually talking? Subsystems of one single bug? Wouldn't make sense with how Pepper is observing as Atlas flies away. The confusion mostly comes from the fact that in the last paragraph everything points to Atlas /his/ wings and antennae and stuff as if they were parts of Atlas himself rather than of his vessel. On the other hand the amount of "people" in the conference and them having roles like Experimenter, Scout, Biologist, Gypsy, Trader and Carrier (and not just one guy per role) points away from the idea that each of them is one bug of the same species.

Regarding "Navigation", it seems to be something that the "people" /use/ not are. So Navigation is one of the interface systems of the ships? What do the users represent?

******** Our willingness to kill bugs for light looks unbridgeable to them. I must concede that the differences between us and bugs from our planet are smaller than the differences between the Baby Eaters and humans. I also had to make them behave much more like humans to tell the story effectively; similarly, I had to minimize the human presence. If bugs are aware of lights, they probably see the correlation between lights and humans. Irl, I mean.

******** Not exactly. The person being an oathbreaker invalidates their ability to request oaths period. When Rikkart swore his vows to the King, he wasn't swearing oaths. He was speaking empty words, as the Fae don't believe in making oaths with oathbreakers. In addition, the oaths for human king guards are /human/ oaths. The Fae don't have much respect for oaths of that nature, it's barely considered an oath to them (part of what makes it so blue and orange. The Fae aren't being hypocrites in their eyes. They just don't understand how you can swear important oaths without things like spiritual observance, herb burning and family input. A human oath, to them, is like if you told the average Westerner that culture A gets married by standing in a drum circle and swearing to the moon, and the newlyweds then go off and sleep with their spouse's parent as a sign of respect. The average person would be hard pressed to understand such a marriage, let alone take it seriously, as it's so alien to what you consider a "proper" marriage to be.)

*** It annoys me when people say people are less than animals. You don't torture animal families to punish an animal, why would you do it to those less than animals? The things that suffer the most are always "above" animals.

Especially fae would they even think of animals as below them? Depends on what Fae you have I suppose.

Also I liked the references to old stuff that the King didn't know as it cements the fae longitude but I would have liked the champions spurned to have been the King's fathers decision.

**** Well, do you think the emissaries to our current King were the only ones sent? It depends on how old you think our King is and how many decades ago the trespass occurred. I can guarantee that if it happened when the former King was in power, he did his share of turn aways. The Fae sent out one every few years, with decreasing frequency as the years past and their ire grew.

And you torture people's families because they have the capacity to be hurt by the suffering. While most animals will instinctively fight to protect their young, there's little observed empathy. A dog won't suffer because you beat it's kids. It might bite you, but it won't suffer for it. At least not that we can tell.

And the Fae consider oathbreakers less than animals in the same way a person may consider a pedophile less than an animal. It's a crime that surmount the fundamental value that being has as a sentient intelligence.
