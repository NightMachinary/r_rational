** The action scenes were really confusing. Did Zira's spirit defeat all of those other spirit lions? By herself? How?

Why did Simba's dad save them? Was it because he took issue with his father possessing his son.

You might want to go over the action scene again and edit it so that it's easier for readers to follow it. That just went by in a big confusing blur for me for the most part. It was hard for me to keep track of who was attacking who and when and how etc.

*** Whilst I'm not sure how I feel about the confusing-ness of the action, I don't think Mufasa's reasoning really needs to be spelt out here. It's enough that we were assuming all this time that he was ruining the land to spite Scar, and to have that assumption turned on its head. That it's open-ended whether he actually forgave Scar or whether he just wanted to help Simba isn't a weakness here, and I could happily see the epilogue going either way on spelling it out or letting the reader draw their own conclusions.

*** Cheers for the feedback. If it's confusing that's very important for me to know, as that detracts from the action. Of course, I am also getting reviews like this:

  Orphiex:Wow. Did not see that coming at all. /Fantastic/ ending. Wouldn't change a single thing if I could. Looking forward to the epilogue!
#+end_quote

So I'm not sure if I should change it or not. Anyone else want to give a third/fourth/fifth opinion?

By being awesome. Or to put it in a less pithy way: She's always been a bloodthirsty hunter with an incredible single-minded focus towards destruction, which is why she became such a powerful destructive spirit after death. Most of the other kings were scruffy old men with not much fight in them, as you would expect from peacetime rulers. Ahadi however was both King and Captain during a constant war against hyenas, and so was spiritually powerful enough to beat her.

Also, he knew from Pokemon that water beats fire types, every time.

** I am very satisfied with that climax. It might have been better had we seen some of the visions of the past from this chapter earlier, would have planted the seeds of the reveal a little earlier. But I don't know where I would put them.

*** Heh, you're not the only one. I don't think it was really possible to see the final reveal coming, to be honest.

(Spoilers for this chapter ahead!)

The fact of the matter is that I didn't fully plan this story out ahead like I did with The Need to Become Stronger, and although I knew from the start that the Spirit Kings would be the final enemy (there was plenty of foreshadowing for that I think) it was only towards the end that I decided that they needed a face and a name to make it more personal, rather than just being "Nameless old dead kings possessing Simba". So I used Ahadi, who had been mentioned as being abusive towards Scar and playing a big role in his bitterness, as I thought it would fit.

I hope it didn't detract from the climax too much?

** This is great. I enjoyed the ending, but I recommend re-reading the story now that you know the climax and tweaking it to improve reader familiarity with Ahadi, rather than just having a flashback at the start of the penultimate chapter.

** I loved the twist of it not actually being Mufasa :) Well foreshadowed, in my view.
