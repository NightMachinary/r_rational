A story of intrigue, magic, and piracy, it begins in the wake of a brutal war, following the generation raised in its aftermath.

After three months and 100,000 words, Book 1 of Conquest of Avalon is officially complete. I posted a bit about this story here a while ago, with an explanation of why I believed it qualified as rational here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/m4t85j/conquest_of_avalon_an_original_fantasy_story_of/]]

With a magic system inherently dependant on sacrifice, CoA explores the morality and dynamics of power, both political and martial, and what people do in the wake of devastating defeat.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Seventeen years past, the Kingdom of Avalon invaded the Empire of the Fox from across the sea and conquered its capital, Malin, sending its rulers fleeing to the city of Guerron. The strange new technologies of the distant kingdom triumphed even over the power of the spirits, killing the Fox King and thousands along with him.

  Though time has brought with it peace, resentments have only grown in the wake of this War of the Foxtrap. Refugees defiantly dream of the day they can retake their homeland as nobles plot behind closed doors, even knowing it would mean another war. Until then, those of Guerron must put forward a friendly face, plying Avalon with tribute and trade, lest the Kingdom resume its ambitions of conquest.

** One standout review from Royal Road, with credit to Giles who posted it:

  Revanche. Revenge.

  The Kingdom of Avalon swept across the Empire of the Fox a generation past, conquering the heartlands and leaving the broken remnants to stew in the island duchy of Guerron.

  This isn't a story of Good versus Evil, of kindly kings doing their best to lift all subjects, or of unvsr ished heroes doing battle against evil.

  Instead, this story is about power: who has it, who wants it, and what people will do to obtain it. It is about the violence inherent in the imperial project and how even the most well-intentioned rulers and conquerors are, still, engaging in systemic violence against those conquered and defeated.

  Our three point-of-view characters are a farmboy turned fire wizard, an excitable duelist with more enthusiasm than sense, and a scheming mage-priestess bent on reclaiming her family's birthright and waging war on the foreign oppressors who rule her home...no matter the cost in blood or treasure. Fernan, Florette, and Camille are each delightfully different and their stories leave you eagerly awaiting the next new chapter.

  Come read Conquest of Avalon if you want a tight story exploring a fleshed-out workd made up of believable characters acting in realistic ways for waht they think of as the right course of action.
