I've seen it on a few posts, but am currently unable to figure out what it means. It's also [[http://puu.sh/6Im5E.png][not in the sidebar.]]

** [[/u/Yxoque]] gave the right answer but the tag seems to have been replaced by [D]. Don't know when this happened.

*** I think TIP is more a "Hey this is interesting" while D is "This is interesting and I want to talk about it for a while".

******* [TIP] seems to mean that you have figured something out and want to pass it on to the community at large. [D] means that you may have figured something out and want to submit it to peer review.

The way I see it. [D] and [TIP] are the same thing, except that [TIP] assumes itself to be true.
