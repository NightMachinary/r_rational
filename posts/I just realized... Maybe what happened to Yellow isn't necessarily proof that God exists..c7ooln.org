Story I'm referencing: [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/]]

What if Yellow went crazy after seeing Jesus' picture... because she saw Jesus' state of mind at /the end of his life, being crucified./ That could be enough to drive someone crazy.


** The problem with this theory is the shroud of Turin itself. Black states in the story that the shroud is "A perfect photographic representation of Jesus Christ, created by some unknown technology in the first century."

Now, I do agree that it doesn't mean that Jesus is literally god, but there would still have to be something really funky going on with him for there to be a camera+printer equivalent around to make the shroud.

** You would also have to explain why it would interfere with black's ability to see the future.

  “Don't you know how this will go, anyway?” asks Blue. “Why don't you just tell her what happens?”

  “Um,” said Black. “This is actually the one thing I haven't been able to see. I guess contact with God is inherently unpredictable, or something.”

*** Actually I thought Black couldn't foresee what would happen due to his future self being in a coma. His future visions manifests by seeing through the eyes of his future self. So if he is keeping his eyes closed in a month, then he can't foresee anything.

**** I don't think so since Black thinks about looking a millisecond into the future to see the entire world as it is currently. If he could only see what his future self sees then I don't think that trick would work.

#+begin_quote
  Also, a millisecond in the future is pretty indistinguishable from the present, so “seeing” a millisecond into the future gives you pretty much complete knowledge about the current state of the world.

** That would imply she never tried to read the mind of a dead person which seems implausible

*** It's not the death that would drive her insane, it's how horribly he died. It's more likely that she's never tried to read the mind of someone who died as horribly as Jesus did.

** Yellow went crazy because Jesus was the user of the yellow pill, in the previous cycle of the universe. They just couldn't handle the recursion.
