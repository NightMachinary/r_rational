Hello this is kind of a request/discussion thread.

I'm suffering from severe depression and need some help. Haven't clicked with any of my therapists and wanted to try reaching out to you guys.

I just read Learned Optimism and while I enjoyed it, the implementation system he describes just doesn't seem enough on its own. I'd really appreciate some books for better habit/outlook building that you could recommend.

Or anecdotes on how you dealt with depression/setbacks.


** There are two approaches I'd take to alleviate depression. The first is some basic stuff that has to do with our physiology. That stuff sounds trite and uninteresting but it's critical to dealing with depression. The second is a note about your lived environment and life purpose.

To hack your physiology and mood back to a more normal state, do these things. Don't try to do them, don't do them slightly more. Just do them all.

- Sleep. Aim for 8 hours or slightly more a night. If you're sleeping more, you may be using that as an avoidance tactic. If you're sleeping less, that can cause ongoing cognitive disturbances. Six hours is not enough, there's good science on this.
- Eat fruits and vegetables. You may think this is sounding like an after-school special, but the studies on this indicate some really mind-boggling differences. Not "statistically significant" differences, more like "cumulative 10% improvements in mood per serving" differences. Insert pun about low-hanging fruit here.
- Cardio exercise. If you can somehow do this in a natural setting, you're getting a twofer, since natural settings have been shown to elevate mood. But cardio exercise is a ridiculous mood elevator. There's a reason "runner's high" is a term of art.
- Human interaction. This is a kicker. If you go some days without talking to anyone meaningfully, that's cognitively very dangerous. Lonely people have biomarkers similar to people under incredible stress and mortality and negative life outcomes dramatically increases with loneliness. The increase in mortality with loneliness is actually similar to the risk increase with smoking.
- Sunlight. Lack of exposure to sunlight can directly cause, not just contribute to, depression (seasonal affective disorder).

Working on one area can have effects in the others. More sleep and better eating can make it easier to exercise, etc. On the other hand, improving in these areas can often mean confronting addictions--media addiction, for example.

There's another avenue of attack that I recommend as well, and that's evaluating your lived environment and purpose or direction in life. Your environment means your work and the people around you. If you feel disconnected from your environment--well, that's practically the definition of depression. This is also related to what you see as your purpose in life, a mission to accomplish or a community or organization you can advance the goals of. Even if you get your day-to-day mood in order, you may need to track down one of these to really get over depression. You may also need to radically change your life situation/milieu, which may require a physical relocation, starting/quitting school, or starting/quitting a job.

I'll also just say that you can't think your way out of depression. You need to make behavioral changes and change your life circumstances. We have a modern belief that "positive thinking" or other cognitive states change outcomes and perception. I think it's more generally true that different environments and different behaviors produce different cognitive states, so work on doing things differently, not thinking things differently.

**** As far as I can tell, it's a real phenomenon. To my knowledge, introversion is not protective. Lonliness, defined variously as few social connections or lack of confidantes, is associated with depression, poor life outcomes, and early death.

My own personal anecdotal evidence also suggests that this is a real thing. Even if you say you prefer to be alone, the evidence shows that your body and brain don't agree with you.

** I make it a rule to accept social invitations unless I have a conflict.

On any given night, I feel tired and like I'd rather stay in and read.

The problem is that nights in tend to blur together. The week feels like time flashed by without me doing anything. This really kills my every.

Defaulting to 'yes' breaks that pattern.

A nice side effect is that a reputation for saying yes means thay you'll get invited to more things.

*** Another way to manage it is to deliberately schedule in Things and Stuff until your days' schedules are noticeably distinct.

Sample of my current week:

- Tuesday: lift weights, run, get some groceries, cook dinner
- Wednesday: go biking, work on essay, bake with groceries from yesterday, leave work Slack open late because of coworkers being in Release Panic Mode
- Tonight: work on essay, meet with person downtown, probably do some studying
- Tomorrow night: probably try to work in a date night with the wife, possibly run

Weekend plans:

- Gym and run
- Probably board-games night with some friends
- Absolutely need to study for stuff, a lot
- Need to start signing up for more meetup groups and attending, due to all my current friends being geographically scattered and having weird schedules
- Bother the other friend whose girlfriend just got out of the hospital with appendicitis. See if I can grab him during his Wed-Thu weekend to do academia stuff

Other than work, gym, and running, things /need/ to be kept varied in order to maintain the density of complex experiences in mundane life.

** I have been reading these books on habit formation recently.

The Willpower Instinct - Kelly McGonigal

The Now Habit - Neil Fiore

Willpower - Roy F. Baumeister

Charles Duhigg - The Power of Habit

Some quotes from Charles Duhigg..

#+begin_quote
  This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.

  Over time, this loop---cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward---becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerges. Eventually, whether in a chilly MIT laboratory or your driveway, a habit is born.

  Habits aren't destiny. Habits can be ignored, changed, or replaced. But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit---unless you find new routines---the pattern will unfold automatically.

  Habits never really disappear. They're encoded into the structures of our brain, and that's a huge advantage for us, because it would be awful if we had to relearn how to drive after every vacation. The problem is that your brain can't tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it's always lurking there, waiting for the right cues and rewards.

  This explains why it's so hard to create exercise habits, for instance, or change what we eat. Once we develop a routine of sitting on the couch, rather than running, or snacking whenever we pass a doughnut box, those patterns always remain inside our heads. By the same rule, though, if we learn to create new neurological routines that overpower those behaviors---if we take control of the habit loop---we can force those bad tendencies into the background, just as Lisa Allen did after her Cairo trip. And once someone creates a new pattern, studies have demonstrated, going for a jog or ignoring the doughnuts becomes as automatic as any other habit.

The one thing that has genuinely helped me cope with my depression is learning about mindfulness meditation. Everyone should set aside five minutes of their day to just observe themselves, appreciate the present moment they are in. It's not about getting rid of your thoughts. You learn not to get so lost in them that you forget what your goal is.

Andy Puddicombe's Headspace is a good introduction to practicing mindfulness. It's also an app, with short guided meditation sessions.

I've also been enjoying reading on mindfulness - Jon Kabat-Zinn - Wherever You Go There You Are.

Legs: Weighted heel raisers 4x20 Leg Press 4x20 Lunges 4x20 Some other exercises idk the names to

Then end every workout with arms and another mile of running. Every fourth day is 3 miles of running.

During the summer I only work out twice a week but play ultimate, rock climb, and mountain bike.

Writer is coming, and dropping those sports could be a bummer. I know it's not the same, but maybe join an indoor climbing gym/club or do some other outdoor winter sports?

Also, if you're used to being outside in summer, watch out for Seasonal Affective Disorder. The days are already getting shorter, make sure you have enough vitamins in your diet and maybe try a sun lamp.

** An added thing is how much its important to "not do it alone", it being both life and also some of the specific things you do to alleviate the depression. If you feel like you need to exercise more, do it in a group; you are letting your life goals wither, get a group of like minded people to work on them together, etc.

Depression has a temptation to make you push off socializing until you are 'ready' or 'feeling better', which isnt always false but is often a trap.

** Okay, first of all, this is my experience with depression so yours could vary greatly. The thing that helped me the most was Stoicism, which is a following the teaching of Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and a couple of modern authors about how you face and live your life, based on what you control and virtue. I highly recommend you to take a look at [[/r/stoicism]] to check that out. Another thing that helped a lot was tulpamancy, the concept that you can create another sentient mind inside your own brain. It's much like Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw/etc. inside HPMOR Harry's mind, but on another level of thinking and reacting. The good folks at [[/r/tulpas]] can explain it better than I ever could. It helped me immensely by not feeling obliged to have the same degree of social interaction with others, and allowed me to be a better person altogether among other stuff.

On another note, I think understanding your depression helps just as much. I can't search for the source right now, but I read a recent study that considered depression not to be a disease/problem, but more like a defence mechanism for the brain. In situations where the brain isn't getting new knowledge/ being on the same routine every day, the brain goes into a 'depressed state' so it won't spend as much energy keeping your memories of the same stuff over and over. The same happens when you are constantly sad, the brain goes into a state so it won't keep those memories of being sad. The conclusion for that article was that better than getting exercise or eating/sleeping well, a good course of action would be to force yourself to experience new things regularly; going to that new coffee shop in town, watching a orchestra, going to the beach, anyway, whatever suits your fancy.

Hope I could help, my best wishes that you can pull through it :)

** First - What time zone are you in? (I'm PST) I'll tots pop on calls with you (I'll PM my number?). I'm not a shrink or anything, but I go through phases of really needing meaningful human contact, too. And people generally think I say helpful things.

Second - AFAIK, there's a distinct difference between "depression" and "feeling bad". Depression, AFAIK, is a low-energy state; you don't have the oomph to do anything. Feeling bad (like after a break up, or while pining) is a different thing. Which are you experiencing?

I typed up a bunch of crap, but that'd be me telling far more than listening.

Which part of the world are you in?

I read some of your other comments. You're highly physically active. How's your social anxiety / comfort in new situations?

I would definitely look at acroyoga and contact improv; acroyoga is rather more widespread.

** I was going through a severe depression because I was going through some bad life stuff. What cured me instantly (within one month, stopped taking it after that with no withdrawl) was NSI-189 however this is experimental.

Since then I've discovered safer stuff but haven't had any real major depressions (one reason might be that I take CBD pretty regularly). You could try CBD oil and the Wim Hof breathing technique (youtube has a lot of videos on it, should feel effects instantly and see if it clicks with you)

Never had a therapist or any real friends who can listen and I've gone through some pretty depressing shit. Introspection + learning a ton about human behaviour / psychology will help you figure out the real causes of your depression, then take some stuff like CBD, maybe try smoking weed to get out of your funk so you can fix the real problems. For general life advice I find Jordan Peterson videos to be of immense value.

Also getting angry helps me when I'm feeling down, one of the ways I get angry is piracetam and aggresive music like hip hop / rock. I feel anger is much easier to reach for than calmness / happiness while depressed. But you need to be careful to get angry at the right things, like your old self for doing stupid shit that got you to where you are instead of getting angry at the world / people that caused you pain. I find accepting responsability for every shitty thing that happens to me and then using anger to make sure I never do the stupid shit again helps aswell.
