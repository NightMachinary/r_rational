Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** [[https://i.imgur.com/5x2kMlt.jpg][WHO WOULD WIN in a competition between my dog and my cat?]]

Let's say they compete to knock each other off the above log, because they may be rivals, but they're still friends :]

[[https://i.imgur.com/c5jbLC8.jpg][PIPSQUEAK (DOG)]]:

+ Heavier (12 lbs)

+ Heavily armored

+ Longer reach and teeth

+ Far more fighting experience (14y)

- Not as limber as in youth

- Nuclear sclerosis may limit vision

- Most teeth removed

[[https://i.imgur.com/uucxPom.jpg][MONTE (CAT)]]:

+ Cat, with cat-like reflexes

+ More versatile and pointy claws

+ Very sneaky

+ Can do a pull-up

- Poor depth perception and field-of-view

- Smol boi (7 lbs @ 8 months)

- Easily distracted by rustling leaves, passing birds

(PS, Monte was on leash here, I just magic-wanded it out)

I missed that at first. I say definitely Monte, b/c a dog approaching a hissing cat will reflexively do flanking behavior. Pipsqueak will fall off the log. Claws hurt, and we don't forget that fact even in friendly competitions. I'd probably lose to Monte for the same reason.

Also Pipsqueak looks wizened, far too wise to terrorize a youthful cat over a contest that he can easily forfeit by jumping down. An older dog is smart enough to pick his battles.

You are right in that Pipsqueak would forfeit first. Monte tries to play with him as he would with another cat, but that's not a language the pup understands. So he mostly just runs away ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I won't vouch for the validity of any of these ideas, but they are ideas.

Change the rules:

- Violence allowed
- Or, only valid threatening behavior is licking
- Play in a trench, animal must escape instead
- Put beds on the log. Adjust comfort to even the odds (give Monte a box, Pipsqueak a pillow)
- Put food off the log. Adjust tastiness to even the odds.

Change the game:

- Frisbee retrieval (size disk appropriately, or make it out of dog treats to undo Pipsqueak advantage)
- Sumo wresting (flanking allowed)
- A race (Monte likely to get distracted)
- Soccer (mass advantage for Pipsqueak)
- Likes on Social Media (both your animals are very cute)

  - Smol boi (7 lbs @ 8 months)
#+end_quote

Cats can continue growing to their adult size until like 18 months, so it could just be that. However, generally cats are expected to gain about a pound a month, so you'd expect more like 8lbs rather than 7lbs.

One of my girls is 7.5lbs at /five years/. Sometimes cats just turn out smaller than average.

Smol gurl is the second cat I got. She and the first cat were each at about eight months when I got them, the third was at ~2ish years, and the fourth was at probably right around 5-and-a-half weeks.

Rescued that last one from the side of a highway, she was literally on the actual road and probably would've been run over within the next 3 minutes if we hadn't stopped the car and scooped her up. Her being too young to be separated from her mother led me to do a great deal of research into raising a tiny baby kitten, so I learned (for the first time since getting the first cat in 2012) that a cat is still technically considered a kitten until 12 months, and that you should still be feeding them kitten food until then. Kitten food has more taurine in it than adult food because kittens need more taurine than adults since they're in a growth stage.

Maybe my smol gurl wouldn't be quite as small if I'd known to feed her kitten food for the first four months of having her, rather than putting her directly on adult food.

The third one turned out to have already been fixed when we took him to the vet (we assume he was abandoned since he was starving with ribs clearly and distinctly visible), so Smol Gurl is might be the only cat to have been spayed as late as 8 months. I had the youngest spayed at 3 months. Spaying earlier apparently leads to a larger adult size.

So if Monte isn't still eating kitten food, and if he hasn't already been neutered, then those are things to think about. I'm not making assumptions about whether or not you've already thought about those things, I'm just putting it out there because I didn't know those things myself until my fourth cat. If he's already neutered and still eating kitten food, then, hey, sometimes cats is just smol.

**** Ah, thank you for the advice :] in this case I'd say he's more a smol boi right now, and in comparison to the pup -- everyone seems to think he'll grow up to be quite big, and from looking at charts e.g. [[https://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/10.2460/javma.255.2.205][here]] he may have a few more pounds in him yet.

Otherwise, he was castrated pretty early and is on a (fairly regimented) AAFCO All Life Stages diet. I think that should be sufficient for development and growth (my partner's not a nutritionist but has rotated through a veterinary nutrition block and they seem cool with it).

** Some miscellaneous thoughts after (an out of order) rereading of Worth The Candle:

- Joon eats Elk strips while at the barren jewel hotel. Many chapters later we learn that elk are extinct but an entad called the Jade Elk mass produces Elk which are slaughtered for their meat.

- Rereading old comments, I saw someone speculate that Joon's Earth is a simulation also because his hometown is literally called Bumblefuck. I thought this was an over literal reading, but on reread, Joon consistently refers to it as Bumblefuck not just as a description, but also as a literal proper noun, so this is a more convincing than I first thought.

- I can see several places were the Outer Reaches anti-meme might have cut off conversations and line of thought. In particular, the discussion with Heshnel's group that turned violent might have had a major and critical discussion because it is so similar to the Dungeon Master. This could be why Valencia was thrown off so hard and it could have influenced the direction of the conversation in a way that pushed O'kald and Evertt to violence and left Joon's team with no memory of it.

- side note: I think I missed if they checked: can spirit magic effect/sense Valencia? (If not she can't help them with the Outer Reaches stuff).

- I can see in hindsight I can clearly see how Joon doesn't give Fenn enough credit or take her serious... but this definitely doesn't justify Valencia, indeed it seems like something they could work out and change their habits.

- All the stuff with Bethel's threats are painful to read in hindsight...

*** The town definitely isn't literally called Bumblefuck. Even if his town were a simulation, which seems like a bit of a narrative dead end, it would have to be a poor simulation, or at least one highly divergent from ours, to have a Midwestern town be called a derogatory term for Midwestern towns. If that were changed, the whole origin world or simulation would have to have a series of other changes to support it, which isn't in the text.

He does call it Bumblefuck highly consistently, but I think that's a function of AW not wanting to name the town but having to refer to it relatively often. It does sometimes feel like sour note..it feels bitter to call your town that a few times but fully pathological to call it that every single time. Not really inconsistent with the characterization, though.

Any word on when the next chapters will drop?

**** The DM has added winks and nods in the form of anagrams and puns all over Aerb, so it isn't implausible they would add them to an Earth sim.

Given all the other oddities (Cidium being over a million years old while Aerb is only 30,000 years old) and improbabilities the DM has pulled off (Aerb versions of Juniper and friends living out lives nearly identical to their Earth counterparts), it wouldn't be that hard for the DM to either simulate a midwestern town with a weird name in isolation as opposed to a full Earth or to simulate a full Earth with a fabricated midwestern town and then put an anti meme effect on the town's odd name.

If Joon switched through various derogatory nicknames, I wouldn't consider this theory, but he uses the name Bumblefuck even in contexts that aren't derogatory. Still given the quasi-SI nature avoiding using a real town name makes sense.

Either way is a form of precommitment, but while a reversible version is a lesser precommitment, it potentially preserves something that has some value to you. Besides that, there's a risk that after three months or so you find yourself just making a new account, or get used to browsing without an account, or otherwise adapting to the inconvenience, in which case it would be better to be able to go back to an old, established account.

*** Rational doesn't mean intelligent, well-informed, powerful, etc. In DnD terms, being strictly rational is more along the lines of having 20+ Wis. I don't think an undead rational faction is so different from the trope of a single high Wis mastermind lich/necromancer with endless hordes of undead.

Also, why not have FLAQTSC as a goal? Tonnes of DnD campaigns have the ultimate endpoint of 'the party ascends to godhood and saves the world'. It certainly makes a lot of sense for a faction to strive towards imposing their idea of utopia on the universe.

As for the dramatic adventure, consider the perspective of the min-max murder hobo treasure goblin. Burgle kingdom treasuries of rare magical artifacts, manipulate fools where possible into profitable trade deals, cheese dungeons where ever possible for sweet loot. All this for the purpose of gaining power, preferably discretely, and eventual apotheosis.

Overall, I don't really see how a rational faction would differ so significantly from a typical fantasy faction beyond the high Wis aspect.

*** In addition to what others have mentioned, I think that any rational storyline in the DnD setting needs to deal with the gods. If everyone is happy in the afterlife, why do you want immortality on the material plane? Could a better world happen in which the focus were to convert everyone to the dieties that had the best afterlives? This could easily result in either the characters finding themselves dissatisfied with the available afterlives, finds that the afterlives don't quite work as advertised, or that a supermajority of the gods are against undeads and will actively oppose them in their dream for an undead utopia. Any adventure that involves battling gods can easily become dramatically satisfying, though you need to be careful in how you define gods and their powers.

Suppose I was in the OOtS campaign I would have major objections both to the dwarven afterlife(modelled after a christian view of the nordic afterlives in which it's aweful to die not fighting) and for the Snarl.

*** Your rational undead faction is a slow AI; a growing corporation; a growing area of positive growth or a cancer. It just dep[ends on perspective. Every other faction is made of people they could add to their numbers and using land they could desecrate (making it better for undead), so whatever their goals they will want to expand, possibly slowly and through legislation, possibly through portals and blitzkrieg, if your friends are like minded, and you care for big video gamish plots you might have a sobering story by making them a faction to be put down or assisted in taking a neighboring kingdom/ the world/ the plane.

If you want them as a semi static but no reed richard is useless faction make them slowly expanding: demesis near them will be conquered between stories with any stored treasures and cohorts lost, nearby villages with contacts are still there when re-visted, but have been coqured or co-opted and some notables died in the process. The grey steppes (or whatever you name them) are welcoming to those who can survive and do not abuse the mindless undead on their periphery (those that they have not yet recovered from their first death, as the process does take time and skilled undead, but who provide a cheap first line defense and will eventually be returned as incorporeal intelligent undead if struck down)

You don't need any big plots: their slow meticuliously planned campaign of expansion, and the contracts between the quality of un-life within their border, the pain outside an the horror of the expansion should give you all you need. As enemies every perosn is competent level appropriate threats in a optimized OODA loop, as patrons they are welcoming, generously equipping, scarilly prepared, and very tight on operational details as the players (assumedly) are not yet undead so their loyalties are questionable.

for adventure... you always need more materials to make things with. some materials are from dangerous monsters, and now the undead need to hire adventurers to get things for them. could even be an open bounty.

the next problem, is what is luxury to the dead? why, they could just lock themsleves in a tomb and stay hidden for a hundred years or so. boring, but safer than being exposed to everyone hating them. and for that matter, would it be better to move to another plane? the githyanki went to the astral where they dont age, or need food or water.

*** The endpoint of the story, or the endpoint goals of the faction?

The rationalist faction is probably going to want to make peace with the other factions. There will be plenty of kings, officials, adventurers, and even ideologies opposed to cooperation. Nevermind that they are undead, those who live by war don't want an end to war. Of course, the undead thing is an easier sell. Instant conflict, as you said. Resolving the sources of conflict can be the interesting part of the campaign.

I'd end the story itself when a major barrier to cooperation is removed (violently or otherwise) and leave the end state of the universe to the imagination of the players. As for the space communism, maybe getting outside the light cone is a challenge they'd approach.

Cause think about any of the Good gods still invovled in the blood war. An afterlife of good where you do have to worry about demon invasion still seems kinda iffy.

An immortal existence of playing chess with other skeletons could easily be preferable.

Could you elaborate? Also, you could always have them not be "sufficiently" rational for that. Just more rational than most of everyone else. Have undeath seriously hamper with innate compassion and instead have their society based on enlightened self-interest, with that translating into literally not caring about the peasantry of foreign nations insofar those people can't help them in any way that would be worth the effort.

Or else, make them act rationally good in ways abhorrent to outsiders. Like, obviously the life of a wild animal is one of suffering, so a spell that sterilizes all non-magical non-sentients in an area is the best and most efficient act possible to lessen net suffering. And since without animals, the need for food, the ability to smell or taste, or the same ability as humans to appreciate natural beauty, plants aren't really needed, there is zero reason to work on containing all the negative energy that is blighting the earth due to blatant use of necromantic magicks.

You are right in that I could just make them less rational but that feels dirty to me. I suppose it is just me being too precious about it.

I do like the sword of good angle there. I hadn't thought of making them people who would press the button.

*** Yup, that gets discussed sometimes. Three issues, in increasing order of importance:

- It's really hard to estimate the expected value of that kind of intervention.

- It's political, which will alienate people (which reduces donations). Right now a conservative, a libertarian, a communist and your grandma can get together and agree that more mosquito nets would be nice, yay EA. Not so if EA starts to be about e.g. establishing a carbon tax, or redirecting military budget towards foreign aid.

- It's a crowded market. We can expect all the low-hanging briberies have already been done, and now you're just committing your piddling strength to a zero-sum tug-of-war. The biggest EA wins are where nobody else gives a shit.

** I'm behind on the latest chapters of Animorphs: The Reckoning. I know this is heinous as it was always the update I looked most forward to seeing. Can someone please comment something to the effect of "OMG magicweasel, the chapters you've not yet read are awesome, you really should get on it" so that way I can read them.

In related news I've been sorting through my bookshelf and made a pile of books I need to read. I think I'm going to try and read them (all?) in 2020.

--------------

In further related news my 2020 is going to be hectic:

- Trip to LA / SF in Feb (hit me up anyone who wants to meet up with me, CouteauBleu and SvalbardCaretaker can both confirm I didn't murder them, or if I did murder them I replaced them with bots based on GPT2 of their posts)

- Probably going to have to apply for a promotion in Feb too, and government jobs take about 12 hours of work to apply for (I actually have a decent chance of getting it, like, 25% probably??)

- French boyfriend coming to visit for March

- Studying part time from Feb-June

- ~Month in Paris in July

- Studying part time from August-November

- Want to finish Vampire Flower Language Volume 1 (about 7 chapters uploaded)

- I have a full time job, by the way

... actually that's not so bad. It's really the first three months that are going to be hectic.

--------------

Finally, this is the year I really have started putting beeminder goals for like everything. I realised I haven't played the new pokemon game as much as I wanted to because I was playing Tower Defense on my phone instead, so I have literally made a beeminder goal for playing the new pokemon game, which is cray, because I'm like optimising my leisure time because that's apparently how Type A I am now?

--------------

And my motto that I've had since the middle of November and will have through the end of 2020 is "No Fucks Given". I got it from an enamel badge I bought, and it's proving instructive.

It's not clear what chapter you stopped reading... so I might spoil something... the animorph's efforts to communicate to the rest of the world has pushed the conflict with the Yeerks to a global scope, to the point that the Animorphs struggle to find ways to meaningful contribute, until a few more Elimist/Crayak shenigans gives them a few key opportunities. Esplin (Visser 3) continues to be devious and several canon elements are introduced and remixed in creative rationalist ways.

** So I've been toying around with an idea where magic, at its core, is kind of evil/bad, the rules for which are that "mana" can only be obtained by causing suffering. This brings up a lot of interesting questions about how to get mana in the most moral ways (probably self-harm) and how exactly you'd go about measuring suffering. Which brings us to a scenario I have for yall, let's say you sneak into someone's house in the dead of night, waterboard them for hours then dry them off, use magic to delete their memories of the torture, and put them back to sleep. They'll probably wake up exhausted with something like a super bad sore throat but that'll be the extent of their suffering (I'm probably oversimplifying the potential physical dangers of waterboarding here but I'm having trouble thinking of another way to cause intense physical/psychological suffering without also causing severe injury). Where does this rank on the immorality scale? It obviously isn't a moral act (unless maybe you juxtapose it against the costs of letting the Bad Guys win because they're willing to do worse stuff to gain more mana), but is it worse than torturing animals? What if the person agrees to be tortured in exchange for money/something, is it still immoral? Is it immoral to only torture "bad" people, essentially going the Dexter route? It should probably be noted, that by wiping the victim's memory of the torture, you are preventing a steady trickle of mana that would come from their lifelong trauma.

*** If you're allowing animal suffering, you could probably just install capture equipment around factory farms and end up with more mana than humanity would know what to do with.

Actually, this might be a pretty nice world. Assuming you can objectively measure suffering, if you could make sufficiently precise suffering detectors, you could use it for all sorts of applications. You could walk into a store and buy a mattress that is proven to reduce suffering by 21 microfloggings a night versus their nearest competitor.

*** > Is it immoral to only torture "bad" people, essentially going the Dexter route?

Yes,although you could say it's lower on the immorality scale than torturing innocents, since if someone really needs to torture it's better than it is the worst people.But It still rates very low on the morality scale and you should really make sure its the only way, and preferably not do it at all.

I'm not going to say that you should never torture people for power since your specific scenario sounds like it could lead to some situations where that is actually the best choice, but I will say you should act like that's the case since otherwise you are likely to rationalize yourself into doing horrible things instead of finding out a better option.

Especially since its doing bad things for power, humans generally can't be trusted with doing bad things to get power to do good things.Instead you could just get someone that is a big masochist and or turn yourself into one and then get mana trough self harm, and enjoy it.Like in Efflugence [[https://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html?style=site]]

Or you could maybe cause mild inconveniences to lots of people instead depending on how mana scales.

Does it count as suffering if you enjoy it? I feel like if this was only physical pain, this would be an easy out, or just find the least sentient creature that is capable of feeling pain and go to town on them. Without the emotional pain part, I don't think there would be any good reason to use human suffering which would kind of remove most of the conflict from the magic system.

*** In /The Ur-Quan Masters/, there is mention of a device called an 'Excruciator', which works by directly stimulating the pain nerves of the wearer, leaving him/her/it in constant, excruciating pain (hence the name) but not actually harming him. There, it's used as a defense against hostile mind control (since anyone trying to control your mind also feels the pain you feel) but it strikes me that, in the world you postulate, a mage may well go around wearing an Excruciator in order to increase his power...
