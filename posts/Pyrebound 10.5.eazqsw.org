Another chapter ended. Let me know what's good, what's bad, and what's ugly.

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/12/15/chapter-10-5/]]

PB is an original fantasy novel set in a semi-Mesopotamian world (it resembles Sumer about as much as Middle-Earth resembles medieval Europe). The cosmos are broken, life is tough, and somebody has to wind up on the bottom of a very harsh and unjust society. Our hero Rammash doesn't care for that. If that sounds interesting, the story starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. Thanks for reading!


** Just finished reading the story so far. I quite like it. The worldbuilding is interesting, and seems pretty deep, albeit it doesn't feel quite as deep as it seems to be. I like the ubiquitousness of broken systems. Not just the system of the society, but the magic system itself is stuck propagating a cycle of injustice. Defeating evil empires is easy compared to building good ones, and all that.

*** Thanks! That is generally what I was going for. Could you elaborate, though, on "doesn't feel quite as deep as it seems to be"? Do you mean that the story's scope or our perspective is too limited, for example?

**** We only get to follow one perspective. I don't think you could advance the story like you have, keeping a strong pace, if you tried to cram more worldbuilding detail in. Certainly not with the same word count.

Someone like Brandon Sanderson has multiple perspectives and a ton more words to explore his worlds. Word for word, your story's plot moves quicker. I think every author has to find where they are happy.

For a web serial example, Delphic spends a lot more time world and character building than you do, and thus the plot advances much more slowly.

***** Ah. I considered doing interludes at first, but realized I didn't have anything interesting to say in them. It'd just be villains, etc. dropping exposition, or irrelevant scenes. Thanks for chipping in.

** My history seems to be failing me, could you please tell me which chapter was the one where Ram recently came into his powers and was heading back somewhere I think with his family? This is after they robbed the barge and after the place with the caves.

*** I'm afraid you've stumped me on that one. Ram gets indwelt at the end of Chapter 5. He picks up his family at the end of Chapter 6, has them in Dul Misishi (the mining pyre where Darun grew up) by the start of Chapter 7, and leaves them there before the start of Chapter 8 (when they hijack the tax assessment). They've been there ever since. There's no point after 8.1 where he's going anywhere with his family. He's returning to Dul Karagi via skybarque at the start of 9.1--is that what you're thinking of? Or you might mean 9.5, when he's just survived the ambush by the moonchildren and is going back to Dul Karagi to confront Jushur about it. Those are the only recent updates I can think of where Ram is returning anywhere he's been before. Sorry I can't be more help.

This is the one I'm pretty sure. Thx for the moonchildren spoilers ;P

***** Crap! Sorry, I assumed from the way you were commenting on 10.5 that you had read up to that point and were going back to re-read on something (perhaps for a fan theory or some such).

****** No worries, I should've been clearer. It was 8.1 actually.
