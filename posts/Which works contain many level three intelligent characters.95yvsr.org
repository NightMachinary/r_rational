I think I've noticed that a lot of fiction will have the main character be level three intelligent, but everyone else around them is lesser. An obvious example is the TV show House, in which the MC is rarely outsmarted and never for long. Sherlock Holmes and Artemis Fowl are other obvious examples (if they can be called level three intelligent). In contrast, HPMOR has at least three obvious level three intelligent characters, (I'm not so sure about dumbledore) all though HP is still demonstrated as being levels above everyone else.

(Worm, Luminosity, The Good Student and The Arithmancer have a few each, but still treat there main character's as special).

My guess is that this is because level three characters are difficult to get right, and that having everyone else be less smart makes the character stand out.

Are there any works in which intelligence is more of a norm, Where most major characters are demonstrated level two or three?

I've discovered I like "listening" to intelligent people think, and am greedy for more examples.

Thanks.

Funny you should mention Holmes, because in [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][the essay where Yudkowsky defines level 3 intelligent characters]], he specifically points to Sherlock Holmes as a /negative/ example:

#+begin_quote
  But when you look at what Sherlock Holmes does - you can't go out and do it at home. Sherlock Holmes is not really operating by any sort of reproducible method. He is operating by magically finding the right clues and carrying out magically correct complicated chains of deduction. Maybe it's just me, but it seems to me that reading Sherlock Holmes does not inspire you to go and do likewise. Holmes is a mutant superhero.

The Ender's Shadow series/"Bean Quartet" is pretty good about having a large cast of intelligent characters that have to deal with real challenges using limited resources. One thing that comes up several times throughout the series are scenarios where two parties have no way to communicate/coordinate, but they manage to arrive at a sort of Schelling point by thinking, "Okay, the person I'm trying to coordinate with is a smart person, so all I have to do right now is think 'what would a smart person do in their situation' and I'll have a pretty good idea of what their plan is and what they need me to do in order for it to succeed."

In Shadow of the Hegemon, this happens when one person in captivity is trying to communicate messages to the outside world without their captors knowing. The prisoner has to use a messaging method subtle and hidden enough that the captors won't detect it, and the rescuer has to both locate and decipher that message without ever having been told where to look for it. Shadow of the Hegemon has three main viewpoint characters, and all of them are intelligent. There's a similar case in Shadow of the Giant, where one character (who is ostensibly an honored guest, but is actually little more than a glorified prisoner) has to "communicate" his escape plan to the rescuer in plain view of the captors -- of course, because he's being watched, the only "communication" that really takes place here is "you're here at my behest, now figure out what I want you to do," and the rescuer has to deduce the fact that the prisoner is actually being held against his will, that he has a plan for escape, and the plan's nature soon becomes evident when answering the question "what plan would I devise if I were a captive smart person trying to coordinate with another smart person?"

One of the other things that the Bean Quartet is also good about doing is showing how intelligent characters can still have epistemic blind spots (usually places where they rely too heavily on heuristics), and then showing how they go about recognizing and overcoming those blind spots, and also diagnosing how they developed those blind spots to avoid repeating similar patterns of thinking in the future. So in that sense, there's actually a sense of "learning to be smarter," rather than simply being a story of "smart people doing smart things," even though the characters are all really intelligent to begin with. Another theme of the books is that being a rational person does not make you immune to irrational impulses, even when you recognize that those impulses are irrational. For example, knowing "it would be irrational for me to gloat right now" does not magically remove your desire to gloat, and knowing the methods of psychological warfare that your captors are using against you does not magically make you immune to the psychological torment. The characters are smart, and a big part of being smart is trying to figure out how to deal with the limitations of being human.

** I don't think any of the characters you cited are level 3 intelligent, by EZ's definition. At best they're level 2. (and EZ's description of level 3 intelligent was kind of vague, actually).

/Animorphs The Reckoning/ and /Glimwarden/ are often cited as having multiple protagonists with different perspective, who are all just as important, smart and interesting. Unfortunately, both of them are in hiatus right now.

***** I would recommend looking up realistic-style pokemon fan art rather than the official art. If you're unfamiliar with pokemon and the only drawing of a pikachu you've ever seen is the cartoon one from the show, you may have trouble reconciling it with the more serious realistic nature of P:tOoS.

** Dr. House and Sherlock Holmes are both the "writer faking character intelligence by giving the character random insights" type of intelligent, neither one of them is level 3 intelligent.

Have you tried Mother of Learning? I've only read the first two chapters and it was quite a while ago (I'm waiting for the whole thing to be finished so I can read it all in one go), but I remember thinking that the main character had somewhat of an HJPEVish sort of vibe to him.

*** Pretty much everyone acts rationally in that story. Even the guys you think act according to a trope only do it when they see no negative side effects of doing so. (Examples of that include: The Crazy Teacher, The Shonen Protagonist, The Overly Strict Mother, and whatever the hell Taiven is.)

*** I have tried it, and liked it a lot. The only issue is I stopped a few dozen chapters in, and it's now very hard to find my place because of the looping.

Planning to wait until it's finished.

I also enjoyed The Good Student, for similar reasons to Mother Of Learning, but am waiting for that to be completed too.

I agree with your thoughts on House, most of his "insites" were based on weird coincidences. And now I think about it, most of his commentary is Straw manning.

***** Sherlock's Sherlock is about as un-level 3 as you can get. Most of his deductions are presented at lightning-fast speed, as if the show is saying "Good luck trying to follow this. Sherlock is a genius, and fuck you." (And when you can actually follow what he's saying, it's usually total bullshit.)

*** I don't think your first sentence is correct, even considering what you said in the spoiler.

There is much debate about how much influence your second statement has over the characters as a whole. And I tend to think that for the vast majority of characters who aren't Thinkers of some sort, the influence is very small and subtle as far as their actual intelligence goes.

They gain increased ability to do things, but not the intelligence to do them in particularly novel or efficient ways. Which is why you see the main character sometimes comment on how some people are wasting their power's potential.

But overall I'd say Worm isn't really a story about geniuses competing with wit. But more about people of average to above average intelligence using extraordinary powers to the best of their ability.

Most characters aren't incredibly clever, but they use everything they have at their disposal to solve their problems. The ones who are incredibly clever aren't simply smart because of the reason you stated, but rather because they spend time considering the best way to use their tools and have a natural mind for improvisation.

**** I very much agree with your post and for anyone who sincerely believes the original post spoiler I would urge them to actually compare the actions that characters make throughout the story with their respective personalities and motivations. I can easily imagine each of the characters to act in the ways that they do without any underlying mental influence to rob them of their agency. Hell the latest chapter of Ward even addresses this misconception directly by stating that there is little evidence to show direct mental manipulation in parahumans

Worm is more about realism than anything else which I suspect is why it sometimes gets criticized in this subreddit for not being rationalist. The story never focuses on or flaunts the intellects of the characters, but simply expresses them in a believable way corresponding to the characters.

** The Wheel of Time series has many characters who I think fit the description. Then again there are literally over a hundred characters you need to keep track of over the series, so I guess it's a numbers game at that point. At least a few of them needed to be highly inteligent and competent.
