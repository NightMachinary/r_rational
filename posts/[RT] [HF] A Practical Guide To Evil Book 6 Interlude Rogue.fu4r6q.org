*** My crackpot theory is that the Rouge Sorcerer is somehow both of them, getting his Rogueishness from Oliver, and his Sorcerery from Roland.

**** Nah it's pretty clear in his Aspects. *Confiscate* and *Use* imply he took and then became his brother.

** Last chapter someone had crossposted the [[/r/PracticalGuideToEvil]] post here instead of making a new post. I suggest we continue that trend, as it's useful to link the discusion - we average 3-5 comments here and they over 100.

Also, for those who didn't notice (like me), bonus chapter here [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2020/04/03/charlatan-i/]]

** since the fay are bound to stories more then mortals, Monks betrayal probably made it easy for Cat to pick the story that ends with the demise/retreat of the fay, can't be that many stories of 5 man band betrayals to pick from.

*** Well, for one, I'm pretty sure that Providence is currently rewarding Catherine for playing her Role of an unsuspecting senior investigator digging up an important revelation before being silenced by a traitor hidden in the ranks: had she openly mistrusted the Artificer after airing out the things with her and taken her down to the first floor, either of the actual traitors would have sabotaged the second line of defense.

Even had she openly "suspected without a reason" the Poet's suggestion to not block the air corridor, or just left him as a backup (and to keep an eye on him, since he was the one to let the last two fairies up), the Monk would have gone upstairs instead and just poke through the web of Light. The Nightsplosion is, hopefully, here to prevent him from doing the same now from invisibility.
