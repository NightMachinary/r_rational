** Giving the drug to a thousand people, because you think you can determine who deserves to live and who deserves to die? permaTruth is thinking along the right lines, but he overestimates his own intelligence.

Give the drug out for free to everybody? Better, but that would start the mother of all wars. Last chance to assassinate your enemies, everybody! Better hurry up and nuke Pyongyang, it won't work this time next week!

So, make everybody immortal, at the same time, in secret with no warning. Oh, and as quickly as possible. I think that would be my wish.

*** Gotta agree. He wasn't even specific enough for it to be worth it. He didn't make himself smarter, or make it easier to gain information. He chose to only create enough Elixir of Life to serve a small population, ensuring most of humanity will miss out. All in all, it is a huge wasted opportunity that - at /best/ - creates a real Illuminati or ra!Wheel Group.

** This just seems too broken to be particularly interesting. Ascending to godhood, becoming omnipotent, or anything like that are guaranteed to work, and render anything else useless

*** Well... how exactly would you go about trying to become omnipotent?

This is a distinct power to the /Path to Victory/, because it just makes your attempt work - it doesn't allow for any kind of feedback or give you any help in planning how to go about it. It also doesn't help you select a worthwhile goal...

***** I don't know, but rigorously defining perfection is essentially equivalent to creating an FAI. Or at least, it's equivalent to writing the utility function that will make the difference between an UFAI and an FAI.

Creating FAI is a step in a process, not the end-goal. The end-goal is to *SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS EVERYWHERE*, and if that sounds poorly-defined, I think FAI is poorly-defined too.

If you get one wish, why would you ask for something that will get you what you want, rather than asking for what you want directly? It seems to add an unnecessary step to the plan, and a possible point of failure.

*** No. The thing I would attempt is to create a strong general friendly recursively-self-improving AI, running on Amazon / Google / Microsoft Web services. I figure that it should be able to pay for its running costs pretty quickly, become absurdly resilient, and turn into something well beyond a Culture Mind.

This is only because I'm not sure how one would go about trying to make a 0 percent chance of failure on the next action a permanent effect. It might even be /stronger/ than Path to Victory in the very short term, though it doesn't have the Thinker part that helps formulate goals and that would probably ruin the long game.

Unless it's more efficient to seize control of the datacenter, or find another way of operating that doesn't require it to earn money, et cetera.

*** It appears to be common thing in these sort of threads for other posters to add clauses and drawbacks, like this guy

[[http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2e3y3e/if_you_knew_the_next_thing_you_attempted_would/cjw84z7]]

here for example.

So I guess you could go for the end all FAI, but it might incur an equal or greater drawback. Randomly generated black holes or the world being a simulation used by an alien mind to best defeat humanity or some such.

**** There are two main families of drawbacks in these situations: unintended consequences and randomly interjected punishments. Unintended consequences are fun to think about. They're sometimes reasonable things to be concerned about when actually implementing things like you wished for or envisioned. Random punishments are just annoyances.

Examples:

#+begin_quote
  "I wish I had a huge fortune!"

  "Done. You got it when all your friends and relatives died simultaneously. Also, the IRS is investigating you."
#+end_quote

Versus:

#+begin_quote
  "I wish I had a huge fortune!"

  "Done. Now you have cancer."
