A [[http://www.amazon.com/Rosemary-Kirstein/e/B001ITXALI][series of books]] (incomplete and on a slow schedule, unfortunately!) that follows Rowan the steerswoman - the steerswomen being a hypertrophied navigator's / almanac maker's guild that treats the truth as a sacred value.

This makes a steerswoman the perfect character to be Too Inquisitive For Her Own Good.

Steerswomen have to solve most of their problems through rationality. Oh, and swords. And fire. But what I mean is that reasoning is actually demonstrated for the reader, not merely implied - to the degree that I'm pretty sure that Kirstein is deliberately modeling rationality skills for her readers.

Also, it's a fun read, with fun characters, and interesting themes like sharing vs. hoarding information, alienness, and what makes someone a good steerswoman.


** Cool. I haven't read it, but I'm upvoting based on your description.

Also, apparently, I can buy either the kindle version for 3€ or the physical book for 100€.

*** it is science fiction in the very best way - the practice of science and epistemology is integral to the plot. They are also just very good books. The Ebook version is the one the author sees actual profit from - the physical copies are used. :)
