Anyway, I was thinking it'd be neat if Sam managed to write something that broke the fourth wall. The "it knows as much about you as you know about it", for example, has some interesting possibilities.

** SCP-1425's page places it in April/May 2005, and makes reference to a 'Project LETHE' that sounds a lot like the bomb described here. Is the reference here 54 years off, or is the implication that SCP-1425 has happened twice and been resolved the same way both times? If so, is this a "when the stars are right" kind of thing? Sounds very CASE NIGHTMARE GREENish...

** I'm a little confused. Lyn Marness said that the more you know about it, the more it knows about you - so why was it able to get to Marion Wheeler? She knew next-to-nothing about it. Literally the only thing she knew was 'an unknown antimemetic SCP exists'.

Or maybe there's a hole in the story and I'm supposed to piece something extra together, but fuck it I'm super-tired. And dumb.

** Keep in mind that you should not encourage yourself to think about or come up with plausible antimemes and that the entire department seems to be either ultimately futile or actively harmful to the human race. Are the researchers doing more harm than good by drawing attention to the things that go bump in the night? Sometimes good fiction has a grain of truth, and sometimes it is just fiction. Either way, you would probably be better served by playing with another mental puzzle, because either it doesn't exist and is a waste of your time and energy, or it does exist and there are sharp sharp teeth waiting to eat you when you least expect it. A lose-lose situation.

*** What kind of attitude is that? Should proto-humans never have left their caves to harness fire , which you can either not find or get your hands burnt on? Should they never seek out wolves, which can either not be found or try to eat you?

Yes, the unknown is scary and lots of people die for unknown reasons, but so far knowledge has invariably been power. None of the opponents in the series so far have demonstrated human-level intelligence (beyond memetics-aided mimicry), so who is to say they can't be beaten, or even tamed (genre notwithstanding)?

Either we live out our lives in fear of unknown monsters which kill uncountably many, until something big enough comes along to destroy everyone, or we try to master the situation no matter how awful it is right now.
