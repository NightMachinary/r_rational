I just saw this on HN. Not sure how well this works, but the concept is interesting:\\

** Not quite sure this works. I put in Prey and Making Money, two random books I enjoyed, and got 90% young children's literature, 5% books I already read (including a David Wong book, which doesn't feel a bubblebreaker for Discworld readers in the slightest) and 5% stuff that just sounded outright atrocious, not out of my tastes.

*** I got a strange mix of religious literature (which challenges my views alright, but not in a productive way), socially left literature (which mostly aligns with my views, go figure), and Hunger Games (....sure).

To be fair, I put /Atlas Shrugged/ on my list since I enjoyed the book in the "it's terribly written but has a heart" way people usually enjoy web novels, and in that category it's my favorite by far. When I took it out, I got "Rationality: From AI to Zombies" as one of the first (anti?)recommendations which is just /wowsers/ level of terrible predictions.

***** We're talking about John Dies at the End here, right? I read that back when it was a web serial on his website before that website got merged into Cracked. I guess he's written several other books since then that I haven't read... and also it's probably been about a decade since the last time I read JDatE. Pretty certain I still have a copy of the book, but it's probably currently in a box in storage.

I won't be reading any of them because I absolutely detest any books set in modern earth but it definitely gives new options.

** I had a hard time getting it to pick books. Eventually, I picked the widest selection of books that I enjoyed which still felt representatives of my tastes.

American Gods - Gaiman (All sorts of Gaiman really)

Men At Arms - Pratchett (I have / read every Discworld book)

Tortilla Flat - Steinbeck (I have / read almost every Steinbeck book, especially the comedies)

1776 - David McCullough (I read a lot of History for my job, sometimes for fun).

2001: A Space Odyssey - (I like old school sci-fi, and this felt like the easiest one to find).

Watchmen - (I read all sorts of comic books; ditto on it being easy to find)

​

In response my top 12 was:

2 volumes of Naruto - No

2 volumes of Bleach - No

2 young children's books - No

Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson - No

Borges - Absolutely not. I loathe him, and I loathe the story they recommended.

Abhorsen by Garth Nix - Maybe

The Powder Mage Trilogy - Maybe, although I really don't want to read another book glorifying the military.

Vorkosigian Saga - This one I've come across, but I'm still leaning towards no for the same reasons above.

​

I've got to say, I'm less than impressed. It seems far too focused on sci-fi / fantasy and children's lit.

***** For me, at least, it's the worldbuilding. It's not super thorough or technical, if that's your thing, but it's so goddamn vivid. I haven't read Abhorsen or the Seventh Tower series in a decade, and I don't remember anything that actually happens in them, but I can still see the locations he describes in my mind.

***** As the other commenter said the worldbuilding is awesome--sort of dark gothic high fantasy, very memorable. The magic system is also totally iconic, I'd say on the order of Sanderson's Allomancy, but with bells instead of metals. Also necromancy rarely gets a fair shake in fantasy, this is the exception.

To be 100% honest with you I haven't read these books since middle school, but I absolutely adored them. Gotta find my copy of Sabriel and start again.

***** To some extent the books which center around Miles do have that lens. The others generally don't; while there are certainly people who are unambiguously villains, their villainy tends to be defined by their vicious and callous disregard for human life rather than by which side they're on.

This is particularly true for Cordelia's Honor (the omnibus in question), and especially true for Falling Free, which is entirely standalone and features a heroic engineer and one of the best "take the thing apart and put it back together in a different configuration" action sequences I've ever read.

#+end_quote

If you're on the fence for this one, I will confirm that it absolutely is glorifying the military (though less than I anticipated when I started the series), but that I really enjoyed it regardless.

Also, if you want a series that is similarly thick with intrigue and politics, but without the focus on the military, may I suggest The Tethered Mage by Melissa Caruso. It has a somewhat unfortunate love triangle subplot that was kind of annoying, but the worldbuilding and plotting is great and the main characters had a lot of moments where I was pleasantly surprised by them avoiding making the obviously stupid decision.

***** This and exactly this. Borges' wrote the Infinite Library, which is an influence on one arc of Worth the Candle and Computer Science in general. I read it and one other thing for class a decade ago and still remember strongly disliking his prose.

****** Did you read it in Spanish? Because if not, you didn't dislike his prose, you disliked the prose of the translation. You've gotta give translated works a bit of leeway. Sometimes a bit-and-a-half.

There's apparently some controversy around the available translation, because the woman he married shortly before his death has the publishing rights tied up for the original translations that Borges himself actually collaborated on with the translator, and she had a new translation commissioned because the original translator was getting 50% of the royalties.

Borges' influence is quite a bit wider than one arc of Worth the Candle. You were in your late teens / early 20s a decade ago if you were in college at the time. I think you're doing yourself a disservice if you allow your opinions to be swayed by the opinions of a teenager / young adult, even if that teenager / young adult happens to be your past self.

It's just right here, you could pick it up any time:
