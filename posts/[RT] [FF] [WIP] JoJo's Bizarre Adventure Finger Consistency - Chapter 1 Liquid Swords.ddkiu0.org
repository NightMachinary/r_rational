** You've quite perfectly recreated the aesthetic of anime subtitles in your dialogue. Personally, I find this incredibly distracting (though of course, YMMV).

When I see things like Japanese honorifics and weird sentence structures in subs, I take it as a flawed but necessary compromise where naturalism is traded for faithfulness to the original dialogue, and being able to sync it to the animation on screen. Here, though, there's no original translation confining you, yet you've chosen to do it anyway. If you don't mind me asking, why?

*** Because it makes the story campier.

It's worth pointing out that the honorifics and translation marks won't be present in the majority of the story the way they were in this chapter, as the main character speaks English. (I wouldn't bother with them if I had to do them all the time.)

*** 90% of the enjoyment in JoJo is aethestics. It has a unique and powerful aesthetic that, while it does play on traditional tropes and motifs, dials many specific aspects of them up to 11. That's what a lot of people love about JoJo. Taking that away and changing the tone and dialog to be more natural would make it... Not JoJo. The world of JoJo is certainly interesting, but the aesthetic is the real draw.

** Hmm. Reactions, as someone who knows only the bare minimum about the JoJo universe:

"It was clear that the woman wasn't all there, and it was important that he": this gives a simultaneous impression that she did something to his mind (to stop him from contacting someone?) and that the author accidentally left out the end of the sentence. If the first, writing in momentary disorientation from not being able to remember what he'd been thinking about is clearer, I feel.

He can make objects move without touching them (apparent real telekinesis), and he tried showing people, but he couldn't get even his friends to to 'listen to him'--I notice I am confused.

That 'Mysterious illness' right after he displayed his power--sounds almost definitely manmade, first make him desperate and then offer him a lifeline. Either that or a consequence of what he does, but then it wouldn't seem to make sense unless it was his fans getting ill from what he took from them. Either way, the timing is incredibly suspect.

<pauses to look up Sadao Kujo information--sees a Jotaro Kujo picture> --Oh my, he looks like a Kongou Banchou character. <reads...> --Ahh, so it was common causation, rather than one causing the other--but rather, this indicates that both Sadao and Holy are decendents of Jonathan, but Joseph doesn't know this (and so hasn't guessed that Sadao got a Stand at the same time as his other family members)? Hm..? <keeps reading the main story>

("The ‘disease' that has been following your family for so long"--'so long', so longer than months. Rather than just affecting his nuclear family by its presence in the last few months, it's been following 'his/their (shared bloodline) family' on the order of generations. She knows about why his wife is sick, and she's not telling him. She knows why he and his wife both got Stands at the same time, and she's not telling him.)

I'm left curious about what the liquid in the vial is (and whether readers familiar with the Jojo universe recognise it).

Edit: Huh. One of the few things I've known about the Jojo universe is the awesomeness of [[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/za-warudo-wryyyyy][The World]]. I had no idea until now that the user was an antagonist rather than one of the protagonists.

No, I just screwed up here. Fixed it, thank you!

Some fanfiction stories are much friendlier than others in respect to how welcoming and understandable they are to people unfamiliar with the source material; this story, and especially this first chapter, assumes the reader knows most of the major beats from certain points in the show/manga. Much of what you've pointed out could be explained by someone who has read up to the end of Stardust Crusaders.

****** AFAIK only Stand that can utilize sperm is from Part V and I don't see how Charlotte and him would be connected so it's probably for other reasons.

I don't think she really works for Dio. If she was, why wouldn't she straight up get rid of Sadao who is supporting Holly? unless she has her own agenda. When she mentioned organization, I thought of SPW Foundation. Which would kinda makes sense since she's there for information and I bet SPW Foundation would try to learn as much as they can about Stands.

******* Oh, I completely forgot about the Speedwagon Foundation, definitely possible. It also would be more Dio's style to just kill Sadao, that's true. Charlotte just gave off very ominous vibes, and she was pretty secretive compared to how the SPWF is in canon (to the Joestars).

****** Honestly my guess was more like that she was part of some kind of secret Men-in-Black-ish society that's concerned with the control of Stands and extermination of malicious Stand Users... so in this case her thought is going to the death of /Dio/, not of the Crusaders. When she says that the "disease" will be destroyed when "bathed in the light of the stars", she's saying that Dio will be defeated by Jotaro.

*** An ideal reader for this would be caught up to the current point in the manga, but I'm writing it so that anyone completely unfamiliar with JoJo could theoretically read it (with the hopes that no one is that category actually does). Hence my explanation of basic stand mechanics.

Just like any actual JoJo part, you don't "need" to have read any of the rest of it to understand most of the story, but you will be missing a lot of the backstory and broader context. This first chapter is much more referential than I expect the vast majority of the story to be, for example.

** I've been wanting to read Jojo ratfic for quite some time and I really like what you did with Sadao Kujo. Hope you keep it up!

Also, you might want to specify which parts the story might spoil or require essential knowledge of. I know you put general disclaimer, but people who only read up to Part 3 might get discouraged if the story does not go beyond making references to future parts. While enjoyable to those who know, they usually don't affect the plot. (Rereading my comment it feels kinda harsh, was not my intention. I just don't know how to soften it lol).

Another STAND, like it was for Jotaro's mom? I wonder if "the light of the stars" here is literal (JOJO IN SPACE YAY - after all the Arrow supposedly is of alien origin) or refers to the Joestar family. Either can work, I guess.

EDIT: ok, so I didn't remember Sadao was Jotaro's dad, this makes a lot more sense now.
