I was watching John Carpenter's /The Thing/ and the prequel again last night and started thinking about how the Thing does a pretty good job of explaining why the universe is so silent. If we had been around, say, a hundred thousand years ago, intelligent life would have been all over. And then somebody made the first Thing (or found it), and galactic civilization crashed in short order.

Accepting the events of the films as canon (and ruling that Childs and MacReady are both human), it shouldn't be too long for one of them (or Kate, if she survived the prequel) to realize that this probably wasn't the only specimen in existence and that this might not bode well for future forays into the stars. Hopefully someone will start thinking about a list of best practices in such a universe.

Let's assume that Things (1) need an impetus to travel and don't look for life-bearing worlds or other population centers without knowing that they're already there and (2) use technology only as a means to spread to known populations (so you won't have Thing-astronomers sending out probes to other stars or anything like that).

What sort of practices arise in a future where expansion means potentially running into more Things? Do we forego colonization of life-bearing worlds (even ones that don't seem infected) and just build space stations?


** On-topic with the thread: there would probably be chemical indicators that something was contaminated with the Thing (kind of inevitable, there's no such thing as perfect imitation biochemically), which would be absorbed into security protocols everywhere. Maybe a detection spray made of nanites would be developed, where they release a luminescent compound on contact, and we can detect the threat level of planets by releasing it into the atmosphere. It could even be a standard part of ventilation systems, particularly aboard spacecraft, it would just need to be safe to breathe.

Unknown species of Things would also be a risk, since they might lack presently known indicators. So even despite the presence of nanodetectors, it would be a standard security protocol. "My partner has been consumed by a mimetic alien life form" would be on page 50 of security manuals.

Depending on your headcanon, it might be followed by "I think that I may have been consumed by a mimetic alien life form whose personality is currently dormant inside me".

I didn't think about unknown species, but that would make sense. Given how flexible they are, presumably they would be differentiated according to chemical indicators.

I've got tears in my eyes. The struggle of the alien to hold to immortality and its diminished soul. The empathy with all those isolated tumors of static flesh. So much suffering. Is it weird that I somehow rooted for the Thing until the very end and beyond?

** Well, we have already been sending out radio signals for some decades, and I don't know if high atmosphere testing of hydrogen bombs sends out some kind of easily identifiable signal, but chances are continuing to use communications technologies as normal here at home is not going to significantly increase the chance of being found. Similarly, anything that would find us on the moons of Jupiter is going to find us on Earth, so the Sol system we might as well colonize/strip mine. Care should of course be taken to not allow anything from outside any colony/ship/station/country to mingle with any kind of animal without being tested. We don't know if Things can take on insect forms and then just land on you and take you that way, so you know what? Mandatory testing for everyone all the time. Realistically, you'll have to prioritize, but we should still definitely implant everyone on Earth with a small machine that tests their blood automatically every now and then, and which has a unique identifier for every person. Failure to have the machine in you is grounds for immediate quarantine.

I'm also in favour of giving everyone a comprehensive medical check up every year at tax payers' expense just to check that nothing weird or subtle and new is going on, but I'd hold that position even without aliens to worry about.

We know that Things purge themselves of piercings and such, so an easy first step is to make everyone have a piercing made out of whatever non-biological material they are not allergic against. Still, I'm going to insist on the tiny machines for everyone in risky places, like off earth, customs, politicians, military, medical personal including cleaners, etc, just in case they can consciously suppress the piercing-removal. Access to sensitive locations, like airports, should /always/ include a quick blood test.

Carefully, though. Who knows if there are Things elsewhere in the solar system? (Oh no... now I'm all sad about the idea of finding out that there was life on Europa, only to discover that it was all Thingified).

Ooh. I didn't think about that possibility. Maybe the Things in the prequel didn't get around to thinking about keeping piercings and such.

The piercing/filling removal didn't make much sense to me. It couldn't imitate it, sure, which would be all the more reason to keep it in the body, because it can't replace it, either. :/

** "Yes". Colonizing living planets is vandalism in any universe. If you can build starships, you don't need planets for anything, and the bio-chemistry of any living planet is with very high likelyhood incompatible with ours in any case, so you would have to kill off the native life to live on them. Converting random dead floating rocks into installations fit for whatever your plans are is much less problematic, and in this case, also safer.

** Speaking of The Thing, which I recently rewatched and fell in love with all over again, I'm looking at an inspired monster to maybe make a small mystery/horror game out of, and I'm doing a lot of research to make the creatures and the setting plausible. :D Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on the desired tone of gameplay, I can't really work out how gruesome transformations like in the movie are physically possible. It's kind of strange. So instead, my monster is a worm that grows from eggs laid inside you and evolved along with mammals to control mammalian brains. And they hijack their host's intelligence, so this gives you all the impostor paranoia and mystery from the movie, which is the part I liked most, frankly. So it's not quite The Thing, but a cross between The Thing (especially the setting and tone of an Antarctic station) and Yeerks from Animorphs.

Their on the 'plausible' scale less as bio-mimicry shapeshifters that impersonate you and more on the whole they just are never dead and can regrow from a cell... But done with plausible things, like information is not very well retained if you disrupt the brain and so on.

***** you seemed uncertain on biological plausibility of things. But to put it another way, there is a lot to be said of complex parasites that don't follow the traditional view of 'wormy' parasites. My favorite of which is sacculina. and considering it's probably possible that things also deal with plants you should not feel limited to just the animal kingdom. Parasitic fungi are pretty impressive.

****** Except for the purposes of body-snatching, I need an organism that plausibly has the same neural basis as humans, and can hide inside a human body. My limitations are well-reasoned. :/ And my issue was with the /physical/ possibility of The Thing's rapid shapeshifting, replete as it was with bony deposits and chitinous limbs, despite the relatively limited material composition of the human body. Not to mention the massive strength required for a two-meter tentacle to anchor itself to the floor and articulate so quickly and with such force. One would think the infected hosts were consuming the tin along with their tinned food.

******* righto, ya without essentially stating it's wet nano your not going to get that much shape shifting and the metabolic capacity is going to be tricky.

You could get a lot mileage out of the whole "pain/natural protective inhibitions" thing not being as much of a factor ala from the puppet masters.

But that won't do much of the betantacled or toothsome shape shifting stuff.
