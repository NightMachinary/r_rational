  It's been said that the difference between headology and psychiatry is that while a psychiatrist will try to convince you there's no monster chasing you, a headologist will hand you a bat and a chair to stand up to it.

guys everyone listen i had an idea

it's a rephrasing of old ideas in maximally nerdish language

which is almost the same thing as novelty

So the basic concept of munchkinry is taking seriously ideas that obviously exist to not-be-taken seriously. Superman can fly and punch things real hard. Munchkinerery is thinking about that and realizing it would make a lot more sense for Superman to [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13][turn a crank.]]

Headology, meanwhile, is the idea that "[[https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Headology][what people believe is what is real]]." In the Discworld books, headology is explained in the context of a therapy session in which the patient's fears are taken as basically true, and the witches provide the logical solution.

Munchkinry is headology applied to stuff that /you/ believe---it's the idea that what /you/ believe is what is real. If you /actually think/ that Superman can violate the laws of physics, have him /violate the laws of physics/ and enjoy your perpetual motion machine. If you can /actually think/ you can Obliviate and Polyjuice and Imperio to your heart's content, then /do that/ and enjoy your Ministry of Magic. If you /actually think/ that combining a few seemingly random low-level spells in DnD will let you destroy the gods, then /go full Pun-Pun/ and enjoy your plane.

Taken into the realm of /actually real stuff/, self-headology says if you /actually think/ you know better than the stock market, /bet against the stock market/ and enjoy your millions. If you /actually think/ something is the right/wrong thing to do, then /actually do or don't do it respectively/ and enjoy your heavenly reward. On that note, if you /actually think/ God is a nice person, then /expect him to live up to the most basic standards of decent behavior/ and enjoy your lightning bolt to the face.

Munchkinery is /taking your beliefs seriously/. Or at least, it's the first step on the road. It's headology applied to /true beliefs about fictional things/. It's a realm where you can take ideas seriously without having to pay any costs, except getting disinvited to the next DnD meetup.

  “I'm clever enough to know how you manage not to think of a pink rhinoceros if someone says ‘pink rhinoceros,'” she managed to say aloud.

  “Ah, that's deep magic, that is,” said Granny Weatherwax.

  “No. It's not. You don't know what a rhinoceros looks like, do you?”

  Sunlight filled the clearing as the old witch laughed, as clear as a downland stream.

  “That's right!” she said.

uhhh post your favorite examples of self-headology in the comments

because this is definitely a discussion thread and not me just treating reddit as my personal diary


** Headology seems to be a requirement of munchkinry, but fundamentally a different concept. For instance, in the first example you gave: if psychiatry is convincing someone a monster isn't following them, and headology is believing that there is one and giving them the tools to combat that monster, then munchkinry is believing there is one then saying, "Does this monster ever tire? What if we tie them to a millstone and derive production from their work?"

Or, to put it another way, headology is "what you believe is true", while munchkinry is using that knowledge for maximum gain.

*** A munchkin who's lived long enough to see why other munchkins /didn't/ might follow up by asking, "Do monsters like it when you tie them to an electromagnet?"

** I'm not sure if you're definition of munchkinery is accurate. Taking poorly thought out ideas/rules seriously is definitely an important step for munchkining, but I don't think that's the core of what it is. I would say that munchkining is getting maximum value out of something regardless of whatever intent there might be. Munchkining definitely requires taking ideas seriously, but I don't think you need to believe something is real to be serious about it, I would say that being serious just involves putting maximum effort into something.

Or do as CS Lewis did with Narnia and expect free-willed finite beings to always find a way to screw up the nice things God gave us, eventually resulting in the willing sacrifice of the Logos' incarnation for that universe, whether Jesus the human or Aslan The Lion.

Rational fiction is not by default atheist fiction. It's /taking what is/ and exploring the consequences. If “what is” includes “I Am,” explore it, like Heinlein in /Job/.

** This is basically "fake it til you make it." If you know what humans /really like to see/ in other humans, do those things and enjoy all your social capital.

(Obviously [[https://medium.com/@dayvough/rule-1-be-attractive-rule-2-dont-be-unattractive-d7c934e62a3c][Rules 1 and 2]] apply in this scenario, though there are ways to partially munchkin those too.)

** proper munchkinry requires outside the box thinking. you have to be able to look at a complex set of rules, and pay very close attention to the boundary conditions. but it also requires thinking ahead more than just one step. If you play a game, and use an obscure rule... well the GM just saw what you did, and now every NPC in the world has read that same obscure rule. did you plan what to do when someone uses the idea against you?

most games have flaws we can find and exploit, because the rules are finite, yet large enough for unintended complexity. the real world isnt like that, because a real-world exploit is better called a 'Trade Secret'. it is something worth money, and anyone who knows how is already using it. social hacks? those are in use by politicians and scammers. physics hacks? heck, NASA put men on the moon decades ago. and in many cases, there are laws that prevent the use of some exploits- they know you can, and dont want you to.

why wont superman turn a crank? because if your being serious, then sharing kryptonian technology would have a much larger impact on the world. superman as scientist has a lot of potential that focuses on his brain instead of his body. it could work... but it wouldnt be superman anymore. it would be something new.

most of the really interesting munchkinry happens on the world-building and setting level. this is where the author does an ass-pull to explain why all this really cool stuff is secret, or why it wont really change the world. or where the author changes the world and really runs with it, a new setting to play in. DC and Marvel are the former, Worm is the latter.

a story is only as complex as its author makes it. and many of us love to deconstruct the ideas behind the stories we read. but many authors fail to start with an idea of the setting as a whole, and only show us new things piece by piece. and this creates a flawed patchwork that would need a serious re-write to be properly rational. munchkinry lives in the stitches of that patchwork, thrives in it. because the stitches that loosly hold the setting together were never meant to be deconstructed, and they give us the most fantastic ways to twist the setting to our whims.

** I don't really see this logic. Real life tends to already be almost maximally “munchkined”. Technology /is/ munchkinry.

“Ok, DM... I exploit the rules of quantum mechanics for periodic systems and defects in a semiconductor to build a machine that allows me to compute things much faster than my own brain, gaining a +5 to INT. Can I do that?”\\
“...yes. But we're not friends anymore.”

Munchkinry simply applies to fictional worlds because they tend to be designed around a narrative or thematic need rather than being genuine, living worlds, and thus people in them stick to that. Munchkinry is a humorous way to lampshade that, showing the things that could be done - and that thus someone invariably /would/ do - if that world really existed as described.
