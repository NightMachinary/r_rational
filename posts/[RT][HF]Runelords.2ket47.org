In the /Runelords/ series ([[https://www.goodreads.com/series/41322-the-runelords][Goodreads]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRunelords][TV Tropes]]), the main form of magic is "endowments": With the aid of branding irons made of a special metal found in ancient battlegrounds ("forcibles") and accompanying rituals, a /willing/ person ("dedicate") can grant to another person (an "endowed") his store of a particular attribute (an "endowment"). An endowment breaks only on the death of the endowed or of the dedicate: When the endowed dies, the dedicate gets the endowed attribute back; when the dedicate dies, the endowed loses the attribute. A person can give only one endowment in his life, but may receive many. A person with many endowments is called a "Runelord"--his subjects give him a certain number of willing dedicates per year, and in return he protects them (and the dedicates, who may require constant care, depending on which attributes they gave) with his superhuman powers. Not all endowments are given to Runelords, though--a pretty peasant girl might sell her beauty to an noblewoman for some gold, for example. Different endowments require differently-runed forcibles--you can't transfer an attribute if you don't know the relevant rune, which may not even exist. Endowments are all or nothing--a dedicate of Voice becomes mute, a dedicate of Grace becomes as stiff as a board (but still conscious!), a dedicate of Mind falls into a coma, etc. Endowments are occasionally given to or taken from animals--it's rumored that, in olden days, people used to take endowments from wolves (and took on some characteristics from those wolves...), and in the time of the book enhanced "force-horses" are used, though they're nigh-impossible to control for anyone but a Runelord.

It's been quite a few years since I read the original quadrilogy (there may be some mistakes in the above summary)--and I don't think I've read more than a few pages of the rest of the series, which switches focus from endowments to deities, IIRC--but I think the first four books at least might qualify for being rational. All sorts of interesting things are done with endowments; for example:

- It's specifically noted that endowments of Strength are useless without corresponding endowments of Endurance, since someone with super-strong muscles will only break all his bones if he tries to do anything with his super-strength.
- The villain of the first two books--Raj Ahten of Indhopal, nicknamed "The Sum of All Men"--has about a zillion endowments; but a person receiving an endowment must be physically in the presence of the new dedicate, since the branding-iron ritual is essential to the transmittal of the endowment. But he still wants to receive new endowments from his adoring populace while he's out conquering. So, [[#s][spoiler]]
- When a Runelord with endowments of Mind is killed, [[#s][spoiler]]
- Endowments of Metabolism typically aren't used except in the direst of circumstances--the candle that burns twice as hot burns twice as fast. However, [[#s][spoiler]]
- Raj Ahten--he of the zillion endowments--accidentally discovers that he can combine his prodigious Voice, Strength, and Endurance to [[#s][spoiler]] Likewise, the favorite of his many wives has such a ridiculous number of Voice and Glamour endowments that [[#s][spoiler]]

There's some philosophical waffling about how allowable it is to kill helpless, blameless dedicates in order to bring down the Runelords they're enhancing. Other forms of magic exist as well--there are "flameweavers", who can manipulate fire.

I don't know whether anyone else here has read this series--I didn't see it when I searched the subreddit...


** Set up a market for Endowments. I would consider trading my endowment of Glamour for an extra of Voice, and there are likely to be more people who would make the opposite trade. Depending on what happens to a dedicate of Metabolism, it could conceivably be a step /up/. If so, sell it to the military for money. If there's a war on, you /know/ they're buying.

Also, if A gives an endowment to B and B gives it to C, it disappears when B dies. What if A dies? If not, there's a way to have more total endowments than population simply by passing them off (through an intermediary) while on your deathbed. Combines nicely with the above because intermediaries who don't mind giving up their own endowments are easier to come by if there's a market.

I never understood why anyone would give up their endowment of Mind, but you can get it from condemned criminals if you don't mind being unethical. Have a truly terrible prison system, and when they'd rather be mindless, you can grant their wish.

I think a Raj Ahten scenario might be inevitable, just because /someone's/ going to stockpile Voice and use it to convince people to give them more endowments.

*** A person can give only /one/ endowment in his entire life, so I'm not sure a market would be very active.

IIRC, a dedicate of Metabolism falls into a coma, just like a dedicate of Mind--though his upkeep is much less expensive, since he hardly needs any nourishment! Almost /no one/ is willing to cut his remaining lifespan in half by taking even one endowment of Metabolism, regardless of how useful it is (it basically makes you into the Flash, but without any "Speed Force" or whatever protecting you), much less several--endowments of Strength, Grace, and Endurance are far more common among Runelords' royal guardsmen. I can see how an unemployed peasant might want to give an endowment of Metabolism to lessen the strain on his poor family, though.

An endowment disappears when its original dedicate dies, regardless of how the connections are finagled--you can't re-assign the dedication to an intermediary. In your scenario, if A dies, B notices nothing (he's nothing but a conduit), but C loses the endowment that A had been granting to him.

**** Wow, that is the /worst/-case scenario for a Metabolism dedicate. Yeah, uh, never mind. On second thought, it's almost half as good as a weaker form of cryonics. Pitch it as jumping a couple decades into the future, and you might get nonzero volunteers even if it does cost around a quarter of your lifespan.

Can you, say, give a Metabolism endowment to a special forces person, or a vampire slayer during apocalypse season, and then have them give it /back/ if they survive? You could only do it once per pair of people of course.

Those other three I could imagine just being sold. Again depending on how debilitating it is to give them up. You don't need a lot of people trading, though it'd be nice; just enough that you can usually find a seller/buyer eventually. Though it might be a good idea to restrict it to trades instead of sales, to try to decrease the social inequality.

***** Endowments are broken only on the death of the dedicate or of the endowed--there is no other way to break them, IIRC. The third spoiler-tag above has a workaround for that, though--[[#s][spoiler]]

What happens to the dedicate for all the endowments I can remember:

- Strength: Becomes too feeble to move
- Grace: Becomes paralyzed (as stiff as a board)
- Stamina: Becomes extremely sickly? (My memory is fuzzy.)
- Mind: Falls into a coma (gains some memories of the endowed on the latter's death)
- Voice: Becomes mute
- Glamour: Becomes hideously ugly
- Metabolism: Falls into a super-low-energy "stasis" mode

Runes for more narrow endowments--e.g., skill at dancing, rather than just plain Grace--were rumored to be known in other lands, but never shown in-story. (I may be forgetting one or two endowments--remember, I haven't read this in years...)

****** OK, so everybody should be involved in a circle with someone. Preferably someone on the other side of the world, so their time zones line up as perfectly as can be arranged. I would /totally/ take losing my mind while I sleep if I get double intelligence eight hours a day while the other guy does. Like, that's not even hard.

The same goes for the other endowments, of course.

*** The all-or-nothing nature of endowments puts a huge wrench in that. You're talking about being utterly hideous in exchange for having a lovely voice, hoping to find another who is willing to be beautiful but mute.

Anyone who discovered a way to give partial endowments, they would create a huge market for them instantly. An exceedingly attractive but poor human might hesitate to become hideous in exchange for money, but becoming only moderately attractive for a reasonable sum is much easier to tolerate. Similarly, if I could donate a quarter of my strength to someone else for a decent price, I'd strongly consider it.

** Sounds like an interesting system to build a story around. I've ordered the first book off Amazon to check it out - I'll report back when I've read it.

Edit: I've read the first book, which was quite good. /The Runelords/ falls into a category of speculative fiction that I'll call "One Big Idea", in that it's mostly centered around this singular magic system and all of the other details flow naturally from that. While the book doesn't restrict itself to only a single type of magic, that first, big grounded one sets the stage for everything else, and the natural conclusions of such a system set the stage for human dramas to play themselves out. The magic gets incorporated into the lives of the characters, as well as their society, in a way that I think fantasy often misses out on. And the primary antagonist of the book is set up very nicely.

*** The first book is just about one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read (and I'm kind of ashamed to say, I've read most of them from 70s-90s) Later books were less... merciless, which somehow subtracted. Still well above most of the stuff that comes out in the fantasy genre though.

** That /does/ sound interesting. Although I'm not really sure why the Dedicates don't immediately die, chalk it up to magic?

So, uh ... how do the Mind endowments work? Those seem like the most obvious source of brokenness unless they're handled carefully.

Can you gain enough social-fu through this to essentially mind-control people? Actually, can you blackmail people into becoming Dedicates? Because that whole "Dedicates must be willing" thing seems like a major bottleneck that would be important to expand if at all possible.

Can you gain these "flameweaver" powers by having a Flameweaver Dedicate somewhere? Because if so, that makes Runelords officially the best magic.

*** (Bear in mind that it's been quite a few years since I read the books, so my memory is a little fuzzy...)

The more helpless dedicates (Mind, Strength, Grace, Metabolism, Stamina) are cared for by other people, typically. There are whole complexes dedicated to the care of Runelords' dedicates and the housing of their caretakers.

A dedicate of Mind goes into a coma, while the endowed person gains the use of the dedicate's brainpower. If the endowed person dies, the dedicate wakes from his coma, retaining fragments of the endowed's memory; I'm not sure what happens if the dedicate dies. [[#s][spoiler]]

My memory is /extremely/ fuzzy on this point, but I think there /may/ have been something about how endowments of Voice and Glamour would be ineffective during the actual ritual of endowment-transfer. Blackmail and threats of torture work fine, though, IIRC.

Flameweaving is a different sort of magic, derived from a binding oath of service to a deity of fire. I don't remember the specifics, but I don't think the two types of magic mesh well. In any event, there are only a few kinds of endowment runes available (though others are rumored to be known in other lands), and a flameweaving rune is not among them.
