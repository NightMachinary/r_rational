** I guess this means Gohan will probably be the winner of the fight, since Goku will probably land first.

As for Red, well there really wasn't much chance of his story ending any other way. If he wasn't murdered by a pissed off underling now, it would have happened eventually.

***** I didn't write this yet, might include it later, but my personal canon is that he inherited the position. The Red Ribbon is a private organisation, and Red's father was actually competent, but then he died and the thing changed hands and simply kept running smoothly thanks to competent aides like Black.

In the original, Red gets killed by Black once Goku causes a big enough crisis. I don't think normally someone would risk doing something like that without a very big reason. Remember, the Red Ribbon isn't outright /illegal/ in my version, though they may occasionally do illegal things under the table. But it must be noticed that here the Instruments have been brewing discontent for quite a while, and the Ribbon's decline only made it worse for them, and pushed people to their cause. I'll probably address this in a few chapters from now, as the Red Ribbon will be a very important part of the next arc.

Also, about morons getting in positions of power... /gestures in the vague direction of the current real life Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful army/

****** But that guy was elected. And he is apparently pretty good both at appeasing rich people and oligarchs and at fanning passion in a certain type of people.

But if Red Ribbon is a legal corporation with a single majority shareholder who voted himself in as CEO and "Commander Red" then I guess that works. Though now I am curious how his father managed to build all that without investors.

******* I mean, even with a board, the key issue is how much does the position /matter/ in practice, especially when the rest of the staff manages to cover for Red's incompetence. Anyway, I'll try to see if I can put some more backstory for the RR in there at some point. It's something interesting to think about.

******** If the staff actually obeys orders and Commander Red isn't aware of his own superfluity then his idiocy is likely to wreak havoc each time he becomes aware of a major decision.

Seeing how this is a PMC, that means that in any major battle against an actual challenge he may feel like doing his title justice, costing the PMC men and equipment it wouldn't have lost otherwise.

If the command staff is able to completely obfuscate him then I guess we are back at Red Ribbon having a shadow council doing the actual leading, making Red a figurehead that only needs to be appeased because he owns everything and him dying or going to the courts would completely remove the fig leaf of legality, transforming the PMC into a terrorist organization if it doesn't dissolve.

Which, given how he is dead now, I hope one of the following is true:

- Someone forged a credible will.
- Someone managed to cajole Red into making an actual will.
- Someone controls Red's legal heir in an equivalent fashion as Red was controlled.

When I say hope I mean after putting myself in the shoes of a Red Ribbon member of course. As a reader I am cool with anything that both makes sense and makes for a good story.

Mmmh, arguable, IMHO. There are different conventions as to what to do with dialogue in this situation, and some I've read about use commas this way. I'll leave it for now, but if someone else wants to chime in, feel free, I might be wrong.

Anyway, thanks! I fixed them all, in this chapter I was a bit sloppy I suppose.

** Another great chapter. Gohan throwing Goku to the other island is hilarious, but also totally possible in dragonball which makes it great. Red's assasination couldn't happen to a worse man; My money is on black making a play for control against piccolo's forces, with a mini plot there of “who gets control of the world spanning terrorist/mercanary organization.”

** Seen how you are treating oozaru as something to control, I wonder what you will do with the ssj4 and controlled oozaru thing from canon broly. Both are the result of stopping the transformation midways, keeping the increase in strength and maximum alocated ki, but without losing control, speed, and been able to combine it with other transformations

*** I can already tell you that SSJ4 is /not/ a thing in this universe, all of DBGT is not canon, so just don't hold your breath for it. As for the Broly thing... I haven't thought much about it, I outlined a lot of this story before the movie came out. My main reference point was the fact that we see Vegeta controlling his Oozaru in his fight with Goku, and the glimpses we get of the same thing in the Bardock: Father of Goku special.

I'll also add that while I liked the new Broly movie a lot, included the opening scenes, I still don't like much the "Dragon Ball Minus" take on Bardock, where he's kinda good and saves Kakarot on purpose. I liked the tragic antihero Father of Goku version much better, and in fact I'm doing a slight rewrite of it as background for this story. There are differences, but you may consider that the final version will basically be more or less the same as the old TV special, which I consider the finest piece of writing to come out of this franchise altogether. I really really /really/ like it. So, basically, I'm not inclined to making the Broly movie canon, if only for that reason.

**** I'm with you about bardok, I'm glad you are taking the old interpretation. It actually already surfaces in how you treat goku's character, as the only reason he is not evil is that he hit his head.

Still, I think the Broly movie does great things, and it would be a shame to abandon it and the good things it introduces. But considering we are talking about super stuff, I wonder if it would ever become relevant in your story

One last thing. While I consider the ssj form worth dropping as it is (well, GT as a whole) the concept of controlling the oozaru transformation, and combining it with other powers, still has potential that I hope toriyama uses one day. But your story your rules, of course

***** The Broly movie is really great, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it a lot and I liked a lot what it does with Cold and Frieza. I will probably borrow something there, but more in terms of mood/inspiration than actual events.

As for the rest... I won't comment for now. I'm sure we'll have a chance to discuss it again down the line :D.

I take ki to be programmable to an extent, but not that much. Mostly because otherwise it'd feel like the Nen from HunterXHunter, and I don't want to end up literally copying that.

Without going into specifics, this is a universe in which there are /Gods/ that look like that. Gods who (in the Kaioshin's case) are specifically tasked with directing creation. So the universe itself reflects some sort of underlying will.

On the other question that answer is great, no follow ups. Still I like variety.
