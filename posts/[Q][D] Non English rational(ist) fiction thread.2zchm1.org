[[/r/rational]] is full of good reading advices, but very biased toward original English literature. So now that I have tasted this kind of writing, and am unwillingly yet to go back to more mundane fiction, I find myself reading much more English than any other language that I'm fluent in, especially more than my native language (French). Translations of the works recommended here are sometimes available (at least in French), but I have a preference for reading in the original language, if possible. Also, the point of this post is finding and listing rational(ist) works originally written in other languages, not translations.

So, any input on non English pieces of writing worth of [[/r/rational]]?

*** I liked /The Last Ringbearer/ (I've read the original), but I should give a warning that it has a problem somewhat similar to HPMOR: it starts off with an awesome premise "what if Mordor was actually a progressive industrialized state struggling against backwards magical reactionaries", but then kinda degrades into a spy novel with a lot less epic scope.

** On the French side, Jules Verne is arguably eligible. I wouldn't describe his stories nor his characters as particularly rational, but his ability to accurately extrapolate real technological advances in his novels is a clear demonstration of rational thinking.
