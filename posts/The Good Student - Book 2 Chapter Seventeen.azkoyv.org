This is really cute. You can feel her frustration at being out of the loop radiating off the page.

Like the readers.

** I am lost. What does everyone want?! Why suddenly everything is built up like a quest to take? They all lie. They always lie. So this must be something that they want. So what do they want? And how can we be sure that is it that they want?

*** - Nick wants to see this new creature, but also not to fall into an obvious demon trap. He also wants to control his own destiny and be important (but those are at odds). And of course he wants Dizzy.
- The crazy demon wants to stay the same instead of changing, which is what will happen if the demons win.\\
- Winnum Roke wants to spite the demons (and maybe save humanity). She's already closed the door, but perhaps isn't strong enough alone or is worried there's an alternate power the demons might use.\\
- The High-Father wants Nick to activate this new creature, since it is a new power and may be the solution to opening the door.
- Dizzy wants the D.

**** Don't pretend to actually explain what everyone wants then finish with an unfunny joke. Dizzy wants to be the very best hero candidate that no one ever was, so that she can be the Savior of Ranvar. Or, failing that, she wants to at the very least have been a better hero candidate than Nic. But her desire to be the hero means she isn't really right for this job; so, despite her initial intention to belittle Nic and wash her hands of him, she finds she doesn't have any better way to become a hero than through Nic.

She attempts to capitalize on his relatively higher status by stalking/trying to protect him. BUT her ravenous desire for the D, and consequent frustration with herself and with Nic, means she can't help but act like a total retard around him. Which makes her want to spend as little time as possible in his presence, because spending time with him means feeling the unheroic feelings of a normal, awkward teenager. Even though what she /really/ wants is to spend all her time with him, because teenagers.

But the point is that if she didn't want to be a great hero more than she wants the D she would already have served herself, so any explanation of her character is incomplete without taking that into account.

***** Real talk, I'm 100% serious when I say that her wanting Tutt is by far the primary motivation of her character now. She's driven and capable, but she has no actual direction in life. In HPMoR, there's a line where Quirrel says to Tracy Davis, "You are ambitious, but you have no ambition," about her being capable of achieving anything, but not having any /particular/ great thing she wants to achieve. That's Dizzy.

She doesn't want to be a hero. She didn't even know that was an option, until Nick turned out to look like one ^{if} ^{you} ^{squint.} Hell, there arguably are no heroes in this story; certainly not Nick who's just a pawn. She (thinks she) sees what Nick has and she wants it for herself, but that's just like Tracey Davis adding on bullet points to her "ambitions list." She /is/ heroic, and thus implicitly believes that if the 'hero' role exists it should belong to her, but that's what I'd call a driving motivation.

The only thing she's certain on is that she wants to be by Nick's side. This is probably the truest thing we've seen in the fic from her -

****** Well said. And that's what makes her an interesting parallel to Nic; conceptually, Nic is floundering with only his feelings for a girl to hold onto, but in practice the thirst for understanding he acquired along the path of pursuing the girl gave him the inner spark he needs to tell his own story.

While despite her attempted brusque definiteness, just below the surface Dizzy is truly the one floundering because she has no idea how to become what she desires. You can tell from the story she tells the librarian about being a warrior who slays the evil monster. She doesn't get that protagonists aren't a real thing that you can become, but a framing for telling a story about a series of events. So at 16 years old, she's been quietly exceeding expectations while waiting to grow up and become a real contender for the title of Demon Slayer. As if school was ever designed to facilitate that kind of story for people. smh

But then Nic showed up and bam, he started cooking up adventures right away by following his gut and breaking rules, and somehow getting away with it. Not to mention drawing the favor of her own father, the archmage, and the country's secret service.

So it's more that I feel a quibble about which part of Tutt she wants most. I think if she got to make a choice between a relationship with the person who is Nic on the one hand, and magically taking over his mind and/or body in a desperate bid to take his mysterious protagonist sauce for herself on the other, all her social programming and self image up to this point would compel her to justify the latter. Even if she had romantic feelings contradicting it, her self image is to deny herself in what she feels is duty to her family and her country. But actually now that I think of it, her opinion of Nic's competence does seem to have gone from unreasonably low to unreasonably high...

I wonder if Nic is the only answer she has when considering how to constructively go beyond what she previously saw as her duty because Nic was the most important thing her duties meant she couldn't have. She built a dichotomy in her head that she has trouble seeing outside of. That's why she keeps imagining that Nic has complex plans and hidden abilities underlying his success and justifying her pursuit of him; she doesn't know how else to frame the story.

  My money is that it's not the librarian, but a different demon. Maybe even the demon that possessed Nic before (who became a dragon and got eaten etc.).
#+end_quote

Also, I've found prior chapters to be confusing but this one seems straightforward finally. The crazy demon is finally revealing what she wants (to /not/ change, unlike all other demons) and part of Winnum Roke's motive is revealed to save the Earth (though she seems more motivated by spite, and I'm sure she has other motives too).

** One thing I think [[/u/mooderino][u/mooderino]] does incredibly well is express frustration in his writing. I always feel incredibly frustrated on Nic's part because there is always a sense of being used. It isn't one of those stupid plotlines where the protagonist is oblivious to clearly being manipulated by other people nor is it something where the protagonist is the real puppet master all along.

I think it fits in with this chapter. Nic is of adequate intelligence and skill to know that there is something going on and that he is being used. However, he is unable to do anything about it. He could completely ignore the direction they are pushing him but then he won't be involved (which he wants to be despite his protests) and his curiosity wouldn't be satisfied. Plus, what if the world WILL end if he does nothing? Nic is stuck on following their directions despite his extreme frustration of being unable to do be at the helm of his own fate.

*** Really? This was the first chapter in almost the entire series where everyone is explaining their goals (in half-truths anyways). What did you find confusing? I feel like reading [[/u/xachariah]]'s comment would help clear things up if you didn't pick it up from the chapter.
