** Okay I'll be honest I asked someone here if they were published and didn't announce it when this showed up in my recommended buys on amazon. I'm about 50% through and it is a delight to read something targeted directly at my flair.

The good: Characterization. Humor similar to ready player one (very Trek influenced). Reasonable approaches for being a copy-clan. Passages through the Void concepts being treated with in public media. Uploaded cryonicist is the protagonist.

The not so good: Light on the physics porn, some of the problem solving is treated as drudgery and glossed over, some YMMV cringey straw man treatment of religion and YMMV unlikely dystopian assumptions to set up the scenario.

** Just read this in a sitting, on the recommendation. Very enjoyable, overall good concepts with the initial apocalyptic strawmen, but abates by the end. Has some lesser-quality space maneuvering of SevenEves, battles of A Fire Upon the Deep, and some sequences reminiscent of Dragon's Egg. I look forward to seeing more!

** Just finished it on Audible. Overall, I liked it, but I'm also unfairly comparing it to Revelation Space. I think the author is setting up a platform for an awesome Bobiverse, but as Empiricist said, it's a bit light on problem solving, which, for Bob the engineer, I'd think would have been a bigger part of the narrative. For the short duration of the book, I think they author tried to cover too much ground, with too many Bobs, and too many story lines that didn't intersect in any interesting way.

But, I will read or listen to Book 2 when it comes out.

** This book would be my Bible if it weren't for all the cringey nerd references and memes the author fires off every once in a while. Even still, I love it.

The moment in the book where I had the question: why did he experience time faster or slower? Wouldn't he be in control of that? And the book answered, almost immediately. It told me that we were on the same wavelength.

I think this book could do without reactionless thrusters. I don't think any magic tech is really required at all. But again. I'm willing to forgive it there.

Love it. Would love it more without the insecent nerd culture that permeates it. Oh well. I want more.

Mooooooore.

I love this book.

Looking forward to the sequel due for April in Ernest.

** I'm on my second "listen"-through now. Really enjoying the general tone of the book as I was worried by the description that it would be all jokes and no substance. There's quite a bit to chew on here though and I love thinking about the concepts of VR, AI, and Von Neumann probes. Also, as an archaeologist, I love [[#s][spoiler]]
