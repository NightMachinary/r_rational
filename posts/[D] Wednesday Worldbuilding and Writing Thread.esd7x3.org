Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** 1. You are a Muggle in your mid 20's.

2. The year is 2015. You live in London.

3. A message received from your 16 year old self has information stating you were brain wiped of a younger sibling who was a wizard at some point.

4. You do not remember a younger sibling, nor do you have any evidence beyond family pictures that look a little off center. As if a person is missing. Several years of VHS tapes and old cheap DVD's are too badly aged to repair.

5. The message contains encrypted scans of year 1-2 textbooks from Hogwarts as well as notes from your 16 year old self detailing what you figured out traveling with your sibling to Diagon alley to purchase school supplies for years 1 and 2.

6. You have 20,000 pounds in savings. You are working a steady job to continue earning 1,600 pounds a month. (Not factoring in expenses.)

7. Your younger self insists that the higher echelons of government around the world are in on the secret, and are actively working to cover up the Wizards existence.

8. Muggles are seen as nothing better than Cattle, treat them nicely but no one really gets too upset if something bad happens to them.

Your goal is to bring down the statute of secrecy, while keeping your memory, and not dying. Ensuring that a war does not erupt is a secondary concern after the preservation of magical knowledge and casters. Wizards are hoarding knowledge that can benefit all of mankind, they can violate the known rules of physics, which is only more data for the Grand Unified Theory. They could prevent disasters, but don't. They took your sibling out of your life.

Rules:

- You are not immune to magic.

- Muggle repelling spells cover only the entrances to magical locations.

- You do not recover memories from a properly cast obliviate.

- Stealing magic is impossible. Investigating the genetics of it and the possibility of gene manipulation for it are far beyond your means until the statute falls.

- You can utilize potions, magical items, and creatures.

- Magic operates like heavily ionizing radiation in regards to electronics (but not living creatures). Dead simple mechanical and electrical devices will operate near magic, complex unhardened transistors / vacuum tubes will not.

- Magical shields block bullets, hand grenades and moderate kinetic impacts. A speeding sedan will be stopped by a shield, a bus will not.

- Muggles cannot learn legilimency or occlumency. Memories of a muggle can be extracted and / or stored in a pensive.

- Prophecy is real, but only in hindsight.

- 'Souls' are brain states. Magic of the soul is manipulation of the electrical patterns that represent the mind.

- Muggles can use the Flu / Side along Apperate / Portkey without anything beyond usual side effects.

- Ritual magic exists, but requires a magical individual to execute. (No sticking a wizard in the circle unconscious and activating either. Coercion is viable.)

Munchkin / what are the most efficient methods of achieving this goal? Assume the individual executing this are of slightly above average intelligence, but not strictly a rationalist to the point of sitting down to plan every possible outcome or examine their reasoning and biases at ever decision. Basic ethical concerns apply as well. The individual is not going to at first murder a wizard to gain access to his library and scan it into a computer. Small slides and forays into ethical grey areas could lead to this. There is no time scale of execution of this plan.

What are some methods of achieving the goal/ loopholes in the current rules?

*** Parents of muggleborns are the key. You can find them at King's Cross. "Hi, did you just drop off you kid to Hogwarts? Being a muggle who knows about wizards is such a weird situation, I'd like to have someone similar to talk to, could I get your number?" Should allow you to figure out if they are willing to help you without exposing you are working against the statute. They can provide magical items that you can use to prove the situation to people privately and go from there. As the operation grows in scope, make sure no single person knows enough that memory reading them will allow the whole thing to be stopped.

*** I really love this (abandoned) fanfiction, it's an isekai of a D&D wizard entering the Harry Potter universe at the beginning of the first book.

Some of the chapters are about a muggle police officer investigating magic.

She first gets on the trail because she's on the team that was to raid the house Harry stays in to hide from the death eaters, then finds out her memory is wiped after noticing paperwork flaws and goes back to the voice recording she took before.\\
Later, she gets bird watching groups to monitor for owl-deliveries of wizarding newspapers, and then eventually discovers who is getting them, and steals one, then gets into diagon alley by tricking a squib.

*** Step one: Email a backup of everything I have to Wikileaks. Anonymously, or as anonymously as I can.

Step two: Set up a system that will automatically email me a copy of the documents - along with all the other notes I upload in the future - to me if I ever fail to send it a weekly email by Monday morning. Send the email every Sunday evening that I remember to send it. Regularly upload my notes to the server, with the intention that if I am memory-wiped, I can reconstruct why I got memory-wiped.

Step 3: Hide several other reminders of the Wizarding World where I would come across them in the course of my daily life, should I ever be memory-wiped.

These three steps will give me a resilience to memory-wiping that will surprise most wizards.

Step 4: Attempt to enter Diagon Alley armed with a camera phone. (Yes, the phone won't work, but I won't know that until I'm there...)

--------------

Step 4: Recover objectives from email. Recognise that attempting to slip into Diagon Alley with a camera phone leads to memory wipe.

Step 5: Attempt to find evidence of missing younger sibling. Search through city records, church baptisimal records, anything. Google his/her name.

Step 6: If younger sibling is alive, attempt to make contact. If not, then send (anonymous email) evidence of probable death to police station.

Step 7: Attempt to recruit like-minded wizardly allies

...after this point, it /really/ depends on what happens...

*** I was actually thinking of this earlier this morning, but from the opposite perspective - the statute of secrecy is so /obviously/ doomed to fail that there must be serious protections keeping it up that we never see. So I was thinking from the perspective of a muggleborn wizard - how do you figure out what's keeping the secret and bypass it?

Your goal, if you want to make information resilient, is just to spread it around without arousing notice. Your problem is that you don't know what arouses notice - if you just tell a friend in private, how do you know that magical alarms aren't going off somewhere?

In the given setting (assuming the Harry Potter novels don't exist), I probably don't think of magical protections until too late. So in-setting me would probably start by telling trusted people as much as I think they'll accept, backing up the information in various locations, trying to feel out people who might be interested in being nodes in an information-spreading network, etc. I'll probably realize that the NSA could have red flags on obvious wizard jargon and not use it in electronic conversations, and certainly not put anything on the public web at first.

At this point, if the protection is magical alarms against secret-breaking, they're probably thoroughly going off and I get nabbed and lose the game. But maybe the magical protections are more subtle and, dare I say, magical. In which case I probably accidentally trip and fall while having decided that carrying all my evidence next to a river was a good idea, then hit my head and die of a brain hemorrhage.

Basically, my chances as a muggle don't seem great.

**** More subtle methods of detection of the statute would be I think counter to the wizarding culture introduced in the books.

In the 'fanon' the Unspeakables who would be executing things like this are given a heck of lot more power. In canon, they're only researchers at the behest of the government.

I think the largest difference between the muggles and wizards beyond the magic is the type of society and group dynamic they seem to operate on.

For as much as the Wizards say they have a government, it's small town politics and machinations. Lots of nepotism, conservative leads, not much political action beyond attempts at a violent takeover.

I'm not saying that muggle governments aren't like this, but globalization and the mindset is fundamentally different. Not to mention that even with the NSA example, they're going to be just as likely as an independent muggle to wrangle anything they can from wizards / those in the know.

I'd prefer to make the mistake and be picked up by the NSA spooks than have my memory wiped. The Government overall might be helping the wizards, but factions inside of it are not all in lock step like the wizarding world. (It's frankly impossible in my opinion for the statue to have been kept for any length of time in the modern world. People cannot keep secrets for months, let along centuries.)

So yes, perhaps the wizards have some arcane information detecting magic. In which case any attempt to disseminate information will fail, assuming it's operating on the information itself as an infohazard and not the method of information transmission.

The wizards might have detection in place for speaking, writing, signing and the like. I doubt very much they have magic for detecting encrypted digital data. You might suffer a few memory wipes to reach this conclusion with reminders in place though... Which is bad. You've got to assume repeat offenders of getting close to breaking the statute are just turned in to vegetables.

Wizards don't see the muggles as people.

** Okay, this is really random, but you know all that stuff about creating a warning system for nuclear waste storage facilities? They basically have to stop people drilling there for 10,000 years.

I recently was reading through a bunch of documents from c. 1990 about this, and one included some science fiction scenarios of how the storage facilities would be interacted with on different time-scales under different conditions. I kind of love this.

You can find the document here: [[https://www.wipp.energy.gov/library/cca/CCA_1996_References/Chapter%207/CREL3329.PDF]] - I think it's about p180 on the pdf, but I've uploaded a screenshot of the first scenario here: [[https://imgur.com/a/Daj1jpb]]

Here's my summary of the scenarios:

"in 100 years" scenarios:

- "What if the world becomes feminist in 100 years and people ignore our warnings because we are old white men?" (full text above)
- "cult thinks the meaning of life is buried there so they drill" - their cult beliefs involve thinking that we are simultaneously in many alternate realities so they think all the stuff about radiation is from an alternate universe that does not apply here
- New Mexico secedes from the USA and joins Mexico and everyone forgets about the waste buried because beaurocracy... By 2091
- "what if it's so successful that it's expanded and lots more stuff is dumped, even non-radioactive stuff?" (answer: it's probably ok)

the 1,000 year scenarios

- in 2991 there are underground skyscrapers in all major cities and they are building a tunnel through the site, which they don't find because they are coming from below. This is actually reasonable if unlikely
- slaves are mining the area. Computers working through speech interfaces mean that nobody can read anymore. They ignore the written warnings and dig anyway

11991.....

- Virus on the androids that build underground cities makes them dig randomly. There's a very detailed description of society and its 3 tiers in this future. (There are the high class humans who run everything, the low class humans who get UBI and make art and or do drugs, and then the robots)
- spaceship crashes into the site (there's also a space war, I think)
- nuclear warning systems are basically Disney and the storage sites Disneyland. "Nicky Nuke" is the equivalent of Mickey Mouse.

And then they have The Industrial Scenario. 2000-11991 (this is like three times as long as any of the other reports)

- the area is used as solar farms
- so industry (esp magnesium mining) sets up around the solar farms to take advantage of the cheap electricity
- "For the much more distant future, the whole notion of industrial production may be replaced by concepts not yet available to us." => for example, they haven't anticipated 3D printing, which, if/when it reaches a certain level of sophistication, will do away with the need of a lot of factories as it's much better to download the design for a widget and print it at home than order it
- the magnesium extraction caused some of the magnesium to get contaminated with radioactive waste and be incorporated in metals in 2500, resulting in more stringent controls being reapplied
- in 2900, people start going to mine trans-uranic elements there, because they are no longer produced as a byproduct of nuclear weapons, taking about 10% of the trans-uranic elements before they became too expensive to be worth recovering
- this process repeats several times before the year 4,000, using different resources

It's a kind of wacky and random collection of scenarios, none of which seem remotely plausible.

This one's my favourite. WIPP is the name of the radioactive material storage facility:

WIPP (hw;p), n. [prob. <Eng. whip in reference to ancient religious flagellation rites] Ancient 18th century A. D. (approx.) underground religious shrine in honor of the salt goddess. Care with which the facility was aligned vertically within the salt stratum, precise geometric layout, and inclusion of valuable transuranics show the esteem accorded the salt goddess. (Note: Some authorities believe the shrine layout is a stylized image of a mythic sea monster in reference to the salt in the oceans.)

******** The range would be as far as she could make out another person's eyes without it being blurry.

If the victim's vision is short-sighted for example and she is up close, the power would only be half as effective, and the victim would either be extremely paralysed or more likely the outer skin would be turned to stone, but the brain and internals would turn into a magma-like mess.

EDIT: Here's some more information on the power

#+begin_quote

  - To turn people to stone both subjects must have direct eye-contact with eachother. Transparent material like windows or glass also works as long as both subjects can see eachothers eyeballs. An army of 100 could be stoned as long as they're all looking at the eyeballs.
  - If the subject or user covers one eye closed, the subject is still stoned
  - The power works by just transforming the subjects atoms into "stone atoms"
  - Sunglasses don't work against it. The range of the power depends on the distance the subject and user can see eachother's eyeballs - if both have 20/20 vision it'll be further than if both are myopic.
  - Blind subjects aren't affected. Subjects with extremely blurred vision aren't affected until up close. Although some subjects with blurred vision, who can still see the eyeball - will turn half to stone and their skin will become hard and rock-like. The results are varied, gruesome and unpredictable
  - Camera and screen footage of the eyes will not stone the subject
  - No strenuous staring is needed
  - The power affects humans, animals and all creatures with eyes and sentience, so not bacteria.
  - The speed of the power is instant, maybe a millisecond, although it might take a second for the stone form to replace the skin.
  - Mirrors are deadly, and so the eyes must be protected with some opaque material. Although, the power can be controlled with training, and then is able to be switched on or off at will. Because of the shifting molecules - water reflections will not usually stone the user, but I wouldn't risk it.
  - Clothes are stoned too with the subject, and carried items that are smaller than the subject's size - swords, handbags are stoned. But not if the subject is just touching an object. If the subject is carrying another live being like a dog or baby, they are not stoned unless they are looking at the eyeballs too.
  - Once you're stoned you can't be un-stoned. The stone material is always the same standard rock.
  - When the power is activated, the eye may glimmer a little but is not very noticable
  - Often when the subject is stoned, they collapse to the ground as their balance isn't controlled. All of their internals are also turned to stone.
  - If the eyeballs are camoflagued/hidden or painted into a background, the subject must still recognise the individual eyeball itself to be stoned.
  - If the subject is pregnant, the baby will also be turned to stone
  - Once the eye is blinded - (by laser, looking at the sun) the power is deactivated. A successful operation to regain sight will restore the power

********* Her brother has contacts in the police force. One way for her to find out about crimes is by taking on some minor (possibly secretarial?) role in the station and just keeping her (unstoning) eye and ears open.

Better yet, she can take on a minor role in the court system, and (mostly) limit herself to criminals who slip away from a Guilty verdict on a technicality.

You're going to have to define exactly what is meant by 'standard rock'. Something igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic? Granite, gneiss, quartz, marble? Chalk, salt?

...diamond?

It's more or less a case of "pick one". But bear in mind that almost all rocks are way heavier than the original people were - there may be recently-stoned people dropping through (weak) floors or out of trees or similar. (And if it was a TV show there would inevitably be one guy, at some point, who got stoned just /as/ he was walking past a window so that he could dramatically fall out the building in front of everyone and /suddenly/ the police are /super/ interested in the question of who was in that building at ten minutes past four on Tuesday afternoon).

I think I would just have the criminal and the brother be alone on a high platform like a bridge or a balcony, and at first the criminal would pretend to be a jumper but instead pulls a gun on him as he gets near him. So there would be a panicked crowd at the bottom - and maybe the criminal forces everyone to stay put?

The problem would be getting the criminal's attention and forcing him to look at her eye, without bringing attention to herself - so I was thinking she always carries a laser-pointer in her pocket (because PTSD of stoning her father and toying with blinding herself). So she could discreetly shine it in his eye so he gets distracted and looks down? It's a big stretch.

Suggestion: Building under construction, lots of scaffolding, no-one up there but the builders.

One of said builders heads out on a ledge with a gun and fires it into the air to attract attention (Where do the bullets land? Well, /he/ doesn't care.) Brother heads up to find out what the guy wants/talk him down, all other builders evacuated.

Crowd gathers beneath. Crowd includes Sister.

Guy With Gun takes Brother hostage, grabbing him around the neck with one arm and holding a gun to his head. Since Criminal's arm is around Brother's neck, Brother can't look down (and isn't really trying to, he's mostly thinking about the gun barrel pointed at his brain matter).

Criminal, however, /can/ look down. and is yelling at the crowd below. Possibly he's yelling at a police negotiator - a guy with a loudhailer and a psychology degree, who's trying to talk him into letting Brother go.

Criminal wants something. Possibly something political, possibly just to get his cause on the evening news. He's unstable, threatening to shoot Brother. Brother /still/ can't look down because of the arm around his neck.

It's at this point that Sister (possibly standing near to the Negotiator) can flip up her eyepatch for a moment, and stone Criminal. Bother's troubles aren't over - he now has a massive heavy unmoving statue around his neck - but at least he's not going to get /shot/ anymore...

This has some real "conservation of energy" / nuclear physics type consequences, if you haven't already explored that.

Does the weight change? Like, say she chases a criminal up a tree, and the criminal is at the very thinnest part their body can support, and BAM, the eye contact happens, the criminal is stone. Does the now stone body cause the tree to snap?

There is no such thing as "standard rock" - choose something specific (sandstone? granite? whatever type of rock is common at her birthplace/the thing that cursed her's birthplace?) to ensure your descriptions are consistent.

  If the subject is pregnant, the baby will also be turned to stone
#+end_quote

Slippery slope argument: you said a baby in arms won't be. Let's say you have a baby that was born at ~26 weeks and taken home at ~36 weeks, so it's still not "fully grown" but is independent/etc by the rules of the power. Now say you have someone with a baby at ~42 weeks in the belly. Are you OK with this?

Possible explanation: the baby is considered part of the mother for the purposes of this power until the umbilical cord is cut.

Problem: the baby is born, and the cord isn't cut yet. You curse the mother: does the baby, which is now external, get cursed? What about if you curse the baby but not the mother?

Solution: I highly doubt this will come up in your story, and pretty much anything can be justified here.

Complication: If you decide the umbilical cord is what matters, this needs to be consistent with conjoined twins. If one twin sees her, are both stoned?

--------------

Munchinry: Assuming she does it on animals that society has no qualms killing (i.e. most everything except dogs, cats, and anything endangered) she can do power generation stuff with a wheel.

Workaround: it takes some amount of effort for her to do it, which is unnoticable for killing 5 criminals here and there, but if she does 4 hour shifts changing rats in wheels, it probably becomes noticable. Also, breeding the animals probably takes more work than would be generated, unless you imagine that Lemmings really do commit suicide and you set it up next to the lemming suicide cliff.

Of course, it's not particularly likely to be in her plans if she wants to be Dexter.

(You can probably get around this if the stone is a shell of the same weight, though it still requires a fuckton of energy, it doesn't outright break physics).

********** Appreciate your help

I imagine the stone is a dark grey marble, and whatever weight the subject is - the stone is the same equivalent. It's also dense, so if you were to break it apart, there would still be stone inside. So that tree branch wouldn't snap because it's too heavy but because the criminal loses all balance, so they would fall off and might take the branch with it.

If I ever get far with this story, she might have plans to fake her death and sculpt her own portrait, making the police think she stoned herself. So the stone material would have to be exactly the same. Or maybe it would be easier to stone a criminal and then sculpt her likeness onto it.

As for the baby concept, it will be stoned unless it literally exits out of the mother's body. The umbilical cord would snap off probably. And if you stone the baby, the mother wouldn't be affected.

But if a criminal were pregnant, she wouldn't want to stone an innocent life anyway.

The conjoined twins idea is extremely fascinating and too good not to explore in this story, so I would think the "power" would make a distinction between the two beings and only stone one of them. The other twin would need surgery to seperate themself, and prevent the spread of disease.

The power generation is a creative avenue to go down but probably too out there. Although she probably would use the power for personal gain at some point, and sell statues to artists for money etc

Some other ideas:

- The power stones the victim almost immediately but starts from the body-parts closest to the eye. So if they stick their arm out, the arm would be stoned first and then the rest of the body. So if the subject were bleeding out from an amputated limb, and the eye were to open and shut fast enough, the wound could be cauterized by only turning the limb to stone. Maybe you could make a device like a pair of digital glasses, where the lens opens and shuts in a millisecond to do this.

- Using technology to upgrade the eye's power - contact lenses that zoom in, infra-red/night vision lenses, AR censoring technology to filter out mirrors and reflections

- Using optical illusions to imprint images on the eye? But I don't know how that would be useful

That's a problem, because... either it's ordinary stone, which is heavier than flesh, or it's abnormal stone (eg pumice) which has the same density as flesh. If it's ordinary stone, it can't be solid. Maybe it can have a honeycomb sort of layout, but you're really stretching it. It just plain doesn't make sense for it to both be solid (heavy) granite and be the same weight as flesh and bone.

This is clearly the way to go, especially if she can kidnap the criminal, change clothes with her, change her appearance (e.g. with costumer face putty), and then stone her. Much easier for a trained SFX makeup artist to do it before stoning than for her to sculpt (which will give tool marks).

Umbilical cords don't really... snap off. They fall off after several days of their own accord.

The umbilical cord and placenta are part of the baby - but the placenta is also part of the mother. My first thought was that the placenta would turn into stone with the baby, but that would mean a stone organ with stone blood vessels entering the mother's endometrium would be a thing. Which would probably result in infection at the very least, and be very difficult to pass (that said, there's literally 30 minutes between a baby being born and the placenta being born, so, this really doesn't need to be worked out for your story...)

I guess if the baby was stoned, you could make it be stoned until the start of the umbilical cord, which would then fall off, but based on embyronic development this isn't nearly as pretty as it /seems/ to laypeople. (And converseley, if the mother was stoned but the neonate wasn't, the placenta and cord would be stoned all the way up to the navel? or maybe either way the placenta gets off scott free?)

I think most conjoined twins who aren't separated is because the surgery would be too dangerous: but I guess if one is dead, then you can "just" save the other (though they usually share a liver: how do you determine what happens to the 'shared' liver? what about those American women who are essentially one person with two heads, and they each control one arm and one leg?)

************ Ok, I think I'll just change it so that their mass is heavier as they are stoned.

The umbilical cord being stoned all the way to the navel seems like the way to go, and wouldn't really harm the baby.

I think the shared liver would be partially stoned which would make it unusable anyway - so they would still have to get emergency treatment. The one person with two heads is an interesting idea - I think the power would only stone one of the heads down to the neck. So the other limbs probably couldn't be used anymore.

I was thinking an eccentric rich artist takes an extreme fascination of the stone killings and wants to display custom statues like large animals, people in elaborate poses etc that would seem impossible to sculpt in some exhibit. Of course, that would create a lot of suspicion.

The mob boss who wants their rival's corpse is a fun idea, and would she would have no problem killing another criminal.

The stone limb would probably lead to disease if not treated, but not life-threatening. Maybe paralysis in that arm. The limb stays attached like a prosthetic arm that you can't take off. There wouldn't be a fine cutoff line where you can distinguish where the skin stops and the stone starts, more like a slight gradient so it doesn't snap and fall off. A criminal would then probably go to a back-alley surgeon to amputate it.

EDIT: I was also researching metamorphic rock types and how they change form based on increasing pressure. I think it would be interesting if the power could be trained and focused enough that the marble transforms to something like graphite, or diamond or even reaches a melting point. This would probably render the eye useless after such an exert of energy.

If you want the pregnancy thing as a plot point, I'd probably peg it to blood flow - i.e. cojoined twins and newborns with a functional umbilical cord would be stoned - or just, y'know, the fetus would die regardless and be entombed (although that would be pretty grim.)

** So I am not sure if this really counts as world building or munchkinry, but I am posting it here because it's more world building for where it is in my process.

Let's say that you - a rationalist - find yourself in 1990 with the following advantages:

- You have worked out the rough trajectory of the future through intelligence (and a bit of luck).

  - What the internet will become.
  - Cell phone computers and 3d printing.
  - A guess about things like CRISPR and Deep Neural Networks.
  - Whatever else you can reasonably expect someone to have predicted about things that exist today (perhaps in prototype form) if they were very lucky.

- In 1995 you will have approximately 5 billion dollars in assets. And a liquid income from your primary venture (some sort of technology company) in at-least the billion dollar range every year following.
- Given your ability to project out what the future will be like, you have the ability to reach it sooner for cheaper.
- No moral or ethical boundaries.
- A small group of deeply loyal people who will do anything you ask.

Now here is the problem:

- You believe super-scaling AI will destroy humanity. You believe that this must be stopped.
- You believe super-scaling AI will first be achievable by 2020, this is your hard cut off for any plans, you have 30 years, 25 years with money.

  - You believe publicly releasing any projected technological advances you have made early would be detrimental to this number, so you will not do it unless necessary and only in a strictly controlled fashion.

- You believe that any attempt at social, political, cultural, or other soft power solution will not be enough to prevent super scaling AI from being created.

  - They may be useful tools, but in general any solution relying on them you believe will eventually fail.

- The solution must survive your lifetime. Any self sustaining human structure would be inadequate (re: the previous), it must either prevent super-scaling AI or push the problem back by a significant amount.

  - Some sort of semi-permanent progress toward preventing super scaling AI must have been made.

- Humanity must exist in some self-sustaining form.

  - Preferably space faring.
  - Your own, or anyone's, survival is not particularly important.

What do you do?

I have none of those assumptions. I think nuclear energy, communism, and electric cars are tools that might or might not be useful depending on what you're trying to accomplish in what circumstances with what other options. I'm just trying to explore an alternate history scenario as objectively as I can.

**** Electric cars are vastly more efficient than gasoline ones end-to-end. An electric car using coal-generated electricity is still better than any gas car.

*** Heavier reliance on infrastructure (electrified tracks, shorter range before recharging esp. with primitive batteries) might lead to more centralization, more crowded cities and towns. Worse roads, especially backroads; some areas might not bother with roads at all and just put in train tracks or similar (less accidents because you can't swerve off-road, but more fatal when they do happen.)

EDIT: towns built without cars in mind, such as if they intended to rely on a subway system, would have narrower streets and thus fire would spread more easily.

*** Thank you all for the wrinkles and details to what is turning out to be a pretty grim alternate history.

I'm wondering if this scenario might create the incentives for someone to invent a better energy source. 1920s hydrogen cars seem a bit of a stretch, though.

It might just be that the most likely scenario is that people abandon electric cars and switch to gasoline, just like this did in our time line :)

** If you had to guess, what elements of reality are fictional? Like, if someone convincingly demonstrated they were an isekai protagonist or similar, what do you think the "real" world is like?

My guess would have to be the technology level. I'm hardly the first person to observe that our world has gotten pretty cyberpunk lately, so we could easily be in a sci-fi story. If we were fantasy, we would have to be a fantasy world where math controls the underlying structure of reality - one of those "mutually fictional" deals I guess. Or an urban fantasy where I'm not privy to any of the differences because it's all kept secret (which I guess includes a lot of action films, like Terminator), but that's a little boring.
