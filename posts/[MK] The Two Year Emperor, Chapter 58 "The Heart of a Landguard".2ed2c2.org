** Huh. So if that's how /Mindscrape/ works, Ice Afi One could use /Mindscrape/ on Ice Afi Two in order to spread the knowledge - so removing it from the leader might not be enough. Though I suppose that there are good reasons not to spread the knowledge too far, and letting another creature learn all of your secrets is terrible, even if they're an exact clone of you. Also also, /Mindscrape/ gives a lot of fodder for secrets that you can junk - gather up a thousand people, /Mindscrape/ them, then have all the ice clones /Mindscrape/ each other, then have them each dump a thousand people's worth of secrets into the ritual.

And I just now realized that /Mindscrape/ is probably a renamed [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/book-of-vile-darkness--37/mindrape--165/][/Mindrape/]], which is one of the most terrifying spells in existence.

*** All of this is correct. There's a quibble about knowledge possessed by a thousand people and a ton of IAs not being secrets, which means that it has a lot less oomph but yes, that works.

And yes, Mindscrape is a bowlderized version of Mindrape. I wanted something a bit more family friendly, since my general rule is "it could be shown on prime time."

**** I get why you changed the name, but it was always one of my favorite spell names specifically because it conjures up such ugly feelings that so perfectly match what the spell actually does. It's a brutal, ugly, vile spell, with a name that quite suits it. But it's probably not in fitting with the story you want to tell to have that word be used.

I'm curious whether any of the mages that can learn/cast 9th level spells would be alright with knowing and using /Mindscrape/. For all that I just said about it being brutal, vile, and ugly, it's also got some of the most utility of any of the mental magic spells out there. You can ensure absolute loyalty, you can rapidly share information, you can change alignment without using the Helm (and presumably forcing a much more difficult save), you can do /so many things/. I'm not sure who would willingly submit to it, but it's an incredible spell. If /Mind Blank/ weren't continuously applied to all of the most important people, it would be even better than save-or-die, since instead of killing your opponent you turn him into your instant ally.

(I once ran a D&D campaign which featured a villain who was famous for the use of /Mindrape/ and other mental magics as a sort of Moriarty man-behind-the-man-behind-the-man role, and have a deep affection for the spell.)

I dunno about you, but to me 'Mindscrape' brings to mind images of a jagged rock being dragged across someone's wet brain. Pretty vile, ugly, and brutal to me. :)

Minor spoiler: I'm actually planning to have some of the new Archmagi pick up Mindscrape.

And yes, it's less of a save-or-die and more or a save-or-lose-and-become-the-enemy-of-all-you-stand-for.

***** Sort of.

The effectiveness of a sacrifice is how much of a sacrifice it is -- how big a difference it makes, both to you and to the world, that you've given up this knowledge. If it's a secret, then you're sacrificing the only copy of the knowledge; think of that as a multiplier, because it makes the sacrifice more significant when there is no one else who could act on the information.

When Jake sacrificed his "blow up the world" plan, it was a really big deal. It would have effected every single undead and living creature on the planet, it was the only way that Jake then knew to win the war of extinction he was facing. Also, it was the only copy of the information -- no one else knew what he'd come up with. Even without the secrecy multiplier, it was still a big deal.

The fact that the Ice Assassins have spell slots isn't a secret, but for a spell caster to /permanently/ give up a spell slot is a huge deal for that person. They don't get the secrecy multiplier, but it's still a big sacrifice.

In case what I said before wasn't specific enough: "Is there some reason to believe that, when Icefi sacrifices all the knowledge he got from Jake, that Jake will lose all of that knowledge too, leaving him merely a clever person with no special knowledge?"

Of course, there is also the question of who gets the 'credit' ("share" in Herrun) for the knowledge. I suspect this is Icefi, and the credit would be quite substantial for that amount of rarefied knowledge.

I assumed it was a consequence of the unbreakable vow he'd just gotten done making:

#+begin_quote
  "Allow your alignment to be changed and I will recall the magi. Allow your alignment to be changed and I will prevent these messages from being sent in future, so long as you and all of yours maintain faith with us and do not cast yourselves against us. I swear on the Land, and in the name of the True God of Flobovia, to keep my faith with thee, [...] I bind my honor and my soul in earnest to this vow: my word is good, my intent is without deceit, I shall not waver from its completion."
#+end_quote

Afi wouldn't allow his alignment to be changed, therefore the leniency that Thomas vowed would come from doing so will not be granted. (Logically this would be "denying the antecedent" but the oath having wording like "my intent is without deceit" suggests it's do-what-I-mean, not do-what-I-say.)

Thomas's vow is a simple modus ponens: "If you do X, I will do Y". (Well, not exactly MP, since X is not being assumed true. Still.)

If Icefi doesn't do X, Thomas is under no obligation to do Y.

******* Yes, if there is no 'denying the antecedent', then Thomas is under no obligation to do Y.

My hypothesis meant to explain Thomas's insistence on /not/ doing Y by assuming that he somehow /is/ under an obligation to do not-Y. (If this is not the case, then of course the hypothesis fails.)

Searching for a cause of the postulated obligation, I looked at the vow. The form is basically "If you do as I say, then I will be good to you." So the DTA postulated is the use of this reasoning:

- If you do as I say, I will be good to you.
- You are not doing as I say.
- Therefore, I won't be good to you.

As denying the antecedent, this is logically invalid---but it is a /pragmatically/ likely outcome: normally if someone says "if you stop now, I won't hit you", there's usually an unspoken "if you don't stop now, I /will/ hit you" to be inferred. Thomas' explicitly referencing intent would make this reading possible, but given that it's you I'm having this conversation with, I suppose it is unlikely. :p

*** (I'm away from my books at the moment so roll wih me if I have the specific numbers wrong -- the point still stands.)

I've always been a bit confused by the XP charts. It says that it requires (e.g.) 1000 XP to reach level 2 and 3000 XP to reach level 3. I've had some people tell me that these numbers are lifetime totals (meaning that you become level 3 when you earn your 3000th XP). I've had other people tell me that these are level increments (meaning that you become level 3 when you have earned 1000+3000=4000 XP). I'm not sure who is right, but I am ruling that the numbers are level increments.

Assuming that these are level increments, it takes 360,000 XP to reach level 13. (If I remember the number right -- three hundred something anyway.)

If I'm wrong and those are only lifetime totals, then just assume there were fewer Fire Giants on the platform. Oh and, next next time? We take our newly minted 13th level folk and create a bunch of Fomorian Queens for them to drop. Voila: 17th level Archmagi. The only reason I didn't go straight there is because the XP charts won't handle encounters between 1st level chars and 18h level threats, and the needed number of fire giants was prohibitive.

**** Just for future reference, those are indeed lifetime totals. The XP needed to reach the next level is always (Current level*1000). So 1000 to go 1-2, 2000 to go 2-3, thus 3000xp lifetime at level 3. Page 22 of the PHB has all this, unfortunately it is not part of the srd so I cant link to it.

As well the Epic level handbook goes into some of the xp formulas which work for everything but the very low range which the writers seem to have tweaked a bit. We can work out that base XP is CRx300 at CR=ECL, for every 2 CR above ECL the XP doubles (x1.5 for +1CR). CR below ECL works the same way in reverse.

A single fomorian queen (CR17) would give a single ECL17 character 17x300xp = 5100 xp which lines up with the chart. To find the xp that encounter would give a ECL1 character we can start with a CR1 encounter (1*300), then recognize that we are adding +2CR eight times (x2^{8} ) to get XP = 1x300x2^{8} = 76800xp for our ECL1 character. Of course ECL1 is in the weird grouped line so the table doesnt line up perfectly with the formula, but Ill just go for text trumping table and ignore the stupid table.

Well, taking advantage of fair use, I'm going to quote one sentence:

"This column on Table 3--2 shows the experience point total needed to attain a given character level---that is, the total of all the character's level in classes."

I would prefer that this be a lifetime total -- it would mean that the FLEA would need a less ridiculous number of giants while still giving as good or better results -- but I'm still having trouble with the text. "The XP total to attain a given character level" -- that could mean either lifetime total or increment. Is there anything you can point to that clarifies it? If so, I would happily retcon it to work like that, but I'd prefer not to unless I was sure.

I read the info in the Epic Handbook and you're right -- it lets you figure out the award for any challenge. Three problems though:

- It gives the number, but doesn't speak to the total / increment question
- 2YE explicitly disregards all epic content, so this isn't part of the setting. I wouldn't feel too badly about saying "this isn't epic, it's just an explanation of the system so it's in", but...
- 2YE works off of RAW, and the info in the EHB only has RAW about levels 21 and up. The formulas can trivially be adapted to figure out what a 1st level vs 17 CR award would be, but that's RAI, not RAW.

****** Experience points are running total throughout your entire career, they are not lost when leveling up. XP is only spent/lost for certain things like crafting or permanent level loss. So a 19th level character by definition has an experience point total of at least 171k and as soon as that total increases to 190k they will be able to level up to 20th. Also, page 6 of the ELH it does spell out that you only need an additional ECL*1000 xp to reach the next level: "For instance reaching 31st level would require an additional 30x1,000XP (or 30,000 XP), taking the character's XP total from 435,000 to 465,000."

As for RAI vs RAW, that is unfortunate. It is very obvious its the same formula they used in the DMG beyond the first few ECL's, but it does not come out and say that. You can derive that formula from the DMG tables, but Im not sure how you feel that falls on the RAW or houserule issue. It is following the logical trend established, but not spelled out, by RAW. Quite frustrating the ELH didnt say "for party levels and Challenge Ratings above /or below/ these ranges" instead.

Luckily getting people to 21+ should be pretty quick with the FLEA and then the stupid-worlders can use proper xp formulas. The 360k xp from 34 giants would actually send that apprentice to level 27, so its not a total waste. Im scared to think of the kinda of xp the FLEA will generate once Jake figures out he can use templates to get around the 15HD limitation of PAO.

On close inspection of Polymorph Other, that doesn't work - Polymorph Other doesn't affect the mind, so they'd be humans with an Int of 1. Too low to be sentient.

But they become sentient when their Int hits 3, so all we need is a mass-produced way to give +2 to intelligence. (Suggestions welcome.) Polymorph Other might even be superfluous; depends whether non-humans can contribute towards the god's totals. If they do, Deadboy's massive army of undead must exist for /precisely this reason/.

I can't find any information on what a worm's Wisdom and Charisma scores are - I'm only guessing that their Int is 1 because animal intelligence is always 1 or 2 and worms are not particularly bright animals.

Does Jake have any plans to create spell engines? They seem as though they'd be pretty useful. How exactly do they work, anyway? Do they just cast a single spell? Or can they have the spell they cast changed? And can they cast the more incredibly useful spells, like Ice Assassin or Wish?

How many times can the newly minted Archmages cast Polymorph Any Object per day? Is there a sufficiently large supply of level 1s that Jake could just leave FLEA with a lot of worms and grow his supply exponentially?

But! You've got Polymorph Other (4th level) and Polymorph Any Object (8th level), +both of which can be used to power to FLEA+. [EDIT: Only PAO. PO can't produce an output critter more than one size category larger than the input critter, so worm => fire giant is a no-go.] So you can, in fact, grow your supply of wizards pretty damn fast. And each one that you FLEAify can, after 9 hours (8 to sleep, 1 to memorize) cast more PAO +and POs+ to help other people crank up. So, yeah, you can grow the supply pretty damn fast.

Spell engines come in several flavors: resetting magic traps, spell turrets, spell clocks. They have slight differences, but the basic idea is the same: they cast a specific spell at a specific frequency (1/round, 1/hour, 1/day, etc). You can't change the spell. It isn't specified, but I rule that you cannot put a spell that requires XP into a spell engine, so you can't have a spell engine casting (e.g.) Ice Assassin or Wish. Also, you must make all decisions about the spell engine when you create it. You can't set it up to "use True Creation to create whatever I want at the time" you have to set it to "use True Creation to create a longsword". And all of those longswords will be exactly identical.

The other problem with spell engines is that they take a long time to make. An engine that casts a 4th level spell takes almost a month -- the entire story so far is currently on day 17, where day 1 was when Jake arrived.

The description for PO says

#+begin_quote
  The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the subject's normal form, and can have no more Hit Dice than you have, or that the subject has (whichever is greater), and in any case the assumed form cannot have more than 15 Hit Dice
#+end_quote

But fire giants have way more hit dice than 15. Would FLEA still work so well with weaker monsters if they used PO?

The wiki says that you get a maximum of 4 spell slots for each spell level. Assuming this cannot be increased, that would mean you can make 24 mages with PO or 8 with PAO a day, from a group of around 30. You have said that PO works, so that's 5/3 times the total mages a day. I love this idea. If they're left for a week that would be a 35 times increase

******* You're looking at this chart, right? [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm]]

Those are your base spells. You also get extra spells from having high Intelligence (or Charisma for sorcerors): [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm]] (scroll down to 'Ability Scores'). Plus, if I were using feats and prestige classes you can get extra slots from those too.

Fire giants have 15d8 HD (plus a 72 HP constant) so they are the max you can create. And yes, if I'm being honest, it actually doesn't work because the worms are Fine and the fire giants are Large and I missed that restriction. You can get around this (inefficiently) by sending someone off to find lots of horses or dogs or whatever, bring them back with Teleportation Circle, and using them. Or I could dig through the "creatures by CR" charts again and find some devil or demon that's 10HD and Diminutive. Or by putting Animal Growth on the worms and then turning them into something Medium sized. Or by using a ton more worms. Or by using only PAO instead of PO. I can't bring myself to care enough to rewrite it. Maybe at some point I will, but not today.

As to number of wizards and growth rate: the Big Damn Heroes have a population of 3,000,000 to work with, an unusual percentage of whom (about 5%) have character levels. Many of these folks (about 60%) are casters, and about 60% of casters are arcane casters. That means 54,000 wizards and sorcerors. Of those, a little under 10% are of level 15+, meaning about 5000. Most of those will have the brainpower (either naturally or enhanced) to cast 8th level spells (PAO). Then there's a bunch of lower level folks who can cast PO but not PAO. Long story short, they've got plenty of mages available to run the FLEA.

So far as I'm aware, D&D has basically no rules for researching new spells. There are a couple of mentions of it, but it pretty much comes down to "DM choice."

******* About 28 million. The demographics are very different, however. Anundjå is comprised of a bunch of refugees from an apocalypse; character-leveled folks have been selected for, especially casters and especially casters of high enough level to teleport away from, or blow the crap out of, the things that are trying to suck out their tasty lifeforce. Also, there has been a ton of combat, so they have leveled pretty quickly.

Flobovia, on the other hand, is a country of rich farmers and merchants that hasn't had anything more dangerous than a few bandit raids in centuries. Furthermore, it was settled by a bunch of refugees from the fall of Ainaalacar; the area they settled was uninhabited and out in the boondocks when they got there (that's why they chose that place), so there aren't really any ancient ruins or long-lost dungeons to explore. The ones that there /were/ have been picked over pretty thoroughly in the last 5800 years, so any adventurers that do come along have to leave the country to find any adventures worth the name.

Most Flobovians who gain class levels are doing it with an eye towards commerce: lots of fighters for caravan guards, bodyguards, etc. Lots of thieves because there's craptons of money floating around. (Even before Jake broke the economy.) Casters are mostly priests, and most people have strong local ties -- family and businesses -- that mean they don't go adventuring, so they level relatively slowly.

Flobovia is 28 million. Of that, about 0.1% (28,000) have character levels. Of THOSE, only about 10% (2,800) are casters -- most are some sort of martial class or rogues. Of casters, it's a 30/70 split between arcane and divine (840 arcane) and the level percentages skew heavily to the bottom: about 70% from levels 1-7, 29% from levels 8-14, and 1% levels 15+. In short, when Jake arrived he was greeted by 3 of the 8 Archmagi in the entire country.

It's a little better on the divine side, but not much. 2800 casters, 70% divine (1960), and the levels go about the same: 70/29/1, meaning in the entire country you have about 20 clerics and druids of levels 15+. And the druids mostly stay out in the woods and don't interact with people very much. The Archpriest and the Dark Lady are the only people in Capital City capable of casting True Resurrection.

Only downside is they are huge so it will take polymorph any object instead of polymorph other if the FLEA is going to run on worms. Of course PAO doesnt require a creature so you could skip the worms and use pebbles. Worm into giant Wyrm is a bit more amusing though.

Killing one of them would give a 1st level character: 1x300x2^{9} x1.5=230,400xp. Just one of them will turn a 1st level into a 21st, almost 22nd, level character.

If we wanted that commoner to become a commoner 1/wizard 20/archivist 20 (ECL41) they will need 820,000xp. 4 gray linnroms and they will have significant xp leftover. And since both wizard and archivist use int as their casting stat, our commoner can sink all 10 of their leveling stat boosts into it for 20int.

Four eighth level spells to get a dual 9th level caster with access to the arcane sor/wiz spell list and /all/ divine spells. Before bonus spells a 20th wizard has 4 8th level spell slots, an archivist has 5 (and cleric trickery domain gets PAO). So we can more than triple the number of dual 9 casters every day. Oh and with their obscene amount of leftover xp, why not have them all wish themselves +5 inherent in every stat and make a +6 belt of magnificence while they are at it.

I realized after the fact that Polymorph Other doesn't actually work. :( It can only change something by one size category; worms are Fine and fire giants are Large, so that doesn't fit. So, I guess the FLEA runs on PAO until I can find a Dimunitive creature with a high enough CR to be worth it.

Problem with the Gray Linnorm: it has SR and DR 15/+1. The wall of force isn't a +1 or better weapon, so it can't actually hurt a GL. Which is stupid but that's why they call it Stupidworld.

[[http://monsterfinder.dndrunde.de/]] tells me that there are several (Fine or Diminutive) creatures with CR(6-15), but all of them are swarms and so not good candidates.

Could use black puddings, I suppose. They split, and if you can keep feeding them temporary HP so they stay above 10 HP, then you can split them indefinitely.

As to the rate of caster increase -- the new ones need to rest and rememorize before they can participate, or it would be truly ridiculous. Although...hm. The Landguard all have Fortifying Bedrolls (which is why Duncan can do a 23-hour/day punishment schedule). If they loaned those out to the new casters, you could have the noobs online in 2 hours.

  Should FLEA not grow exponentially? Each caster can cast 8-12 PAO spells a day, they use around 30 per person, so the total should grow by around a third a day. Assuming that he leaves most of the casters in FLEA until it is finished, and infinite earthworms, and no PAO wand

Yes, true. I'll have to do the math to see how long it takes.

  Also, i believe you mentioned that this is only day 17. It feels way longer. Do you have plans for a time skip or anything like that? Because when it was established that Jake has a limited time to rule, i presumed that that would be relevant later, but at this rate you will never reach 2 years

"Feels longer" => good. That means there's been a lot of engaging elements. :)

Timeskip: I plan to finish the Drauga War cycle. I may or may not continue on after that. If I did, I would probably try to make some money off it, through a Patreon or such. Writing 2YE takes a LOT of my time and energy; I've been doing it for a year now, and I'm starting to think that a break would be nice after I finish this. Then again, I didn't expect to end up writing a 250,000 word epic when I sat down to write "a fun little D&D short story." We'll see what happens.

************** Assuming you start with around 10000 casters, it could get to 20 million in around a month, at 10 spells per caster and 30 spells per user, assuming infinite objects to polymorph

Can you legally make money from of 2YE? As fanfiction, i would've thought that the owners of D&D hold the intellectual property

*************** They hold the copyright for D&D, but it's easy to reskin it to avoid use of their copyrighted material. Stop calling it "Mage's Magnificent Mansion" (which is already a genericified version of "Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion") and call it "Ethereal Abode" and you're all good. Obviously, also remove mention of specific elements such as "move actions" etc.

If you go over to [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com]] you'll find that I'm selling "One Hot Night", a novella spun off from 2YE. It's based in Anundjå in the Time Before. The premise is that Ingfred is a young man in his late 20s, living in a society where everyone is immortal. He's got no great prospects, but he's got an entrepreneurial spirit and a fire in his belly. He comes up with a get-rich-quick plan: undergo a somewhat illegal transformation, then sell the memory to The Experiential Herald for a fortune. He has two problems: how can he convince Master High Mage Calder to risk his Mage license by doing the transformation...and how does he deal with the legal problems afterwards?

It's on sale for $1; I wrote it as the MVP to see if anyone would pay for my writing. I've had a few sales so far and the feedback I've received has been positive.
