** So after all that, we end up with Shadowrun?

** Deconstruction, a little bleak.. Very much along the lines of the Salvation War series. My favourite bit was the part with Sauron.

** After reading this comic, I considered brainstorming a rational take on Narnia.

This lasted for about five seconds before I realized that just the cupboard is broken as hell.

*** It's okay to break the world, if you're going to keep your fiction short. Sometimes even if you're not.

** I've been thinking about this sort of thing lately. I was thinking about the Mary Sue scenario where the powerful fictional character shows up in the "real world".

Hate him or dislike him, Capaldi's Doctor would immediately recognize the danger he was in and how badly he was outclassed. The wittiest and most cunning of all of his enemies back home are only as sneaky as the guys who write television scripts here. He would immediately determine that he was outclassed by brutal savages and work to escape.

**** I'm excited about him, but I call the character Doctor Bag of Dicks. (Mind you, my name for Smith is "Doctor Shouty" based on his first seven or eight episodes where telling everyone else to shut up was a big part of how he solved problems.)

*** So we're just ignoring the fact that he has a nearly infinite capacity TIME MACHINE then?

** So the suicide bomber goblin petrifies everyone... and then blows up? Seems like step 1 is just making his job harder.
