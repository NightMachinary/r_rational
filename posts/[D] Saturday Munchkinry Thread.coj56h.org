Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have a store of energy. By touching an object and speaking a one word command, you can infuse it with some of this energy, which will be used to move said object in order to fulfill the command. The object moves autonomously; you cannot control it further than the initial command without touching it again and giving it a new command.

****** 20kJ is enough to, for example, accelerate a two-ton car from rest to jogging speed/just over 3 m/s. Or enough to slowly lift a 50 kg human (or shoes that contain one, such as yourself) up by 40 meters. You could increase the air pressure of a 320 sq. ft room by a quarter of a percent or so. You could bring two gallons of water to boil from room temperature.

At one joule per second of replenishment, you could do one of these every six hours or so. Or less feats more often. For example, a 150 ml cup of tea every seven minutes or so.

This is to say nothing of the implications that come with presumably violating Newton's third law. All sorts of our thoughts about inertia would go straight out the window.

******** For the car, I worked backwards and I think I forgot about the 1/2 term. 20kJ/2Mg = 1/2v^{2.} 20 J/kg = v^{2.} v = sqrt(20) m/s. v = ~4.5 m/s. You've slipped a digit in your math; a one-ton car at 3 m/s is 4500 J, not 45 000.

For the water, I searched the amount of energy it takes to heat water by 80 K, and found that it was roughly two fifteenths of 20 kJ. I converted it to gallons because two is a cleaner number than 7.5. I messed this up too, though. I just did the research again after some sleep and found a different answer: you can bring ~60 ml of water to a near-boil. Enough for a tiny spot of tea. 20 kJ = c m dT. 20 kJ = 4.184 J/gK m 80K. 250 J/K = 4.184 J/gK m. m = ~59.8 g = 59.8 ml.

Water is /very/ hard to heat up, and I forgot this. Air is easier: instead of 4 J per gram-Kelvin, it's 0.7. Assume an average room is 28 square meters and 3 meters tall, and the density of air is 1.3 kg/m^{3.} Google calls that reasonable for 20 C near sea level. You can raise that 110 kg of air by dT Kelvin, where 20 kJ = 0.7kJ/kgK 110kg dT. 28.57 kgK = 110 kg dT. dT = ~0.26 degrees Celsius. Maybe it's just impossible to heat things. I guess you could make a blanket nice and warm before going to bed.

In theory it takes no energy to levitate-- just force. If you commanded your shoes to levitate, the only energy expenditure would come from maneuvering, which you can probably do with your arms just pushing off things. That's probably the best use of this power, with all of its entropy-defying implications.

***** Okay, so full regeneration takes about 5 hours. Maximum energy release is comparable to burning half a gram of fat, or using about two AA batteries, or about three times the muzzle energy of an elephant gun. That could be useful for accelerating a few bullets without a gun or propellant using the "fire" command. Could also be useful for jumping up to 25 meters upward by issuing the "up" command to your shoes while jumping.

*** Before I munchkin, I want to point out that a one word limit is more arbitrary than logical. If the autonomy of the infused object has limited processing power, that should still allow it to follow multiple word commands. There are plenty of one word commands that are more complex conceptually than entire sentences. "Kill Bob by strangling him" has a smaller conceptual space than "Think."

Since corpses are objects, I could bring people back to life with the command "resurrect". (I assume that the infusion doesn't work on living things, since that's a little too overpowered)

Second, I could probably infuse my clothes to "Fly" or "Hover". If I couldn't control that, than it would at least be useful in certain scenarios.

**** You have a point on the one-word limit. Do you have any recommendations for a more logical replacement, or should I remove that limitation entirely.

You are right about it not working on living things. On the subject of resurrection, I'm inclined to say such a command would just make the corpse move and attempt to imitate the infuser's conception of the person whose corpse it is, without permanently resurrecting the corpse or actually bringing back the person who used to control it. Unless there's a way to kickstart life through just moving around the bits inside the body, I think out and out resurrection isn't really a possibility.

I like the idea of making the clothes hover/fly - though it would likely require stronger clothes than normal for them to be able to carry you for long, though I may be wrong about that.

Isn't there? We're all made of atoms, death is what happens when the atoms move out of a structure that allows life. If your ability does not depend on your knowledge of how the atoms should be ordered, and has the precision to move each atom precisely, there's no reason why you couldn't rewind a body's state back to just before it died (assuming you collected all the atoms that have left the body since death, which means that if people want you to resurrect someone they better seal that someone in an airtight body bag until they reach you.)

Similarly, I wonder if you could command arbitrary objects to "Rewind", to make them return to their state in some previous time. You're not actually causing time travel, you're just reversing the movement of the atoms, which doesn't actually take much energy. The only reason we can't do this in real life is because we don't have the ability to grab every atom and put it back in its original position. Your magical ability might get around this issue.

However, I'm more favorable to it being able to move things on an atomic level. Off the top of my head, this would let you control the temperature of objects by giving them a command like "heat" or "cool." It would also let you hypothetically change compounds into others, assuming you can find a one word command that could do that. Any other applications you can think of?

Telling a turbine to "rotate" "faster" "faster" "faster"... and so on for 8 hours a day would be incredibly lucrative, especially when A) they redesign a turbine for maximal moment of inertia since you can just arbitrarily make it spin and B) they can plop you in a warehouse literally anywhere generating clean power silently with no footprint.

***** Then it would depend entirely on what the scale is between real-world energy and your energy, and how quickly your energy recharges. Basically for the turbine idea and other free energy schemes, your power just has to be strong enough to make converting it into real-world energy economical. If it's on the low end of the telekinesis scale where lifting something like a car is difficult/impossible, then it's a no go.

If it's too weak for that but strong enough that you can lift, say, a few hundred pounds indefinitely, then you could make decent bank as a tour guide/remote photographer/disaster relief. Use a full-body harness and you've got a poor-man's flight by instructing it by "hover" "forward" "up" and such. Research groups would fight to contract you since it'd let them get samples/surveys of areas that are difficult to explore without disrupting the environment, such as caves, cliffs, reefs, etc.

******* Yeah, I was looking at the flight idea more and the physics gets a bit wonky when you start trying to define telekinesis in terms of energy rather than forces.

For example, holding an object stationary should not consume /any/ energy since energy can only be defined by a force acting over a distance. Therefore, it should be possible to make floating cities by stilling their foundations since without it being able to move (within your frame of reference) there can be no energy acting upon it.

If you avoid that by specifying that an object has to /move/ by your orders, then you still run into trouble with horizontal movement. Say you want to use your power to move a 1kg weight horizontally 1m (say by using "contact" on an object that far away), using all of your energy (i.e. making it move as fast as possible). since everything's 1, it's evident you exert a 20,000N force on the weight, accelerating it at 20,000m/s. From rest, finding the final velocity becomes as simple as =v_f=sqrt(2*a*d) =sqrt(2*20000*1) =200m/s=

And since the distance travelled is arbitrary, if you want it to contact something 1cm away, the force exerted becomes 2,000,000N, and final velocity becomes =v_f=sqrt(2*a*d) =sqrt(2*2000000*1) =2000m/s=and of course things get even faster at shorter distances.

In short, using units of power to define telekinesis makes some weird problems unless you include things like a cap on how much force you can exert with your telekinesis as well or you want railguns to be an intended use of the power.

** I have two characters that have an ability resembling magnetism between them. One is a normal human man with the squishness that implies. The other is a woman made of metal. The drag goes both ways it is just hard to notice it hitting her because of how heavy she is.

The force of the magnetism is strong enough to drag the man towards the woman at a fast but survivable (without damage) speed. The two always know the exact distance and direction between them.

I was thinking having the man grab others and use the ability to drag people to her in fights. Do you know any better ways they could Munchkin these abliltys ?

Another question is whether the force drops off quickly over distance like actual magnetism. If so, at what distance is "The force of the magnetism is strong enough to drag the man towards the woman at a fast but survivable (without damage) speed."?

I would have the man armed and armored to attack enemies directly rather than just dragging them to the woman. After all, if the force is strong enough to drag the man's entire body, it's strong enough to push a blade into an enemy. Have the man and woman run around trying to get enemies between them then activate their ability to have the man charge at the enemy with great force and with a blade pointed at them. If swordsmanship is a problem, consider wearing spiked armor.

And if it can't affect others, then most superpowers would be worthless. And with the hard cap of $500 a week, any superpowers with any sort of utility would be identical in impact.

I think the two Munchkins would be either:

Take advantage of the notoriety clause, and choose something that would maximize entertainment with minimal utility. For example, the power to allow people to experience books as VR or illusions that only make entertainment media better/immersive. This would be generating economic value, but the exception clause is super vague.

Maximize self-interest while minimizing its ability to affect others in any way, which would look something like you can freeze time in the "real world" to enter a separate self-generating multi-verse where you are all-powerful, near-omniscient, (can seed creations of universes, can live vicariously through copies/imitations of stories and self-memory manipulation, etc. etc.,) but you cannot bring out anything other than vague memories and exactly $500 dollars.

****** I'm actually not sure if there's a point to the time-delay, but just saying "create $500 worth of something" by definition makes sure you never create more than the threshold amount. Though at the same time, that's not really munchkinry-- you're using the power up until its stated limits, but haven't actually found a way to break it. If I were to munchkin it, I would focus on generating both economic and non-economic value, or value that would be priced into the economy as being worthless, but have some greater value. For example, creating life-bearing planets where humans can never reach doesn't create any economic value because there's no way for the economy to interact with that, but it would give me some peace of mind in case of an x-risk.

Actually, I think I just figured out the ideal way to use this power due to your post. Changing the /future/ is pointless because that generates economic value. But I can retroactively change the past as much as I want, because then that economic value will always have been there. I can say:

"my superpower is to automatically, passively, and retroactively make myself an omnipotent being who decided to live as a regular human until an automatic return to omnipotence triggered by gaining any sort of superpower, and then giving myself the chance to choose a superpower to recursively retroactively make themselves an omnipotent being who did the prior stuff so on taking the superpower I revert to my ordinary state as an omnipotent being."

The diction can probably be cleaned up, and have loopholes closed, but at this point I already feel like I'm writing yugioh card text so I'll stop.

Or you could go full Marxist, and say that since the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_necessary_labour_time][socially necessary labor time]] for the use of your superpowers is basically zero (because it takes you very little time and effort to use your powers), so you generate basically zero economic value any time you use it.
