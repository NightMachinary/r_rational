** My thoughts on the most recent page:

I'm guessing Jimmy's daughter was a Demon too, and is now possessing Heron. It doesn't seem like Demons can possess each other or the daughter would have overwritten Jimmy when she died instead of jumping to Heron (I assume she would have been closer to Jimmy, although depending on the geometry it's possible not?).

So what's going to happen when Jimmy dies? Seems like he should jump to the next nearest person, while meanwhile Hunter's agents jump "Heron" (do we know the daughter's name? I feel like we should but I don't remember it and I haven't found it yet). How long before Jimmy and Hunter figure out what's going on?

*** I feel like Jimmy will figure it out right away. Hunter will be a little bit slower - it probably won't become obvious until Jimmy's current body dies and Heron shows no change. Jimmy will make his escape, and have to rescue his daughter from the body of Heron and the clutches of Hunter's organization.

I am curious whether he'll see his daughter's head there or whether there won't be any difference - it's not clear to me whether Heron and Jimmy have ever seen each other outside of pictures and video. They showed a courtroom, but it was impossible to tell whether Jimmy was there. Given that he was shown reading the paper ... probably not?

**** Jimmy will probably end up possessing one of the guards next to "Heron", so it might raise some eyebrows when he doesn't immediately draw his tranq gun and shoot.

*** By the way, the main (only?) clue pointing towards this theory is that Heron was injured in the crash and now has "the mental abilities of a third grader". Jimmy's daughter is 10.

**** That's the only evidence Jimmy has. We also know that the story jumps from Jimmy wondering if his power is hereditary, with the last thing he says being "My daughter..." and then the next page is exposition about Heron. Not an open-and-shut case but it's definitely suggestive.

***** Of course "my daughter..." triggers the flashback to Heron, because Heron killed his daughter.

(On a meta level, though, it would be exactly the sort of complication that would make for a good story, so it's probably true.)

** I find it quite interesting, although its a bit weird to read a story featuring what is essentially a sociopath. I guess his death triggered a lack of care about other's lives, seeing as he is willing to kill anyone with abandon.

*** I think he might have been pretty messed up to begin with. It's not certain, but if you look at Hunter's research on him he doesn't seem entirely neurotypical. Like, his lifelong dream was to be an actuary? What?

** Oh man! I love Shiga's comics, but hadn't visited his site this year. I highly recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/Meanwhile-Pick-Path-Story-Possibilities/dp/0810984237][Meanwhile]] (I had to buy a physical copy) and [[http://www.shigabooks.com/fleep.php][Fleep]] is also very good.

This Jimmy is long on rationality and short on ethics. Looking forward to seeing where this goes.

...And the protaganists are both named Jimmy Yee.

** Story seems to just be getting into the meat of it. I'm curious to see what happens, but I'm more curious about the main character's lack of serious attempts at espionage, given he knows at least one person who seems to already have the wealth of information he seeks.
