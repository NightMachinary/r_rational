This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for [[http://nanowrimo.org/][National Novel Writing Month]], which started November 1st.

- Want to check in on making some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?
- Just need to vent about your story?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

** I committed the cardinal sin of NaNo: I refactored. My friends, my siblings-in-quill, forgive me, but know that though I have erred in my path I still somehow managed to keep hitting my self-imposed ~2k word quota, so I guess that's OK.

The reason why is simple: the narrator has not yet earned (narratively, not in-setting) what he received, and so I had to dial it down. This also gives a slower burn to finding out the deep dark secrets of the other people involved, which I think is good.

** Man this is hard. I very consistently hit ~400 words a day, but after that I just run out of steam.

In all fairness, that's close to 400 words more than than I get outside of NaNoWriMo, so that's something I suppose.

*** The first ~500 words are so are always the hardest for me, since I haven't really gotten into the flow of writing yet. 400 is still a reasonable number though, any writing is more than no writing.

** Welp, I'm updating NTBS. Heck, I'm writing and updating at the same time and keeping up my buffer of six chapters so far. I've never really managed that before. Feeling pretty proud about my newfound sense of discipline.

Of course, having slightly more free time than before may also have something to do with this <_<

** This has been a very hectic month for me, school-wise, as the majority of my projects and exams are happening right now. There's been a few times where I've had to prioritize school over writing (which I don't regret), and it completely kills my momentum. I'm probably going to take an extra week to finish at my current pace, not the worst though.

*** I've often felt that November is one of the worst months that National Novel Writing Month could have chosen, because it's prime school time, and in America, it's got Thanksgiving, which has historically been a productivity killer for me. Prioritizing school over writing is entirely sensible, especially if you're going to time-shift the writing to a better time for you.
