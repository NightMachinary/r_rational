Are roleplays/Quests considered here? Because I think that I know of one where "technological uplift of primitives", usually very cliche trope, is unusually realistic, despite existence if magic in the world:

** The Redemption of Christopher Columbus by Orson Scott Card falls into this category. I liked it.

** If you're asking about /just/ information, there's an interesting discussion on the topic in the wandering inn comments section of an old chapter. [[https://wanderinginn.com/2017/06/21/2-31/]][[https://wanderinginn.com/2017/06/21/2-31/]]

search for the word "infrastructure"

​

Otherwise, take inspiration from Africa. that's basically what a lot of the humanitarian efforts in that region are trying to do.

Ah. Isn't it annoying how cool plot ideas work out better in fiction than reality?

That's because the problems there aren't caused by lack of technology.. That's a silly idea. The problems there include corruption, war, late imperialism, lack of infrastructure, disease, droughts...

​

Believing lack of technology is the cause of Africa's problems is naive and uninformed to say the least. If it was that simple their problems would already have been solved.

Technology helps but it's not a magic pill with instant results.

At least, current technology is not.

***** I'm curious, do you really think that all of those problems would not be present in a situation where someone from our times is sent back to a more technologically primitive age?

Guilds would veto technological improvements. War would sap resources. Monarchs would not look kindly upon attempts to educate the peasantry. Infrastructure would not be present, either. Diseases would probably kill a modern person before they could even attempt to get any sort of technological uplift project.

****** That'd require a long answer, while I agree with some points and not with others, I do agree that it'd be harder than it's often portrayed.

​

I don't think they'd die from disease, unless they are a child or old. Most of these diseases don't kill healthy adults, at most they may incapacitate you. At a social level it's a big problem, not as severe for individuals..

​

Authority figures resisting it are a problem, but there are ways around it, like doing it in secret until you can oppose them, or if you are individually powerful in some cases.

​

Infrastructure depends on the scale you're dealing with. It's much more expensive and difficult to build roads in an entire country, than just to a village and its surroundings.

​

In africa we also face other obstacles like not being able to take control of the countries ourselves or installing a puppet without the UN blocking you. There's a big difference in what you can accomplish with direct control instead of needing to rely on a corrupt government to do it for you while deviating most of your funds..
