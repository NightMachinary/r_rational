Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I'm repeating my ask from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dy4bm2/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f80rvur/?context=3][three weeks ago]] in case anyone has more ideas. (See below for my reaction to the recommendations there.)

I'm looking for stories with realistic portrayal of skill acquisition (in contrast to the infamous "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkMontage][training montage]]"). Hopefully, focusing on motivation/[[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Tsuyoku_naritai][determination]] and overcoming setbacks.

The difficulty should lie in the training, and the path towards improvement known. The first part of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]fits perfectly, but then the focus shifts considerably. The best example I've found so far is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go][Hikaru no Go]]. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protector_of_the_Small][Protector of the Small]] is also quite good.

Also tangentially related are stories taking place in a learning environment: the first few books of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter][Harry Potter]], [[http://www.hpmor.com/][HPMOR]] minus the battles, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem][Anathem]]>! (minus the ending)!<. There was a post asking for academy-centered stories and I've tried [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17879100-super-powereds?from_search=true&qid=8LNZlfqkqx&rank=1][Super Powereds]] based on a rec there; but it's not quite what I'm looking for.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

- First rec was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lowell#Trader's_Tales_From_the_Golden_Age_Of_The_Solar_Clipper][Tales of the Solar Clipper]]/,/ and I've read the first two books in the series, about a newly-orphaned kid working his way up the position rank on a spaceship. The setting was perfect, but the story unfortunately disappointing. The first book started out promising, but by the second book it becomes apparent that the protagonist has no real obstacles in his path: he passes his qualifying exams without too much struggle, comes up with amazing business ventures, and have half the female crew fall for him by book two. It was a good idea, and I thank [[/u/iftttAcct2][u/iftttAcct2]] for recommending it.
- Second rec was the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0753FP6SP?ref_=dbs_w_series&storeType=ebooks][Cradle]] series, and I've read the first book. It's a cultivation story and was an interesting read. The main character had real struggles to contend with, and he approached them open-eyed and with resourcefulness. However, the focus of the writing is more on the adventure/epic-saga and of acquiring magic power-ups than on methodical skill-acquisition /per se/. This is not a complaint about the book, just a mismatch for my personal taste, and I would be open to reading more of the series if the focus is different in later books. Thank you for the recommendation [[/u/xamueljones][u/xamueljones]].

But there's still a structured curriculum for students with a clear path for advancement, and he just has to figure out how to get his freaky magic to fit in to it (after developing the tools to do so).

**** Holy fuck the RoyalRoad community's response to a kiss contained to a single paragraph is so incredibly disappointing. To summarize the handful of comments and reviews I was able to stomach before I stopped looking at them, it got a resounding "The minor romance subplot blindsided me, despite the previous straight one at the beginning being more sudden and awkward, and I don't believe or acknowledge that dudes can be bi, so I'm going to call the MC gay; I'm not homophobic, but anything that even acknowledges the existence of TEH GAY is completely unenjoyable to me, this was a good story until we were BETRAYED, 0/10"

This isn't just a few people, even though it's probably a vocal minority, it's practically 95% of the most recent reviews.

The characters are a liiiiiittle bit wooden, but I would figure the author is still finding their voice. They had a pretty interesting idea for a magic system; would be super cool (if complicated) to actually flesh it out, or even better, actually instantiate it in a game.

I'll rate the story 3/5, shows promise, and the RoyalRoad community 1.5/5, at least some of them care.

*** I'd recommend reading Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. It has a fairly good description and interpretation of skill acquisition. Beware of the 10k hours rule it's kind of bs and bad rationality, there's plenty of criticism of it online, but overhaul if you are interested in skill acquisition and what it entails it's a good book.

​

There's a cap on how good people can get at anything, and the effort required grows exponentially. People can technically get to the top 10% on X competitive field in less than 6 months without much effort, but getting those last 10% becomes exponentially more difficult and more often than not the potential benefit is not worth the effort.

​

So stories where the point is train / work hard and get better indefinitely tend to seem silly to me. There's a cap, and the benefits after a certain point aren't worth the effort.

​

In fact I'd much rather have stories with cool magic systems with power caps where conflicts are won with strategy, planning and tactics rather than X is better because (s)he worked harder for longer.

#+begin_quote
  The main character starts practicing tennis out of a worry for his health and physical aptitude. He slowly climbs up the ranks using a combination of analyzing correct body movements, his opponent's strategy, and continuous training. This training part is actually an important theme in the story - he very diligently practices everything until he gets it perfectly right, sometimes spending hours on a single movement. He's taking a lot of notes about these things in his notebooks, and it's clearly explained what he's supposed to accomplish by this. Also, I think it subverted the usual sport anime tropes by applying real-life logic. It was some time ago when I last watched it, but it might even count as fully rational.

Those she has spent time with (eviscerating) had no chance of drawing the real her out of the sociopath shell. She's already made her choice to hide behind the comfort/purpose of the shell, so it seems unlikely she'll change without external intervention. I'm feeling optimistic for the next few arcs.

Goal-wise, it seems deliberately vague. She's made some allusions to having big ambitious plans, but she's also a fan of Machiavelli, so wouldn't be surprising if she wants power for power's sake or to "maintain the state."

*** Have you read [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] yet? Sylvester has /some/ form of morals, but they basically boil down to "protect my friends, don't hurt children". Given that they're usually sent to some war zone or another as kid spies, that leaves him /a lot/ of leeway to cause mayhem with his social manipulation abilities and penchant for firebombing.

It takes a while for him to develop his goal, like more than a third of the book. The beginning is a bit meander-y and reads like a "monster of the week" TV show, but they do contribute to the plot and worldbuilding.

Stories about exploring interesting mechanics (probably, but not necessarily, magic). Something like [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break Them All]].

Stories that actively explore the nature of "narrative", or have other meta-narrative elements. Some stories that fit the bill here are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498][The Library Unpublished]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com][A Practical Guide to Evil]] (wherein stories are just part of the way the universe works), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth The Candle]] fits the bill to a lesser degree.

I much less strongly recommend Wildbow's "Pact", it's a supernatural action thriller where magic is strongly based on narrative.Theatrics, personhood, and consistency add strength to your actions and the rule of 3 is hugely important for example. I'm not a big fan, I prefer more concrete powers and the overall tone didn't appeal to me, but you might enjoy it. There's also a read along podcast, Deep In Pact, and the Pact audiobook project (not very far).

Seconding this half-recommendation. The mechanics of the world are fascinating early on, and a lot of interesting tools and symbolism are set up. Then you keep going, and going, and going, and realize you've been in this endless state of high tension/combat, for all 950k words, and half of the combat feels like an asspull to just let the story end. Really felt like a step back from Worm's structure and rigidity.

** It's very late and I'm writing this on my phone so please bare with me.

I just stumbled upon a short (by web novel standards, 42k words) fiction called Twin.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14758049?view_full_work=true]]

It's a cross between the universes of Hetalia and Twig. If you know anything about those two fictions, you can tell immediately that the product is going to be very interesting.

Hetalia literal country in human form plus Twig Mad Science gone extreme, spice it up with total war, and what could go wrong. Apparently, a lot. I personally haven't read or watched either of those but it's not needed beyond the bare minimum.

I'll leave the very excellent summary/hook and subsequent trigger warning here.

#+begin_quote
  Once upon the time, the United States of America won his independence from Great Britain.

  Once upon a time, the Crown Empire reclaimed his colony.

  Once upon a time, the Crown States of America put pen to paper and began to write.

  They say that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

  This is a crossover involving the characters of Hetalia in the world of the web serial [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]. It contains spoilers for the entirety of Twig.

  Twig contains many instances or mentions of war, violence, sickness, body horror, massacres, and various other terrible things I have likely forgotten to mention; while I will not write graphic descriptions of any of these, dark themes are present throughout the setting and will be present here as well.

I enjoy the MC actually doing the math and planning for skills, although I do wish he took things a step further and mapping out long term goals and trade offs. I generally appreciate cycles of unlocking something new, planning to exploit/max it, rinse and repeat, litrpgs tend to make these explicit but then the numbers eventually become meaningless. It reminds me of the early "The Gamer" manhwa.

I find it kinda shit how the big turning point of the story is essentially just a bug in the game. Like, it's really not something that should be happening in any system that is trying to be realistic, but here you have it as a central plot point. There's no explanation for the water clones making more chakra than they take to produce, it just is how it is. It's a huge spot of lameness in an otherwise brilliant story.

My logic for asking is that Iv'e been +lurking+ here long enough to have probably tried the beginning of most recommendations, and so I hope to find a hidden gem. For example, I find the beginning of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Amy]] to be unreadable, while the story overall is excellent.
