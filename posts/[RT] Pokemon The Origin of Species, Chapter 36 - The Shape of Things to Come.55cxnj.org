** Obviously the most important thing we learned here is that things can randomly become pokemon for seemingly no reason. We knew that "artificial" pokemon were a thing before this, but we were never told how they come to be.

What is the mechanism here? Did someone/thing do it on purpose or is it just a property of the world? This seems like something people should invest/bet a lot of money on studying.

My guess would be that it's not human-directed, but may be derived from human understanding (e.g. as some sort of residual effect of the psychic collective).

*** Do Porygon exist in this universe? [[/u/DaystarEld]] ? Canonically they were the first fully human created pokemon, and I've seen a lot of fanon of them being made by Bill.

I'm not sure how they'd fit into his taonomy of AI given that they seem not to be any more intelligent than a normal pokemon/animal, but they may have something closer to general intelligence than a narrow AI. The simplest version woul be for them to be programmed to simulate pokemon, like an advanced version of a furby or nintendog type thing. Though not sure why they'd be regarded as "pokemon" rather than software, given we dont regard our virtual pet programs that way. Or they couldspontaneously generate in virtual spaces in the same way beldum and other pokemon do

** I liked this chapter, although.

First! Positives! I think you portray character shock, surprise and confusion quite well. Bill's explanations of things are well done, easy to follow, and easy to reason with. The subtle "huh, this is weird" about the meal are good.

Second! Critiques! The hologram "tour" was a little weird, felt wedged in. If Bill really didn't care that much, there'd be more evidence of carelessness about the system. Like if you got in a Tesla and the seats were uncomfortable (not that that's true).

It's lectury. More tell than show, even in the location descriptions; which kinda feel like they're just there to tell me how much of a research genius the guy is.

Something feels less-than-optimal about Bill, in his actions with the world. Have you ever seen Elon Musks' bit about first principles? His example is batteries: he says (paraphrasing), "you look at the price of the batteries, and then you look at the price of the elements that go into a battery, and, well, they don't add up. Batteries are too expensive."

Then you look at Musks' current work, and you see: Well, you look at the dangers to the future of humanity, and you pretty much get: We're all on earth, and we use polluting energy. How do you fix this? Well, rockets. And renewables - specifically, for home power, and for transportation power.

There's this simple-direct-single-mindedness style that's present in that thinking that doesn't quite come across from Bill. Now, Bill's not Musk and probably doesn't need to be, but in my limited experience, people that ridiculously accomplished have some simple driving underlying principle - Stark is fiction because he's "just good at everything" and then picks up interests. Real people get that ridiculously good for a /reason/. What's Bill's?

This made me consider that I should have probably put some of Bill's characterization later in the story in here. The reason I didn't is because there's a particular scene I have in mind for when it's supposed to come out, but it would definitely make this chapter feel less "lectury" and make Bill more of a character, so maybe I should do it after all. I'll see if I can rework the later chapter, and if so, edit this one.

Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad you enjoyed the chapter despite its flaws :)

** In the future, when you have a lot of dialogue and lecturing to get through, I'd suggest splitting it up somehow. Maybe only have part of the conversation "on screen" and then have part in a conversation later where Red explains it to Blue, with some action in between.

Having it all together here breaks up the flow and makes it feel preachy.

Also, while the AI and Raikoth parts are interesting, I'd suggest shortening them (or moving them) if they play a major role in upcoming events, and removing them completely if they don't.

** Hey all, welcome back! This chapter took a lot of extra time to write due to research, and still managed to hit 10k words again. It's rather information dense in places, and there are some rather obvious shoutouts to specific people in our world. I tried to communicate their ideas as best I could, but am not an expert on any of the mentioned fields. More than any chapter before, I'm worried about inaccuracies I may have made in this one, so if you spot anything that's not right or is a poor explanation of one of the concepts, please let me know!

Similarly, I'm concerned that I didn't hit the pacing as well as I could have, so more than usual, all feedback and specific suggestions on the writing is welcome.

If you're interested in learning more about the AI topics talked about here, may I recommend [[http://www.arbital.com][arbital.com]]? It's a fantastic new site that attempts to teach high level concepts in easy to understand ways. Raikoth was stolen with permission from the great [[http://www.slatestarcodex.com][slatestarcodex.com]], which has dozens of top tier, informative, and persuasive articles on all sorts of topics. I don't agree with every conclusion its author comes to, but I always respect and admire the meticulous journey he walks through to get there, and always learn something from following along.

Finally, a quick note about my site: I've started adding blog posts here and there, on assorted topics. I don't have an RSS feed set up for it yet, but will soon: in the meantime, feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy!

** I really enjoy this story, but this chapter was.. kind of unpleasant for me. Maybe it's my personal preference, but the painfully direct real-world references are not doing any good for the world building.

In HPMOR, there are some direct references to psychology researchers, but they make sense as the HP universe is our real world universe+hidden society. Here it feels very out of place. Beside this, EY used his author notes for promotions and similar things, which I think is more appropriate. Heck those can be really influential, it led me (I have an incurable disease affecting my living quality) to sink in a lot of money into a certain medical company with zero gain. But this made me re-calibrate the trust I put in EY and not my judgement of HPMOR.

If you leave the promotion for your own pet projects or those of your friends in the story, this story might be seen in the future as something in between "The cool pokemon story where the author advertised these world changing applications before anybody ever heard of them". and "The cool pokemon story where the author advertised his crappy pet project that disappeared a few years after"

Wouldn't it be nicer to just be the "cool rational pokemon story"?

If the references are naturally part of the story, it works fine though. So mewtwo as the AI in a box and pokeballl-cryonics are both great ideas. For the ladder, Bill could rather just mention, his research suggests the damage done to human brains happens in the phase of getting out of the pokeball and not when they get in. Then it would be much more rational for Red to jump to his current conclusion without even questioning anything about the claim.

** I also think this chapter is bad, but not quite for the same reasons. Essentially, my suspension of disbelief no longer exists now. With this chapter you have /significantly/ attached all the extra context of AI and such to your story, even going so far as to name-drop many actual people. I guess that's fine if that's really where you intend to take the story, but it does make /Origin of Species/ that much less unique. Oh well.

The only other real problem is that it's just too long. No matter how much research you do, it's never necessary to include an entire constructed argument in the chapter -- especially when you are replacing a chapter of a long-running serial with said essay! The only justification for it to be in the story was for the last few lines, so that an AI/Pokemon can be taken as scary. But we already had the Mewtwo interlude, so you can guess where it was going a third of the way through this chapter, so the tension just falls away.

I wish I had something more positive to say. Your story is still very well-written and unique, just... less so, after this one.

** I think you should cut this chapter. It's too anvilicious.

They're going to be in bills house for a while, so consider simply splitting the content of this chapter up, across a few conversations. The pokeball-cryonics conversation should probably be part of an entirely different chapter, as an example.

No shame in doing some rewriting, and right now I don't think it's really persuasive for people who aren't already in the rationalist community core. Rationalist fiction should teach people, not just rationalists.

I could do that, yeah. I actually added the pokeball-cryonics thing last (obviously it's at the end, but I mean I wrote it in after the chapter was done) because I wanted to bring it up so Red was aware of it as a safety option earlier than usual, but I'll see how the next chapter at Bill's flows and shift it around if necessary.

** For some reason it won't let me drag to copy the text on the fanfiction site but I really loved the exchange when Red tried to pitch funding his research to Bill, and Bill denied.

It would have been cheap for Red to get a "technical" win on the self-imposed "funded through self-merit" by having Bill who's insanely rich and the stakes would be extremely low to fund do it.

But, Bill denies! And he doesn't mince words, but also doesn't slam the door shut in his face or admonish him for trying. Just that it has to have potential. So find something, anything and come back and show me.

And Red to his credit, puts in perspective. Doesn't cry or feel sore about it. He accepts it.

I really loved that. Plus the last chapter; Red being denied by everyone but a flimflam operation.

I really like Red. My guy is taking his lumps for real.

And not only that, it's mental masturbation about things that are only tangentially related to the story and almost completely unrelated to pokemon or its universe.

I can almost see the marionette strings stretching from your hands to Bill's here. This just reads like a "and then he handed Red a crisp $100% bill while the national anthem played over the speakers and a bald spearow swooped in a window and settled on Red's shoulder and cried a single tear" story.

If you want to talk about AI that's fine and it can probably be integrated into a great story in bits and pieces but I don't like how you stopped the entire story dead in its tracks just to lecture the readers about it and have literally all the characters in the chapter support one particular viewpoint (probably yours). I /agree/ with the views expressed in this chapter but I don't want to read what is essentially a circlejerk about it in the middle of a pretty good pokemon story.

This is a situation I've been in before with the second interlude, where everything seemed completely unrelated to the plot where it currently was. Rest assured, the information here isn't just for informing the readers or world building.

The problem of course is that putting in "foreshadowing," blunt as it may be, this early isn't always satisfying from a reader perspective. If I were writing this as a book, from start to finish, and then editing it afterward, I'm sure I'd make different choices about where the best place to put everything is.

**** As someone who doesn't know much about the issues covered, I personally found it a) interesting, b) necessary setup, grounding, and exposition for issues and events that will happen later on in the story, and c) an interesting dynamic to feature just Leaf, Red and another character, particularly with the addition of having Leaf take the academic lead rather than Red, as is usually the case.

I think the initial comment in this chain was overly critical and it isn't how I'dve put it.

People have different preferences. I do enjoy the action scenes and the battling as well and that is a big part of what I read for; but the world you've created has a lot of characters with different threads and plots running concurrently. A chapter like this is necessary and seems perhaps more 'unsatisfactory' read in isolation, than as part of a whole piece. In that sense, the episodic nature of publishing is working against you and against some readers' perception, rather than the actual content of the piece being a huge issue, I feel.

One place I've seen this done much better is /the gods are bastards/ (I don't think I'm spoiling anything in the following text so you can read it regardless of whether you've read that story). He's writing episodically, same as you, and had pretty large infodumps (ID), same as you. What I think the crucial difference in execution was that he didn't ID to foreshadow--he included elements of what the ID explained in the story, and their effects, without explaining them. Reading the ID then became a lot more tolerable because of the element of curiousity and because the reader could put all the pieces together themselves. You're handing pieces and promising a puzzle later while TGAB's author gave a mostly filled in puzzle and gave the final pieces in the ID.

It was also more organically done. The main heroes are in a school and the IDs were part of a lecture. It was very natural within the context of the story and provided a glimpse of the day to day life that is usually hidden from a reader. Obviously putting in /all/ the bathroom breaks and stuff would be very boring but putting them in every now and then actually grounds the story better and makes it more effective, IMO.

But otherwise, I dunno if it's just me rereading it or your edits but the chapter seems more palatable. Removing the clapping stuff definitely helped, IMO. It also seemed like the lectures were more evenly spaced out with scenery transitions, which also helped.

--------------

I first clicked your link to your website though and if you don't mind some criticism there....I tend to hate web design that interferes with usability and content in favor of art or beauty or creativity or whatever and I feel like that applies even more for a website meant to host stories rather than pictures or links. On your site the story takes up a relatively tiny column in the middle while pictures and the table of contents takes up the other half to 3/4 of the screen. I'd be normally too lazy to go to a different site if I'm already on yours but this bothered me enough that I went to fanfiction to read the chapter, where the text takes up pretty much the entire screen, as it should, IMO.

But I am just a random user on the internet so feel free to ignore all this if you want, I'd definitely understand.

  I first clicked your link to your website though and if you don't mind some criticism there....I tend to hate web design that interferes with usability and content in favor of art or beauty or creativity or whatever and I feel like that applies even more for a website meant to host stories rather than pictures or links. On your site the story takes up a relatively tiny column in the middle while pictures and the table of contents takes up the other half to 3/4 of the screen. I'd be normally too lazy to go to a different site if I'm already on yours but this bothered me enough that I went to fanfiction to read the chapter, where the text takes up pretty much the entire screen, as it should, IMO.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'm definitely not a web designer and I just focused on usability changes when making the site on wordpress (adding links from one chapter to the next, useful sidebars, etc). Some of those things are still not working the way I want them to, but I totally get why all the empty space might be annoying. I'll see if I can figure out how to change the text margins on the pages and posts.

Thanks for the feedback!

  "With the way inanimate objects gain sentience when they become pokemon, it's distinctly possible. AGI is frightening enough when it's just limited to what computers and machinery can do.

Chuck the whole chapter. The majority of it feels like it won't be relevant to the rest of the story (and the majority is not directly relevant to anything in the story thus far) and out of place and out of step with the rest of the story. Either than or split it up into bits and pieces and pepper it throughout the other chapters.

I acknowledge the effort it probably took to research and write it and I know it'd suck to have it all be wasted but I can't think of any other way to salvage the pacing to my preference.

  I'd rather see the trio of main characters level up over time and battle challenges within their realm of expertise than be slapped in the face with a super powerful potential ally operating 100 levels above them and dwarfing all the importance of the things they're working on and trying to accomplish.
#+end_quote

My view on this is a bit different. I /like/ the idea of showing that the main characters are currently dwarfed by the power and importance of some of those they interact with. It ups the stakes, and puts their struggles in perspective of what they're trying to reach. To be important in a world with people like Bill and Professor Oak and Giovanni in it, you need to do much more than just be a good trainer or researcher or journalist.

You've got to be the best at what you do.

**** I think what it all boils down to is that it was just too fast. There was not enough foreshadowing, the plot felt like it was going in a completely different direction right up until this chapter. It doesn't flow, it doesn't fit, it's jarring as all hell. It was too much too soon. A lot of that conversation should be broken up and put into different parts of the story. Maybe instead of Bill spontaneously inviting them via professor oak, have something in Bill's AI research get public attention, and Leaf goes over there to get the scoop, and Bill reluctantly lets her in because he thinks she might portray his work more reasonably than other journalists (since she knows nothing about AI research and has not formed any preconceptions, and since she's the daughter of Professor Juniper). In fact, i wonder what would happen if Leaf went in there and Red didn't. Leaf would have a lot of interesting things to say to Red and Blue and would have to try to explain it to them instead of Bill. Imagine if Leaf was the one telling Red that he wasn't aspiring high enough. I think that would be a really interesting conversation.

********** I was planning on it being sort of a constitutional monarchy but not? (Not sure the word for this type of government). Basically the structure is this.

The champion is the peace of the region he can do what he wants... Except if all four elite four members unanimously veto him. You become leader of the country by being the most powerful trainer in the world, which well doesn't always work well and you can always be dethroned at any point too.

Next is the elite four, which is comprised of all previous champions who chose to stay ruling the region. So in this case Karen/Will/Koga/Bruno all were once champions but we're dethroned by the previous person, when asked if they wanted to stay on the league they said yes and they became the highest spot in the league. This consistently makes the league have only the strongest trainers at the top and the weakest at the bottom in a society based around power.

The league is heavily corrupt though, and actually run by the likes of Silph and Devon who fund essentially the entire country and if the champion makes a move the dislike, they will pull out making millions of people lose there jobs and potentially even civil war. So the champion does nothing without there permission and even enforces shitty rules like 10 year olds can go out into the world overrun by dangerous super creatures, just so the can get more pokeball and other trainer related item sales earlier on and don't care if the child dies.

Rocket in my world is disbanded (takes a few years after G/S/C) and rocket was an evil organization but they did it for a good reason, rocket wanted to try and revolutionize the two countries and make them into a much better system, abolish the ten year goal etc. it's how they got so many followings, of course there leader was corrupt and they did evil things in the name of good and that's why they ultimately failed. However, there original goal was one that was great in the first place.

On top of that there's plenty of advisors an other things that work at the league that help the champion (especially if there a 10 year old somehow) and you do always have the right to deny the championship too! The champion also is the head of the police force (if there's a ridiculously strong trainer that can't be taken down by police) among other things that mean a bad and corrupt champion is that much closer to being a horrible dictator.

That's pretty much the gist of my politics right now and while the plot has started very basic (trainer travelling to get badges) it is going to turn more into just trying to fix the league and all the problems with it.

I do plan on sneaking religion and philosophy in here at times too though (even though I am not a religious man) along with common things like adaptions to types over years/genetics and of course it will also be dark as hell, since that's what Pokemon in the real world would actually be like.

I take my biggest inspirations from you (darker more realistic world) and the stories Regret (darker more realistic world with adaptions), Language of life (gets pretty religious and philosophical) and the author Renaerys who wrote both Triumvirate and Clash of Crowns (darker more realistic Pokemon world, has adaptions and is super politically based though more the latter).

** The part of me that has watched dozens of awesome fanfics slowly come to a halt is terrified that this fic will end before Red actually begins to use his psychic powers/ discovers something interesting with them; it feels like they are a plot point that will be developed, but so slowly that they won't really be relevant for a while.

I really enjoyed Misty's chapter; I feel like a psychic perspective would add yet another dimension to this rational Pokemon world. Are psychics treated differently in anyway? Is there any kind of discrimination against them? Are they allowed to gamble? How does any formalised testing work (for example any exams Red would have to take to qualify as a professor) if the candidate could glean answers off the person next to them? And given that psychics are extra vulnerable to dark type Pokemon, what provisions must they take to being completely incapacitated by a wild one, like Red was?

I really enjoyed Misty's chapter, because it began to delve into the world of Pokemon as seen through a psychic's eyes, and I greatly look forward to the day when Misty either becomes more integral to the plot, or Red's chapters can also possess that quality. I just fear that this fic, moving as it is, might be forced to abandon that plot element in favour of advancing the plot.

I guess I just hope that Red catching an abra will, in a way, kick start his psychic development.

And also a quick question; in Misty's chapter, I do believe she was only explicily said to communicate mind to mind with her Starmie, which is itself kind of a psychic pokemon. Can psychics in this universe not communicate mentally with non psychic pokemon?

And also, this chapter had a great ending. Hearing Bill talk about the dangers of a human level or beyond intelligent being with pokemon powers, knowing that Mewtwo exists, was awesome :)

Absolutely :) As shown with Misty and her starmie, a psychic and their psychic pokemon have a much stronger connection for training and battle purposes, and that's something Red is going to develop as he trains his abra.

**** Looking forward to this! Still not sure what to think about this chapter. I agree that it felt somewhat out of place, but that won't be clear until we know more about where the story is going.

I'm not super excited to see the story focus on Big Important Problems that aren't specific to the Pokemon world in particular. This story stands out because of the world building and because it adds a new perspective on a rich and interesting source material -- I'm not sure how novel a perspective you'll be able to provide if the story turns to an investigation of Artificial Intelligence.

This is the sort of chapter that /has/ to change things in the story, if we're meant to take the protagonists seriously. In a way it's good that they are being made to confront these issues (though I'm not sure how affected Blue will be) but a lot depends on what happens next. The world keeps expanding, and I keep getting excited about seeing Red and co. enter the game, but before they get a chance to take a tenth of a level in badass the world expands again.

Like, since the start of the story we've been introduced to the natural-disaster scale threats of the Legendaries, the existential-risk of Mewtwo, the machinations of Giovanni (which, btw, Daystar may have [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55cxnj/rt_pokemon_the_origin_of_species_chapter_36_the/d89wkj6][off-handedly narrowed-down a bit]]), and the world-to-universe scale problems of Artificial Intelligence. And yet, Red at least is still a total beginner, in terms of what he's accomplished and how much he's had to grow. His clever plan for catching Abra is exactly the sort of thing he might have thought up a couple of chapters into the fic, and yet it's a multi-chapter saga for him to execute it hundreds of thousands of words later.

This is a riff on the sort of complaint I've made in the past, and it's pretty unfair for me to bring it up again here since not much time has passed in-story since I last mentioned it. In fact, some of the things that happened in this chapter seem like clear steps in the right direction. Red's moment of surprise as he is told his ambition is too small felt almost like a third-wall-breaking wink at those of us who want him to hurry up and become like 3 times as awesome.

So why isn't this chapter exactly what I want? Well, for one, there's my comment earlier about how none of these issues are new, interesting things that follow specifically from the Pokemon world. Dealing with AGI-risk largely metaphorically by way of Mewtwo was a wonderful idea, but when it becomes explicit then we might as well be reading Vinge or Bostrom. There's also the hint of dissatisfaction stemming from the fact that Red didn't get to discover any of this on his own, and was instead just introduced to these issues totally by chance.

Then, and this seems to be a common refrain here, it's just too much. It doesn't look like Red will leave this conversation with a burning desire to become stronger and join the fray. He's been introduced to /too many/ first priorities. On the one hand it would be beyond embarrassing for him not to change his plans at all, but what is he going to do? Buy an Intro to CS textbook? In another context the Pokeball-cryonics idea could be a perfect hook, but I don't see the path forward from a dramatic perspective (though naturally one may exist). I hope he at least interns with Bill or something, or gives up on academia as a waste of his valuable time.

I can't help but expect that the story will continue largely as it has, in which case Red fails at Taking Ideas Seriously and from and out-of-story perspective why include the chapter at all? But if he does shift paths completely, I'll feel sort of mislead as a reader, or at least as if my time was wasted by watching all of his flailing thus far. Ideally there'd be some synthesis of his original (and eponymous) ambition and what he's encountered here, but I don't see it.

Despite loving this story, I'm feeling somewhat fatalistic as I write this comment. With the pacing and the update rate and the several plot domains and the three POV characters I don't know how Daystar will manage to leverage this chapter in a way that benefits the story overall.

I kind of want a meteor to hit or something, and then to see what Red looks like a year from now as he carries out sophisticated investigations on dozens of Abra and fiddles with Pokeball technology and never sleeps /because people are dying/ and pushes his psychic abilities as far as they can be pushed and keeps going because his boring human-level brain won't be sufficient for saving the world.

Or something similarly awesome. With nothing forcing him to be reactive, his continued failure to bootstrap himself into a position of leverage and agency remains frustrating (though, again, recent developments suggest improvements here). I kind of feel like I should stop expecting that, judging by his growth so far, but what is he even doing with his time? I know he's fictional and like 11, but I feel like /even I'm/ getting more done and learning faster than he is.

I do expect to continue enjoying the story though, and hope Daystar doesn't get too discouraged. This story is great and has been a source of much enjoyment and plenty of interesting and useful thought.

P.S. Red totally has a crush on Leaf and it's adorable. Look how defensive and annoyingly protective he gets when Bill is rude to her!

** I agree with a lot of the lecture stuff in the chapter but hate how it felt like an anvil being dropped into the story. We've got this guy who's super smart and characters who were contrary and questioning in earlier chapters just sort of nod along and get turned into subjects to be lectured at. Red didn't throw back even a single Steelman objection to anything he was being told.

Also if we're going ro 've lectured on AI there needs to be some kind of lead up in the earlier chapters. Something. It went zero to AI safety lecture in a paragraph like the author was thinking "I should name drop half the rationalsphere somewhere in the story. Lets do it all in one chapter"

Also the last little bit seems like a really massive hazard, pretty much bigger than all the rest combined.

** Since the AI stuff has already been discussed in detail I'l skip talking about that, but I do think you did a better job of fitting it into a context of other concerns than most LW inspired fiction does. Makes it seem less melodrmatic. And building up from oracle and genie helps. The raikoth science prediction market felt a bit shoehorned in though, unless it comes up later.

I was expecting from the previous chapters ciffhanger that youd use the mind swap with clefairy thing from the original, but i realise that would be ridiculously exploitable. The buildup of them entering the lab was very effective.

Bill's wealth comes from the storage system right? Unclear how he's getting that money since the trainers don't seem to pay for it. Is it funded by the regions? If so that would seem to require more interacting and negotiating with people than he is comfirtable with

His robots can make food and run the lab, but he hasn't got one to deliver soda to him yet? Or was that a pretense for testing their reactions. (Also, who has "a soda", don't people normally ask for "a coke" or "a sprite". )

I like that he tells them to wait a week. Shows realistic/sensible amounts of caution

He talks a lot about other people doing research in the things he isn't interested in, does that mean he's sharing his findings?

Yeah, that probably takes the cake as the single most ridiculous thing to show up in a pokemon game. And then it hasn't been mentioned in like 20 years of sequels, so I figured it was safe to ignore it as a thing... until the latest game references it.

Which is kind of annoying, but I'm still ignoring it until something of consequence happens with it :P Then maybe I'll come back and change things.

His fortune was built by coding a relatively large number of TMs, which he's still collecting money from, but the storage system is his crowning achievement.

He doesn't allow the machine too much generalized mobility: it can do things localized, but it can't move things from one place to another as part of risk reduction. Also I didn't want to make up a name for a soda, so I figured maybe he just doesn't have a lot of variety in his fridge and is happy with any :P
