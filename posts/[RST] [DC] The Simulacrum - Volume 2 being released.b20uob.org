** The contents page is here ( [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum]] ). It's about a guy who wakes up in an anime world and has to come to terms with his new existence, mostly by poking and prodding wherever he can to see how this new world ticks. Lots of rationalist actions as the MC investigates where he has ended up.

The characters are well written, and manage to acquire a depth and life of their own despite being based on classic anime tropes.

Overall I'd definitely recommend reading it. The prologue are a bit like an outsider interlude thing, and don't read like the main story much at all though, so don't form your opinions just from them.

*** I quit reading it when a friend told me it lacks the "exploit" part of rationalist entertainment fiction. That is, what we recommend most on this sub isn't really "realistic" fiction, it's fiction where the protagonist can use his or her knowledge and thinking to come up with an exploit - and it actually has to work at least some of the time.

â€‹

Another keyword is "agency". This is one problem with the Sufficiently Advanced Magic book series - the protagonist hangs around so many arbitrarily powerful beings that he can do very little to affect the course of events, except when they let him.

**** It sounds like you want a protagonist who can 'metagame' his setting. Have you looked into SI's? Those normally have MCs who gain power by exploiting the setting due to meta knowledge.

***** I have. And most are good. Just pointing out a common pattern in 'bad' fics. In these, the author pens a character who is basically just along for the ride. Maybe 'realistic' but not engaging. Most of Harry Potter is this way, as a side note.

*** Yeah, despite acting with rationalism and logic the MC doesn't become a robot, which is nice.
