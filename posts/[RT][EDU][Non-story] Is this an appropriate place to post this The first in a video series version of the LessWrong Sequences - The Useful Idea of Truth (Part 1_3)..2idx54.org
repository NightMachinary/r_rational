** Inspired by [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/eqn/the_useful_idea_of_truth/][this post]] over on LessWrong, as well as popular Youtube educators like CGP Grey and CrashCourse, I thought I'd do my best to teach the lessons of LW in a more memorable and shareable way. Let me know what you think, good or bad!

**** I didn't have the skill. It's not a flattering answer, but it's the most true answer.

The Useful Idea of Truth has a lot of great art, and reusing the ideas (and in some case the images themselves) from that post really helped me make my initial progress in the video. I've learned a lot from doing that, and am now more comfortable with Photoshop, After Effects, and my own artistic ability. Future video will likely feature much more visual assets completely original to me, and will be prioritized more so by importance, than by difficulty.

Originally, The Useful Idea of Truth had even better art. Then someone noticed that the human figures were all male and instead of changing some to female, we got those ugly stick fiures :(

I'm sure you know this, but there are probably many, many cliparts under creative commons licenses that you could use.

Oh, and I already said on LW that I don't like the text, though it seems nobody has joined me in that, yet. Maybe you can create a poll the next time you post a video on LW, asking if people would prefer not to have all spoken words as text in the video.

+Is there a source for this, and do the original images exist somewhere?+ ([[http://lesswrong.com/lw/eqn/the_useful_idea_of_truth/7jwy][Source found before posting,]] though I wish I could still see the originals.)

Then you'll be happy to know that the most consistent criticism of the video has been in regards to the text, so that is what I'll be thinking most about moving forward. I do worry that fans of this style of text are merely being quiet, because disliking specific things is more comfortably talked about than liking specific things, but not so much I wont tone down or even remove the text in future videos.

**** Generally speaking, the recommended reading order for the Sequences starts with /Map and Territory/, since it introduces a lot of the concepts taken for granted in /Mysterious Answers for Mysterious Questions/. The first post of /Map and Territory/ is "The Simple Truth", but, since that's a long-winded story that kinda beats around the bush, a lot of people recommend Eliezer's more recent "The Useful Idea of Truth" to get the same point across. It also has the added benefit of coming prepackaged with nice visuals that can be used for animations.

OP is following this route through the Sequences.

** 1st: Yes, I think this is an appropriate place to post this :) Thanks for sharing, I enjoyed it! One bit of constructive criticism for the future videos is to try staggering your words a bit less, the way Stephen Fry lets the words follow his natural speaking pattern rather than what appears to be you trying to speak in the order the words appear, like so:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7E-aoXLZGY&channel=RogersCreations]]

2nd: Would you mind explaining which programs you used to make this? I've been thinking of making book review videos in this style and this is exactly what I had in mind for the way the words would appear on the screen.

*** Thank you for the feedback. I expect my voice to come through more naturally as I gain experience, and is something I'll be sure to maintain awareness of. I only hope to one day have a spoken voice as beautiful and compelling as Stephen Fry's.

I used a combination of Photoshop CS and After Effects CS4, and [[http://vimeo.com/26079113][this tutorial]] is essentially comprehensive information of everything I knew when I started. Specific stuff, like keyboard shortcuts, how to organize my workflow and work area, specific plugin settings, and render options are things I learned and looked up as I went. If you're making something like this I'd be happy to answer specific questions as they arise and I'm available to do so.
