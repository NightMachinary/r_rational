** Well that settles it: Ginny's another Riddle. (Note to the author: by having Pomfrey /literally say it out loud/, you make it look like you think your readers are idiots. With the revelation of the wards malfunctioning, the foreshadowing was /already/ about as subtle as a punch to the face.)

Was Pomfrey this competent in HPMOR? Her behaviour here strikes me as out-of-character, but I could be wrong. Her brusqueness initially reminded me of Amelia Bones, but I guess it's more likely that this is still polyjuiced Moody.

Also, Lesath. Also, DracoxGinny. This is gonna be interesting.

*** As time passes, the polyjuiced Moody theory only grows in strength. Speculating about small children secretly being dark wizards is pretty typical Moody.

*** It took me about 20 minutes to even understand your chain of logic. And my response is no. Just...no. It's way more plausible that Draco thought of his father because he's still not used to him being dead, and Tim is someone whom Draco now corresponds with regularly in the same way he used to do with Lucius.

** I think the concept of "magical gender" really needs to better defined and elaborated on. What is "magical gender"? And why would it have anything to do with dorm assignments?

Also, how might magical gender actually be related to "mental gender" or "physical gender"? Why is there such a strong correlation, according to Madam Pomfrey? One possible explanation is that "magical gender" isn't really a gender, but rather your "magical style/personality", which determines the kinds of spells you prefer to cast and are good at, and the strong correlation to actual gender is because differences of both "mental gender" and "magical gender" are influenced by the learned and inherited personality differences between people of different genders/sexes. The correlation between "magical gender" and "physical gender" could just be because people with a certain "mental gender" tend to have the corresponding "physical gender".

*** As I understood it "magical gender" is just the binary magical answer to the question if someone is male or female. Because that is exactly what is needed for the dorm protection magic. The barrier can't let you half-pass or 60% pass. It lets you in or not.

** I'm really enjoying the story so far, but I'm finding the chapter length to be a real issue. It's just my personal preference, obviously, but the writing in general seems rather short and abrupt. Not a lot of exposition or descriptions. Yes, we're all familiar with the story, and its characters, but a little more exposition wouldn't hurt here. Of course, I could be wrong. *Or Voldemort*. Who knows?
