Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Also, some collected photos from my recent trip to the east - this time, it wasn't for work, my husband took me on a "surprise" trip for our anniversary (I knew about the trip, but he didn't tell me where we were going). We saw [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Rock][Wave Rock]], which is one of our major tourist attractions, though it IS kind of in the middle of nowhere. Lesser known, we saw [[http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/records-supplements/records/mulkas-cave-aboriginal-rock-art-site-its-context-and-content][Mulka's Cave]], which has aboriginal art (hand prints) and was honestly a far cooler experience because I have seen lots of cool rocks but I've never seen /ancient cave art/ before!

** Just want to throw this into the void: I wish English had a formal gender neutral noun for people. I wish I didn't have to guess the gender of someone to be polite by calling them sir/ma'am, or to even refer to him or her without calling them "it" which implies non-person to me.

I haven't been corrected on my guesses yet, but I do realize the people I guess wrong on are likely to have many others guess incorrectly also which is depressing.

If the parallel here is sir/ma'am, just use "you" and be polite about it; if you mean third person, "they" is pretty commonly accepted except by prescriptivists (and people will understand what you mean even if they don't like the way you say it).

** I don't know /how/ I got there, but I ended up reading a few articles about the Catholic tradition of praying the rosary. I knew about it in broad strokes - you recite sets of prayers for 15 minutes to an hour, depending on how hard core you are being - and for each prayer, there's a "mystery" you're meant to contemplate (basically, parts of the Jesus story), which are grouped into thematic groups.

When I was reading it, something woke inside me. Not in a "I am saved" way, but in a, "I was raised Catholic and thus have a cultural connection to this practise, and it reminds me of my unsuccessful attempts to meditate" - and I had a quick look around the internet and it seems there's no real attempts at making the rosary habit secular the same way the buddhist meditation traditions are secular. Not that I'm sure that even if I did rosary practise instead of meditation practise it would have gone better - maybe it would have, as reciting the words might have stopped my mind wandering? idk.

I don't really know what I want to say here: I was half-expecting an atheist blog circa 2009 having a secular rosary that included 20 "mysteries" like "Charles Darwin looking at finches" and "Neil Degrasse Tyson pwning noobs on twitter", which is totally not what I'm really wanting. Probably "mysteries" more on the line of, "what made me happy today", "who needs my help?", "what should i try and do better", "was i wrong about anything today?" - you know, kind of useful, generic, gratitude journal/self-help stuff. And I'm not even sure I really want it. Or would use it. Or would benefit from it.

But damnit I kind of want to pray through a whole damn rosary just for fun even though I know one hail mary in I'll be feeling super embarrassed even if I'm doing it alone and silently, not to mention bored. And like, what would even be the point? It's just a kind of interesting tradition that I never partook in.

Plus, I'm a person who doesn't participate in the group "ohm" at my yoga class because its origins are as a worship word and that makes me uncomfortable - and here I am wondering if I should spend an hour praying in a language I know from a tradition I'm familiar with?!

Anyway, hopefully by writing it out, it's out of my head and onto the page, and I'll never have to think of it again.

*** Maybe try to emulate the things you think are valuable about praying a rosary without doing the any of the mystical parts that you don't believe to be as significant. I've often heard writing a journal every day is a good chance for self reflection, and can provide a useful log of things happening in your life that you might want to look at later in life. The thought processes of meditation don't necessarily need to be accompanied by mysticism or special poses, it could just be a few minutes you set aside every day to think over a list of topics you want to cover, and writing those out is a fairly simple extension that allows you to also write about more mundane things going on in your life.

Alternatively, you could emulate the yoga tradition more, and spend half an hour on a treadmill doing the self reflection thing. Good for your body similar to yoga, a good habit to get in even divorced from any self reflection, and the rhythm might aid in the meditation portion.

Don't pray/mediate on stuff like that!

Meditation (or at least the way I do it) is meant to help with working through personal issues. Think about what sort of pressing stuff you have to do, your goals and dreams for the future, or something that you find very easy to spend a lot of time thinking about without making much progress.

For example, I found deciding on a new job to be stressful, so I meditated on what I was looking for and how I wanted to do it.

People seem to think that meditation has to be used for deep and profound things like philosophy or spirituality. But meditation is a tool to help you work through personal issues and mental tangles.

I find meditation works best with a dash of self-centeredness.

*** Something similar happened in brazil this year. Truck drivers blocked every road and interstate because they didn't like fuel prices. The government just waited them out while people in the interior went without gas and fuel, in the end the protesters gave up.

​

Here it wasn't a tax increase people were angry at though, just the free market and high inflation, they wanted the government to subsidize fuel to make it cheaper.

​

If I was the french gov I'd just let them burn themselves out. It's either that or increasing salaries, inflation and damaging the euro, which seems unlikely to happen because of the protest. It should happen, but if they do it as an answer to the protest people will begin to exploit it, which is a bad idea for the gov.

More evidence for Macron being awesome, I guess.

Overall, I agree that there's a part of the population who will just hate Macron as a representation of the system, and will find evil subterfuges in anything he does, and giving these types of people an inch is definitely never a good idea.

On the other hand, I have a lot of hope for the planned consultations with the Gilets Jaunes. Some of the few dialogues they've had with the government so far were described as "productive", and including popular feedback in political processes is definitely something I want to see more of, especially if it tries to leverage modern communication technologies.

**** The Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests, for the vests that you wear on the road that every single French driver is required to have in their car) is a protest movement, that began with a petition posted in May 2018, but really gained visibility with country-wide protests on November 17, two weeks ago.

The protests are ostensibly in reaction to the planned raised in gas taxes, which itself was a campaign promise of most 2017 presidential candidates, and is required by European accords on CO2 emissions, but everyone agrees that it's mostly a "straw that broke the camel's back" thing. The protests rally thousands of people, especially from the countryside, who are in dire economic situations and feel that the government is letting them rot to line the pockets of the super-rich. The protest is essentially motivated by the same factors that got Trump elected, if I'm being uncharitable (and I am, screw these people).

Part of the problem is Emmanuel Macron's actions and reforms have given him a strong identity, for some people, as the champion of the super-rich establishment, and as an elitist proto-king that thinks himself above the lower classes. Some of these actions include:

- Replacing the ISF by the ISI, both of which are wealth taxes, which is often described by the opposition as "removing the ISF", because why be accurate when you can slander politicians you don't like?

- Telling an unemployed young man that he should try to work in a restaurant (the guy had a horticulture diploma), saying "There's a lot of demand, I could cross the street and find you a job", which was about as well-received by the public as you'd expect.

- The Benalla case, where a cabinet aide tasked with logistical planning for Presidential events was accused of getting undeserved privileges, including the right to bear a weapon, highest-level access to the National Assembly, a police car and uniform, a diplomatic passport and a 300m² apartment (personally, I think the affair was way overblown, many of the claims made against him turned out to be false or made without understanding of presidential organization, and the actual violations were either minor or bureaucratic in nature). During the scandal, Macron made a semi-private speech where he denounced the "republic of fuses" (as in, patsies), and said "I'm the only responsible, let them fetch me!", which was taken as an insult and a mockery given the constitutionally unassailable nature of the president.

- Various other tax increases, I'm not going to go over them all.

- Also, he was elected with a fairly narrow First-Turn margin: 24% against Marine Le Pen's 20% (for comparison, Hollande had 28% to Sarkozy's 27% and Le Pen's 17% on the First Turn), which means a lot of people feel he was elected by default.

The protests last week-end were mostly peaceful, with Macron making a speech where he said he wouldn't "confuse the vandals with the legitimately angry people", and promising the organization of an open dialogue for three months between delegates of the Gilets Jaunes and regional and national administrations.

The dialogue has been unsuccessful so far, because the decentralized nature of the movement, and it being built on a distrust of authorities, means that the Gilets Jaunes have been unable to agree on representatives, and the people who did designate themselves as representatives received threats and ultimately didn't show up.

This week-end's protests were worse, with a severe country-wide increase in vandalism, thefts and violence, despite better police preparation. Also, people were pissed that Macron went to the G20 in Argentina instead of staying in France, because who cares about international politics anyway? It's not like taking care of these is the job of the president or anything.

--------------

Anyway, my personal takeaway is that, while I'm sympathetic to the protestors' plight, their movement represents everything awful about the opposition to Macron; most of the protestors seem to think that a second French Revolution will somehow fix all the economic problems the country is in right now, that the President should somehow negotiate with them without them ever designating a representative (because presidents /love/ basing their economic decisions on chats with angry mobs!), and that Macron will always be a corrupt autocrat no matter what he does or says, even when he gives them attention, legitimacy and consulting power beyond what any other president before him would have done.

tl;dr: Everything about this is awful, and this situation represents the most destructive, toxic, intellectually dishonest aspects of national politics. I kinda get what alexanderwales was pissed about now.

Yeah, French politics piss me off now.

** I don't know how I've gone all these years without knowing this. I was super into the Matrix movies when I was 13/14, and I've been aware of the existence of the band Röyksopp for at least 6 years (never listened to a full album of theirs until last night, but had a few of their songs on rotation on my iPod at various points over the last few years).

Y'know how Don Davis did the music for the first Matrix, and then for the sequels they switched it up and the music was made by Don Davis and Juno Reactor in collaboration? Juno Reactor's job was originally offered to Röyksopp. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmatItacEvM&list=PLG5oQ5ad8TJlY0uIyjEsYN6IhNJ1eJYuG&index=1][They'd only released their first album at that point]], so the sound of that album has to have been what the Wachowskis originally wanted to go for with the score of those movies. It's a strikingly different sound than the videogameish club music sound that ended up in the final soundtrack.

So, I'm wondering if anyone thinks their impressions of the Matrix sequels might've been different if the score had sounded more surreal with Don Davis / Röyksopp instead of sounding like a dance club with Don Davis / Juno Reactor.

***** In my experience, being (successfully) nice to people prevents them from raising their mental defenses. I've also seen a lot of cult-like behaviour geared around "If people are telling you you're wrong, then they're manipulating you" (like Trumps calls of 'Fake News'), which means that being (unsuccessfully) rude to them will entrench them further into their belief.

I don't know of any studies exploring different approaches, and only have anecdotal evidence (which is certainly biased). One such: I was having a discussion with someone on this sub earlier where we disagreed on whether to respect someone who we know nothing about other than that they identified with an idea/cause/movement. The KKK came up, and I doubted to myself whether I would treat them with respect. Then I saw someone [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw][do exactly that]] to great success. In this scenario, there's little doubt that if he attempted to be rude then he would've failed spectacularly.

I am really interested if you know evidence supporting rudeness as an effective tactic since within my bubble I'll be unlikely to see it pop up. You mentioned it working for you; was that you being rude to someone else, or someone being rude to you? I'd like to know more about these situations if you are willing to share, so I can make informed opinions.

****** First of all, thank you for this non-judgmental comment! I don't mind sharing at all.

The first incident was when a buddy of mine started taking really dubious pills to increase his height. He wouldn't listen to family or other friends, even when literally everyone was against him taking the pills. He was completely fooled by the quack who sold him the pills (350$ for a month's dose) who had successfully convinced him that people who were telling him to stop were out to get him. Once I found out though, I started taking cheap potshots at the lack of the pill's effectiveness and how he might as well pay me 350$ for nothing. It was basically a constant bombardment from my side every single time we hung out. And after a few weeks it worked!! Although he told only me that he'd stopped and he was too embarrassed to admit it to anyone else.

The second one, I can't fully call a success although being rude to the person (self-diagnosed ADHD, taking pills) and making the MLM comparison in my parent comment got him to really open his eyes for a minute. I could see him processing the thought, 'Wait a minute, I think he's right'. I still remember the look on his face when he stopped for about 3 seconds after making the connection to MLM. Unfortunately, he blocked the thought out I guess and isn't willing to accept that he doesn't have ADHD. Also this only worked because a mutual friend got hamstrung really badly by an Amway like company and she still continues to peddle their product. I will continue trying and probably use rudeness+humor to pry him loose.

I'm not surprised that people find this behavior assholic and I'm actually glad they perceive it that way. It always invigorates me to take up a position not commonly held.
