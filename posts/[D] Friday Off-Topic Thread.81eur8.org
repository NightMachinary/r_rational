Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I saw The Matrix again yesterday, and I was once again impressed with how good it is. I think if I could choose to forget something in order to experience it for the first time again, The Matrix would be very high on the list.

Also, there seems to be a lot of fodder for a rational take on it. The theory that it's nested simulations. That the machines are actually benevolent caretakers of humanity, or that humanity created The Matrix originally as a paradise for themselves, and that the machines had some sort of value drift.

The most fascinating part to me is how it sets up hackers as being these truth-seeking mystics looking for a greater truth. I can't imagine that The Laundry Files by Charles Stross wasn't based at least in part off of that.

*** I'm one of those people who never liked The Matrix, even the premise didn't really appeal to me, but instead of whining about what I didn't enjoy about it I'd like to talk about a tabletop game and actual play podcast with a similar premise that I do really like. It has more of a fantasy flavor than sci-fi, but I think that just allows for even more imagination. No kung-fu, though.

[[https://www.montecookgames.com/category/invisible-sun/][Invisible Sun]] by Monte Cook Games has similar themes of Gnostic philosophy and uncovering mystical enlightenment that gives you cool powers, but instead of a ruined Earth ruled by machines the real world is more like Welcome to Night Vale. It's strange and surreal, oddly humorous and subtly horrifying, and the heroes need to explore its many wonders. From a game design perspective, I think it's a really interesting system for emergent storytelling.

** Anyone have recommendations for good and or rational Star Wars fics?

I finished The Waves Arisen yesterday after going in blind, and while I don't dislike it, it read as a draft of "I want to hit these plot points, and fill in the rest later." Everything just felt very rushed, with basically no stopping for character development or character interaction between the fighting and munchkining. No spoilers, but a big example is after Hinata's fight with Neji, she kind of just never mentions it again. Hinata started as a rather shy and withdrawn person, and ended at very nearly the same place. Basically the same for Sasuke, although he did change some.

Also, everything seemed to just... Work out extremely well. Naruto is smarter, sure, that's the premise. But shadow clone is also categorically better as well, same with water clone, same with Sasuke's powerup he got early on. And that would all be ok, but the antagonists aren't scaled up to match. They're mildly better than in canon, but nowhere near an intelligent Naruto with broken abilities.

I'm not saying that the entire work is bad, it's not, but a lot of the plot could be changed for the better while keeping many of the same elements that make it enjoyable now. Many things could be fixed by simply slowing down the pacing in certain areas.

*** I believe one of the taglines joking proposed for Worm as it was coming out was "And then it gets worse".

But honestly the story has many ups and downs. And there are parts of it where it feels like Taylor and those around her do gain their footing for a little bit and things somewhat calm down. But for there most part there is a steady decline here, not necessarily always for Taylor herself, but as a general tone for the story.

So I guess what you have to ask yourself is if the high points of the story you've seen so far are worth experiencing the low points that you've seen. Because there's more of both coming, with less and less time for stabilization as things head towards the end.

I'd say it's worth the ride, but if it's honestly depressing you then maybe the story isn't for you, or maybe you'd do better to take a break and read something else for a while before coming back to it.

*** Are you picking up on how unreliable the narrator is? There's a lot of moral questions being asked, there's a lot of exploration of different moral codes, and sometimes it's subtler than you thought at first read. You are at one of the lows in the story, depending on your relative values of various taboos, and thoughts on foolish utilitarians robbing banks, there are lower lows. Have you tried listening to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HydKjQMzJ8][we've got worm]] it's a podcast that comments on the literary aspects and often gives Taylor a well deserved hard time for the bad rationalizations she gives. I don't know if it will make it more or less fun for you after you see someone discuss it, but it was added value for me on a reread and it pointed out the little harmonies in the story that argue against the nihilism.

**** ? I am confused about that last line. Taylor herself is not very nihilistic it is the world she lives in that is. I also understand how her robbing a bank is not very utilitarian but that is not one of my problems with this story. I just feel like their is no hope in this world. It does not matter what taylor does it will never come to anything good, and that is why I am having trouble reading more of the book.

I think I want escapism when I read books, and I never want to escape to this world.

NINJA EDIT: I think the only way this would work for me would be if taylor was a tinker instead. This would allow me to see taylor evolve or something. Allowing me to have hope that she could prepare and possible take down the bad guys. All of this was dashed when Pan went into the prison.

***** I am unsure how to answer this without spoilers. there's a lot of world development you are missing, but it's wildbow, every chapter is rife with world development.

I will say there is a list called the skitter facts on TVTropes and all of them are arguably accurate, but yes the Earth bet world is burning down and I'm not going to spoil the ending things, but thing escalate, and keep escalating, but not so badly that there isn't a sequel. Do we get escapism in it, sometimes: the next Arc [[#s][skitter fact]] , do we get real adult fear in this story, boy howdy yes we do.

To go by analogy I read Charels Stross "laundry files" if you aren't familiar with the series it's a bit of a Cthulhu comedy/adventure/horror with each book parodying the style of some popular genre, where the horror factor keeps ramping up, and now the stars are right. The next book in the series is really going to hurt, so is the next book in the [[https://www.tor.com/2015/08/27/how-baru-cormorant-would-overthrow-emperor-palpatine-kill-voldemort-and-stop-sauron/][Baru]] [[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/seth-dickinson-answers-5-questions-monster-baru-cormorant/][Cormarant]] series but they are cool stories with well intentined deeply flawed people/monsters trying to do what they think is the right thing.

*** I quit at the same point you're at because I just couldn't take how harrowing it had become. I preferred watching Breaking Bad because, as dark as that show is, the tragedies are more cathartic and the protagonists are unlikable enough that you don't feel as bad when they suffer.

I /loved/ Worm before Leviathan showed up, I put it up there with season 1 of Daredevil, but by the time the Slaughterhouse 9 showed up reading it just became painful. I've heard Wildbow's other work is good, Pact is at least horrifying from the start while Twig is actually about heroes fighting evil and winning.

If you want more clever superheroes that isn't nihilistic, I recommend the anime My Hero Academia and the book Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain. Both have their dark elements, but know how to appeal to the fun escapism of people with power using it to help others and fight injustice.

**** Honestly, twig and pact are both way darker than worm. Pact gets bad enough that people who liked worm were complaining about the darkness by the end of it, and describing the protagonists of twig as heroes is really stretching it. Worm is amazing, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. There are several other excellent, but not as dark, superhero fictions out there. It's definitely recommend Superpowered's, if you like worm but would prefer if it was like 3 steps less horrifying. ([[http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds/]]). Citadel is also decent, but I think it got abandoned. I've heard legion of nothing was good, but never really got into it.

Superpowered's protagonist is pretty average, definitely not rational, but several other characters, including one of his friends and a few teachers are very intelligent. One of the big themes is that a lot of the more powerful heroes optimize their powers to ridiculous degrees, often spending years really understanding how to use their abilities to the fullest. The school's headmaster in particular has munchkin-ed his initially relatively mediocre ability pretty hard.

I don't mind if you spoil the second half a bit by saying it does get to that eventually (I'm kind of expecting it to at some point), but if you disagree and think that even at the first half it's darker than Worm, I'd be interested in why.
