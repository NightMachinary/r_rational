** I have mixed feelings about the whole time-travel direction, since it means that the plot would be less defined by Hermione's agency and more by having to deal with her future self --- along with possibly having to mess with her past self to create a closed loop --- and also I am not sure what it entails for Hermione's interaction with her peers and teachers: how much meaningful character interaction is possible if she is constantly scrambling to stay sane and in control of her thoughts and actions?

That said, these are worries about the future of the story, not its present or past: I've very much enjoyed what's been written so far.

*** I have the /very/-high-level plot worked out, which is to say I know where I'm starting and where I need to end up. I just have to work all the middle parts out sensibly.

One hint is a lot of my titles tend to have double meanings (e.g. "Independent Study", because that's what Hermione is literally doing, but also she discovers someone else has been doing, with her body) - and that goes for the story title as well.

So what you're saying is that the person in Hermione's head is Kyle Reese (*Reas*onable Explanation)?

***** I'm not saying that's /not/ who it is. Though I would've expected Hermione to have noticed she was wearing stolen Nikes by now if it was.

** i love the idea of young hermione doing mental battle with her older memory packet. for all that young-hermione is outgunned, she can go to the library and look up new information without limit. Older hermione may or may not be limited in information acquisition, but certainly has constraints w/r/t goals and objectives. All that young hermione has to do is learn and attack, while old hermioine has got to curate the timeline while simultaneously fending off a fast-learning 11 year old with (tentative) access to their whole shared history.

cool.

*** It's decent. A lot will depend on where it goes, and RobinDrew is better at some aspects of writing than others, but I'm continuing to read updates as they come out.

Hermione's definitely more ... autistic? ... than she has been in other fanfic incarnations, and she leaps straight to the heart of the issue on very little data, but it's consistent and it fits with her emotional core (i.e. she doesn't read "weirdly smart" so much as "smart and weird").

Plot is a little chaotic and confused, but I think that's on purpose, with explanations forthcoming (hopefully). Nobody else has really been a character yet, so far.

** So, potential idea:

Hermione's Future Spirit is possessing only one side of her brain: The right side, the creative side. The side which controls the left side of her body.

She gets use of the whole brain while Hermione is unconscious, but otherwise cannot access the parts which allow the use of words or language, explaining her non-verbal communication. Easier control of the left arm explains why the notes were written with that arm.

*** Britpick - 'bleachers' is a US word, I'd call a large set of bleachers a terrace, open air stand or a grand stand. Open air stand is the most strictly accurate, but grandstand is a quicker way to make it clear what you're taking about even though they usually have roofs of some kind.

**** Thanks!

I wondered about that, but I was too lazy to go look it up in the books. It's invariably "seats in stands" or later just "stands" throughout the UK editions, so I'll go with that.
