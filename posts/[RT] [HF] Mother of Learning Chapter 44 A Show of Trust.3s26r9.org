** Interesting chapter, good to know specifically the time limit for the memory package. I hope Zorian will focus on that from now on.

His motivations for avoiding Zack make sense, but I can't wait for them to go all out again the invaders. That battle will be epic!

** Seems like we're heading towards a pretty lengthy timeskip. Zorian confirmed in this chapter that he's not going to meet with Zach until he finishes his projects, and he seems to have a lot on his plate at the moment. Golems, Xvim, study group, Tavin's suggestions, aranea treasury/secret research, making friends with everyone in his class and mind training.

I think we're going to get a skip of about a dozen restarts, which is when Zorian will feel comfortable enough to meet up with Zach. Either way, it feels like this arc will come to a close soon.

Prediction: Similar to how the first arc closed off on a climactic note and with Zorian leaving Cyoria, I think the same thing will happen again. Either Zach tries to attack Zorian (thinks he's Red Robe), something major in the mind packet or Red Robe discovers Zorian's identity. After that, we get Zorian traveling again, but on a far greater range (the Highlands, the other continent, Silverlake). This is were we will start getting answers.

**** OH GOD TIME DILATION IN A TIME LOOP

Why the hell didn't I think of that? That would close the gap between Zach and Zorian pretty quickly; Fuck Zoiran could just set the dilation to infinity and let himself die of old age.

This also takes care of the issue with the loop being finite in length; only problem is where he can get his mana from. I'm assuming because the facility is located so close to the Hole, they have some workaround?

  The logistics of time dilation are much more complex than people usually posit, though. I cringe every time someone write in a scene where a character spends a few months in their personal dimension (double cringe if they spend all those months alone; how are they not insane by the end?) like it's nothing. Later, when Zorian actually gains the capabilities to do that, I intend to explain why Zorian can't just casually abuse that idea.

And regarding the social deprivation: being alone for just several weeks shouldn't be that bad --- he could make a pattern of dilated and normal stripes of time in the same reset.

Yeah, he'll define the background rules of his world in a way to support his opinion on the matter, even if it /is/ possible to profit from this ability in many other worlds. I am not even saying that using such an ability wouldn't rise any problems at all, but, at least to me, those would be /interesting/ problems to solve.

He has definitely expressed an interest, but we don't know where it really ranks comparatively. He's had to concentrate on accessing the memory packet since before he knew there was a time dilation room, and almost exactly since he found out there was anything there from the Matriarch's message in the first place. Obviously he has to put the memory packet above all else at this point as well, if he ever wants to access it. Plus the memory packet itself might change his plans completely.

In fact, considering the way the chapter ended, I think we might see him list out what his priorities are after he accesses the memory packet.

************ By this chapter, yes. But between when time dilation was introduced and now, he had enough time to investigate how TD worked. If he had prioritised that learning about TD is more important than his regular to-do list bulletpoints, by now he would've at least figured out whether or not it's a viable option --- and recovered his opportunity costs if it was.

************* He has mainly been concentrating on learning mind magic so he can access the memory packet. The only reason he has anything more than vague rumors "there may be black rooms somewhere," and the possibly not related gate things, is because he was practicing his mind magic and it was vaguely close to his time loop question, he almost didn't notice it.

He couldn't have used it until he accessed his memory packet anyways. He didn't really have a good place to start. Who knows how long he would have had to look before making any progress, whereas training other things helps now, which he /does/ need.

** As great as this story is, I was a little dissapointed that we didnt get any more emotional reactions/development in this part. I understand how much this story is the "anti-relationship", trying to make its plot the focus as opposed to a vessel for character drama, but Tavien and Zorian have a complicated enough history that I expected Zorian to actually feel things and care about this situation beyond the tactical. Its not bad at all (and he does have some emotional moments) but it still frustrates me.

** This will be/was copied and pasted onto several sites, just in case you've seen it before. Anyways.

I have a couple of guesses on things that might happen. They have verious amounts of evidence, so hear me out.

With the whole Silverlake thing happening, at some point Zorian will kill the Grey Hunter. Several things could happen: 1. Silverlake could just take the eggs as a quest item and help Zorian in some way. 2. Zorian just gets the eggs and uses them in some way. 3. Silverlake takes the eggs and uses them to help Zorian. Let's get into the consquences of each one.

1. She could teach Zorian more soul magic, give him soul sight, or just help him in some way. If this happens, it's mostly just speculation. Actually, there might be a way to give him soul sight that would work. More on that later.
2. The eggs could be an unknown way to get Soul Sight. After all, few people kill grey hunters, let alone get their eggs, so they could be really useful in something. They're magic, so maybe Soul Sight. The magic is weak evidence though, nothing was said about their soul, except for shifting. More on that later.
3. Pretty much the same as 2.

So she could help him get soul sight and Zorian might become a shifter. Let's look at other evidence first.

There has been a ton about the time warping rooms. Nobody103 has confirmed that something will happen, but Zorian won't abuse it for training. I think that Zorian could get the dirge larvae for the soul sight potion, put them in a room, get a chrysalis, and then get Silverlake to make him a potion. Boom, soul sight. It's doable, realistic, and there's enough foreshadowing for it. Why would Nobody103 talk about Soul Sight, the moths, the rooms, and Silverlake if not to have him do this? I think it has a good chance of happening. Maybe Kael told Taiven about the moths and soul sight, and Taiven realizes what Zorian could do with the time travel. But first, there's something more important, the packet.

Zorian needs to learn how to open the packet and fast. You probably don't remember, but the Rose Labyrinth Dwellers offered to teach Zorian, saying, "You will live with us for the duration of your lessons. You will eat and sleep in our settlement, hunt with our hunters, patrol our territory with our scouts and otherwise act as a member of our web." Zorian rejected that, thinking about Aranean food, for one thing. But you know what would allow him to accept that offer? If he were an aranean. Or an aranean shifter, anyway. It's highly like for him to end up being a shifter, anyways. He's investigated it a lot and is befriending the daughter of a tribe chief. He could get access to the ritual. And if he can't, he might be able to get an aranean soul transformation potion from Lukav (it would happen if he failed to get the ritual). The weirdest part is whether he would be a male or female aranea. On one hand, he might not be able to bond with a female, because they're sentient, but he might not be allowed to do stuff if he were a male aranea. Weird.

I also think the Silver Wolf is a shifter that lives in the mansion in the middle of nowhere. Maybe Zorian could get the ritual from him.

That's it, I think. Let me know of your thoughts.

*** Nobody103 posted on Patreon and Blankdom pm'd me (likely didn't see Nobody103's post). Here are the replies and stuff, to have the speculation in one place (or two, cause I also posted it on the [[/r/rational]] subreddit).

---> Nobody103

Obviously I can't respond constructively to most of this speculation without giving out some massive spoilers. A few things though:

#+begin_quote
  I think that Zorian could get the dirge larvae for the soul sight potion, put them in a room, get a chrysalis, and then get Silverlake to make him a potion. Boom, soul sight.
#+end_quote

That would require a time dilation zone that would compress an entire decade (more, really) into the span of a month. Giving something like that to the protagonist would pretty much destroy any tension in the story, don't you think? It would trivialize 99% of the challenges I could throw at him.

#+begin_quote
  And if he can't, he might be able to get an aranean soul transformation potion from Lukav
#+end_quote

The smarter/saner option. Becoming a shifter of a sapient creature has all the problem associated with soul-bonding yourself to something sapient, except it's much harder to fix things if something goes wrong. Also, an male aranea shifter would definitely have a male aranea alternate form, which would be mightly weird and awkward to the aranea. Using a transformation potion/ritual would let Zorian pick the 'correct' gender as well. Though it would require an adjustment period before he could move and deal with his new body.

#+begin_quote
  Let me know of your thoughts.
#+end_quote

There you go. I know it's not very substantive, but it's as much as I can give without being too spoiler-y.

---> Me

Thanks for your response. Just FYI, your story is absolutely amazing. I just wish that you could post more and that I had money for the patreon. I should be able to buy hardcover once you publish, though. I definitely will. This story is too amazing to not buy a physical copy. The three weeks are killer. Keep up the good work.

The room would certainly be way too trivial. After all, the story shows how important time really is, and giving him a room... I do wonder what will happen with that room, though. Can't have everything be too easy, and it must cause some problems.

Remember something when you tell your readers stuff: what's left unsaid is just as important as what is said. I can tell that he likely won't soul bond with an aranea (said), but he may soul transform (said/unsaid). You also didn't say that he won't get soul sight (unsaid), nor did you mention the eggs (unsaid) or Silverlake (unsaid), so he might actually get soul sight. There's definitely more with the Silver Wolf and the shifters (unsaid), so... Despite mentioning in the story somewhere that Soul Sight is op, I really think that Zorian might get it.

Don't feel too obligated to respond to the above paragraph. After all, you didn't mention whatever you didn't mention before for a reason, and I'm not asking anything new, so you don't need to say anything else. I'm just excited for Taiven to push the plot more with the next post. And I love your story. Man, I really need to see if I could support the Patreon...

On a side note, I saw someone write that Taiven could write a letter to the future from herself. I'm sure you could come up with a reason for that not to work, but I'd still like to see that happen. I also read that Zorian should look up some sort of potion that prevents him from falling asleep (or something along those lines) to allow him to wake up instantly in new restarts. I do like the charm in the current way he restarts, though.

You know, I'd like to see more people get in on the time loop (preferably like Zorian). In particular, it would be amazing to have Kirelle actually learn magic, but having everyone else being able to start instantly would be amazing. It would remove Zorian's novelty, and thus would likely happen at the end of the story, before the loop stops. I predict that there is a special gate that activates the spell (like a self-casting object) close to the weakening. I don't know if it chooses randomly, or a particular activates it on them. I also think that Red Robe (who's probably not Daimen, because Red Robe is immature, but maybe) might have access to the gate (and thus "soul kill" magic) or just learned time loop soul magic somehow. He might be able to loop, not because he has a tag, but because he has magic to send his soul back before the loop ends (it would sort of hold his soul in stasis, waiting until the restart). Maybe not though. I also think that Zorian might ask his parents if he could come with them to Koth to see Daimen in Arc 3.

Sorry for just spouting out speculation. This is all I could think of, for now. I kinda just needed to write it down. I hope you got over your dumb cold.

Greetings, I read your comment/review on chapter 44 of Mother of Learning, and would like to point of some things, that you seem to have missed.

It's highly like for him to end up being a shifter, anyways. -- This theory is debunked as of chapter 39, search for soul marker, if you don't want to re-read the whole passage. -- Meaning the only real way is either transformation potion.

As for the Soul Perception tidbit, it would depend on the conversion rate of the chamber. Ref: Chapter 16 -- It takes 23 years for the moths to mature, and the last time they emerged was a decade(10 years) ago, so he'll still need 13 more to get one. Then he'll need to make the potion within a few days, in not only one.

---> Me

Thanks for pointing the stuff out. I posted it on the patreon and he replied, just fyi.

I remember the soul marker (I just reread the whole thing 2 or 3 days ago). I wouldn't say the theory was debunked for him being a soul shifter, just unlikely. They might need to investigate the marker's activation conditions first, which even if he doesn't become a soul shifter, might end up being why he contacts the tribe. The only thing is, there isn't much foreshadowing on the potion, so I'm still banking on the shifting (or at least that being the reason for the help). He also elaborated on the transformation potion, which means it's not a spoiler, which means he might not do it. He might though, cause it makes sense.

Nobody103 said that having the room go so fast would be too op, so it's unlikely for that to happen, anyways. It may be that the eggs are another soul sight potion, though. To me, then, that's what's most likely on the soul sight side of things. As a side note, I wonder if that has the same problem a shifting potion has.

With all these things, something will happen, but I'm not sure what. Nobody103 wouldn't have put in all that he did if they weren't for a reason. The tribe especially is coming back up, but also Silverlake and the grey hunter.
