Seriously, this means she can reshape massive amounts of terrain very quickly. Valleys, mountains, creating or filling in mountain passes. She is become the changer of worlds.

In the real world geography controls far more than people realize. Cat doesnt need an army any longer to destroy empires. She can fill in harbors to uselessness. Reroute rivers important to trade. Bury or steal forests.

I am in awe of the possibilities...and amused at the idea of calernian farmers trying to irrigate with a river filled with underdark leviathans.

Akua's separation of personality might be the means of betrayal, though. Cat's questions might be being asked to one and not the other. I doubt Diabolist would tip her hand so early, but maybe Akua would.

It's generally agreed on this subreddit that Akua will take the Mantle of Winter and we'll get Cat with a Name again, while I tend to agree, Cat is still clenching her teeth about Liesse.

My pet theory on how her plot with Akua is that at some point their will be a merger, similar to what happened with the mantle, she will somehow merge with Akua and gain all her memories, which would make her better at magic and politics, both of which she dearly needs, but not change too fundamentally as a result.

I have had this theory ever since Akua managed to weave herself into the mantle, it might however happen in such a way that conforms to the above suggestion, Akua makes off with the mantle and to get it back Cat has to take her in with it, this could result in a name, something defined by the act of bending the power of a god to your will, rather than just having it.

Heirophant can use the magic to imitate a god's (lower case intentional) action so long as he has /witnessed/, my idea for cat is more domineering than that, she would be an actual threat to all Gods, including above and bellow, and I say this because the story has to have an end, and the most conclusive end I can think of is if Cat manages to tell the Gods to go fuck themselves and leave her continent alone, a conclusion in which she would need the ability to kill and utilise the power of gods for, because the best reason I can think of for them to leave her and her stuff be is if they are /terrified/ of her.

  Great Strycht had proved as much of a wonder as Great Lotow, in its own way.
#+end_quote

Have we just skipped over what happened in Lotow then? Because things were not settled there, and the exact way things shook out seems important to know. If Cat's going the classic evil route of kidnapping people and forcing them into her magically bound army, then the details are quite important. Especially if it's literally the first time she's doing it. Outside the serial it lets us know what to expect with this strategy when she does it off screen later on, and inside the universe of the Guide it determines how she's able to move onward to Strycht and the inner cities and is a fairly important turning point within her own narrative.

Like, are the sigil holders still in Winter? Did they all humbly agree to sign up? Did some of them wander off in search of a way out? Did they try and fight Cat? What's the deal with the seven demigods who were individually a threat to Cat and had a great reason to band together?

This chapter has no information, except that Cat's gone to Strycht, and a passing comment that Soln is now with Cat.

What? When did this become an option? First she's apparently secretly had the ability to use her portals to cut through things the whole time, and now she can drop mountains on people and steal cities? This is a crazy amount of power escalation coming out of almost nowhere.

Not too mention that she's apparently now capable of using Absolute Positioning, which was set up as an incredibly difficult, dangerous task, without Masego. She's not even done any practice or training that we've seen.

I mean, Cat's gotten a lot of power ups over the series (an awful, /awful/, lot) but this is one of the biggest so far and has also happened without any commentary or explanation?

I couldn't disagree more. Cat having a dramatic showdown with the 7 leaders would be important if it were the climax of the arc. But the 7 were explicitly said to be small fish in a bigger pond. Cat found a winning move without drawing her sword, and the implications of her choice are shown in this chapter. We don't need stilted dialogue where the antagonistic characters assert that they have no choice but to comply, followed by more stilted dialogue where Cat agrees.

Imagine that we got the update that you're asking for, where Cat pops in to Arcadia to check on her prisoners. Maybe it takes a few tries. Eventually they submit. This might be an engaging sequence of dialogue or torture porn but is there any plot-relevant information that we wouldn't otherwise discover?

***** The entire point of the Under Dark segment is Cat picking up an army.

We just brushed over her picking up to seven demigods who were each an individual threat to her and increasing her military power almost exponentially.

How did Cat get them? Well,at the end of 67 she set up a classic evil situation - with monologues and death traps she walked away from and truce-breaking and ultimatums about joining her - by stranding them at the edge of Winter and then somewhere before 68 Soln (and maybe some unknown number of the other 6) was inducted into Cat's peerage.

Why did the sigil-holders give in? Maybe they got cold and asked to be let out? Despite how environmental hazards far deeper into Winter have never been shown to worry even far weaker beings than these seven Drow? Will was fine in Arcadia for months back in book one, Black was using Arcadia to portal around with in book 2, Juniper and cat debated sending normal soldiers into Arcadia in book 3, and then Cat, Hakram, and Masego (as Apprentice) walked to the heart of winter without so much as mentioning the cold.

That's without getting into all the ways /out/ of Arcadia that have been set up: with permanent gates existing , or using sorcery, or finding a fae to do it. Or how vulnerable Arcadia is to stories and the set up Cat is handing them on a silver platter.

But let's move on. Cat's also leapt from struggling against the weakest sigil-holder in a nowhere-city to the point where she is now single-handily sacking an entire city three times the size of Lotow with powers that have come out of nowhere.

She's had the ability to open gates for something like a book and a half now, and has never so much as mentioned the ability to cut things with them before 67. Was she always capable of this, but somehow never thought it would be useful before now? Has she been secretly training off-screen and just never brought this up or hinted at it on-screen? Did she accidentally cut something recently and go "wow, this is neat, this sure would have been useful previously"?

And she can also now pull off absolute positioning without either Masego or the Observatory and can drop volcanoes and mountains and lakes on her enemies, despite how difficult this was shown to be previously. Huh?

And not only was there no build up or explanation given to perhaps the single greatest expansion in Cat's power, she's not even mentioned this increase in her capabilities after the fact? Apparently no-one is surprised by the incredible power-up Cat received?

And then there's the story stuff going on here, which I've touched on. But is Cat going Classic Evil now? Monolouges and death-traps are just the tip of the iceberg. She's also enslaving a race to serve in her evil army, is chaining monsters that have both motive and means to kill her if the bindings break, is relying on the single point of failure that is the oaths, is using doomsday style weapons, is creating a court were previously she was worried about narrative consequences, is talking about pulling a dread Empress Sinastra, etc.

You can say that this a Evil vs Evil fight and so the rules don't apply (note; this was mentioned in an Extra chapter, which exists outside the story proper), but we've seen Evil on Evil before with Cat/Black and Akua and stories were critical at literally every juncture of the fight. And, perhaps more importantly, /the actions now are ones that will have consequences later/. Does cat really think that the single point of control over the monsters that hate her, the oaths, isn't going to fail at some critical juncture further down the line?

You wanted to talk about character work, right? Cat's been against classic evil methods for the entire series - why this change in motive? Cat's also been against slavery for the entire series and just recently had a big talk about how she didn't want to kill the Drow prisoners she took - why's she now okay with enslaving an entire race? Seems like a big change of heart.

It's easy to say that the plot details were glossed over for characters development, but what happens with the plot is hugely important in defining that character development. The details matter. Hell, knowing how Cat felt when Soln and whoever else bowing down to her matters a whole lot.

We spent a couple of chapters building up just how strong the weakest sigil-holder in Lotow was, and how the 7 leaders were individually a threat to Cat even before they had a great reason to band together. Then they were put in Arcadia, where they had a whole host of options for getting out, and probably weren't in an incredible amount of danger themselves.

But leave aside the more logistical concerns and look at the narrative: Cat is abducting people, forcing them into magical service, and I'm pretty sure we've had chapter quotes about this exact situation. She was also monologuing about her inevitable win before locking them in an "inescapable" trap and walking away. Knowing how this played out is important if this is going to be standard operating procedure for her, exactly so it can be glossed over in the future.

Cat, hakram and Apprentice were walking through Arcadia back before they had a deal and /while activley at war with the fae/ just fine, and this was when Cat was the squire and far weaker she or the Drow are now.

Will survived wandering around for six months on his own, back when he was roughly equal to cat circa book one.

Black, notable in part for his relative weakness, used it for fast travel.

And Juniper/Cat's only concern about sending scouts into Arcadia back at the start of book 3 was time dilation, and they talked about how they'd send an army of normal soldiers in if they knew it wouldn't escalate the situation.

And Arcadia itself is so vulnerable to stories that Cat literally just had to say, in a hesitant voice, "you'll never get away with this" to utterly upend a fight with a powerful Fae who was easily destroying her. What do you think happens if one of the Drow, after being monolouged too and locked in what's meant to be an inescapable death trap, say "I will escape and have my revenge"? Because personally I think things might start looking like the Count of Monte Christo.

****** That's fair. A few of the top of my head:

- Will went into and out of Arcadia through a set of permanent gates that exist

- Black and Warlock used Arcadia for fast travel. We don't have the full details on this, but to my best knowledge it involved Black summoning a fae to creation to open a gate into Arcadia, and then Black later finding one and coercing it to open a gate back out of Arcadia

- We've seen magical rituals involved in moving things from creation towards Arcadia

- Book three we find that any high-ranking fae can open a gate out of Arcadia. Which brings us to two sub options: 1) Eat the faerie and take it's knowledge and the Secret of Gate-Making. 2) force it to open a portal with their faerie-queen crushing strength

And what are the chances of any of these things happening, you might ask? It's Arcadia - chance doesn't mean anything.

******* Good post. I was stuck in the mindset that Night can only be used for specific spells, but there are non-Night methods of escape. (fwiw, I think that they can only quickly learn skills from other Night users, since a given fae has no Night to harvest. but your point stands regardless)

I think your objection can be handled by thinking as a DM. Sometimes plans just work. The potential failures described above require that Cat's court encounters and is defeated by the 7 Mighty. This is a direct inversion of her power, which would be an unfair trick to use as a DM against a player. Alternatively, they require that Cat knows less about her domain than her prisoners do. That is plausible if her victims were Good, but this is evil-on-Evil combat. Narrative causality doesn't interfere in quite the same way (see: Akua & the monster thread last book)

Your concern is justified, but not damning imo

#+end_quote

Actually, Night can be harvested from non-Drow too:

#+begin_quote
  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

  Narrative causality doesn't interfere in quite the same way (see: Akua & the monster thread last book)
#+end_quote

This is funny, because I was going to point to the Akua fight as an example of the significance of narrative fights in Evil vs Evil fights - literally every segment of that fight revolved very explicitly around stories. There was the monster/trial/pivot layout, the mentor in danger, Black's (seemingly) dangerous last-minute gamble, Akua's story based triumph over Cat in Arcadia, and then finally the villain's monster breaking its leash.

And now here we have Cat making decisions of the sort that appear in chapter quotes (hell, I think at least a few of those decisions actually /do/ mirror chapter quotes). She monologued about her inevitable win, she locked the Drow in what she thought was an inescapable death trap, she's making an unwilling army of monsters bound to her though magic, she's using the titles that she was afraid would have story repercussions, breaking truces, using doomsday weapons, and so on. This is the sort of classic Evil behaviour we've been warned about.

And, back to the Drow, they were locked in /Arcadia/, the place where story triumphs over all. I mean, look at what Black said last time Cat dragged someone there during a villain fight:

#+begin_quote
  “Arcadia was a mistake,” he told me, returning to ignoring Akua. “You won a greater comparative advantage in capacity, but in Arcadia narrative matters most of all. You lacked the necessary weight to win, Catherine. In the future, consult further than Hierophant. His lack of interest in stories is a glaring weakness.”

Yes. On creation side. On Arcadia side she's got to put it somewhere it can remain as a lake if she wants to pull it back out again. Or, if she wants to drop a mountain on her enemies, she's got to open a portal to a specific mountain, and then above her enemies.

This is all approximately as complex as what she was doing in the Battle of the Camps, where she opened a portal to a specific lake and then roughly above the armies she wanted to destroy, and that instance was treated as a huge deal.

He also explicitly used magic to help the process along. And saying that Masego can easily be replaced is something of a leap when he's one of the most powerful mages around and he's doing one of the larger rituals we've seen in the series, with Cat temporarily embracing the perspective of a god

I'll agree that if anyone could replace him here, then it'd be Akua (even without a proper name of her own)... but there's also no evidence that Akua is doing that? And if she was, then it'd be a fairly huge deal anyway, if for different reasons?

******* From what I understand The absolute positioning was a big deal to do because of the size of the gate. It was so large that is created a swamp after a few seconds, 5 iirc. They did this not by creating a traditional gate but overlaying the fae over creation, which I guess is an entirely different thing than gating.

Draining the drow lake isn't as difficult, just put one portal in a really deep spot and the other end over a natural basin in winter.

So I guess what I'm saying is that Cat can do the same thing by herself with her new control and grasp of her powers, but at a different rate than absolute positioning. The math and time required to drain a province sized lake over several days is a question of fluid dynamics that I can't answer, but in a word, absolute positioning just makes it happen near instantly by comparison.

But put it out on flat land and it's not going to form a lake, so much as spread out into a very thin marshland-looking thing - and that's not exactly conducive to getting the water /out/ with portals, because it wouldn't drain neatly. She just talked about the difficulty of pulling all the water out of the lake due to irregularities in the topography, and that's happening in what was already the basin of a lake.

I mean it could work, I guess, as there are a lot of unknowns in play here. But it doesn't really matter either way? My point is that Cat can can apparently do absolute positioning on her own now, and what happens with the lake here doesn't really change that either way when she's talking about dropping lakes/mountains/volcanoes from Arcadia onto her enemies.

I think a big part of the reason is that Cat tends to avoid /plans/ full stop and go for a more improvisational approach to problem solving.

Although the specific ones I was thinking of were the more recent plans from Juniper and Black against the Crusades, which had big obvious failure points that triggered nothing (even though there was explicit discussion of the need to avoid such plans right beforehand).

"How did that happen?", you might ask. Maybe they got cold and asked to be let out?

What else happened here? Are there any Drow wandering around Arcadia that have vowed revenge and stumbled into a story, as those in Arcadia are wont to do? No clue. Is there anything different going on with the oaths of these Drow who, unlike the rest, were /forced/ into oath-bound slavery against their will? Maybe we'll find out later.

And now Cat has dealt with these seven godlike figures, whose strength and power were built up over several chapters to the point where each one individually was a deadly threat, almost entirely off-screen and increased her military power almost exponentially.

Also she's leapt from struggling against the weakest sigil-holder in a nowhere-city to the point where she is now single-handily sacking an entire city three times the size of Lotow with powers that have come out of nowhere.

She's had the ability to open gates for something like a book and a half now, and has never so much as /mentioned/ the ability to cut things with them before 67. Was she always capable of this, but somehow never thought it would be useful before now? Has she been secretly training off-screen and just never brought this up or hinted at it on-screen? Did she accidentally cut something recently and go "wow, this is neat, this sure would have been useful previously"?

And she can also now pull off absolute positioning without either Masego or the Observatory and can drop volcanoes and mountains and lakes on her enemies, despite how difficult this was shown to be previously. Huh?
