** “For you to scream loudly enough that it will carry to our other prisoners,”

This is when you start /yelling your head off/, eking out every erg of acting ability you have in the desperate hope that he'll honestly feel he couldn't make a big difference by actually doing it, and that he'll be impressed enough by your efforts and your cooperativeness to look more favourably on you. Of course, chances are good he's going to kill you anyway, but at least you'll have a better chance at a quick, clean (more humane) death. Better in any case than if you hear that clue and yet still wait there for him to start on it himself.

I am intrigued that Louis is awaiting Scribe; I can't imagine anyone else he could be awaiting (/controlling the hatchets), yet it turns my impressions on its head to think that Scribe isn't the one who wanted to start the fires. Unless she was, and then she later changed her mind after being contacted..? But no, then she could call them off, so it must indeed have been two different groups, and for Scribe to be holding things back goes completely against what Cat and Black thought she would be doing there? But if the hatchets were cracking down on /her/, then again I'm completely bewildered about who Louis could be awaiting, unless he's awaiting Scribe and is completely wrong her about her leading the hatchets--that could be a fun (for us) surprise for him, if she really comes and he's gotten her side backwards.

***** I think that's nonsense image she wants to cultivate. Like Joker saying in TDKR he's just chaos and not a schemer and yet he perfectly outplayed everyone and got what he wanted.

Cat perfectly guessed what the others were planning which allowed her to counter them all.

This was certainly true vs GP and a lesser extent for the rest.

Edit : is like saying I beat you in chess not because I could forsee what you were doing but rather I could exploit chaos.

Nonsense, you may steer the game towards complicated positions, but if you win is because you can see more and outplay your opponent in those positions by understanding his strategy and using a better one to counter

Or you just got lucky...unless you arguing cat is always lucky..

****** First, I certainly agree that lately Cat has been more of a Chessmaster, with Tyrant closer to the 'thrives-in-chaos' role.

Stepping away from the characters, my own internal model (which might easily be flawed/wrong) is of a difference between short-term and long-term gains, between tactics and strategy. The Chessmaster tries to see the end goal, build an artifice that connects to it, and then either defend that artifice or build a new artifice from scratch. The Chaotic ignores the end goal and looks for immediate opportunities. When the Chessmaster's artifices are robust enough and the Chaotic's tactics weak enough, the Chessmaster can lead the Chaotic around by the nose and into a noose. When the Chessmaster's artifices are fragile enough and the Chaotic's opportunity-seeing brilliant enough, the Chaotic can quickly smash the Chessmaster's artifices faster than or as fast as the Chessmaster can think of new ones.

The question is, could a brilliant Chessmaster switch to becoming a equally-brilliant Chaotic or/and vice versa? My suspicion is /maybe/ yes (and maybe no), but if yes then probably with a learning curve first.

Keep in mind that both Chessmaster and Chaotic are playing styles, rather than naturally-emergent states: an amateur can act as a really weak Chessmaster by plotting a path to victory that includes only the dumbest(?) moves and assumes the opponent's moves to be moves that only a similarly weak player would ever make.

Hmm, I'm reminded of Jing Jiu and Yin San (Jing Yang and Taiping) in The Path Toward Heaven, regarding their Go-playing styles, Taiping plotting grand plans that Jing Yang then smashes directly in a reactive fashion because he's too lazy to think ahead.

** u/vimefer:

  Given that the conspiracy's own soldiers were the ones on the right side of walls and gates, at the moment, even if the two princes had struck an unlikely alliance they simply did not have the strength to take the palace with steel. And even if they did, by some miracle, they could not defend it: while it might be true that the servants in the palace had been fond of Hasenbach, and some even protested her seizing, he had Silver Letters among their number that'd open secret ways into the palace if it need be retaken.
#+end_quote

Ominous ! I suspect Cordelia hid back in the palace (backtracking is a good way to throw off pursuers), and let that fool Balthazar go on a wild goose hunt giving her all the time needed while she purges the Letters with the help of loyal servants and guards, and gathers reinforcements. She knows all the secret passageways already.

In fact, I suspect that right now she's sitting upon her own throne, inside the very Chamber of Assembly, waiting for them all to rush inside... so she can have them greeted with a hail of arrows.

** Malicia is behind the coup, pretending to be Rosala Malanza. Black/Scribe is against the coup, they are the 'hatchets'.

Basic purpose of the coup is to make sure Procer and Callow can't unify vs. Keter and Praesi.

White Knight and Witch are neither for nor against coup, just wandering around judging everyone. I bet they kill Cordelia at end of arc.

Very interesting to wonder if Assassin is here. Seems likely he is after Augur in the confusion.

***** During the whole Second Liesse debacle when Assassin!Black is “killed” by Akua he briefly turns into a Tahgreb woman which is where the Scribe=Assassin theories sprung up from. We're also not sure if he's actually dead as it was confirmed that he's incredibly hard to kill and a massive goblinfire explosion was the only way Alt!Cat was able to kill him. My bet is that he's secretly replaced one of the side characters on one of the sides, quietly biding his time before he strikes.

******* It would be interesting if Scribe actual /was/ Assassin and it turns out that the differences were because of having flexible aspects. So Assassin's ability to not be noticed could be matched with Scribe's ability not to be remembered. Maybe *Obscure*? Then Assassin's copying ability could be the same aspect as Scribe's ability to forge or falsify documents and personas with unerring accuracy. *Mimic* maybe? Finally we have Scribe's ability to create meticulous plots, and Assasin's ability to arrange events so that he can safely take out his targets. Maybe *Arrange* or *Organize*?

I do think that Scribe has more than one “passive” or “always on” aspect though

These kind of situations really are perfect for Hanno, nobody knows what's going on and there are enemies and manipulations everywhere...so here comes instant and brutal justice-in-a-can. I feel like people (in this kind of community specifically) tends to be very cynical about paladin types and this chapter really shows that some holy fire, a big piece of sharpened metal, and a magical moral compass, added together makes for a really good crisis solution.
