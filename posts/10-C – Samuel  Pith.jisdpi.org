  “Early this morning,” said the Admiral. “Parliament traveled to Paragon for security, and conducted a vote in secret. With a narrow majority, they've authorized us to take broad military action against Commonplace and the mob.”
#+end_quote

I can't tell if this is actually what happened, or if the current violence just gave Paragon the opportunity/motivation for a soft coup. The story is plausible, but also "the government voted in secret to give us a bunch of power, honest" is inherently suspicious.

I also /really/ don't see this going how Paragon wants it to. For one, I suspect that this:

#+begin_quote
  “Thanks to the recent broadcast on Verity,” shouted the admiral. “Public opinion has shifted! Only a hair, but it's growing. Commonplace's false image has shattered, and our most loyal supporters have rallied as one!”
#+end_quote

is a pretty fucking optimistic take. If "public opinion has shifted a hair" is what they're saying when they're trying to rally the troops, how bad must the reality be? No, the rioting makes it clear that they're losing the people's favor. That's only going to get worse thanks to how brutally they're suppressing the riots. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Thirty-two right thumbs sliced off tattooed hands, spurting blood. The Commonplace thugs cried out in pain, doubling over, losing their grip on weapons, distracted.

  ...

  Blood spurted out of the enemies, and sixteen heads fell off their bodies. They hadn't even touched him.
#+end_quote

One incident, less than five minutes, 32 people maimed and 16 people killed. This sort of response doesn't engender much goodwill. I imagine they'll only make matters worse by performing numerous simultaneous military operations on domestic soil against an organization that has widespread public support.

Paragon seems to have essentially abandon the fight for public opinion in the hopes that it won't matter if they destroy Commonplace. Even if they're right about that (and I'm not sure they are), it's still a big gamble to take when whether or not they can actually do enough military damage to Commonplace in a short enough span of time is very much up in the air. After all, Tunnel Vision has consistently been one step ahead of Paragon's best and brightest, and I don't see a reason why that would change now.

*** Yeah, I have the feeling that Grace played all of them. Maybe something involving the host of Verity? We never found out what happened to her.

**** I think it's more likely the play revolves around the intel Paragon has acquired and is planning their operations around. Either it's false, or else Commonplace is aware that Paragon has the intel and has taken the appropriate countermeasures.

  “Don't worry,” said Leizu, to the bombmaker. One Shenti speaking to another. “Paragon isn't going to abandon its citizens.” Its Shenti citizens. She smiled, though her eyes looked less certain.

That's a nice fantasy you have there. Would be a shame if your superior were to immediately smash it against the ground and spit on the remains...

** The van scene reminds me of something similar in another web serial, where the protagonist and some local do-golfers have to share a vehicle for an extended duration (I'm on mobile and I can't figure out how to do spoilers). Hilarious.

** How is this serial now? I tried the first few arcs, but while it was well-written, the seeming complete lack of rational decision-making of the protagonist kind of turned me off. Is it worth keeping going with it?

The that's the bar you've set, you're not going to enjoy the story. The MC is a person with a ton of trauma, naivete, and anger. Not to mention an overinflated sense of justice. They're not going to make the most rational choice all the time (or even most of the time), sometimes they just go with their gut.

But that in itself isn't a bad thing. The only way to make completely rational choices is to to not be invested in the choice personally and/or kill off your emotions. Which would make for a pretty boring MC.

**** Hmm, that's not quite what I meant. Maybe I'm not using quite the right words? Let me try to clarify.

People make non-rational decisions all the time. But those decisions are still based on a self-consistent world, in which the reasoning and drivers of that person make sense, even if they're non-optimal. The problem I had with pith is that the decisions of the main character didn't really seem to make sense, even in the context of their own values and experiences. Not doing something that you otherwise should because you were too traumatized by the last time you did that thing is totally understandable, even if it's not the rational choice. Not doing something you otherwise should because it would solve the plot problem too fast... isn't.

Let me give an example from Pith. The MC is driven to obtain a new body for herself, even to the extent of violating her own ethics to a fairly major degree. She accepts extra-legal work to this end, helping criminal groups steal and even kill in the name of her missions. On one of these missions, her fellow agents happily kill the enemy and steal their bodies as needed. Our MC doesn't even for a moment seem to consider taking a body herself, however, despite this being the /central/ reason for her to do every single thing she does in the story. And not just that, she doesn't even /think/ about it as an option to weigh. It's just not even a possibility to be lampshaded; it's just off limits. Why not? the obvious answer is that it solves her central conflict too quickly and easily. There were several such situations that came up, to the point where my immersion was broken. The world and characters didn't seem consistent.

Does that make more sense?

***** It's funny you picked that example, because the story specifically addresses it. From [[https://pithserial.com/2020/07/07/7-b-the-blue-charlatan/][chapter 7-B]]:

#+begin_quote
  After many missions, and many coughs, Hira would glance at me with confusion. “You shot so many,” she said. “You should just take their bodies, if they're going to die anyway.”

  When I thought about taking another's body, a yawning pit of disgust opened in my stomach. But I had another reason to hold back.

  Forced transference could only swap. It couldn't force another's Pith into the open air to make an empty chassis, unless you'd studied more advanced techniques.

  Which meant, if I took another's body, I'd have to give up this one.

  And I wouldn't be Ernest Chapman anymore. I'd lose my Grey Coat position with Lorne, lose my best shot at becoming a Paragon student. Maybe my best shot at a new chassis, too, at drinking mulled cider with a friend.
#+end_quote

Even without that passage though, I wouldn't have found Ana's behavior to be inconsistent. Her self-righteousness is as central to her character as her desperation and body issues, maybe even more so. I'd be surprised if she resorted to stealing someone else's body while she still had other options available to her that she was working towards, even if the person she was stealing from was about to be killed. She's had to be dragged kicking and screaming past pretty much every moral compromise she's made, it's not something she typically does of her own initiative.

I can't tell you whether or not you'd find the story to improve on your criticisms because I personally never had that problem with it. I never found the characters or world to be inconsistent and I'm genuinely surprised to hear that you did.

****** I like how she progresses from "I will never take someone's body, that's a line I won't cross", to "I don't want to, and also it's not practical" to "shit, I really should have done it when I had a chance".

*** I'd say that the characters are written rationally rather than written to /be/ rational. This means that they will at times behave irrationally and have consistent blind spots in their thinking because that's what real people are like. I personally think one of the big strengths of this story is that the characters have consistent depth and act in believable ways according to their motivations and experiences, and I find their cognitive blind spots interesting because they speak to the tensions at the core of each character.

I greatly enjoy the story and would absolutely say it's worth reading, but I also don't care if characters make poor decisions so long as those decisions are realistic and driven by the characters and their circumstances rather than the demands of the plot. Make of that what you will.
