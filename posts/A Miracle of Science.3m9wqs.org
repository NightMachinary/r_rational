** Well worth the read even if it is fluff (mad science is a psychological disease).

** Not sure if this is rational, but it /is/ a very good piece of deconstruction/reconstruction.

** I'm a few pages in. Definitely cool, even if it's not fully rationalist. I'm very very glad you posted this.

** It's definitely got it's fair share of handwavium, but there is an organic communal AI in the story, so I'll be reading to see if they do anything interesting with it.

*** Please report back with your opinion of what they have done with it. I'm curious what you think. I think their approach to infectious memes is decent, though risky, considering the rules of the setting.

**** It's definitely not a rational story, though it has a lot of fun rational elements in it. In some ways, it feels like [[http://freefall.purrsia.com/default.htm][Freefall]] in that they are both an exploration of not entirely-human intelligences, but with more detailed art and a slightly more serious overall tone.

****** At the end of [[http://project-apollo.net/mos/archive.html][A Saint Abroad And A Devil At Home]] It's not really a classic mirror moment because it's not self-realization or definition, but it does create a lot of introspection.
