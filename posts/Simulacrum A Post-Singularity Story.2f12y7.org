** Do you have the wrong link? I just go to a page discussing the story and ending in a mod banning the author for their story having graphic sex of minors and underage rape, and forbidding them to restart the story. Which honestly doesn't really sound like a nice story to read

** Thread is locked. Apparently underage sex scenes were depicted either in text or pictures.
