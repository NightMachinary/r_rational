Hello. I'm working my way through Van Vogt's World of Null-A on the recommendation of this sub. I'm about half way through and I'm beginning to wonder if at any point I can expect more in the way of pedagogic or pseudo-pedagogic exposition? Or ... if perhaps it all went over my head and I missed it? I was reading it somewhat fast. To be a little more concrete I'm wondering if at any point the nature of the protagonist's techniques will be revealed.

So far I have not noticed anything special though I do get the vague sense of the author telling the reader to be careful and avoid misdirection ...

Generally no spoilers please :-), I suspect I will end up finishing it. But I would be interested to know if I can expect more, in the abstract.


** It's been a few years since I read it. I don't think it went into super deep detail on the actual techniques. There was definitely some mostly along more philosophical lines than practical ones, but don't expect to get a full-on rationalist explanation based on real life cog-science cause the field basically didn't exist yet when the book was written. The twists in the last half of the book ended up being really good though--definitely worth finishing.

** Maybe you'll laugh a bit harder when you read Null-O, by Philip K Dick. But you've already read enough to see what Dick is responding to.
