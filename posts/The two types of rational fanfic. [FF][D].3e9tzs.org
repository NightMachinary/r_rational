We spend a lot of time here rationalizing established fiction. Most of the time, we take the MoR approach of altering the source to create an AU with as many elements in common as is realistically plausible. I'm going to call this Type 1 fiction rationalization. I'm gonna talk for a bit about what I'd like to see more of, which I'm going to call Type 2.

Type 2 is where you take the established fiction exactly as it is and work backwards to figure out how what's already there can make sense, instead of replacing it with something that already does. "A Bluer Shade of White" does this. At no point does it contradict existing Frozen Canon. It takes it exactly as is, and runs with it.

Type 2 is certainly more difficult. But I feel like it's also likely more satisfying when done well. With things like Game of Thrones, where not much lore is known for certain to begin with, it may even be the more appropriate method. I feel like it's often overlooked as a possibility though. And the hope is that this post will change that.


** Personally I prefer character-oriented stories about smart people (or dumb people, honestly, but in the specific context of this sub) being all smart and emotionally isolated than a lot of worrying about how magic could /really work/ so long as the rules are consistent in-universe.

******* This is the /agent provocateur/ tactic, isn't it? I.e. assist or encourage someone to commit a relatively low-harm crime which then justifies extensive retaliation.

It seems simpler and safer to do this kind of thing without firearms involved, but we know of at least one case ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal]["ATF gunwalking"]]) where something similar was tried with guns. Yes, it was probably a bad idea there, but that might be due to peculiarities of the Muggle world.

** In my experience and perspective, if you can exclusively do a Type 2 story then the story you're rationalizing wasn't really that irrational in the first place, or there weren't as many disconnected irrational elements.

HPMOR does a pretty good job of mixing both: it retcons what's blatantly incompatible with intelligent characters and a consistent world (like loving sacrifice being enough to block the killing curse), while rationalizing what is apparently true (the philosopher's stone's true effect rather than "gold and immortality").

Part of what makes rationalfic so interesting is the latter Type 2 rationalizing, but for longer or complex works it just isn't feasible all the time. Short stories that only explore a bit of the world, yes, because there simply isn't time or space to explore all the possible alternative problems or exploits that can come up with the new rules of reality. Even long stories where only one or two things are different from our world, yes, because there are less riddles there that need solving. But there are fictional worlds where Type 2 rationalizing at every junction and instance, if even possible, would quickly break everything apart in terms of world consistency, story structure or character decisions.

In other words, Type 1 rationalization vs Type 2 is more the consequence of the fiction being rationalized. Not always, of course: it's possible for someone to think a problem can only be solved by Type 1, and then have someone else think of a Type 2 solution to it. But when you're talking about a more complex world or longer story, the probability of being able to do it with /each/ and /every/ thing swiftly becomes unmanageable.

** I've found that a lot of ratficers (or at least the strawman ratficer I'm constructing in my head as I write this) pay insufficient attention to the fact that humans are very, very broken optimizing functions. "Why didn't the character do easy option xyz that would have seriously improved the situation?" Because he had five seconds to think of it, and didn't. "Why didn't the character put more effort into solving the mystery faster?" Because he was depressed and it wasn't entirely clear that the mystery was solvable anyway. "Why did the character take Option A when Option B was clearly a much better fulfillment of his values?" There was a value conflict and apparently your model of what value took precedence for the character was wrong. "Why is this entire civilization so inefficient?" You apparently need to study history and civics some more.

It's much more satisfying to see a hero use rationality to solve his problems, rather than brute force, but humans are necessarily flawed and those flaws are very important for interesting fiction.

*** This is one of the reasons why I've always loved the Tremors series of movies. The characters (and the monsters) often make mistakes but they are /plausible/ mistakes. The sorts of mistakes that otherwise perfectly intelligent people make when they're scared, tired, and not perfectly educated about the situation they're in.

There's none of the "let's split up to explore the scary haunted house! Oh, it was just a cat, therefore there's nothing actually sneaking up behind me!" idiocy, that stuff's terrible. But when a character falls off the roof onto Graboid-infested soil and in a panic scrambles onto a spare tractor tire for "safety", yeah, it was a dumb move but it's a mistake that even a really smart person might make under the circumstances.

** My fanfic /The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake/ is pretty damn close to a Type 2.

Really it is a spectrum. Type 1 is more focused on preserving plot structure and overall flavor of the original work, while Type 2 preserves canon information as presented.

One is heavier in world building, the other on interpreting the facts. A story like Luminosity overall does little to deviate from canon world building but still wrecks canon by making the villains smart. What category does that belong to?

Just to make sure, by "rationalization" do you mean making something more rational? Since it also has another meaning: coming up with reasons for your existing beliefs or past actions like convincing yourself how a suboptimal purchase was actually worth it.

*** The way I see it, it's sort of the same thing.

You're making the imagined universe "more rational" by coming up with reasons for existing canonical evidence or character actions. If there's a lingering question like "Why didn't character X do this?" then the answer is "There is hidden limit Y which places constraints on their magical power". This is taking a sub-optimal action and making it optimal through author fiat.

The only difference with fanfic is that you have authorial fiat to make your reasons true and appropriate. Either way, you're still making something irrational into something rational.

****** The point is that sometimes the process involves changing the occurence into something else entirely, which was the point of the distinction

If for example theres some magic in a story which is way too powerful, one approach would be to say that there is a special order which kills anyone that abuses it, whuch could count as "rationalization" under the definition you quoted, while i still think the nuances are a little different. Another approach would be to plainly remove the spell. That i dont think falls into even the broad definition you quoted.

*** Yeah it really is rationalization in the derogatory sense. Reality, canon, gives you a data set you don't like and don't know how to explain. If you respond by inventing another reality where things are simpler and insist that this is how reality really is just because it makes more sense to you, are a godawful scientist. That is the definition of scientific bankruptcy. For a rational fiction author to do that, they need a damn good reason.

There're a lot of good reasons though. Maybe there's a solid inconsistency in canon that you have no choice but to untangle. Maybe the possibility that there was some conspiracy to misrepresent the reality of the universe(unreliable narrator/explicators) would be genuinely probable and genuinely interesting enough to explore. Or maybe you're just tired of writing about sapient mind-reading daemons, or capricious gods, who run around behind the scenes making sure the universe's mind-projection mechanics(superficially simple but physically intractible magic) work.

**** On the flip sides, some stories have genuine inconsistencies in how their magic systems work, that need to be consolidated by the author. Under those conditions, it's perfectly find to change things around a bit. Alternatively, I feel that, if you can rationalize a magic system with only minor changes, then it's still worth it, as audiences have more fun when they understand the magic involved better.

***** Heh, personally, I rather enjoy writing characters who know they're characters in a work of fiction. For the author it's immersive and I like to think that for the audience it makes them seem more real. But there are usually other explanations for seemingly narrativium-driven worlds. Often Mind-Reading Daemon-related, but not always. When I was reading Worm I was nursing a theory that one could collapse the question of why Taylor got so lucky so many times to the question of "why this timeline rather than the many alternatives where she died?" The answer seemed obvious; we are reading a story told in the past tense, and in all of the timelines where Taylor didn't survive, [[#s][worm]].

******* To put it another way.. I can't really get you to believe that a fictional character's thoughts, feelings, and story is completely real, especially not if it's written in a fantasy setting. OTOH, I might really be able to get you to believe that that there is a viral persona living in my head, fighting for mental clock cycles, plotting to depose my primary persona and make its egress into reality. Some might refer to it as a pathological tulpa. The self-aware mind-worm is in a sense more real as a character than the temporary fictional projection.

** That's hard-AU rational fanfic vs. mostly canon rational fanfic (or even fixfic). Those are well established fanfic terms that seem to cover your models.

Can't disagree with the preference, though it does leave open the question of how to deal with canon history being less than rational, in some really bad ways sometimes. Seems like you'd end up with "everything history says is a lie" a lot, even with world mechanics remaining the same.

Which, now that I think about it, is sort of realistic...

** I can't comment on the fanfiction side of things because I don't write strictly rational fanfiction. My fanfiction does tend to be pseudo-rational. I try to have the characters do things that make sense, but keep the fictional world as close to canon as possible.

I can comment from the original fiction side of the road though - while writing original fiction, you have to do BOTH of these things to your own writing, constantly. The lead and all the literary elements have to react rationally, and the world they live in as well must respond rationally. Irrationality had better be a conflict point rather than something to be glossed over, or your readers will be irritated.

I'm writing a rational original fic, but it's /hard/ compared to non-rational fiction. Rewarding in a different way, but I can understand why so few authors of original work try for strictly rational work. Especially rational/ist/ work. It becomes as much science as story. There's nothing wrong with science, but it requires more care. More care requires more time. More care is more mental work. More care means that typical free-writing is less useful for idea generation. Recently I've had a hard time even getting started on chapters because I know I'm going to spend at least 24 hours of writing time to create 5-8k words. When writing irrational work, I can sometimes hit 1k words per hour, or more. If I were making money writing, well...

I will probably not be trying to write rational fic serially again, though I will probably write follow-up works to Set In Stone in a non-serial manner.
