Imagine you've just met green-haired girl, and she asked you to conquer the world. And then she told that if you refuse, you're going to die horribly, and she will ask someone else. Now she's ready to give you any assistance you need, be it information, technology, money or superpowers. Of course, she prove her capabilities with some impressive feats.

By "conquering", this girl wants you to be able to unite most of the Earth population behind possibly unethical task. Invading other sentient species is a good example. Nobody cares about official titles - you can rule from the shadows, but you need to be efficient about it. Also, you need to keep at least 80% of current population alive and able. And you have a time limit of 10 years.

But she also told that you're not the only one she contacted. She's holding a tender of sorts, searching for a lowest bidder. You don't know exact metrics used to determine a "cost" of resources, but generally more powerful (Death Stars) and more precise (full brainwashing) costs more. AGI is unavailable, neither are self-replicating robots or large-scale robot factories. Also, creativity brings some merit. Intentionally losing tender is not an option - not only would you die, but your friends/family risk living in a world conquered by someone else.

Any clever ideas?


** I aske her to give me undeniable proof that she has the powers she claims to have, so that others can be persuaded. I can pay her for that proof with loaned money, so that total cost is 0 USD.

I persuade world population with that proof, that resistane is futile, and that they should just let me conquer them, for a promise that except for one thing I will do that is non-negotiable - I will create worldwide democracy.

*** That was my first thought as well.

Geass of Absolute Command would likely be enough. Just establish a macro that you could call "Action A" or "Action B" for quick commanding, Include within it several or all of the following:

- "Perform perfectly normally except obey any verbal command I give you prefaced with the words 'Would you kindly'?"
- "Do not harm me, or through inaction allow me to come to harm."
- "Inform me or any attempts or plans by others to harm me."

And so on. Create a good macro and use that. This is important because it is a thing that works only once per target, but lasts forever when used. The objective is to balance personal safety with retention of free will.

Then test if the Geass can be used as an Oracle (ie. Geass someone to answer P=NP. Are they forced to tell the absolute truth, the truth they know?) and any other number of edge cases.

Then, once your macro is set, just hit everyone who may be a threat to you (likely almost everyone) with your above Geass. Maybe add a number of trigger words so that it isn't so obvious to non-Geass people when you give commands [which you shouldn't need to do often, since your Geass should be coded to make them act in your best interest.

Your ideal situation is a quick ascent to power in which everyone just assumes you are that charismatic and nobody ever thinks you have any kind of special power.

This is what Lelouch /should/ have done.

** More powerful and more precise costs more. Fine. What's the cost of my gaining ownership of most of the world's major oil wells, mineral deposits, and investment banks through a network of shell companies? I negotiate with the girl I've promptly labeled "Lyra Heartstrings" for trolling's sake to find the optimal trade-off point between getting my entry to the essential markets and having a low contract cost for her.

I figure I could even start with something small, like using cultural understanding or very minor mind-control to start bringing the mineral wealth of Afghanistan to global markets (EDIT: Can't do that in 10 years, CRAP), amassing a solid billionaire-hood for myself, with which I can plot my takeovers of the other markets and my acquisition of relevant governments.

From there I'll be able to control enough of global political opinion-leadership to push public policy in much of the world whichever way I want it. If I put in a low-enough contract cost to start with to support some evil mind-control or something, I can even use that or similar on recalcitrantly honest officials.

EDIT: Lacking the mineral wealth of Afghanistan, and assuming gaining control over Saudi Arabia is too costly, I'd negotiate for some technological Phlebotinum capable of launching the next Google-grade tech startup within 5 years to attain multi-billionaire-hood. Or I could just use Phlebotinum to replace an existing mega-billionaire who's capable of all this stuff I need.

** How much would the super power "Predict how a crowd/demographic will react to something" cost?

Because that alone will take you a long way. Being perfectly charismatic, at least on average and to crowds. Basically everything I'd look for is an oracle like that. Let me get some expensive piece of information for free on a regular basis.

If that doesn't work, then simple mind reading (surface thoughts) might.

A superman package could be fun, but I don't imagine it affecting things on that scale. Even if I'm threatening spending all of my time murdering cute animals with rare diseases, governments aren't going to cave to my demands. I just become an end-bringer.

Anyone who's watched death note would at least consider the eponymous item, and probably if they read this they'd do a better job of it.

Maybe the jesus power set? Not nearly as powerful as superman, but you can play very differently and there's a lot of people that are /very/ desperate. If I could genuinely perform miracle healing a cult following wouldn't be hard to achieve, and holy wars have a long tradition. Maybe I could reincarnate as one of the other abrahamic faith's prophets after I get killed the first time (budget permitting). See if I can rally everyone together.

In hind sight religion seems like a pretty good way to go. Nothing inspires a willingness to invade people like religion.

Have a few confederates build a base in the desert, for show. Fake an alien invasion with a few actors in spacesuits. Have them "teleport" into the Australian outback, take over the base, and start killing everything with a pulse. Plant other agents in the first contact team and have them pretend they have some form of mental control that requires limiting of contact and communication between human and Xeno forces. Nuke the Xeno base, which, being in the outback, has limited human-death fallout.

I don't need to do much more to get humanity to start fighting aliens; The mental dominance lie allows me to ensure that all interactions with Xenos will be missile diplomacy and naught else.

Meanwhile, there was clearly some human help in building the base (My first agents, who have since appeared to have committed suicide); The aliens must have sleeper agents in the general populace!

Cue worldwide witchhunt, with myself gaining prominence as McCarthy 2.0 by browbeating agents into admitting guilt. Run off that goodwill to get into major politics and eventually the Presidency.
