Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So I found a quote from Tim Minchin's Storm "Throughout history, every mystery ever solved has turned out to be not magic." This got me thinking, what if this wasn't the case. What effect would that have on the development of science. So what if some important part of the world was explicitly magic, and the world was indeed created by magic. However ordinary physics does work normally. Also, I need to add that while it is perfectly reasonable to say try to figure out magic, this is in setting difficult for the reasons that the magic has gone away as history progressed by which I mean the ability to make new enchanted objects, but old one continued working. I personally think this would effect things on the basis the concept of a universal law would be harder to come up with as some objects clearly get an out. Also, why make up naturalism if it plainly doesn't work?

*** What are some example magical objects? Things for the natural philosopher to investigate include whether magic and the world look as though they were designed, and if so, by what sort of character. If culture has changed through history, does it look designed by a modern or ancient character, or neither?

**** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_crystal]]

we can currently explain some very interesting things. a thing is magic when we cannot explain it, when we have no idea how to begin to describe a thing beyond do A, get B.

if the world is a simulation, it would be easy for it to contain things that only exist because an admin had added them to the simulation.

***** In the end, all our descriptions of the world reduce to do A, get B. I like [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u6JzcFtPGiznFgDxP/excluding-the-supernatural][another definition of magic]] more:

  A "supernatural" explanation appeals to ontologically basic mental things, mental entities that cannot be reduced to nonmental entities.

** Building a fantasy setting for a game with themes of duality, so I'm trying to collect interesting dualities that compose the world. It's an invented world, but imagine Persian mythology for flavor.

For a simple example, entities might be composed of two elements to produce a combined effect. Earth + water = clay = golem. Air, fire, smoke, djinn. Etc. (More than two is allowed, just needs to be a balanced split, 2, 4, 8, because fractals or something).

A more interesting example would be Sun and Moon magic opposing each other by being concerned with tangible things (because daylight = visible) and conceptual things (night = imagination) respectively.

That fusion/fission, aligned/opposed, etc/etc duality is what I'm playing with. Can you think of more interesting examples, fitting the theme? Any examples of other worlds built on duality being fundamental to the universe?

The next step for me would be connecting these ideas into something more unified, like life/death and sun/moon being different expressions of the same meta-duality. But I don't think I have enough information to work with yet.

*** You could look at neurological sensory antagonism. Like how human color photoreceptors encode and deliver color-data as levels of "red vs. green" and "blue vs. yellow." We perceive those as primitive axes to split the world along, only because our brains have been built to measure the two quantities against one-another. It's similar to, but distinct from, the idea of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yFDKvfN6D87Tf5J9f/neural-categories][neural categories]].

(Anyone know of other features the brain perceives using this kind of antagonized measurement?)

I feel like you could totally world-build a setting where the categorical duals in the world are inferred from the antagonized features embedded in the neurology of the magical sentients perceiving the world, rather than the other way around.

**** That's an interesting approach! I reckon it's an unexpected but believable explanation should I need one, but I'm struggling to think of anything narratively interesting to do with it. Conflicts like wanting to illuminate or change people's perception to better utilize the magic, perhaps, but feels a little predictable.

Any ideas?

*** Have you read about chinese philosophy? Because the unified meta duality sounds a lot like yin and yang.

#+begin_quote
  Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night time.

  Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime

***** The concept of yin and yang runs very deep in Chinese culture, in mythology you have the Dragon and Phoenix both embody yin and yang but they harness the opposite types of energy, the Phoenix, a yin symbol, is made of flames, while the Dragon, embodiment of yang, harnesses yin energy and creates rain. The soul of a person is yin while the body is yang. There's also food, which can be divided as yin and yang, or hot and cold, not the temperature but in terms of your body, for example if it's hot outside you would eat foods that are yin/cold, or if you have fever you eat yin food. Eating too much of one type of food is not considered good as it can create imbalance in your body and you may get sick. This hot/cold food is not just limited to China but Japan, India, Pakistan (where I'm from, and I hear my mom always talking about this)etc.

****** Those are great examples, and I'm glad there's still some familiar crossover even with modern Pakistan folklore. I mentioned ancient Persia as a source of inspiration in my original post, but I really meant the three early cradles of civilisation. Primarily Mesopotamia, but also Egypt and Indus Valley, which includes ancient Pakistan. There's a lot of crossover as far as east Asia and Africa anyway, pretty sure the Phoenix is related to the Simurgh, like the Lamassu is related to the Sphinx.

Anyway, are there any other similar duality concepts from Pakistan that you're familiar with?

******* I don't think, Pakistan is a Islamic country so most of the pagan beliefs have been forgotten or abandoned and replaced with the Islamic ones, and there's just the Djinn vs humans I guess, it is said that djinns live alongside us on earth but they are invisible, there are some beliefs that say that every person has an djinn counterpart.

These don't need to be opposed.

A computer is a tangible thing; the software that runs on it is conceptual only. Yet they work together in perfect harmony.

**** You're right! I'm intentionally enforcing duality on the world I'm building in order to hammer the theme, but given fusion of opposing natures is also allowed... perhaps Sun/tangible/etc and Moon/conceptual/etc magic could make some kind of fantasy computer by harmonizing?

***** Hmmm... considering it further, you don't even need HEX (or other fantasy computers) to show this inversion. Humanity does it already - we are both our corporeal bodies and our conceptual minds. Any physical thing that thinks, or does something like thinking, is a mix of both sides.

(Ghosts, on the other hand, are pure Conceptual).

****** This is definitely something I want to play with as a principle in the setting. Toying with the idea of fission and fusion of the fundamental duality of the self. It occurred to me that we have this duality IRL now, where people draw a line between their minds/spirits and their bodies, in so many different ways. Exploring this is meant to be an undercurrent, as far as storytelling goes, at least until the climax.
