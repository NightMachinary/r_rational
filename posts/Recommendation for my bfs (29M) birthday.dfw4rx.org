Hi! I recently figured out that my boyfriend loves reading/listening to rational fiction books, as those are the only ones that don't drive him crazy because of illogical plot and characters. I know he absolutely loved hpmor, and he's currently finishing Crystal society, which he's so far liked as well.

I'd love to give him a book (preferably an ebook/audiobook) that fits rational fiction description that he'd enjoy, but I don't know anything about what makes a good one. He's gonna be 29, is a software developer and loves to play videogames/computer games. Do you guys have any suggestions for books I could gift him? Thanks a lot!


** I wanted to point out the distinction between 'rational' and 'rationalist' fiction - illogical characters are realistic, and totally belong in a rational story as long as they are illogical in human-accurate ways. If those also bother him, he probably is into the more specific genre of rational/ist/ fiction, which is mostly about rational people having plot in a setting filled with largely irrational people. HPMOR is an excellent example of that.

Oh, and if he loved Methods of Rationality, I heartily recommend the continuation-fic "Significant Digits". Not something you can really get him as a present, unfortunately :-\

** As a fan of rational fiction, something that caught me completely by surprise was the DIRE series, starting with DIRE: BORN. It's rational adjacency and style of humor hit all my “spots” in a very satisfying way. Has the added benefit of being something not on many people's radar, so it's less likely he'd already have read it.

As a related aside, you may want to check that he hasn't already read/listened to the works recommended here, before investing. If he's significantly into this style already, chances are not too bad that he's read things like Sanderson or The Martian, for example.

** More rational-adjacent, but I really enjoyed the Cradle series of books, and by the same author, The Traveler's Gate series, which I'm relistening to right now.

Traveler's Gate is fantastic because, all in the first book, it takes several fantasy cliches, and flips them all on their head, perfectly, with perfect interactions in how things are different. The main protagonist isn't actually the chosen one, but there is a chosen one, and he's not actually unhelpful. There's a princess, but she's not actually in danger, and she's actually quite competent. The antagonist in the first book isn't actually that bad, and there isn't really one particular person/group that I'd call the bad guys.

The book is a perfectly executed car crash in slow motion. Most books like this have a ton of irrational bits that cause the story to fall apart on further inspect, but Traveler's Gate doesn't. Every single event and motivation makes perfect sense, which is the hallmark of rational fiction, beyond the surface level sci-fi bits that usually adorn the genre. The first book is amazing, and funny, and incredibly well executed. It's an amazing story.

And the other two books in the Traveler's Gate trilogy are just like the first. They're amazing, and they portray the direct consequences of everyone's actions in each earlier book. Exactly how rational fiction should be. This is all on top of a neat magic system, which certainly helps, too.

Cradle is more of a [[/r/progressionfantasy][r/progressionfantasy]], which is somewhat adjacent to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], more about having a good and rational system of power levels in fantasy, which are satisfying to watch the protagonists learn about. More so than the shitty versions of the genre, LitRPGs. I like this series, and the author releases a new book every 6 months or so, and I'd definitely recommend it, but it's not as obviously rational, though the protagonist does have to be pretty clever to get out of some crazy situations.

Both of these have great audiobooks. TTG is read by the author, who's surprisingly good, and Cradle is read by someone else, who does amazing voices and is a delight to listen to.

--------------

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249][Worth the Candle]] by Alexander Wales is an amazing work, that gets updated around every one to two months, and you can download the latest ebook from that link, or just read it online. It's the epitome of rational fiction, and it's definitely of the best (i.e. best demonstration of rational fiction) this sub has. No audiobook, though.

--------------

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/102/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] is my favorite story of all time, and it's about to be completed. It's been ongoing since 2011, and although it came after the genre was named, it's also a good example of progression fantasy. This sub is also obsessed with this one; posts about it reach the top of the subreddit, if you go and check. You can download an epub from that link using [[https://ficsave.xyz]].

There are multiple ongoing audiobook efforts, three I know of, but two of them suck, and I /hate/ the voices of the third one. I've listened to the first four chapters, and the female voices suck a ton, and the protagonist's annoying mentor is stereotyped into the unintelligible Chinese teacher, and you can't understand him /at all/. Besides that, the narrator just generally has a really unusual accent in general, which isn't terrible, but that in addition to poor voice choices for basically every character (I only mentioned the worst bits) mean that he sucks to listen to. I recommend that Mother of Learning just be read instead, then maybe listened to later. And it really should be read, because it's a goddamn amazing story.

****** It depends what your deal-breakers are. The protagonist acts basically like the protagonist from The Martian pretending to be a woman, i.e. is not remotely plausible as a woman. Also Andy Weir and the other characters are all way too amused by how slutty she supposedly is. The plot itself contains no glaring holes, the science is sound, and it's all interesting enough. If you can look past the lameness of Jazz herself, it's an okay read.

** Given that he has an background in programming, I might recommend UNSONG. It's definitely not everybody's cup of tea, and to really GET it it helps to have a background in both Jewish mythology (preferably Kaballah-specific) as well as computer programming, but the people that like it tend to really enjoy it.

Basically, the world *used* to run on physics (thanks to an angel, ironically), until Neil Armstrong took a spaceship up to the moon and accidentally cracked the crystal sphere that holds the stars in place. Now the world runs on God, and by invoking the Names of God you can cause things to happen. The main character starts the story working at a "theonomics corporation", which researches, discovers, and trademarks the names of god in order to make a profit.

The whole thing is a bit silly, and while the setting may not be rationalist the characters are very consistent and the consequences of the setting are played out in a rational and consistent manner.

The stormlight archive has a war-like society, that has lower strata of slaves, plebeians and nobles. And yet a highly prolific womanizer, attractive and wealthy noble would still be a virgin (and be wooed by talking about shit), due only to the fact that Sanderson is a mormon.

So, I began writing about Sanderson before I realized I was pirating his books (I've since lost my copies legally purchased) and honestly, it became a mess where there was no point to what I was writing. So I'll keep my opinion succinct, if you still care.

a)Magic Systems and World Building do no a good story make.

Sanderson wanks about how his magic systems are internally consistent, and his first mistborn novel is all about the cast showing off their powers only to be useless and outshined by the protagonist, who has them all.

She then proceeds to defeat the ultimate boss by an asspul. And the guy before that. And the guy before that too - She gets powered by a god for... reasons in the first book, is 'faster than a guy seeing the future' on book 2 and on book 3, as a god, fighting someone with aeons of experience over her and stated to have more power she.... gets angry because love interest dies. Then beats said god.

Then, we come to his 'Worldbuilding' which is done by rule of cool. You have Mistborn, where there is a large theocracy, with a 'living god' as it's ruler, and two strata of people - Skaa ('slaves') and the nobles.

This is where it gets wonky: the above Living God made (through ass pul magic sans limits) the two people's different. But that ends not mattering at all when the plot needs.

Large parts of the plot is the Living God not wanting skaa and nobles to interbreed - for reasons which are stupid. Why didn't he make them unable to conceive - he made wonky ass magic people too - the plot needed it.

You need to infiltrate the court of said living god (whom are outright the highest richest nobility?). Said nobility are said not to speak to their slaves directly. So the plot sends Mary Sue... I mean, the protagonist, a street rat who was /consistently/ underfed (but not only flip flops on the trust issues of her life story) but also looks like the best fed nobles and manages to speak like them too.

Then you have the more egregious flip-flopping. Interbreeding is a no-no, to the point our protagonist is hunted over cities (before they even find out she has powers). This hunt is led by a minister of the Living God, who is an absolute, undisputed monarch who sometimes engages in noble wars... to maintain his grip, or because he finds it fun because we're told he could level cities if he wanted to.

But the noble houses constantly engage in intermarriage to try and get superpowered people. Constantly. It's a major plot point in book two even. This going right under the ruler's nose, in his city. The main thing he is worried about.

See, the 'world-building' and 'magic system' fall apart under scrutiny. And it's no me being nitpicky, those are major plot points.

b) Sanderson cannot write characters who are deeper than a puddle.

His characters are not consistent if they have any depth - Vin, the protagonist of the mistborn series, flip flops between trust issues and risking herself for people she barely knows.

When his characters are bad, they're bad - even if it makes little sense for them to be. And if they're good, they're good.

The dude who betrays our anime protagonist du jour seems to lead the life of an honorable man. But because he is eeeeeeeevil he needs to be truly and completely evil. He couldn't have been motivated by a momentary weakness. He is evil, and gives in to the god of Evilness.

Or just morally myopic - his fans bitch about a character named Moash being angry at the nobility and killing a king - when said king had his grandparents unjustly imprisoned by said king and died under exposure by the prison conditions.

Then you have characters who are so evil to go counter their interests, like a merchant whose name escapes me - who wants to betray the government that gave him rights (and it's under siege) for... the posssiblity the other government might let them keep them. No agreement, no nothing.

Part 2 tomorrow.

****** Vin is the best assassin because she is the strongest mistborn in the world because she's being groomed to become a shard and so can draw on the mists. Magical powers > bodies. Plus she was trained by Kelsier and his crew. Reach doesn't matter much when you can shoot off like a bullet by pushing on a nail.

Dalinar is an overprotective honor bound father and has been since Adolin was around 13, and Vorin society (in theory) has tight gender rules. Other characters [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/4bnuxt/spoilers_up_to_bom_romance_sex_and_chastity_in/d1bd5ma/][get laid]] without marriage.

Right, the shard who had lost coherent thought at that point. And whom was barred from helping her for most of her life due to an earring. And who was later shown to be unable/unwilling to kill the Lord Ruler but seems completely okay with it as the PLOT SAYS SO. Right.

'Trained' aka have conversations with a bunch of stooges who are later useless in every other book including the first, including the super genious plan of being murdered in the daylight in front of a million witnesses by the guy with infinite propaganda powers is going to somehow inspire some people. Because a guy seeing a bald copy of a guy at night is going to counter that.

Sure. And there was no opportunities for this guy who is always with girls to get laid even once, in the middle of a large camp? Right. It's not like there are slaves or anything.

Except you know, having sex before marriage is evil because Sanderson is a mormon and we can't have our heroes do that. And people who are evil are completely so. Which leads to him being charmed by talking about shitting mid-dinner.

God that was cringe.

Vin is very power fantasyish (As is common for many popular fantasy heroes) but not especially Mary Sue. There are many deeper characters around her fairly blank personality the reader can imprint on, and they don't obsess over her or relentlessly praise her like Mary Sues typically get.

#+end_quote

It did inspire people, and worked well. Having shapeshifters around people don't know about is useful.

Also Lord Ruler isn't an especially good propagandist. He generally doesn't care much about most things going on in the empire unless they impact him.

#+begin_quote
  Except she fought mistborns and won against a guy that could see the future BECAUSE SHE WAS QUICKER THAN THE FUTURE.
#+end_quote

No, she won because she was a better fighter than him and was faster with pewter. She acted based on what he did, creating two atium shadows, and he could only respond to one of her shadows.

Zane could have beat her, but he charged straight at her so her superior speed let her overcome him. He picked a strategy that let her fool his atium.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The idea that power shapes your mind over time is a continual theme in the book. She hasn't had her mind shaped very long, and so can act against her instincts.

#+begin_quote
  Sure. And there was no opportunities for this guy who is always with girls to get laid even once, in the middle of a large camp? Right. It's not like there are slaves or anything.
#+end_quote

He could get laid, but he self sabotages and it's a bit harder than average to get laid. His father is also against rape, and probably against him sleeping with a commoner slave as a violation of protocol.

Other characters have sex before marriage, as I noted in my link. Wax and Lessie say.

  Kelsier's plan It inspired people because the plot said so. Kelsier's plan is completely and utterly moronic.

#+end_quote

She is stronger than average because she can suck in the mists and does so several times, and pewter is much more important as to her reaction speeds than her body. Zane's main strength was in steel, he was never an especially good pewter user.

Plus, Pewter was reducing her malnutrition.

[[https://sciencenorway.no/forskningno-history-norway/was-rape-common-in-the-middle-ages/1452223]]

Rape historically had very harsh punishments, there was no universal consensus that it was ok. Some people like Sadeas would definitely be fine with it, but many would not.

People do have morals even in harsh worlds. Philosophies and religions are often against rape, and Dalinar became extremely religious after murdering his wife.

********** I looked up their stats in the rpg. Zane has 10 steel and 5 pewter, and Vin has 8 pewter and 6 steel. In a steel pushing contest she will lose, but in a brute speed contest she might win.

She convinces him to do something dumb, charge against her. Because her physical magic is stronger she's able to out speed him.

**** Epic fantasy of the best kind. He's written a few different fantasy series all set in the same universe (the cosmere), each with a magic system informed by a different set of rules. All magic systems are knowable & discoverable by characters in the stories, and characters always use the magic available to them in consistent, creative, /badass/ ways.

The Stormlight Archive is set on the world of Roshar, which is periodically ravaged by huge Highstorms that travel east to west, damaging everything in their path. The whole ecology & society is structured to deal with this (all cities are built with heavy fortifications to the east; all animals & plants have shells they can withdraw into for protection; etc.) Highstorms also carry with them a powerful magical infusion called stormlight, which can be used for various enchantment/transmutation abilities focused through devices called fabrials; there are also myths of the Knights Radiant, who could absorb stormlight and use it for varying magical effects based on the oaths they swore. Emotions and concepts can also generate tiny magical beings called spren--a wounded person might spawn painspren like little crawling hands, a victorious general might have gloryspren pop into existence like tiny golden orbs around his head, etc.

It's very, very good.

It's still unfinished, and it's free, so probably not the best recommendation for a present, but it's insanely good.

For a present, there's [[https://www.audible.com/pd/Rationality-From-AI-to-Zombies-Audiobook/B076ZY6Y9C][Rationality: From AI to Zombies]]. It's not fiction, but it's written by the author of HPMOR, and if your boyfriend hasn't read it yet, he'll probably appreciate it.
