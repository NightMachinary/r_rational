Hello, wisdom of crowds, I wonder if you'll help me find a title for a book?

With /Induction/ finished, I'm starting my next novel and I find myself stuck for a title. Given that I'm the person who named a book "The Two Year Emperor" because it was about a guy who would rule for two years and would eventually decide to call himself an emperor after 132,000 words...well, yeah, maybe a little wisdom of crowds would help.

I'm taking suggestions for the title; all of [[/r/rational]] in general and the submitter of the winning name in particular will get a 'thank you' in the book itself, and I'll send the chosen submitter a copy of the ebook before it goes for sale. (Note that I might riff off your title and use something slightly different.) Any help much appreciated!

Here's the blurb that will go on the 'back' of the book. Comments on the blurb also welcome:

--------------

Jess's father was a tinker, a golem-maker, a wizard who specialized in building the magical automata that do so much of the work of modern society. He wasn't the best in the world, nor the richest, nor the luckiest, but he /was/ the one who invented a new kind of golem, a kind that would transform the industry and change the shape of the world. The golem wasn't stronger or faster, it wasn't a better fighter or laborer. No, the secret that Peter Tinkersmith invented was simple: how to make a golem learn.

Unfortunately, mana -- the power that underlies all magic -- is derived from the collapse of worldlines. Anything and anyone with the potential to cause change generates mana, just in the process of existing...and, of course, they generate even more when their death eliminates all of those worldlines at once. A man whose invention could change the shape of the world was a potent source of energy, so perhaps the fire that claimed his life wasn't quite as accidental as the authorities ruled.

His daughter, Jess, had snuck out the night of the fire to win money at the mecho-fights. She came home to find her childhood home in smoldering ruins, her father dead, and her life shattered. Today she survives on the streets with Rob, her father's final golem, as her only companion. She eyes the shadows carefully, always wondering if the people who took her father might someday discover that she and Rob did not die with him. Every day she struggles to learn a bit more, understand a bit more, for knowledge is power and she will need all the power she can get to achieve her goal: forging a world where no child must come home to a father killed for the power of his death.

--------------


** - "The Tinker's Daughter" - If the work focuses more on Jess
- "The Murder of Worlds"
- "Thinking Machine" - If the work focuses more on Rob
- "The Tinker's Legacy"
- "Erudition" - If the book ends/results in FOOM.

"The Tinker's Daughter" is my favorite of these. Fits fantasy naming schema in my head, and makes you want to read the blurb.

*** Alternatively "The Tinker's Child" if you want more ambiguity, or "The Tinker's Children" for something a bit different.

**** It would make a good title to frame the relationship between them, but it's pretty long to fit on a book cover.

** "The Entropy Engine" is my submission. Or "The Golem, Yet Unformed" (which is an adaptation of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tehillim+139%3A16&version=OJB][Tehillim 139:16]]).

I think my general preference for titles is that they're evocative, have a double meaning, and don't have too many conflicts on Google. But matching tone is also important, so I doubt my suggestions are what you're looking for.

** "I t+h+ink, therefore I am" - silly title that popped into my head. The h, in case it's not clear enough, would be marked out but visible in some way.

** I have a strong preference for unique single word titles in the style of wildbow's naming scheme with /Worm/, /Pact/, and /Twig/. But thinking of a single good word to summarize your book which hasn't already been used before is hard.

- Golem
- Tinker (Wen Spencer already used this one)
- Clayshaper, Claytinker, Clayworker, Clayautomata or some other material+builder word for the title

But there are a few phrase-style titles I can come up with.

- Clay Machine
- Clay Fighter
- Clay and Magic
- Daughter of Clay, Friend of Clay, and Fighter of Clay
- Learning from Clay
- My Father the Clayshaper
- My Friend is Made of Clay
- The Clayshaper's Daughter
- Golem with Feet of Clay (references [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feet_of_clay][feet of clay]] and while it doesn't work with your summary, I was wondering if it fits any particular characterization of Jess or Rob)

Most of my title ideas basically can be summed up as combining the material of the golem (guessed to be clay) with some interaction between Jess and Rob.

If you liked "The Clayshaper's Daughter" and go with it, credit and the free book should go to JackStargazer since I was just trying to improve on "The Tinker's Daughter".

*** He's actually made of metal, I'm afraid. 'magesteel' (basically, enchanted steel) to be precise. I like the term 'clayshaper', though. I might build a specialist wizard character around the term...maybe an terramancer who got caught in a rogue mana surge while he was earthwalking; he became a sapient clay statue, retaining all his magical powers but now bearing the form of clay. His body is protean as long as he keeps himself from drying out.
