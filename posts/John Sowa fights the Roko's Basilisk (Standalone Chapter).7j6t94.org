** Roko's basilisk is the Doge meme of the LW community. Everyone wants it to die already, there are more people talking about it as "this thing that other people talk about" than people who ever took it "seriously", but 10 years later we still can't stop bringing it up again and again.

** Why does the protagonist do magic by incanting in Lojban? LOL

Also, it's bad lojban! And in chapter 7 it says "Eliezer's Basilisk".
