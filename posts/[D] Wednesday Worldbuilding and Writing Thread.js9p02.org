Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** So I've been working on a idea for story and had a few questions to make the world building a bit more coherent.

Story Title - Terms and Conditions

Elevator Pitch: The story is a comedy inspired by Yu-gi-oh, Metalocalypse, and Penny Arcade's paint the line. Where death, intricate conspiracies, destruction, social upheaval, rebellions, and more occur around simple games. All while the games master tries to do everything he can to ensure the games finish with minimal death and destruction since the stupid players constantly look for loopholes, unorthodox playing styles, and cheating to make the games more dangerous and chaotic.

The story takes place in a world similar to our own except for the existence of a very small number of people born with powers that often have strange conditions that can causes its strengths/capabilities to vary wildly. In the past before guns and science, they were the premier players of the world. But in modern times they are seen as little more than occasional scientific curiosities. Most governments give very generous incentives for people to register their powers and beyond a powered person using their power for occasional pranks or the odd crime every few years, they are pretty much ignored.

The main character is a man currently suffering from crippling depression and anxiety. He has recently gained a power that allows him to form mental contracts others, which forms a geas on the brains of the participants to give them incentive to follow the contract. If a person believes they have broken the contract, everyone under the geas instantly knows about it and they have to suffer a random mental penalty. But to compensate, there is also a random mental benefit you gain as soon as you are put under a geas to encourage the participants to follow the contract. This geas cannot be put on someone who is unwilling to have it. It must be voluntary.

The punishments are temporary and can include things like blindness, increased sensitivity to pain, severe and uncontrollable muscle tremors, the inability to recognize faces, unusual delusions, and visual/auditory hallucinations. Rewards can include things like enhanced senses, being able to temporarily use bullet time, increased memory recall to the point of mental time travel, a cure for mental disorders, improved learning capabilities, etc. If a person actively hates and fights the geas it only lasts a few weeks but otherwise it can actually last for months and potentially even longer if the person under the geas desires the benefits from staying under it.

Despite how powerful his ability is and how easily it would make him wealthy, the main character does not register himself as a powered person. He does not like or trust his government and considers them idiots beholden to the rich and immoral corporations that have ruined the world and the environment. Instead he decides to use his power to try and make himself happy and get over his depression by pushing people into playing games with him. As he is a former game designer who used to design board games and he has always been a huge fan of media involving mental battles, unorthodox strategies, and heavily studies game theory. Everything goes well until people realize that they can win a VERY powerful prize in his games and every single government, wannabe conspiracy, and more do everything in their power to win his games. Hilarity ensues.

So specific questions:

Realistically what US agency would be in charge of handling super powered people in the US if they were very rare and, usually, not particularly dangerous?

What are some realistic consequences if politicians and bureaucrats in government literally lost their ability to lie? Beyond the comedy aspects, which is probably going to be hard to write.

Any funny ideas for contests that people take WAY too seriously? So far I have: Bird Watching, a the floor is lava race across a desert, a massive card game tournament with unusual rules, and a scavenger hunt with simple clues that people over analyze.

*** If you gain benefits from entering into these contracts, could the contracts be stupidly specific and unlikely so that you could get these benefits without any real cost? "I promise not to eat live mongoose while married to a woman named Ermina Willingham III." And then make a dozen contracts like that so you get a range of benefits.

A high stakes game of chutes and ladders, or any other game where the outcome is completely outside the players' control, would be funny.

Losing the ability to lie isn't particularly bad, you just have to be clever about what you say. If it's a temporary affliction, they take some sick days off work.

**** Not really, you have to give up something meaningful or make a solemn promise for the power to kick in. If you say gave up eating any meat that would be enough to work. That said, there are certain circumstances where his power will improve and in his strong state he could make such a contract but it would probably not last very long or give you much of a benefit. The main character is also limited in how many contracts he can have open at once, so he probably wouldn't waste it.

The actual circumstances are due to a winner of a game winning while the main character is in a strong state and not realizing it. The winner gains the ability to make a rule that people have to follow in a certain range of themselves, as long as they themselves are willing to follow it. The winner makes a rule compelling people to tell the truth and goes to Washington, with a good chunk of the city suddenly losing the ability to lie without warning. It isn't just lying, you are literally compelled to tell the truth though you can just remain silent. But this isn't a good look for the politicians that choose not to talk to anyone. Funny chaos ensues before the winner comes clean and admits what they did out of guilt when there are several suicides/deaths. This act makes the gamesmaster infamous and leads to the chaos of the games as everyone dreams about what else they could win.

A completely random game could be funny though I think giving some way to change the dice rolls by adding/subtracting would make it more strategic depending on what they do.

Well, yeah. Of course adding some method of affecting the outcome would make it more strategic. But the humor is in having high stakes and analysis for a game that gives small children the illusion of strategy, but any adult sees after reading the rules that you do a bunch of dice rolls but ultimately have no method of changing your chance to win or playing better than your opponent. It's an overly complicated coin flip.

Imagine a character who is world renowned for winning the Chutes and Ladders World Championship 3 times in a row, and everyone in universe takes this seriously.

I'd definitely have a reveal that there is some crazy explanation for their victories--a demon, say--and that the character unwittingly loses the geas contest for 'cheating' despite thinking they'd won all those times with personal skill.

*** Self-modifying games like Nomic, Mao, or 1000 Blank White Cards could be interesting, although very complex when applied to this power. Especially since you typically play multiple rounds with round winners jockeying for more control of the series/tournament.

If you're looking for comedic effect, improv/theater games that encourage absurd behavior are a pretty direct path: think of playing Zip-Zap-Zop with somebody famously dignified, like the Pope or the Dalai Lama. Party games like Truth or Dare or Spin the Bottle fall into this category, too. Doubly so, since many of these have no victory condition, or extremely subjective/vague victory conditions.

Collaborative/co-operative games like Pandemic where all the players either win or lose together would be interesting from an outside game-theoretical perspective. Some people might strategically try to lose on purpose, effectively introducing meta-level of co-opetition. Games that allow multiple winners or allied victory are also similar.

Or you could distort children's games like Musical Chairs or Duck Duck Goose into horrifying bloodbaths.

Would the power be extensible to games played asynchronously/asymmetrically/remotely? Could the person with the power just publish a YouTube video with a "You laugh you lose" or "you flinch you lose" challenge and see the world line up to attempt it?

***** What the main character specifically does is create a projection of himself and anything he is wearing within line of sight. He wears a costume/mask, not sure what he wears, that he uses to hide his nervousness/stage right. This projection forcibly creates a telepathic link of the people that are directly around it. This link makes it impossible to lie or tell half-truths as people can see each other's thoughts and feelings. He can only keep the link active for about ten minutes before he gets a massive headache and he will eventually fall unconscious if he keeps pushing things. While people are linked is when you can actually make a contract.

In his games, he hides somewhere nearby with a telescope or camera than projects his appearance near the people who want to play. Once he becomes famous, there are hordes of people wearing his costume and showing up wherever he announces the next game so it is much easier to hide.

I don't think you could do a youtube that was by itself supernatural but he normally posts a puzzle on a website that if solved shows the location of the next game. That said there are other power users in the world so I could imagine someone makign a contract with the gamesmaster to boost their power for help. So maybe.

The Liar Game has a great musical chairs arc that had alot of strategy and was related to gambling. I have a vague idea of a large scale game as the first big game held after the world becomes aware of the gamesmaster. The large amount of losers and the unpleasant side effects of losing are used to discourage too many players from playing at once. Because realistically if such a game was offered where you could win mental superpowers or cure a mental illness in the US at least, the number of people who would come to play would be huge.

I was thinking of some type of dice or card game with betting as a major component and you have to earn a certain amount to make it to the next game. The trick is that you can only bet beanie babies or something silly like that with the more valuable the beanie babie the more it is worth in betting. Perhaps also a rule that you can only bet with beanie babies you are directly carrying by yourself to keep rich people from buying out entire stores. Plus I just love the absurdity of criminals cheating and killing each other to steal someone's beanie baby collection and someone saying the line, " I raise you a claude the crab," with complete seriousness.

**** For less conventional games, you have the publicity stunt style of contest/endurance trial, like putting four people in a phone booth or requiring then to put their left hand on the surface of a car with the winner being the last to give up and leave. Or things like the dance-athon.

Spelling bees are already hilariously tense and over-dramatized, applying the same atmosphere to normal people who are not semi-traumatized 11-year-olds who train obsessively could be hilarious.

Arrangements where a single person who is not themselves a player get to select a winner at their sole direction could create fun scenarios. Think, the Bachelor type of contest. The Bachelor has lots of power here, but only one of the contestants can actually win. Most reality TV competitions or game shows are actually pretty ripe for this as well, especially if you want to get into satirizing how rigged these contests can be and how that might or might not mesh well with this power.

I'd hide the fact that they've lost the ability to lie, at first--and just have one politician go mute while the rest are on recess or something. When they get back chaos ensues, with a manhunt for the person causing lying to be impossible. All the while everyone involved can't help but give genuine reasons to want to be able to lie again--personal embarrassments, mostly, as a way of screening their political motivations.

You could make a big deal about how the MC has a contingency option that he won't use because it's too powerful and dangerous. When he is forced to use it, it should be challenging someone to "The Game," which of course you instantly lose by thinking about. Turns out neither player has heard of it (or his memory was wiped and all he knows is that his opponent will instantly lose if he brings it up) so a bystander decides the winner by explaining it to one or the other.

You could parody all the insane extra rules for rock paper scissors. Two players in a solemn competition keep making up weirder and weirder hand signs and meanings. Jumpcut to whiteboarding the interactions between fifty hand signs.

You could have someone challenge someone else to tic-tac-toe, undergoing a contract 'if you lose'. It's a tie. Then they get into an argument about whether a tie is a loss. The loser of the argument necessarily is the loser overall--meaning you can talk about the Lawyer paradox.

You can have him moderate the Ultimatum game, except each participant secretly arranged for their friend to communicate threats to the other participant (since the participants cannot speak). Like "If you give him less than 51% of the total, he's committed to burning your house down." "Aha, my teammate thought of that, and has already sold his house!" or some other barely-plausible escalation.

Other than those game ideas, you should have a scene early on where the MC goes on live television with some world leaders to explain how he arranged for all of them to agree to a treaty where none would try to use his powers for political gain, and will punish anyone who does. The loss of the mental benefits that the contract provides would disadvantage any defector--they agreed to it in response to a 'mental benefits arms race'--but the punishment that the others would mete out ends up being their primary motivation. Also the scene culminates in the world leaders singing and dancing, the second part of his Geas, as proof that it is genuine.

Feel free to change these ideas however it suits you.

** Cantrips are minor spells. In D&D, they are, like all other spells, mostly themed around dungeoncrawling. Imagine you lived in a quasi-modern world, where introductory magic theory was a high school class. Not everyone learns, even most who learn the basics have little true aptitude. But the end result is that maybe 80% of the population can cast a few minor cantrips. With all that cumulative brainpower thrown into the mix, we'd definitely get some cantrips that were actually optimized for daily life, or work.

What cantrip-level spells would you want for your job, or daily life? What might other professions want? What are some non-standard uses for existing cantrips that could be applied to normal circumstances? For example, when I posed this question to my friends, one got hung up on how Mage Hand could revolutionize competitive gaming, just by freeing players from the limitation of their physical number of button-pressing digits. A divination to immediately comprehend dimensions or sizes might be invaluable for many professions, say, carpenters.

*** Existing cantrips:

- Guidance is a D&D cantrip that gives a small bonus (+1 in 3.5, +1d4 in 5E) to any skill check. If cantrips can be cast constantly like 5E ones, then this one cantrip is enough to justify the high school magic curriculum by itself. Especially for professions that consist of bashing your head against a problem until you succeed, like artists and engineers, you'd want to cast that constantly (unless you had a better, non-stacking bonus).

- Cure Minor Wounds (3.5), in addition to curing a paltry 1 HP, also stabilizes a dying person, making it competitive with a complete course in EMT training.

- Mending is a lot better than glue, tape, etc, so that's worth knowing.

- Minor Illusion doesn't have any canonical limitation in fidelity, so that's a remarkably powerful tool for data visualization, communication, giving presentations, and so forth.

- Prestidigitation is, as always, endlessly useful. It flavors food, so that's at least enough to barely learn to cook and never buy spices.

New spells:

- All sorts of minor divinations would be useful. Magically measuring things is very handy, I'd expect a lot of variation on that by trade - off the top of my head carpenters, architects, transportation engineers, tailors, chemists, and athletes.. Medical divinations seem particularly important - even if it's just weight/height/pulse/blood pressure that's some time saved for a nurse and a godsend for an EMT. I wonder whether magic's idea of how hard error-checking is differs enough from a compiler's idea to be useful in programming.

- Mending only works on broken things, but if you could make a variant that works on raw materials then you can use that for superior welding, carpentry, and other trades. I feel like a material-specific version has to be limited enough to count as a cantrip (Weld, Join Wood, etc).

- There are attack cantrips that create fire or frost, which presumably could be modified into more efficient and less combat-ready forms of heating and cooling for chemical processes.

- There are attack cantrips that create small amounts of a material - acid in particular is popular. Again, a version that fills a cup with acid can probably make more acid than a version that was designed to fling acid at your enemies (Create Water makes at least two gallons of the stuff). It's not clear whether the conjured acid disappears - free matter creation is always interesting, but temporary matter is even more interesting chemically. Imagine a chemist gets to perform an experiment in an acid solution, then the acid disappears, precipitating the result instantly.

If nothing better were possible, a divination to make you notice those hard-to-spot syntax errors would be invaluable. Something like "bring something I would recognize as an error more directly to my attention" seems like the sort of thing Vancian magic can do easily, because of how the writers conceptualize (or, rather, /don't/ conceptualize) magical data processing.

*** Considering what other things the cantrips do, it'd probably be really easy/cheap to make a combination of a specialized cantrip and a specialized non magical USB I/O device, that is a far higher bandwidth+more intuitive in both direction to all our current I/O devices like screens or keyboards.

Failing that, using Minor Illusion inside a controlled camera setup would still instantly let you move complex images from your visual cortex to software on the computer, letting anyone with the cantrip do in seconds what takes a digital artist or 3d modeler hours. Not only would this revolutionize the arts, it'd also be highly useful for CAD, any scientific use that needs a 2d data array, etc. You might also be able to crate the illusion of hovering text or a written text, which together with text recognition AI lets you input text in a similar way.

Any cantrip that create matter from nothing (like Create Water) OR telekinetic force (like Mage Hand) would utterly revolutionize everything related to space, and shift things violently back to favoring manned spaceflight, because you have infinite Delta-V and probably have to carry a lot less supplies for life support.

Can mending fix broken /software/? Even if it has to have been fully functioning in the past, that still solves enormous swaths of system administration and tech support. It'd also be extremely handy for lost backups, hard drive restoration, etc.

Any spell that cools things break thermodynamics, and has a ton of scientific uses cooling small samples or high tech equipment. It's also really handy when your food is to hot so you don't have to wait for it to cool down. It could also have uses for pushing any tech that needs a cooling system and gets overheated, from gaming PCs to machineguns.

Looking at druidcraft and heal minor wounds, you could probably create some really powerful but extremely small scale agricultural/rapid growth spells, useless for staple crops but extremely valuable for spices, medicine-producing or sample bacteria, rapid testing of genetically engineered organisms, stem cells, etc.

You could probably fairly easily make a "recharge batteries" cantrip from Shocking Grasp and Mend, that's really useful in everyday life (no more having to plug your phone into the wall for hours!) but also in survival situations recharging things like flashlights or water purifiers.

Cantrips can produce small amounts of chemicals, such as acid or noxious gas. It is possible that with modern testing, R&D budgets, and knowledge of chemistry, you could create more powerful substances such as medicines, drugs, much more lethal toxins, neutralizing agents, etc.

Combining the above with the healing and druidcraft bits, and the brain-targeting of Message, and modern knowledge of brain anatomy, you might be able to create an infinitely repeatable and extremely addictive "wirehead" cantrip, that just creates overwhelming pleasure and joy. This one would probably be quite illegal, but also have the biggest incentive to be created and the most popular.

Trustrike could probably be modified slightly to be useful aiming other things than attacks, and a lot of devices and skills involve hitting a narrow target. Also this is combat related but it'd be much more powerful with combat being so dominated by guns.

Mold earth can replace various earthmoving machines. Minor illusion would be a pretty fantastic teaching aid, and would have a thousand other small uses. Prestidigitation, the cleaning part of it, would be hugely useful in the medical field.

As for potential cantrips, minor magical things that would be useful in a dungeon crawl but would be revolutionary in a society: A sterilize water cantrip. Would have prevented any number of disease outbreaks, but is minor enough in a game as to barely merit mention. A boil water cantrip would have a similar function but also be convenient for 1st world people.

*What if anti-procrastination pill was invented?*

Imagine a pill, that if taken daily, removes the need to procrastinate, and prevents akrasia. After taking it, for 24 hours, your actual behavior matches your conscious goals and values, and you are incapable of acting against your rational judgement. You feel motivated to achieve your goals, in order on how important and practical they are. You find it easy to delay gratification, and are not easily distracted from your tasks.

I'm a chronic procrastinator, but one of the things that I've learned is that at least some of my procrastination isn't procrastination. The problem isn't that I am having trouble doing this thing I want to do. The problem is that I've convinced myself that I want or should want to do something that I don't really want.

Now, this doesn't account for all of my procrastination. Honestly probably not more than 10% of it. But the segment it does cover has been really important to my personal growth and understanding of myself. If I could just take a pill and suddenly have the truth that there are some things I just don't want made apparent to me without the need/opportunity for extended introspection, I'm not sure how things would change for me, but it seems likely to be just as dramatic as the actual effect of removing procrastination from my habits.

**** I just want to write a cool fantasy story really, and I don't mind the world too much. What I am going with for now is: an Isekai fantasy (not litRPG) where the story is rarely from the perspective of the isekaied "MC" (but always furthers their plot, as in, the perspectives are all about the MC). And the protag got Isekaied into a hive-mind head-crab(s). - As in, they are a parasitic hive-mind organism which takes control of other creatures (including humans).

The idea is I really like other perspective but hate them when they 1. Don't progress the plot, 2. are about a completely different plot. And I also really like Isekais + non-human protags (especially if they are traditionally "evil" beings), Hence that is what I wanna do.

As you can see, that setting works in almost any world, and I don't mind it really, the only consequence is the follow-on effects in the world's culture the more magic there is which means more world-building (which I don't really want to do).

***** Thanks for the clarification, so you'd mainly like ideas for the consequences the magic system would have for the world? If you post a summary of how it works and the kind of things it can do, I could give it a look

****** no no, I'd like someone (who likes doing this and would like to do this for fun) to actually MAKE the magic system, world, maps, politics, and consequences off all this. Like actually just do the whole world-building.

I wouldn't mind using someone else's already created world as well if they don't mind me using it. Just I figured some people like doing this and I don't, so why not ask?

***** Please clarify, is this for a setting in which the main character has been reincarnated as a parasitic hive-mind and we see their actions from the perspective of the native host species, or a setting in which the main character has been reincarnated as a human, but where the primary perspective is a parasitic hive-mind organism whose plans are foiled by the protagonist? These have somewhat different world-design constraints, as you can probably imagine.

****** Yeah, the first one. isekaied into a parasitic hive-mind, and the local species (human/semi-furry or fantasy races w/e) we see the perspective off mostly. I'm imagining the Isekaided hive-mind character is doing a lot of base-building in the "wild", which most of the native characters only see the tip off, but through implication can see the progress of the "MC".

I think I have a world for you.

I intended to use it myself, but this makes more sense I think.

TLDR: Imagine a multiversal level species of godlike aliens, who love to watch "spectator sports", of the strategy/tactics variety. What they do is they pluck the an entire race of sentients, like humans, and teleport them, naked and unarmed, on a completely virgin version of their planet. The planet would be just like Earth, if humans never evolved on it.

Now, about 1 in a billion of humans, instead of being bodily inserted there, are instead turned into a a hive of parasites that can take over humans without the humans detecting them. The human "victims" think they have free will, and have a blind spot that prevents them from noticing the head-crab, theirs or on others. Only the insane, brain damaged, or extremely drunk/high humans can notice the crabs, but only briefly before the control is re-asserted. Otherwise, the crabs control them in a way that feels like it was their natural idea.

The game the Crabs must play is thus: the 8 hiveminds each are given a different place in the world, and access to a similar starting population. Their goal is to create a world-spanning empire in 5000 years, and defeat all the other Crab Hives. The last Hive standing is rewarded with being "uplifted" to a status of a godlike being just like the Spectators. The losers have their minds deleted from the face of space-time.

- Each Hive starts with one crab controlling one human. They must not only breed new crabs but also FIND the other humans.

- Human population is spread optimally all over the virgin planet (more where there is good land and pleasant weather, fewer on the deserts or the polar region). The Hives must reach these humans as fast as possible, lest the humans die of exposure, or form their own hostile tribes.

- both the Hives and the natural humans only have as much survival knowledge as they would normally have, and must learn through trial and error. Most humans will die, and some Hives might even fail before their war starts.

- Essentially, this would be a bit of a LitRTS world, with Hives as "players" controlling their populations through the continents and centuries, but also LitRPG about individual humans within the Hives (and "wild", uncontrolled humans) having adventures and "leveling up" at survival and then, at the skills needed to further the empires. So for example, one chapter could follow the thought process and strategic battles of the Hive, while another focuses on the adventures of a particular guy who first deals with the wilderness "Robinson Cruse/Cast Away" style, then becomes a leader of a tribe, then a general of the Hive's empire, being unknowingly manipulated.

- I would prefer to have the setting be low-magic. Basically the only magic in it would be the psychic power of the Hive that allows it to not just control, but upgrade and "level up" its individual slaves. This should allow the individual humans to use feats of "magical seaming" levels of knowledge, almost superhuman skill and "precognition" where in fact they would be just tapping unconsciously into the power given by the Hive. Other than that, this would start as survivalist setting of humans VS prehistoric wild nature, and then human empires vs other human empires.

What do you think?

****** Cool, but unfortunately not at all aligned with my subjective tastes; I don't like any setting where there are some higher-beings creating games etc for lower ones and humans being one of them. Don't enjoy any artificial "death games" like fate/stay night, Dungeon crawler Carl etc or any xanxia which continuously increasing power-levels etc. I am pretty set on wanting just a standard fantasy world like Azarynth healer, Life of a Summoned Demoness, Shade touched etc but no system for a generic isekai story.\\
What I'm after is anyone who is interested in thinking up the specifics; the magic system, the political and geographical situation and characters etc.

Thanks though.
