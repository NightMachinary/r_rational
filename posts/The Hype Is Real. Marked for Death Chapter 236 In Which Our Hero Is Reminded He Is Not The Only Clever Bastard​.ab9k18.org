** So I dropped this story when the mc got inducted to leaf and it felt like all the risk of him dying left me for some reason so should I pick it back up again? I really wanted them to find their own village or something because being in leaf seemed like you won the game. I also didn't like how the mc was going for a harem with ino and was rationalizing it.

*** It really didn't turn that way.. reality ensued. In regards to Akane..Also they might have joined leaf but remember they still used to be missing nin from another villiage. And Jiraiya's tenure as hokage can be described shaky as best with the other clans clamouring to maneuver for the hat.

I didn't really like that either, so I voted against plans that tilted in that direction as much as I could.

*** The stakes are indeed different now, with less focus on surviving and more on winning. (Also, no harem.)

** Sorry for necroing the thread.

I've been catching up to this story (currently on ch. 59) and I like it so far.

The only issue I have is that I've been having a hard time finding out what the final votes are that lead to the chapters that get written. Do you happen to know if the voting results are somehow linked/highlighted in an easy to search way?

Usually the QMs do a good job of explaining things so you don't necessarily need to know what the vote was to understand what's going on. But sometimes I feel like I'm missing a bit of information about what motivated the group to take a certain action. And it's not fun hunting through pages of comments to figure it out.
