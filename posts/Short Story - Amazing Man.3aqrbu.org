[[http://www.deathisbadblog.com/amazing-man/][Amazing Man]] I dashed off a little short story, inspired by the Sad Puppies Hugo Fiasco. I had fun writing it, I hope someone finds it enjoyable to read. I don't think it's Rational or Rationalist really, but it kinda waves in that direction in the few thousand words I had. For anyone who reads it... would it be approriate to post to [[http://rationalfiction.io/]] ?


** Please leave politics out of the sub. This isn't rational or rationalist at all, it's political satire. This doesn't belong here.

I don't see how. Did you seriously set out to write a rational protagonist, and end up with this?

**** Then why did you post it here?

For that matter, why'd you ask if it should be posted at the ratfic site when it isn't rational/ist?

***** Honestly, it because I'm still not entirely sure what rationalist fic is. I know we've been trying to define it for a while, and there's a lot of cases where it's very obvious that something fits in the genre. This story referenced a few items but it didn't have a rational protagonist or a rationalist storyline, and I was wondering if it would slip in as an edge case or be entirely out of bounds. When my view of the boundaries is very blurry I try to prod at the edges. This was an obvious failure, but it wasn't obvious to me before I asked.
