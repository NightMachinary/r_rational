It appears that rationalfiction.io (listed in the wiki) is down. Anyone know who was running it?


** Try using [[http://rationalreads.com/][rationalreads]]. It's not being maintained too much now, but it still links to most of the older rational fiction posted to this subreddit.

I used to have admin access due to posting the most works to the site.

*** No, it wasn't really active. It does fit a need, that of a durable location to collate all the recs and anti-recs. (There was talk of setting up a bot for a similar purpose but it was overshadowed by drama.)
