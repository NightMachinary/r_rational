Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I was reading about a vampire not having a reflection today and I thought of a cool way to munchkin this ability. Wear sunglasses with the top half of the lens facing your eyes covered in a mirror. Anytime you want to be able to see behind yourself, just look at the mirror-lens and you will be able to see behind you due to not having a reflection. You'll literally have eyes in the back of your head!

Just an interesting way to munchkin a vampire trait I wanted to share.

*** it is so meta that you are off-topic in an off-topic thread...

here should be stuff that doesn't fit somewhere else... in [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. It isn't really a problem, but you might get more responses in the saturday munchkinery thread.

also not sure what that trick could help with... could be a nice worldbuilding thing... but traditional vampires are so overpowered, it doesn't matter to them anymore...

** I binged "Dragon Prince" on netflix earlier this week due to the recommendation posted, and would like to pass on that recommendation. It's a well built story with interesting characters, that also happens to hit in the strike zone of topics I like to see covered by a fictional work. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but check it out on netflix if you have it.

On a related note, I notice that [[/r/rational]] is probably the best recommendation engine I have available to me. It's worked for movies, books, anime, and even webcomics. But notably, [[/r/rational]] hasn't been at all useful at recommending music. That's not really a surprise, as listening to music as a form of entertainment is far less "thinky" than anything else I do for fun. That being said, I was wondering if people here felt the opposite way-- that when [[/r/rational]] recommends music, that music is typically in line with your tastes.

--------------

Has anyone watched/is watching /Designated Survivor/ on netflix? I've been really enjoying the show (it makes me think of bald eagles and productive oilfields), but have had trouble believing the government would be as disunited as it is in the show after such an attack. Am I overestimating the US's capability to respond to crisis with a united front, or are the producers just making the governors (for example) more adverserial because it makes for better television?

**** Right now, at the very top of my ongoing list are:

- [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/][SMBC]]-- Gag a day; so consistently funny I've been reading it since middle school.\\
- [[http://www.prequeladventure.com/][Prequel]]-- Very loosely a Skyrim quest, featuring reader input and way too much effort on the part of the writer (he literally programs small games for some episodes.
- [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][The Order of the Stick]]-- Self-aware DnD Fantasyish stick figure comic with a surprisingly deep plot.
- [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]] A flying brick superhero realizes that fighting crime isn't necessarily the most effective way to effect positive change.
- [[https://www.gocomics.com/endtown/2009/01/19][Endtown]]-- A gritty, biopunk, postapocalyptic sci-fi.
- [[https://www.poppy-opossum.com/comic/a-story/][Poppy]]-- I got nothing. It goes in ways you'd never expect. The fight scenes are extremely shonen, which is impressive for a webcomic featuring Funny Animals.
- [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html][UNSOUNDED]]-- Fantasy epic with gorgeous art and fantastic worldbuilding that makes excellent use of the webpage medium.
- [[https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2000-06-12][Schlock Mercenary]]-- Long running sci-fi epic that makes a serious examination of both the technology and ethics of a far-advanced spacefaring society, and how to be a really effective mercenary. Also, it's hilarious.

Completed, I've really enjoyed:

- [[http://www.genocideman.com/][Genocide Man]]-- The art is meh, the story is a fantastically disturbing piece of sci-fi.
- [[https://www.nuklearpower.com/2001/03/02/episode-001-were-going-where/][8-bit theater]]-- Absolutely hilarous; every main character is a terrible person, and it features a brick joke that took the entire comic to pay off)
- [[https://www.baldwinpage.com/spacetrawler/2010/01/01/spacetrawler-4/][Spacetrawler]]-- Sci-fi. It's been forever since I read it, but I still vividly remember the hilarious facial expressions and not insignificant amount of feels.
- [[http://www.rice-boy.com/order/][Order of Tales]]/[[http://www.rice-boy.com/see/][Rice Boy]]--two different webcomics set in the same universe. Hard to describe, but feature excellent storytelling. [[http://www.rice-boy.com/vattu/][Vattu]], incomplete, is also in the same universe.

edit: so I binge-read Spacetrawlers in three hours after I tried to refresh myself on it. It is very, /very/ good sci-fi with likeable characters, comedy, drama, and tragedy in spades. I very highly recommend it. (Also it's technically ongoing because there's a continuation series, but it doesn't really hold up to the original.)

***** More on PREQUEL:

It's story borrowing some of the format from Homestuck (parts of narration and animation, reader interactivity, chapters punctuated by commands, mini-games every so often) to tell a completely different, and much more compelling story. Seriously, the format is hard to describe, go check it out and it'll be much clearer.

The story features a Khajit fleeing a life of shame, homelessness and possibly prostitution, and trying to have a fresh start on Cyrodill, a few weeks before the events of TES: Oblivion (hence the name). The protagonist is implied to maybe be the hero of Kvatch.

It's a really depressing story, especially at first. Katia has no enemy except herself, her alcoholism, lack of self-confidence, lack of a job or trade skills, etc. There are several moments in the story that go "Oh fuck, no no no no no don't do it OH FUCK SHE DID IT" that are incredibly depressing and probably make a lot of people quite the story. I think there's huge value in reading past those moments, and seeing how Katia picks herself up and tries to get back to building herself a life despite everything.

It's a really odd story that you don't see anywhere else. Katia isn't an adventuring superhero that infiltrates manors, kills monsters or decides the fate of countries. Her stakes are small, and so are her successes, and yet they feel incredibly rewarding. I still get goosebumps when I read the page where Katia throws that [THING] on the ground, pants, looks like she's about to cry, and sets it on fire with a scream of rage.

****** Magic is done by a kind of programming language of reality. You are near a waterfall? You can invoke the specific coordinates of that falling water and enact the momentum on someone else. Or the hardness of a brick wall or the sharpness of a spear.

Its a high fantasy setting, and we follow a tiny young girl on her first adventure to make her father proud, only for it all to escalate to conspiracies and thaumaturgical weapons of mass destruction. Slow start and really rich (maybe too rich) visual style.

*** Regarding designated survivor: We LOVED Season 1, but midway through Season 2 we started calling it "Terrible President Show" and hate-watching it.

The decline in quality was noticeable and major. It becomes so badly unrealistic in some things (IT, "that's now how the FBI works",etc) that even I, who normally puts a blind eye to stuff like this, got annoyed.

I'm hoping being bought by Netflix will make season 3 better.

** I really liked [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FJEtCvb2Kw][this video essay]] on "manufactured authenticity".

I've also been thinking a fair amount about a sequel series to [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][/Shadows of the Limelight/]], not in terms of actually making a plot or creating characters, but in terms of what I would want the work to be saying, which would then serve as the springboard for thinking about the kinds of characters and/or plot that would serve to say those things.

Media, especially modern, fully adaptive media, serves as not just entertainment, but as a way to fulfill social and emotional desires. That makes it more important that someone playing their role plays it both in and "out" of character. But because people know that, there are meta layers to the character/actor distinction, where the character has quality X, the actor maintains a persona with quality X, and then there are occasional glimpses at "the real actor" which are actually manufactured in order to seem real to people who deeply need to believe that they're not being fooled (because if they were being fooled, it would ruin it for them, and the assumption is that everyone is inauthentic).

And then this all ties in with why/how people become stalkers, super-fans, or obsessive about particular personalities, because the edifices of public personality that get constructed are so real that they're indistinguishable from actual reality, and actually, because they're /optimized/ for appearing real, they can appear /more/ real than things that are /actually/ real.

Yeah, Lindsay Ellis does the best video essays.

Otherwise, I don't know about movie celebrities, but I've often noticed the opposite effect with internet celebrities, where people say that they're just playing a character when making political points or doing a "angry game reviewer" kind of shtick; but when you look at the opinions they express in interviews and other semi-unprepared media, they maintain traits of their persona that make you think "oh, this is actually really the way she thinks".

** I'm goin' on another work trip next week! I'm going to be driving through an "outback" type area for a few days with my colleagues, doin' our work, and then I'll be staying in a tiny but touristy town for another 3 days. I'm looking forward to it so much; I've never been there before (it costs $~300 to fly to Indonesia, and about $500 to fly to this part of Australia). And I'll take a bunch of photos.

(NB: the place I'm going is not really "the outback" because it's far up north so it's got tropical weather, but it's got [[https://s1.at.atcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/AT_2018JUN05_OnlineStory_OutbackBreaksWilpena3.jpg][long desolate expanses of red sand]], so...)

Anyone have advice for travelling solo? I'm going to be by myself for 3 days. I get really lonely so I have booked a bed in a 4 bedroom dorm at a youth hostel, but the hostel manager informed me that their guests tend to mostly be fruitpickers, so my plan of "finding a travel buddy" may have been too much.

Fortunately I've already made plans for two of the three days (Day 1: drive an hour and go on a scenic river cruise; Day 2: go to a wildlife rehabilitation centre in the afternoon), and am planning on just going into town and finding all the tourist traps on google and dealing with those.

also always have a towel with you... no clue why... but some famous writer read it in a travel guide...

if you want a travel buddy, maybe look on meetup.com or couchsurfing.com for people and write them if they want to go to tourist traps

some people do that with dating sides/tinder but no clue if that works... all depends on how many people in that region use such websites
