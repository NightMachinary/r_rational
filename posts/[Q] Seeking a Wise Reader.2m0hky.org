As y'all probably know, the Kickstarter for "Pay Attention" hit not one but /two/ stretch goals. For each of these stretch goals, I am writing a rational story (one horror, one fantasy) of at least 10,000 words.

The first one is done; it's 15,000 words of rational horror entitled "Baby Blues." I have sent out notices to all backers that the ARC is available, and I've done enough touch-ups on it that I'm generally happy. Before I sign off on it completely, however, I'd like someone to do a Wise Reading(*) for me. If you're interested I'll send you a download link for it (it's in HTML).

Any takers?

(*) Wise Reading = read, take notes as you go about your reactions to various parts. When you finish, send me your notes along with any further comments you have. Copyedits are welcome but not expected.

I can be reached at [[mailto:david.storrs@gmail.com][david.storrs@gmail.com]]

PLEASE NO UNTAGGED SPOILERS IN COMMENTS.

*** No problem! I'll catch you next time. I write enough stuff that there will always be something in the pipeline, and I could always use a Wise Reader...or even just a copyeditor.

**** I've never done it before, mind, so I might not be your optimal source... but having read the linked description, it seems to fit my skill set well. I'll give it my best shot next time.

Incidentally, copy-editing is /also/ well within my skill set, ha ha.

** I'd be up for doing it. A couple of warnings: 1. I don't get scared by anything (most people say that, but it's not really true. It is with me), 2. I'm not sure how "wise" of a reading I could give (and yes I have read the post about it), though I am working out a good method for doing it, and 3. I haven't read very many (any) horror novels.

Anyways, I could do it, if none of those warnings bother you.

*** Thanks, I appreciate it. None of those things are issues -- "Baby Blues" isn't a scary story, it's a horror story...as in, at the end, you should find yourself thinking "that's horrifying." Whatever comments you have are welcome. No experience needed.

Note that I'm putting this in response to everyone who's stepped for so that you'll all see it in your messages. For anyone reading the thread, this will probably look weirdly repetitive.

**** Additionally, do you mind if I copy+paste this into Google Docs to critique it? Or are you, like me, incredibly skeptical of their copyright system and so wanting me to do it in a Word document?

**** Well. Fuck that noise. "Not scary, just horrifying." Shoulda been a warning.

** How soon would you need it back? I could probably get it back to you by the end of next week, and I'm not sure if that's too long. I'm in a writers group where we critique each other a lot, so I have some experience, but I wouldn't say I'm great at it or anything.

Oh, and if you want to offer it to your writers group, I would not object at all. ;>

*** FYI, I just did some heavy revision on the "and now, Ben will exposit!!!" scene. You may want to pull it down again (same link [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/writing/KS/first_stretch_goal.html]])

A few minor tweaks outside of that scene, but nothing important.
