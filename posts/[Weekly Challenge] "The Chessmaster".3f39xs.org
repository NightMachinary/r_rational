   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: last-week
   :END:
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e98lr/weekly_challenge_rational_horror/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Rational Horror". [[/u/JackStargazer]] is the winner with his story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e98lr/weekly_challenge_rational_horror/ctdhyex]["The Real You"]], and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations [[/u/JackStargazer]]! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

** This Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
The prompt for next week is "The Chessmaster". This is the character with layers upon layers of deception and backup plans for when the backup plans fail. Sometimes, being the chessmaster means sacrificing a few pawns. Other times, it means recognizing which piece is really the king. For more, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster][see the entry at TVTropes.]] Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, August 5th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance.

** Rules

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][in the meta thread]]. Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Week
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-week
   :END:
Next week's prompt is "Clones, Clones, and Clones!". Whether through literal cloning, time travel shenanigans, or multiplication superpowers, one person (or multiple people) ends up with multiple copies running around - perhaps with divergent goals.

*Next week's thread will go up on 8/5.* Please confine any questions or comments to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3][the meta thread]].

*** A great story. (found it through EY's post history, not surprisingly) Thank you so much for writing it! I hope you'll publish this one and many more after it.

Found one typo, "we can get going Gavin" - comma missing.

It would've made a fine beginning of a fine novel. Or, rather, as someone Gavin-like might've put it -

Too bad it probably wouldn't make a novel. The protagonists are too powerful; nothing could ever be a challenge for them. Indeed. Such a pity. Sigh. I could be a good beta-reader for that one, too.

**** Thanks for the feedback!

I'll be a bit shameless and mention that I've written another story for this week's challenge, so you should check it out. :)

And as far as a novel goes, if I were to expand, it would have to transcend any domestic threats. It'd probably become more about inter-Organization conflict or external threats. As it stands, the local country is their territory. And there's nothing to be done. Only reason it isn't out of hand is because of the one per person rule and the implicit unknown payments. It's easier for a noble to hire some mercenaries than to make a request. You don't want to know what happens if you don't pay the Organization.

Pronounced, I presume, "Loki"?

Very clever story. I like the air of the setting, and the Opposed live up to the villainous feel of their name. And the usage of -X- as your break was a very nice touch. Overall fantastic. I'd just like to know what Gavin's fourth manipulo-request was!

*** I didn't realize until most of the way through that italics and regular were the two different sides -- I thought regular were official reports and italics were in-person discussion. It made for a confusing read.

As to making it more clear, maybe something like this?

(Regular) All H-class battleships: Begin shelling at 0200 to cover landfall, focus initially on AAA batteries.\\
All bombing groups: Begin airstrikes at 0300.

(Italics) Sir, forward recon reports a major enemy push coming. We've sighted a naval force, mix of battleships and transports; looks like they're trying for a land assault. There's a bomber group immediately behind them, and at current speed they'll arive an hour after the ships.
