** An interesting concept, but $50 for even a digital copy is too rich for my tastes by half.

*** It must be /a lot/ of work to research all this stuff, get in contact with experts of many different fields, draw and write it up, etc.

I'd rather pay a bit more than have half-hearted or wrong information.

** I'm posting about this Kickstarter project, because while there have been other rare books written about what a time traveler/post-apocalyptic survivor would need to know to construct this or that invention as part of rebuilding human civilization, I don't think there has been anything like this where it's reproduced as an amazing art book.

The example illustrations are amazing, and unlike many of the books where all of the focus is on the science/inventions, this book also covers music, society, and fashion. Sure, they aren't "essential" to building civilization, but they'll teach you how to charm people long enough to convince them you are worth listening to. I loved that novel twist on the concept.

The Kickstarter is doing amazingly well, and has raised nearly half a million to make this book within less than a week of starting!

** They should send it to the parallel universe Codex Seraphinianus came from to give them a proper mind fuck.

** I backed many projects in the past and now suddenly I get this error from KickStarter: "The card has been declined for an unknown reason.", nothing wrong with my bank either. Is there any other way to preorder the book for the current prices?

*** Not that I know of sorry. But try reentering card details into the KS account? There's still 2 days left to pledge.

If your problem can't be fixed quickly contact the creators and ask if they can reserve a backer spot for you. Sometimes people will do that when needed.

**** I tried. Even tried with 2x different CC, located at completely different banks. It finally worked with a 3rd CC.

** Isn't 400 pages to short? In order to rebuild civilization you'd need to know a lot about agriculture, but also medicine. Like the making of vaccines, or at least how to make very simple ones, how to make the most important medicines like insulin and thyroid hormones and acetylsalicylic acid. How to make glasses and how to assist with child birth gone wrong. How much of a crop to plant in order to sustain a set number of people and best practice when it comes to agriculture based on different climates. This seems like it could be a really great work, but the paper probably needs to be as thin as that of the common bible and the writing as small and the pages more numerous.

I really really wish for this book to be as amazing as I'm picturing it, but I am worried it will just contain a very very small amount of the knowledge needed.
