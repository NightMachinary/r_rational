** Cash4Gold would probably buy it, I imagine.

It all depends on what form you get it in, really - gold chain, gold bullion, gold dust ...

** It seems likely, in a world moderately similar to earth, that you could sell some gold easily, but the more you tried to sell the more suspicious people would get. If you have control over the form, you could make necklaces or other plausible jewlery from it. if you don't, you could claim- in a low tech world, ideally- that it came from an inheiritance from someone who expected the local currency to fail and gold to still have value. You could also claim to have found it somewhere- or claim to be a gold dowser for a mining organization, and sell them the gold you "find" in their refuse pile.

Obviously, gold bullion and dust are more suspicious and "where did you get this". with lower tech, you can travel, selling it as you go, posing as a merchant. with higher tech, this is less viable, because if people get interested, they stay interested.

Please note this is making some assumptions, but i'd think stolen gold would be something the government looks out for.

*** I was assuming that this was in our world. Without further alteration, the gold would be in the form of dust. Melting it into crude jewelry would be possible, but probably look very homemade.

** Start up a gold mining company up in the Yukon.

** Start with Cash4Gold or similar. Buy a [[http://advancedgeologic.com/Gold_Exploration/Gold_Claims/Placer_Claim_List.html][mining claim]] once you get enough money and sell the gold as dust and nuggets. Doubt you'd have any problems until you get up to very large amounts, like tons. Then I suppose you could buy a lot of claims and incorporate as a company in order to look ligit.

** sell to pawn shops in small quantities to start you up. you can also set up an actual small recycling company and use your process to arbitrarily inflate the yields of normal procedures (acid baths, mercury, and furnaces mostly) beyond what a single machine would be capable of. the last one has you covered on having to explain any large scale acquisitions of circuit boards and misc trash while also protecting you from explaining your process by claiming it is an industrial secret.
