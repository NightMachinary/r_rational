I've started posting a story that I've been conceptualizing, planning, and researching off and on for a couple years. Yeah, I like books with adventure, but more than that I /love/ books that focus on kingdom building, invention, and technological innovation to overcome those challenges. So I wrote one.

I've got a bit of engineering background but had to do so much research on chemistry, human physiology, and technology to make this not just vaguely plausible but truly believable. I'm having a lot of fun with it, actually, and growing as a writer.

If you'd like to check it out, Go to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time][An Advance in Time]] on RoyalRoad.


** Haven't really read anything yet since I usually wait until stories have 200-300 pages, but I would seriously consider rewriting the summary. It told me nothing about the story except it involves someone named Jason making advances in technology, probably using nanotechnology.

I don't know what the world is like (is it modern, was he transported to the past and has to recreate technology, is he at the forefront of a singularity, etc.) Most importantly, it doesn't grab me. I think it's because it's too meta, in the sense that it's talking about what the story is about from a meta narrative perspective instead of letting us have a look from inside the world.

In any case, I'll be checking this out sometime soon considering the dearth of new rational content during the lockdown. So good luck!

*** I rewrote the summary. What do you think?

In the year 2050, nanotech was invented that allowed humanity to do what it does best: ignore reality. Jason was a project manager at Razor, Inc. where those simulations were crafted and improved every day.\\
That is, until an accident with a power outage and a poorly-coded backup protocol saw his consciousness transferred to a server and his body in a coma for the foreseeable future.

With the corporate vultures circling around what they see as a new piece of company software, Jason ultimately found himself in one of the simulations he used to work on with a new set of objectives:

1. Survive the medieval setting

2. Build a Kingdom from scratch before ten years are up and end the scenario

3. Prove to the rest of the world, who will be watching him closely, that he's not going to be a crazy human / AI hybrid that would take over the world if given half the chance.

4. Figure out how #2 and #3 are compatible...

His modern knowledge of technology, chemistry, and physics is a huge advantage, but he wants to reinvent centuries worth of advancement in a few short years and innovate like his life depends on it. Because soon, it will.

If you enjoy kingdom-building, strategy, technological progression and big challenges, you'll likely enjoy An Advance In Time.

** I just read through all the chapters in one go and I wanted to say awesome job so far. I'm really liking the direction it's going. It's kind of like those incremental games, but much much more entertaining. I can't wait to see where this goes, and can't wait for the next update. Great job!

** Solid prose and an interesting start. I have to admit that the company deciding that a time-compressed medieval survival adventure is a good use of AI time was a bit of a strain on suspension of disbelief, but it's justified enough that some allowances can be made in the name of a cool premise.

I'm always a sucker for industrialization, so I think I'll be watching this.

*** Thanks for the feedback on all counts. I've also made a note to explain some of their reasoning in upcoming chapters that might explain how the company plans to make a boatload of money off of this. Might help, but let me know what you think if you notice it. ;)

** The story looks really interesting! Out of curiosity, how did you do most of your research?

*** Glad it interests you!

College initially took me down the engineering route. Did two years of that before I decided that other aspects of business were more my passion - I'd rather spec out a product than implement someone else's ideas. (I do have my name on a couple patents, too, for my day job.) I've never lost the love of how things work. All that is to say I've got a bit of a technical background.

Beyond that, I do a ton of reading and asking what-if questions that lead me from one point to another. A lot of them are technological dead ends from the book's point of view, but knowing what doesn't work is as important as knowing what might.

I've read series before that several books in just start breaking the laws of physics so much that I have to put them down, and I want to do the opposite of that here. Biology is one of my weaker areas, so when it came time to do the background research on plausible nanotechnology, it took me days or weeks, I don't remember exactly (part time, not full time). I researched neurons, learned a ton about how the brain physically works. I have the nanotechnology in my story inserted and flushed out by the cerebrospinal fluid during sleep. Why? Because I have notes that say things like: “The brain has a unique method of waste removal, known as the glymphatic system, a kind of plumbing system that washes away toxins by pumping cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) through spaces between brain cells. Interestingly, Xie and colleagues found that the glymphatic system was almost 10 times more active during sleep. In addition, they saw that cells in the brain "shrank" by 60 per cent during sleep. This contraction creates more space between the brain cells and allows CSF to wash more freely through the brain tissue.” [[https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health/article/1412641/sleeping-allows-brain-cleanse-itself-too-much-harmful][referenced article]]

Instead of me just arbitrarily saying that the nanotech goes into your brain between the brain cells and stays there forever, I try to ask the question “what would happen to the nanotech if we put it there?” Let physics guide the tech rather than arbitrarily saying that this is how things work for no apparent reason.

It's interesting to me and if a reader says, “hmm, I don't think that would work”, and pushes at it a bit, the more they look into it the more believable it seems. I'm sure I'll fail at that a lot, but we have to aspire to something.

** I just read the latest chapter and wanted to say good job! I can't wait to see how the professional army reacts to the guns and how the king reacts and deals with them, no doubt with an even larger army. Eagerly awaiting the next chapter :)
