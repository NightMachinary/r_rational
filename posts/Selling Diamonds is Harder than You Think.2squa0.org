*** Absolutely. Although to be fair it seems like there was a small crash in the 80s, DeBeers was just able to reassert control.

Actually, in the comments to that article there was a link to a [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120923200747/http://www.overtcollusion.com/diamonds/][decent piece]] on timeline picking up after the OPs article finishes.

** I'm mainly posting this link to see what [[/r/rational]] thinks of this monopoly, since the process of moving into a post-scarcity society would cause large companies to logically act like this to maintain their money-making monopolies.

For further discussion, how would you sell your secret stash of diamonds when they are not really that rare, but it's common knowledge only among people who have the resources to buy them?

*** Debeers is really an outlier though. Never before or since has a complete and utter monopoly been tied to an almost universally pervasive meme that reinforces the monopoly.

Most new goods now are /designed/ for a consumer market, which involves buying and selling and in some cases planned obsolescence.

But on the other end of Debeers is Aluminum.

Aluminum use to be rarer than platinum. When foreign royalty visited the court of Louis XVI, they were served on plates of aluminum, with platinum being used for mere dukes.

Still, even with the incredible cost, the small amount meant that the total value of the market was limited. Only a few small number of people could afford it, and there was little movement in the trade.

Then it was discovered that you could inexpensively extract aluminum from bauxite ore, and the price crumbled to the point that it is almost disposable now.

But the outrageous growth in supply means that, worldwide, the market for aluminum has actually grown exponentially - even adjusting for inflation it's easily a hundred thousand or a million times larger.

So, a loss of scarcity actually created a larger market, and enabled applications that would never have been considered before.

This is the same thing I expect to happen to gold and platinum when asteroid mining becomes viable and effective. There is more platinum in a single asteroid rich in it then has been mined on earth in the history of mankind. While this would crash the price, it will open up enormous opportunity to exploit the material in ways that never would have been cost effective before.

***** Planned obsolescence is a thing that exists. I'm on my phone, so I can't provide links, but look into the lifespan of old-timey lightbulbs compared to modern ones. Of course with LEDs that's maybe not a very relevant example. Cartridge printers are another example you could look into.

Non-jeans clothing found at big stores could also be seen as an example, provided you don't care about fashion.

******* Another example of planned obsolescence? Appliances. My mother owned a 1960 RCA Whirlpool Imperial washing machine. That machine did 3 or more loads of laundry every single day for 42 years. The reason it was eventually sent to the scrap heap? The tub finally got a leak. We actually managed to get a NEW replacement tub in a 40+ year old box, but I couldn't get the retaining nut that was at the top of the tub off, because the thing had welded itself in place. I didn't have a proper heating torch to get it off, nor a shop to play with it.

These days, a washing machine that sees heavy use is likely to last maybe 5-7 years. That way they can sell us another one.

If Appliance engineering had advanced like automobile engineering, we'd get 100 years of service out of a good washer.

******** Yea, /except/ that there is no evidence whatsoever on appliances. Sure, they don't last as long. They also have way more fancy electronics to make them better, and they are /cheap/, because cheap sells.

With cars, there is the safety thing which is why lots of people like to use newer and bigger cars. There is /demand/ for expensive cars for good reason. There is less reasons to buy expensive appliances.

If it's "planned" obsolence, there has to be evidence of intent. With printers, we have parts that are programmed to not work after certain amount of uses.

********* Looking here: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence]] one can see that we are both correct.

What you are referring to is "Programmed Obsolescence" and what I am referring to is "Lifetime-limiting Design." They are both variants of planned obsolescence.

A very good example of programmed obsolescence is throwaway digital cameras. There's no reason that they need to be throwaway. Sure, they would be a tiny bit more expensive if they could be re-used, and their lifetime would be short due to cheapness of design, but you could certainly get more than a few pictures out of one if you were careful. Cellphone cameras currently make this a non-issue in most countries where you might be reading this from, but if you remember back to the dawn of cheap digital photography, there were lots of disposable digital cameras. I would not be surprised if you could find them in first world countries still.

#+begin_quote
  *Planned obsolescence* or *built-in obsolescence* in industrial design is a policy of planning or designing a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics)][product]] with an artificially limited useful life, so it will become [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsolete][obsolete]], that is, unfashionable or no longer functional after a certain period of time. The rationale behind the strategy is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases (referred to as "shortening the replacement cycle").

  Firms that pursue this strategy believe that the additional sales revenue it creates more than offsets the additional costs of research and development and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost][opportunity costs]] of existing product line cannibalization. The rewards are by no means certain: in a competitive industry, this can be a risky strategy because consumers may decide to buy from competitors.

  Planned obsolescence tends to work best when a producer has at least an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly][oligopoly]]. Before introducing a planned obsolescence, the producer has to know that the consumer is at least somewhat likely to buy a replacement from them. In these cases of planned obsolescence, there is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry][information asymmetry]] between the producer -- who knows how long the product was designed to last -- and the consumer, who does not. When a market becomes more competitive, product lifespans tend to increase. [/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation needed]]/] For example, when Japanese vehicles with longer lifespans entered the American market in the 1960s and 1970s, American carmakers were forced to respond by building more durable products.

*********** Ah, in my opinion, it is very close to malicious to intentionally design products to be built to a lower standard. I do recognize that others do not necessarily share this mindset.

If there were a range of appliances offered with large differences in durability and cost, then I could believe that it was consumer choice driving the market. There really aren't though. Very few appliances of any type are designed to last more than a few years. When you go to buy an appliance, you don't have a choice to buy a 50-year model or a 5-year model. Not all customers want cheap appliances, but that's all that is offered.

************* Engineering of a product is more than just designing it once, and then taking it to a fabrication shop and making it happen.

For years, the appliance industry adjusted it's designs based on what was failing. If X failed on a regular basis after a short time, a design alteration was required to address that failure.

These days, it's the opposite. The appliance industry adjusts it's designs based on what is NOT failing. If, after 5-7 years or so, there are very few reports of failure of X, that means that X and/or the components that support X can be engineered to a lower standard because it exceeds the planned life of the appliance.

Starting an appliance business that would immediately become a priority lawsuit and talent-poaching target of every single competitor on the market after they understand the goals of the company is FAR from anything that I'm interested in. There are not very many appliance manufacturers in the world. It's not as far from the OP's example of DeBeers as most people believe.

** Diamonds are extremely good thermal conductors. Copper (extremely good for a metal) is 400 W/m.k, whereas diamond is 2200. So you could use it as a heat exchanger in most applications where copper is. Diamond is also corrosion resistant, so you can use it in seawater. It could also be used as a building material, if you have enough of it. Structures could be much taller than steel structures due to the better strength to weight ratio. Shaping it as desired might be difficult, but there are laser based approaches to cutting, welding, sintering, etc.

****** Yes, they are more brittle than steel, but is toughness/brittleness actually the limiting factor on construction? What evidence do we have of that? Concrete and glass are more brittle than steel as well (possibly more so than diamond), yet often play a structural role in large buildings despite this.

Perhaps the ideal way to use diamond supports would be something like a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity][tensegrity]] structure. The primary shock absorbers would be the cables, which could of course be something with ultra-high tensile strength (diamond nanothreads, carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber, etc). The diamond supports might also be separated by a thin layer of steel, aluminum, etc, or maybe even a pneumatic shock absorption system. As long as no sudden shock hits the diamond pieces, the structure is safe.

It would also likely be best to use pure synthetic diamond rather than natural diamond, as brittleness is partly tied to flaws in the structure.
