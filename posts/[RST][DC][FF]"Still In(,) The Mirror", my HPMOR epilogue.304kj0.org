*** I wanted the implication to be that the mirror's creators assumed they had future-proofed it, but hadn't counted on HJPEV and his anti-Death shenanigans being such a huge and unending power drain.

** I rather enjoyed it, it was a pleasant offshoot from the usual, gotta say. I predict the mirror will cause a calamity once Harry's simulation achieves FTL travel. If the mirror doesn't prevent this somehow (It seems like it could easily alter its simulated world's own physics enough to prevent this) then Friendly will have to render out stars as the people of Harry's simulation discovers them. I can only assume that rendering out a star to the point that it's consistent with the real world science HJPEV has brought with him is going to cost a star. So the more stars they discover, the more we lose, until it chains into our universe being left a barren void, with Friendly floating at its center. At which time, further attempts at exploration will trigger a decline in Friendly's powers. What this wil do, I can't say. Considering the Atlanteans designed him so that he pulls from the very /stars/ I doubt they've put in any low-power failsafes inside of it. Although I suppose you never know, that "be friendly" directive may come in handy for that. It's not very friendly to have your inner world suffer through entropy (presumably)

*** No Interdict of Merlin in Dumbledore's sort-of-canon CEV means pretty much all bets are off when it comes to the Mirror hewing to reality.

But for what it's worth, I imagined the Mirror as working like a video game's engine, i.e. only rendering things to the level the player can see. Stars can be points of light, or great balls of fire, or gigantic nuclear furnaces, depending on how closely Harry or Hermione is looking at them.

**** At first I thought about that, but think about this. As Harry (I assume) gets more involved in science and magic, he's going to be doing things that rely on the stars acting exactly as he believes they will, i.e the massive balls of white hot plasma we know they are. Whether that's physically exploring other galaxies, or merely observing readings from a variety of scientific experiments. And Harry and Hermione are definitely smart enough (especially considering they have immortality) to get to that level. Hence why I feel that's what will happen. Although I suppose the mirror could mind-nudge them away from that path, but considering how core things like colonizing the stars are to Harry, it seems like it would be violating its program to do so.

****** How long before Harry notices this though? Assuming the story was truthful, and the mirror can't heavily tamper with Harry's mind. It seems to only be able to do the equivalent of casting a Notice-Me-Not charm over subject matter

******* It just has to show Harry what he expects to see. In theory, there are ways to make this unfeasible. For example, there are cryptographically secure proof-of-work systems that Harry could use to ensure that vast amounts of calculations are actually being done. The problem is that Harry has to check them by calculating a cryptographic hash in his head. If he programs a computer to check it for him, the Mirror will just make the computer say that it worked.

******** I see what you're saying, but I feel like that doesn't really address my core issue. My issue is that, I feel, Harry, and by proxy anyone he's working with, is going to, eventually, figure out FTL travel (if it's possible at all, which it MAY be, since the mirror can alter its own physics, and Harry REALLY wants it to be possible) When that happens, actual observance of stars at much closer ranges is going to be theoretically possible. And if colonizing galaxies, as an immortal society, you will eventually reach multiple stars. And yes, no one is going to dive into a star, or have probes that can dive into stars, so the mirror won't necessarily need to simulate the star itself. But things like the heat it gives off, and the gravity it gives off, and their interactions on the planets needs to be simulated. So, in essence, you still need at least a majority of the energy within a star, to do this. I know what I'm saying wasn't explained properly (I don't have a big science background, beyond basic college chemistry and physics) but I hope I've clarified what I mean. And I DO suppose it's irrelevant if the mirror can alter every other human's minds at will.

********* Suppose the mirror takes too many shortcuts and gets the wrong answer? How will Harry notice? If he tries to run a simulation to check it against, the Mirror will notice and give him the same result.

** I want to say, I like the humorous, light-hearted tone this is written with that contrasts with the dark subject matter. In particular the Mirror AI - I know it's unrealistic to expect anthropomorphism in an AI, but it was entertaining to read. That said, I don't quite understand what happened in it - I know both HPJV and Quirrelmort got stuck in there and Dumbledore escaped, but not how or why V was allowed to die instead of getting his own shard.

*** V? Who's V? If you mean Voldemort, I think it was because Harry mindwiped him to the point where whatever ideologies he hung onto were consistent enough with Harry's, that the Mirror chose to just use Harry's ideals to shape its world. This is helped along by the fact that the Mirror recognizes them as the same person. Plus it's clearly a Machine, so once Voldie was wiped, I think HJPEV was close enough to being Voldie by the Riddle's standards.
