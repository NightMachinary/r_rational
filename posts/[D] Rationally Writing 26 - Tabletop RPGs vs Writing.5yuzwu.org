** Hey everyone! This week we explore the differences between GMing a tabletop RPG and writing a story.

We've also got a new sponsor for the show this month: [[https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php][Scrivener,]] the software that helps organize ideas for writing stories, research papers, or articles.

Alex and some of my other writing friends have been using it for years, and I recently started too. It's got a lot of tools to help outline and plan out stories, in a much more visually useful and organized way than my usual slipshod method of keeping a bunch of disorganized notes on google docs.

If you want to try it out, they offer a free 30-day trial, and if you decide to buy it and help support the show, you can use the code RATIONALLY to get 20% off during the month of March. Hope you find it useful!
