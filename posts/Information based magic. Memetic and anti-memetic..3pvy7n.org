Was thinking about the possibilities of a magic system based on information.

Let's stay classic: medieval setting and only a restricted group of indivduals can do magic.

We need to

*1.* Brainstorm magic spells.

*2.* Chose what we like.

*3.* Define a set of hard rules for this magic

*4.* See how people on the setting could abuse them.

So far I got: High level spell "Antimemetic field": People forget about the user a split second after seeing them. It is a more powerful invisibility.

A travelling memory: You have the plot of this awesome book that when written will be amazing. You can't sleep at night thinking how awesome it would be. But as soon as you tell the plot to someone else you can no longer remember the details and the listener is the one now plagued by the plot.

Maybe the spells need to a ascrifice of information to work: Like you lose the memory of your mother, or youneed to bring a living human whose mind will be totaly wipped clean.

P.S. What are good SCP to take inspiration from?

P.P.S. Basicaly I'm thinking about a hard magic sytem around memetic SCPs.


** I'm writing a short story (that may become a novel) using the idea that wizards gain power from knowing rare and secret things. The more secrets they know, and the fewer /other/ people who know those things, the more powerful they are with magic. This power from secret knowledge is a zero sum game.

This explains wizards speaking in riddles, hording knowledge, and even having True Names they tell no one. Even showing off or explaing the magic they know cost them some power. The more organized the knowledge, the more powerful the secret, but also the more power loss when others find out.

Displaying a spell to a crowd saps the user of that secret a little. The smarter the observers and more organized their reaction (like writing stuff down) the greater the eventual power loss. But that would be nothing compared to a university finding and displaying a book written in the wizard's own hand that describes the spell in detail.

One gets magic powers in the first place by being the only observer to a powerful and enviroment-changing* event. Then if you are ever unable to claim sole knowledge of a significant and unique idea or fact, you lose your magic. Only a few people realize this before blowing their chance to be a wizard.

***** Hmm. You could make it so that the more widely known the unsolved riddle or secret is, the more power that can be gained from it. Maybe it steals processing power (or something) from the corners of people's brains, and devotes all that power to the one who knows the secret's answer. That would encourage people to pursue risky strategies.

****** I think it is more that unimaginative or unadventurous wizards would build towering piles of original (but mostly "useless") work in private, then hide it away. Remember, letting people /know/ the secret /at all/ is what loses power. An exposed and examined secret would just lose /less/ power if people weren't easily able to figure out much about it.

The interesting part comes when two people think they can discover something twice as valuable together than they could working apart. Then you get apprentices, covens, orders, entire secret societies, etc. All with their own secret rituals that do nothing but grant them power as they get more and more complicated and well used (as their history of secret use is complex information itself).

** People get more powerful the more famous they are. This is basically the opposite of what [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] is saying. Instead of wizards hoarding secrets and speaking in riddles, they would be trying to spread knowledge. They would be all about trying to tell (and create) the most compelling stories they possibly could. This is the basic magic system for [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]].

If you want to adapt something like that to spells:

- Memetic bomb: A nascent spell gets attached to a meme of some kind. Maybe this is a piece of news, a new song, or a saying. From then on, the power of the spell that eventually gets cast will be dependent on the strength of the meme (and use up that power). Wizardly power would then be tied to which memes they had lashed their spells to, as well as how well a wizard was able to help a meme spread.
- Memetic casting: The spells that are most powerful are those which are most known. /Fireball/ is iconic, so it's powerful. /Glibness/ is unknown, so it's weak. This provides a feedback effect for casting; as a spell gets more powerful, more people will know about it, which will make it more powerful, etc.

*** I like this, but I think that larger memes while powerful, could be unwieldy and inflexible compared to secret or niche information. There wouldn't be any immunity established for things that hadn't been encountered and survived. That's not to say wizards wouldn't actively be spreading precursors to allow people to become susceptible to more complex meme structures.

#+end_quote

That immediately puts me in mind of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox][black hole information paradox]].

This is the observation that:

1) Particle interactions are predictable. (Electrons repel each other)

2) Predictable interactions are reversible. (Two electrons that have interacted will be further apart)

3) All that get gets tossed out the window when a black hole wanders into the picture. (We have no idea how many electrons got sucked up. They're all contained inside the event horizon even if that volume of space wouldn't normally hold them.)

If you treat "information" in an anthropomorphic way it seems to get where you wanted to go. If we take "you can't destroy information" to mean "you can't get rid of the knowledge in a letter" then Wizards would have some sort of a spell that gets the knowledge from the ashes. For even more fun maybe they can recreate the letter (or something more important?) from the knowledge and the ashes?

You wanted to abuse the system, you say? Then let's overthink information theory! What does encryption do to these wizards? The information exists, but isn't readily retrievable without more information. Or how about Godel's paradox? (Credit to a reader Para on my story for thinking about that one. I don't know if they hang out here or not, but "Hi" if you do.)

**** If magic is a natural aspect of the world, there will be natural creatures whose evolution has stumbled upon that aspect. You should seriously consider creatures that have memetic and antimemetic effects, and in a medieval setting they could certainly come across as demons. Mages themselves could come across as demons, or present themselves as creatures or forces of nature, depending on the versatility of the memetic system. I would recommend at least one legendary-level character that does just that.

To make things really interesting, detection and prevention of these effects should not be easy, or even possible. It should be very hard to resist memes and antimemes. This could be reflected in cost. A mage that imprints backups onto their own mind to counter memetic interference may become a little inhuman, or be forced to sear backups into the minds of others.

Possibly antimemes and memes have to balance, so the mage imprints the antimemetic impression of information onto others minds so that his own will have a sustained memetic effect. You could approach Imp's invisibility in this way, the mage using a supernaturally large portion of their attention to erase themselves from the attention of others. Long-term, short-term, and attentional memory could all be distinguished in this system, maybe modeled as a trifurcated pool of resource allocation, where you could diminish someone's long-term memory to increase the breadth of their attention, or to steal it for your own. Perhaps antimemes and memes have to actually balance, as in per-person, and a meme in one mind requires an equal antimeme in another. This means that Imp can only weakly disappear in the minds of a crowd, which may be all that's needed, or strongly disappear to the view of certain people, such as guards or a ruler to be assassinated. Maybe Imp steals whatever attention anyone devotes to her.

I kind of want to write something along these lines now. Maybe for the next contest. The important thing to remember is, when making a hard magic system, you're making a mathematical model of it, not just a list of effects. If you have a model, then you can play around with it and see what kinds of effects that could arise and how people would use it or model it themselves.
