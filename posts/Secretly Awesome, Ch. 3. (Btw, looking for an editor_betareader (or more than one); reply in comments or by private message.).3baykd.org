** I admit that the name has put me off enough not to want to read this. Tell me, am I missing out?

Edit: righty-ho then, i'll get to reading.

Edit2: Aaaaaand, I love it. The writing is bubbly and enthusiastic in a very enjoyable way. Guess I'll be following this one.

******* Good point. Thanks for the advice. The reason I responded is that I myself am not entirely happy with the title (which I guess it may be too late to change now). Here are some reasons why:

1. It's not a very clever title. Compare with the chapter titles, which for the most part engage with the themes of their respective chapters.
2. It makes the reveal of Willow's Mind-name ("Secretly Awesome") less interesting/unexpected/exciting/compelling. I spent quite a while searching for a name for Willow and was very happy with the result. Now it's possible that I have, in my haste and excitement to get the first chapter published, undermined the value of this name.

******** It's not too late to change it. I've changed titles on some of my stories. ff.net supports it, since what they care about is the story ID (which is invariant). I don't even think it will break any links.

That goes to the same place.

Bad (or rather, non-representative) names are particularly ungood if you're trying to draw people in. The television show "Cougar Town" was stuck with that name through its whole run, and that turned a lot of people away.

********** I'm not a huge fan. I think it's a good ship name, but my ideal title is:

- A quote from somewhere, ideally from within the work itself (bonus points if it's the last line)
- Layered, so that it might mean multiple things
- Suggestive, so that it gives the imagination a kick
- Enigmatic
- Descriptive, so you can make a guess about what you're reading

That's a pretty tall order; I consider myself lucky if I can get two of those. (I've also been accused of being pretty pretentious though, and I sort of agree with that sentiment. These are just my personal preferences.)

/Secretly Awesome/ makes sense within the story, but I can see how it would drive people away, or draw in the "wrong sort" of people who aren't actually interested in the story you're presenting. You want to think about who you're writing for (even if that person is yourself) and then think about what kind of title would draw /you/ in.

And I agree that your chapter titles do a much better job than the story title.

*********** Thanks for the feedback. I'm going to do some serious thinking about the title and come up with a list of alternatives. Thinking more about the current title, I can see how it has the wrong tone. It suggests I'm writing a Mary Sue fic, or perhaps yet another one of those clich√© civilization-building SG fics (you know what I'm talking about) where the author espouses their lame political philosophy. (Though those two particular examples are important for me to keep in mind, since they represent possible failure modes for my own story.)

What I'm going to aim for is something that captures the personality of the story. Something that's thoughtful, maybe slightly pretentious, and a tad bit funny. (I'd say goofy, but that's how the current title fails.) Or at least, that's what I think the personality of my story is. Am I reading it accurately?

Also, do you think the new title should drop the "Ship of the Line" part entirely?

************ 'Ship of the line' did seem a little odd. I really did not get the impression that most culture ships were 'of the line' in the sense that they were even warships. GCU's, while very capable of fighting, are not warships.

Ironically, I quite like 'Secretly Awesome' as a title; it fits both with a culture ship name, and is very Willow.

************* "Ship of the Line" refers to the genre of Halloween fics where the Gang dresses up as science fiction characters and somehow thereby receive a spaceship, and where, additionally, the Sunnydale universe turns out to simultaneously be a /different/ sci-fi universe (traditionally Stargate). The name comes from [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Challenge-7035/Ship+of+the+Line.htm][a "challenge" on tthfanfic]], which you'll see that I don't adhere to religiously.

Exemplars of the genre, which I consider to be influences:

- /[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-29783/PitViper+Ships+of+the+Line.htm][Ships of the Line]]/: Brooding, thoughtful, imaginative, and, sadly, unfinished.
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9280215/1/Ship-of-the-Line-Forever-After-Earth][Ship of the Line: Forever After Earth]]/: Erotica, incidentally, sometimes very extreme/disturbing. But if you look past that, it's a very well thought out and well written story with some interesting ideas. Also, appears to be written by an aspiring rationalist.

I'm glad you like "Secretly Awesome." It took me a while to think of, but it was clear to me that it was a good choice almost as soon as I came up with it. Much better than the previous "GCU /Principle of Explosion/."

**** It's a little childish. I'm particularly on my guard recently because I accidentally started reading some really bad fanfictions while wandering the interwebs, so I'm trying to avoid repeating that mistake. I wouldn't call it a definitively bad name in and of itself, but it may not be the same genre as what you're going for.

Still, let's give it a read.

What I would hope is that my betas would be willing to talk about where the story is going, how well the themes work, ways to improve things, stuff it would be awesome to see, analysis of characters, tone of voice, etc., rather than merely pointing out typos or awkward language (which is, of course, still helpful).
