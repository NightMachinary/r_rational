** /Worth the Candle/ is a webnovel about a teenage boy who gets dropped into a fantasy world that's a conglomeration of the ones he spent every night of his adolescence working on. He is, to all appearances, in a game of some kind, one that's brutally real and reticent to show its true nature. Forced to fight for his survival, he moves through a world that's both alien and familiar.

**** Yeah, but I'm really frickin' lazy. I keep thinking that I should make a TV Tropes page too, but then I think that seems like work, and I don't do it, because I would rather put my efforts toward writing.

Also, I'm not sure that they take submissions from things hosted on Ao3:

#+begin_quote
  Note: we do not list stories on large sites like FictionPress or Authonomy, as they have their own very extensive communities, and we really can't handle the volume.
#+end_quote

That's from their [[http://webfictionguide.com/about/submissions/][submissions]] page, and it's unclear whether Ao3 would count as a large site - I'd assume it would, but have no idea, and that means that it's more work and might just be pointless. (Also, Mother of Learning is on FictionPress, and still listed, so I don't think that's actually accurate to their policy.)

***** I made a submission to topwebfiction's parent site (webfictionguide) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vy8h8/rt_worth_the_candle_chapter_2425/dm4u4i7/][about a month ago]]. I'm unsure whether ticking the I'm-the-author box would have expedited the process, but they do say it takes about a month for them to get to it. Details below - let me know if I should change anything. From the flavor of the week summary above, I venture you're still polishing the perfect pitch. I hope any changes don't set it to the back of the queue.

*Tagline*: Is the game worth the candle?

*Tags*: fantasy, magic, adventure, rpgs, sword and sorcery

*Summary*: A self-insert litRPG portal fantasy.

A young man (the SI) suddenly finds himself falling off a plane into a new fantasy world. Being an old hand at D&D, some things seem disconcertingly familiar... but there's no time to ponder the similarities to the campaigns he used to run because there's a character sheet attached to his soul and this "game" is getting lethal real fast.

This story uses some custom CSS for the character sheet and definition tags to allow mouseover on various game terms, so mobile and touchscreen users, you're missing out.

****** Ah, thanks for that. I do recall that now, but it's one of those things that I guess I assumed had fallen off the radar or something. I appreciate it.

I /am/ working on the pitch a bit; my plan is to just write a new one whenever I post and figure out blurb-writing through iteration. It's difficult for this story in particular, I think, because it's somewhat deliberately generic in a few regards in order to give me room to play with the differences.

***** From that submissions page, they say

#+begin_quote
  The editorial board of the Guide has the final word on what to list and what not to list. If we think it belongs in our listings, we'll list it.
#+end_quote

Which I gather to mean that they'll waive their restriction at their discretion.

And yeah, it would definitely be work to put your story up somewhere new, but in terms of effort/reward I think the balance works out to be pretty good for your story. You've got an existing fanbase to quickly propel you up the rankings on your first week, and then it'll really pay dividends. Speaking personally, I at least check out any work new to the top ten or so, and I've read a bit from 17 of the top 20.

But hey-- ultimately, it's your decision. If you need some motivation, however, think: can I really justify my SI practicing some inane task for hours on end, when I can't even self-motivate enough to submit my work to a webfiction catalogue? ;)

**** Noted. I think that's my preference too, but I kind of don't like the idea of releasing chapters where there's just some people talking and no conflict/resolution arc, or only a weak one, which makes me want to Voltron things up into a better-digested chunk. I've been around the block enough times to have seen people commenting on web serial chapters saying "meh, nothing happened" and I would rather that's not how people come away from any chapter of this, which I think they're less likely to if they can continue on to another chapter right away.

But I also don't want to give in to the temptation to force every single chapter into the same setup/payoff or conflict/resolution format, because sometimes I just want space to breathe for a bit, and have something that's a tiny bit more slice-of-lifey (though I can't off-hand recall whether there are any individual chapters that actually do that).

The compromise I make is with chapter chunking on occasion.

(Alternately, sometimes there's a granular-level story beat that extends for 10K words, which is a little bit long for a chapter in my opinion (longer than a lunch break), and the chapter gets split in two partially in order to ensure that a more casual reader has good stopping points and doesn't have to push ahead, even if they're in the middle of something that should narratively be a single gigantic chapter.)

I don't actually have anyone doing editing or beta reading (with this chapter set as an exception - I got some early feedback from some people on the discord, thanks [[/u/ketura]]) so that's not an issue. I write fast enough and at odd enough hours that I don't really want to wait around or talk things over or whatever, most of the time.

**** I've considered it, sure, but don't plan on doing it. After this is finished, I'll probably try to get in contact with an agent or publisher in order to get some it properly published, like with an editor and cover art and everything. If that doesn't work, then I'll pay out-of-pocket to get it self-published with a decent level of professionalism.

Part of what's working for me right now is that I don't have commitments to anyone and I'm not writing for anyone's sake but my own, which gives me a lot of freedom that (I think) has helped with keeping output/quality high.

** I love Juniper's reaction to the Fel Seed quest. Also, finally arriving at what I expect to be there big plot thread of the setting, if not Joons personal story: Fixing this crapsack world. A lot of quests are hinting at it... Fix all thirteen personified exclusion zones, become a God, rescue your best friend who may very well be in the 4000 hells, punish the wicked and reward the good kind of stuff.

The one question I'm surprised his minmaxing instincts hasn't jumped on is... Can he draw unicorn time wankery out of the bones they collected? That would make fixing his boneitis much easier, assuming he can unlock soul manipulation at all.

I will say that as a general rule I tend to dislike repeating myself, and I think 'go to place and kill person' probably would not make for terribly compelling reading by the tenth one - seems like you would eventually just have action and planning without any character change or plot revelation.
