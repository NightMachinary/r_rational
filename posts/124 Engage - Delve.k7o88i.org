** I wasn't thrilled with this update. It definitely had that meandering feel to it of an update going over the same ground again, even though objectively some things happened I guess. It's just they were mainly cleanup sorts of things .

Is giving the accolade to Tarny really doing anything useful besides making him feel better? Without an interface he probably can't progress the skill, and even if he could it wasn't going to fit in his planned build anyway.

Doesn't Ice Girl still need to swap a skill into something to get her class? I was wondering if it's Ice Bolt. Might be too convenient.

Making him feel better isn't a bad thing, he can always pass the accolade on later. Also, I think he can progress the skill.

She already has Ice Bolt

*** Eh, one more person with magic arguably has more tactical value than making an existing mage slightly more versatile. (As long as no special class unlocks are not involved.) But I think making him feel better was the main point.

**** I really don't think Rain has any use for the skill. I assume a level 0 skill has pathetic damage compared to his auras. So, it makes perfect sense why he'd give it away.

Also, maybe it's possible for the unawakened to keep swapping it to each other when one runs out of mana? If yes, then that seems like a pretty valuable asset.

***** It's not just pathetic damage, wearing armour screws up a mage's aim. Rain gets around that because a 360 degree aura can't go off target but for him ice bolt was useless.

  unawakened to keep swapping it to each other
#+end_quote

that's a very smart idea. Considrering their poor mana/physical reserves maybe they can switch between themselves while one holds a physical based skill and the other a mana based one. Switch when one of them deplete his reserves.

*** Mostly making him feel better. It might help him train (control) as well as start dealing with soulstrain. It's not particularly devastating (Tier 0) so it's not like your lead party needs it. (and if you enter a lair where it is useful...just get it back from Tarny)

Rain should have maxed it to Rank 10 first though (he can do that quickly) for future experimentation (does it serve to unlock new skills, can you put a point in the new skills with the accolade being the prerequisite, etc)

** Considering how no one got any accolades, but Stint did, I theorize that Stint counted for double. To awaken and get an accolade, he needed twice the amount of essence. But that worked out fine due to there only being 7 members total in the party in the Dark Lair, so Stint was permitted to take up two "slots" for an awakening and an accolade. However this time, every slot was accounted for with 7 awakenings and 1 earning an accolade for 8 slots total.

**** Stint was capped at level 5 which was the same level as the lair. But Rain is unsure if everyone who awakens by smashing the core are automatically given a cap of level 5, or if the cap matches the lair's level.

***** Hmm yeah that's quite the question. I would /guess/ that it's a cap of 9 since the Accolades scale with Lair strength (maybe?) and it seems to trade off with those, but it's not a confident guess.
