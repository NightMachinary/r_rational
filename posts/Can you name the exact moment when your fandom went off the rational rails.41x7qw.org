So let's say you're really getting into a new story in some medium, it's clicking, you're falling in love, and you're intellectually stimulated...and then the writer(s) make that fatal choice to do something disappointing, contrived, and intellectually shallow.

When was the fatal moment for you?

Example: I loved the first series of /Downton Abbey/, but the moment that Julian Fellowes decided to create dramatic tension merely by having Lady Mary choose to keep silent about her reasons for not accepting Matthew's proposal, the story quality started to suffer. (When you posit a problem with an obvious solution, but you don't follow it, WRITER BEWARE.) The failure wasn't obvious at first---Lady Mary's silence was somewhat believably motivated---but I had the disappointing premonition that Fellowes was going to stick with shallow, contrived tropes to tell his story...and that premonition was confirmed in spades within the first five minutes of the second series, when the story quality took a totally predictable nose dive, and the contrived tension was maintained for the whole remainder of that series.

*Moral: Once you commit intellectual suicide in your storytelling, there's precious little that has a hope of rescuing your story and making it rational again.*

Thoughts?


** Battlestar Galactica is probably the single most promising half of a sci-fi show I've ever seen, followed by the most disappointing. Without spoiling details, it built a great world full of rich characters, compelling plots, and exciting mysteries, and tied them all to a single, nonsensical, contradictory deus-ex-machina reveal.

Now anytime a show promises that there is some "master plan" that will be eventually revealed, I just have a sinking feeling of deja vu and save myself some heartache by predicting that the writers are backing themselves into a corner that they don't intelligently know how to get out of.

*** Aye... so often it turns out to be a blatant lie; there was never a master plan. There were never any explanations. The writers end up punishing viewers for trusting them and for trusting their curiosity.

It's funny, Valve have admitted that there is no set worldbuilding documents for Half Life and the plot wont be determined till they have specific gameplay experiences to fit it around. I know that the G-Man's story might not have ever been written, but I wont get off the HL3 hype train yet, because if there's anything this subreddit has taught me it's that a sufficiently creative rationalist can salvage any series.

We'll just see who they replace Mark Laidlaw with.

*** Yeah, I had that same feeling with BSG. Whenever sci-fi writers crap out with a mystical angle, it always leaves me with a disappointed, hollow feeling. I don't mind a little bit of mysticism in my sci-fi---after all, any sufficiently advanced tech is indistinguishable from magic, right?---but I don't want the mysticism to be the lynchpin "revelation" of the whole master plan.

Arthur C. Clarke walked this sci-fi/mysticism line in his writings, and sometimes he did it well (/Childhood's End/) and sometimes he did it poorly (/2001: A Space Odyssey/). Figuring out exactly why one works and the other does not is a fascinating question...

****** I'm in the process of deconstructing the wish-fullfillment 'people wake up transformed as X in the 'real world' ' fic.

In this case however that is not what is really happening at all, instead the characters in the story are some degree of accurate approximations of the minds/memories of people that were produced by what MIGHT have been a GAI. But quite possibly could have been something a lot less capable then a truly general self modifying intelligence.

The characters are in bodies that on the surface look like and even kind of work like jRPG monsters. But everything is smoke and mirrors and compact applications of technology.

So the story is less "wish fullfillment yay!" story and more "my life as a high tech theme park animatronic arriving a few decades earlier then the tech level should support it"

**** BSG started out with perfectly "explainable" mysticism based on character motivations. Or, if it wasn't explained it didn't determine everything.

I didn't need it to really be explained either but it became a tumor that grew and swallowed everything.

The easiest thing to do would be to simply leave it as something the characters believe but the show is agnostic to, the way they started out.

The problem was -and I think the admitted this- they had an idea they felt was soooo brilliant they had to throw it against the wall and see if it sticked. No planning, nothing. Just..do it, for fun

The ironic thing here is that BSG is brilliant because the creator ran from all the dumb things in Star Trek that frustrated him. No damage lasting more than a week, no character or arc planning and no consistency. And he falls back into the trap.

**** Exactly the same problem as BSG, but a lot more frustrating, because at least BSG had a good strong first half of (relatively) hard sci-fi. Lost started out propelled by a boatload of mysteries, it solved maybe 2% of them (but only to push the plot forward with more mysteries), and then it pulled a bunch of hand-wavy, maybe-if-we-confuse-you-you'll-think-that-we-solved-the-mysteries-but-you-just-missed-it crap, and then there was a totally nonsensical mystical ending and /poof/, the whole house of cards collapsed into the nothing it was.

Totally wasted all the viewers' intellects and emotional investment in the characters. I heard a recent NPR article where Lost's show runners gave an interview, and they said that they wanted to explore the concept of frustration and unresolved storytelling. That was their goal from the beginning, they claim. Of course, they never warned the viewers of that, and really, I think the show runners were just covering up the fact that they invented a compelling, refillable concept (great for TV executives to buy into!), but they had no idea where they were going, ran out of steam, didn't have any answers for the mysteries they posited, and crapped out.

Like The X-Files.

Really, show runners need to figure out the whole story before they start airing the first episode. They don't have to have all the details worked out, but if they don't have a solid idea of where they're going to end up, they shouldn't waste our time with a filmed WIP that has no ending, really.

JMS did a great job with Babylon 5 (although the fifth season was shaky, but there were reasons for that that were outside of his control). Why aren't more people telling high-quality, long-term stories on TV? Why are we putting up with all this half-assed storytelling?

The end of the series wrapped most of it up /somewhat/. But it wasn't really a scifi or a scifi-tinged show at that point.

The second series...so many stupid and/or contrived moments.

A partial list:

1. the way Percy loses the Achilles Curse. It seems completely boneheaded of Hera to make her chosen champion vastly less effective and isn't explained/justified in any detail.

2. The completely underwhelming threat of the Giants which are dealt with extremely casually.

3. The completely overpowered monsters/spirits that possess a couple of characters once or twice, wreck their plans, and don't really show up again. Not foreshadowed in previous books, and basically only there to make the plot move.

There's a lot of Steven Universe that implies the Homeworld Gem population count is fairly restricted : the size of the Kindergartens, the scale of structures like the Ancient Colony Ship and Galaxy Warp, and much of the background art on Gem architecture. Peridot's identification scheme could theoretically extend to ~78 billion Peridots, but the way it's formatted suggests that use of the address space is probably two orders of magnitude lower, perhaps even three, and she's one of the single most common gem types. Even the Cluster, made from the remains of an intersystem war, is described in the mere millions of gem shards: these are scales that humans would wage war on by the mid-19th century, not what we'd expect from people like us a step up the Kardashev scale.

Just an episode earlier she was gushing over how much she would like the Earth to be 'homeworldformed'. The order the episodes aired made it seem like what convinced her to join the CGs was the verbal abuse she received from the Gems in the moon base, and that has rather unfortunate implications.

** The Two Year Emperor, Suzy's ascension.

Her ascension itself was selfish, endangering the future of her civilisation for the sake of her getting the credit and power by not sharing her two-levels-higher thinking with the rest of the government.

Then, after her ascension, she continues to refuse the obvious route of asking the former protagonists for help, but instead wanders aimlessly, terrorising people and eventually committing genocide in a world where even 'always (chaotic) evil' is easily reversible with a mass-purchasable helmet of inverse alignment.

*** In fairness, the reason she did all of that was because the mantle of godhood was driving her crazy. The entire thrust of the book was about her fighting to hold on to her rational self.

That said, your version of things is a valid interpretation.

** u/Tsegen:

  The failure wasn't obvious at first---Lady Mary's silence was somewhat believably motivated---but I had the disappointing premonition that Fellowes was going to stick with shallow, contrived tropes to tell his story...and that premonition was confirmed in spades within the first five minutes of the second series, when the story quality took a totally predictable nose dive, and the contrived tension was maintained for the whole remainder of that series.

If you don't mind me asking, what happened in the first five minutes of season 2 that turned you off?

*** We learn that:

- Matthew has been avoiding everyone in the Crawley family, except for his mother, for /two years/. (Really? So he had a falling out with Mary and he's stopped talking to /everyone?/)
- Matthew has gotten engaged to some new, offscreen female character that he only met once, very briefly.
- Mary is getting herself entangled with a new, offscreen male character that apparently nobody likes, including herself.

Setting aside the contrived and implausible nature of this situation, let's imagine how this will play out, shall we? There will be a tedious love quadrangle (because obviously Matthew and Mary are endgame) for the entire season, where we do not become emotionally invested in the new characters and where most of the plot machinations surrounding Mary and Matthew involve getting the two new characters back out of the story again.

And, lo, that is exactly what happened (::yawn::). The male character was reduced to a bully and Matthew punched him (which was briefly satisfying, I admit), and the female character was conveniently killed off by the Spanish flu, which also conveniently spared all of the other characters that we know and love.

But, okay, lots of romances have this kind of extended will-they-or-won't-they structure. The thing that really irked me was that this shallow and predictable plot line dominated the Crawley family's half of the Series 2 plot, and the opportunity cost was immense. Julian Fellowes sacrificed the possibility of a deeper, more resonant treatment of WWI (which was, in effect, just a background contrivance to keep Matthew and Mary apart, and which Fellowes dispensed with in only /four/ episodes---by episode five, Matthew is home and we never see another war scene), and then Fellowes compounded his mistake by utterly wasting the dramatic opportunities inherent in the Matthew-paraplegia storyline, finally capping it off with a completely unbelievable miracle recovery. (Because of course we can't have our male romantic lead injured in any /real/ way as a result of living through /four years of war/.)

My tooth-grinding frustration with the terrible waste of a possibly fantastic storyline at least had one good outcome: it prompted me to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10078078/1/Trust-and-Providence][write the story that we /should/ have gotten]]. :)

**** Oh, god. I had forgotten that that was the season of Lavinia or whatever her name was.

And the contrivances don't end with Spanish Flu. He has to contrive a reason that this doesn't actually work to allow the one true pairing, then a reason it works, then a reason why it solves /another/, completely separate problem of Downton's (money) and a reason why it also can't and then a reason for Matthew to change his mind.

Jesus.

A common thing with him. I feel like his treatment of all of the changes everyone keeps mentioning was pretty lackluster. He's better at telling you,usually, though there are some exceptions.

I feel like Fellowes decided he was writing a bad soap before anyone else realized. We all thought it was going to be a soapy drama with something to it but clearly he had other ideas.

If you look at it from the perspective of a telenovella that sort of twist makes perfect sense.

***** If you do, please feel free to make suggestions for improvement. I welcome all feedback, including critique.

Haha on "I feel like Fellowes decided he was writing a bad soap before anyone else realized". And I think when people realized, they got off the train ASAP. (That's part of my theory as to why Dan Stevens bailed---he was given the most embarrassing, telenovela drek to act out.) Writing shallow plot lines is a common thing with Fellowes, unfortunately. Ah well, tons of people loved watching the show for its costumes and sets and beloved actors, so at least there's that. :)

** Eragon. Where do you begin???

edit: For me, up until the final book, it could have been saved. But that was just the nail in the coffin. Between the deus ex machina powerups and downs, the inexplicable killing-off of the centuries-old magic, telekinetic, and super-strong elf queen only for her killer to be revenge-killed by a normal human, and then the frantic shoehorning of the last third of the novel's events to fit the prophecy - kind of - from the first book... there wasn't really a shred of sense in it by the finale.

Suffered greatly from poor plotting in advance, which led to struggling to very quickly set up the endgame with no... setup.

***** Yeah. The tipping point when the intriguing / dross ratio flips from "worth it" to "not worth it" usually doesn't occur until near the end, or at the end of the story, because you keep holding out hope. It would be nice if there was a registry somewhere of stories (novels, movies, TV, theatre, etc.) analysed from the POV of whether the story fails at being rational, and if it does, if it's still worth a thinking person's time, because there are enough interesting ideas. I'd subscribe to a blog feed on that topic. :)
