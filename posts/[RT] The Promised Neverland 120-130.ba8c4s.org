** I've never read this manga, can I get an elevator pitch? (is it justifiable for [[/r/rational][r/rational]]?)

*** Giving you the elevator pitch (as well as linking 120 chapters in) ruins the effect, the first arc benefits heavily from going in blind. I would say, and I believe the consensus is, that the first arc (1-37) is pretty rational and lays out all the characters and antagonists motivations well, for its genre, after that point it decays a bit though the story is still fine. I'm not sure why 10 chapters in the middle were linked.

**** They probably wanted to post it less often since people were questioning if it was still relevant here.

*** It was first posted on here a /while/ back, and had updates on the sub for each new chapter for quite a long time. The first arc of the manga, at least, is justifiable enough for the subreddit, though I can't remember why people stopped posting the new chapters, or the particular reasons it qualified in the first place.

You could probably find the pitch by searching the sub's archives, but be warned that this is a /very/ spoiler and plot twist heavy work.

You might be better off trying the anime, which just finished its first season and is still free to watch on Crunchyroll (At least watch until the end of the first episode to get the gist of the series).

**** The anime removed the internal monologues of the characters, which seems like a big loss from the first Arc to me.

***** I was under the impression that they just animated it as external monologues instead? It's been a while since I read the manga, but I don't think it impacted everything too much, though it is a bit less realistic.

****** I don't remember the first arc well enough to know how much they left out, since I read it so long ago. I might need to reread...

******* I just watched the anime then read the manga. I didn't notice anything of significance left out of the anime. The most noticeable thing left out was that Norman knew how to pick locks.

All the dialogue seemed intact and the internal monologues are either still there or just switched to spoken largely.

If anything, the additions in the anime are weird. The whole thing with Krone being totally batshit insane in the anime was a weird addition. In the manga she seemed much more rational despite being slightly unhinged.

******** Interesting. Again, I don't recall the first arc that well, but I was listening to the Anime Feminist podcast recently and Krone's insanity was one of the major gripes they had, along with the way they cut her flashback short.

***** Ah. Well, I can't really speak as to the current chapter reactions, as I'm afraid my manga-reading fell off a while back and I never bothered to catch up again for some reason. I may have to do that sometime.

Either way, you seem to be getting a decently good reception here as it stands. This post is still on the first page of the sub in spite of being almost a week old, and I don't see many with a better score.
