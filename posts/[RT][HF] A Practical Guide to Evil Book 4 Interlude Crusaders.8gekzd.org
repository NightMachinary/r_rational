** I like how the Grey Pilgrim is completely taking for granted that Black will lose the coming battle. I guess he doesn't have the benefit of knowing Black, so he doesn't know how surgical and thorough the guy can be.

It's funny, in a way, it looks like since he met Catherine, he respects her more than he respects Black, who he only has secondhand accounts of.

Black is the implacable man who specializes in anticipating people who specialize in blindsiding implacable men. The Vales is a super defensible position, and the Heroes are going in with what appears to be very limited intel. I don't know if Black is going to hold the city, but whether or not he does, I expect his enemies to get /wrecked/.

*** Oh yeah, "he will not repeat his past mistakes" isn't a great improvement on its own for someone facing Black Knight.

I still hope that he heard the beginning of Bard's monologue about how she had Sabah killed (he was only fifteen or so feet away, and Tyrant might have let him hear her). Googling the memories about Bard would show him more of the big picture, which would be necessary if he's ever to start thinking for himself.

It's not even like he /made/ mistakes in the first place. He almost got flattened while essentially being at his best.

***** Not exactly, enough googling would allow him see the goblinfire shell game coming, for example, and Amadeus notes Hanno didn't bother learning to use Ride for anything other than closing the distance. Combining Ride and Recall would turn him into a human missile, and that's not mentioning the possibility of tricks like searching for a memory that would capitalize on something Black Knight wouldn't be able to know, or, you know, buying an actual mount to tap into Ride without having to say the word.

Guess being the kind of person to convict himself for being unable to address a case with insufficient amount of data, and then to offload the responsibility for his actions to those who won't feel the consequences of them, marks a person with little imagination.

****** The way Named fights have been depicted so far, it'd be a gamble to burn two aspects at once. More powerful, certainly, but it leaves Hanno at a disadvantave if the combo fails to deliver. Rolling the dice against Amadeus...

Well, I could see an argument in favor of it. Amadeus has shown that he will win the slow-and-steady style of fight.

** I, once again, am having worm flashbacks reading this (tough to be fair there is ample cases of this in the guide itself). Everyone that sees Cat/Taylor underestimates her and underestimating the MCs is at the very top of things not to do in fiction. Thankfuly the Pilgrim is not marching to war with his spear so far up his ass that is ticking his ubula.

We met the Saint and she is scaring the princes into line. is that good or bad? I mean if they follow the terms of engagement it might mean that they will be more competent that previously thought. By the way the Saint's ass also doubles as a scabard for her blades, since she is following the moral leanings her last name, Montfort, inspires. Simon of Montfort was one of the leaders in the crusade to quash the catar heresy in the middle ages. he was famous for saying "kill everyone God will choose his own." anyway that she curses the princes into shape is amusing.

** Grey Pilgrim having spent most of his time is the Levant, has no idea the lengths that Proceran royalty will go to for some power.

The Pilgrim and the Saint have a good cop bad cop thing going, pretty fun stuff.

I wonder if the Watch that Duchess Kegan sent them will be under suspicion now that the heroes have shared their doubts.

Looking forward to what cat has planned to solve this unholy mess at her doorstep.
