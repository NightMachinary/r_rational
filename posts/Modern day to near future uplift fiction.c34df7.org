Looking for books/web novels that focus on how a roughly current day society transitions to some sort of futuristic sci-fi or magical based world. Mostly focused on books that focus on the specific technology or magic involved, rather than more general character dramas.

Examples roughly in this category include the Bobiverse, Live Free or Die, With This Ring, The Gam3, Legend of Randidly Ghosthound, etc.

My most recent find was called [[https://storiesonline.net/s/17944/micro-gates][Micro Gates]] (Warning hosted on NSFW erotic fiction website. Though the story itself has no sexual content)

Basically any book where current society moves drastically in a new and fantastical direction.

I've read several traditional uplift stores like Release that Witch and A Hero's war, but right now I'm more interested in current day rather than medieval-type societies.

Book does not need to be published or originally written in english, or finished (as long as it has a fair chunk of content).

Any recommendations?


** [[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]] is about a world where magic is an advanced branch of mathematics/computer science, discovered in the late '70s. Mages are by necessity the smartest people in the world.

** [[https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][Accelerando by Charles Stross]]. Follows several generations from from the near future as humanity masters upload and space technology. Some character drama, but it's more about hinting at the sort of things people have drama over in the future. To give one minor, spoilery example, dude and his girlfriend (both uploaded) swap genders to have sex, just to try it, and there's maybe 2 sentences of the dude feeling uncomfortable about it.

** [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35429993-fall-or-dodge-in-hell][Fall; or, Dodge in Hell]] by Neal Stephenson is upload fiction. I'm half way through and enjoying it so far. It has a definite mythological feel to it, with the new digital souls forging a new world and, due to fractured memories, not really understanding what they are doing. As a result, they tend to act like primordial creator gods.

**** I wanted to enjoy micro gates, but the writing was just not very good. It was a very good example of "Show, dont tell." It was really painful to read.

** The earliest example that I can think of is Poul Anderson's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Wave][Brain Wave]], which starts with everyone living on Earth suddenly becoming superintelligent.

The linked Wikipedia article says that it was "one of many science fiction works written at this time on the theme of heightened intelligence", which is true enough, but I can't think of any other contemporary novel-length book which explored the consequences of planet-wide superintelligence.

Note, however, that it doesn't "focus on the specific technology or magic involved".

** Destiny's Crucible. Definitely

Similar story to Release that Witch and A Heroes War, just without any magic. IMO written 10x better. About a chemical engineer that is displaced to a world with medieval tech.

Children of Time also comes to mind. Its about the bio engineered inhabitants of a terraformed planet where evolution is accelerated. Tbh I did not enjoy it as much as destiny's crucible, but still highly rated on goodreads.

** bit of an odd one, but I feel like it fits the bill:\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23539/super-science-fast-romance/chapter/338765/a-robot-thats-fun-at-parties]]

Its a sort of (dys-/u)topian near future fiction that explores various current societal problems, and how people are overcoming them. It is a bit crazy, but I found it a really fun read. NSFW, but the sexual content is more along the lines of "everyone is bored and has lots of weird sex to pass the time" than erotica.

** I think you might really like the story I've been working on for the past two years, but sadly I haven't published it yet. It's a series of rational/scifi novellas called "Earthlings: People of the Dawn". It's about an alternate Earth very similar to our own in the near future, where authoritarian regimes are taking over everywhere and the threat of human extinction is drawing near.

I've already gotten most of the story written up through *Episode V: The Healer's Hand*, and I'm hoping to finish the series before the end of this year (not including the happy ending version of *Episode VI: the Ancestor's Legacy*, since that's the extended epilogue and is going to need a total revamp.) I'm pretty sure that *Episode I: the Ambassador's Voice* and *Episode II: the Seeker's Quest* are already totally done though.

Here's my planned inside cover blurb for *Episode I: the Ambassador's Voice*:

/“I notice that I am surprised. Reality has violated my expectations. That means something I believe about reality is false or incomplete.”/

/The Year is 2020 C.E. The advent of technologically-assisted public deception combined with mass surveillance and a sophisticated psychological operations arsenal has granted governments and corporations an unprecedented informational advantage over the public. Knowledge is power, and whoever possesses the most knowledge will control the world-- assuming that it doesn't get destroyed first./

/As authoritarianism spreads around the globe and the threat of human extinction draws near, one socially awkward musician must rise to the challenge and stand against the darkness. His name is Bertie Stern, and the secrets he bears could save the world.../

/Or destroy it./
