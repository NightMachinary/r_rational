Hello everyone,

I just got caught up on Worth the Candle, and have also enjoyed HPMOR and Mother of Learning. I found this website where you can vote on fiction and noticed a lot of mentioned works there:

[[http://topwebfiction.com/?days=365]]

Should I just read from top to bottom? Anything on that list that should be higher up or that isn't on the list?


** Endorsed:

Worth the Candle (natch)

Mother of Learning (natch)

Practical Guide to Evil

The Gods are Bastards -- If the Trissany character is a showstopper for you early on, know that her character changes significantly/organically as the series progresses.

Worm

Mostly Endorsed:

Wandering Inn

Savage Divinity

Passingly Endorsed:

Metaworld Chronicles -- Largely because of frequent updates, as a kind of junk food reading.

** IMO and your mileage may vary, but most of the list is garbage. It's a popularity contest based on binary decisions, its usefulness is telling you which serials are popular right now and/or update often (hint, these two factors are related).

If you want new stuff to read I recommend hanging out in the Monthly Recommendation threads instead of that website.

As for what you asked, I really like Unsong in that list, if you haven't read it yet, and The Good Student and Large Chests were pretty addictive. Worm is great too, obviously, not so much everything above it.

********* The first arc of wandering inn is objectively the worst of the entire series. The writer consistently gets better though, and eventually cuts one of those two main characters completely out of the story for 2 full arcs. The other character becomes much more well developed and likable as the series continues.

I'd honestly recommend giving arc 2 a chance if you have nothing else to read atm, it's noticeably better.

The four entries above Worm are A Practical Guide to Evil, Ward, Metaworld Chronicles, and The Wandering Inn. Of those, one is the sequel to Worm, two more are truly excellent, and the last is fine reading if a little lightweight. Yes, the ratings are suspect and subjective, but unreadable work doesn't make it to the top of the list.

*** Yeah I don't think it's a secret that the list isn't gonna be perfect - some authors are going to be linking the website to social medias and asking for votes at the end of the chapter, while others may not even know of the website, so votes are going to be skewed. Plus anytime you can only vote for one option radical choices will be inflated (rip US Presidential Elections)... That's why I am looking for opinions from reddit. :)

Is this based on the forum version? I'm caught up on the RR release, and while fun, I don't remember much rational about it.

Offhand, Forty Millennia of Cultivation is the closest to one that I've read (aside from an early deus ex that kicks off the plot), even if it isn't perfect. /Savage Divinity/ sometimes nudges in that direction, but never to the point where I could call it rational fiction.

**** Perhaps Rationalist is a better description, and it /is/ the forum version, just edited to not include the Quest bit. The reason I call it rational is mainly due to the characters and their development, and the world and its development, everything makes sense in context with the rest, and the characters each have goals of their own that they are in pursuit of. Last I checked that is the Definition of Rational.

All the stories on there are pretty similar (superhero/superhuman) because the system is set up to keep the strongest clique engaged and everyone else with something better to do.

My recommendation is to try the top 2. If you like them, you're pretty likely to like the others as well, if you don't, you probably won't.
