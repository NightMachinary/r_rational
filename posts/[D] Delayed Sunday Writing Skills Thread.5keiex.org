Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow [[/r/rational]] fans...

- Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tropes]]?

- How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

- Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

- Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

- Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.


** Sorry for not posting this yesterday! I got distracted celebrating the holidays by going ice-skating. Better late than never!

** I find it gets harder to draft, the further into the future I'm looking. A lot of it is that I haven't thought too much about how the characters actually interact that far down the line, and while I know the broad plot strokes, there are things like travel times to take into account. Is that a writing challenge specific to serials?

** God, next week my self-imposed "write 50,000 words of my paranormal romance novel in january" challenge starts up, and I am getting MAJOR cold feet. Like major. Can someone please reassure me? My self-soothing like I did last week is not up to snuff.

- I don't want to do this anymore it's so much work

- What will it even accomplish?

- I will be embarrassed to show it to anyone

- Where the hell do I start??

- Do I even like the story I'm gonna write

Like... I know the answers to all of these! I've been excited to write it, my husband says he's excited to read it, my roleplaying partner is on board, I've planned out some plot elements, but... the thought of putting the proverbial pen to paper is terrifying all of a sudden.

I've even told a bunch of people I was going to do it, so I have that commitment device, and I really should get around to setting up a beeminder goal for it. But god, I just... don't want to do it anymore now it's actually on the horizon. Which is stupid because it's something I've wanted to finally do for /literally years/

*** Getting through 50,000 words is very impressive fo an achievement. If you power through that, you're also working on "getting good at doing things you want to do even if they're hard", which seems like a really strong things to cultivate.

Also, re: accountability/encouragement, if you put updates somewhere, I'm sure people here can comment/encourage.

**** Thankyou so much for your comment! I appreciate your support :)

What would updates consist of? "I worked really hard this week"/"I didn't work hard enough how can I get better" or more like "here's a chapter I worked on any pointers?". I'm happy to do either, but I'm loathe to inflict chapters devoid of context onto anyone. But I suppose I'm not holding peoples' eyelids open and forcing them to read it, even if I did do that.

***** When I did nanowrimo I didn't plan to show any of it to anyone except a few extracts to one close friend, so I posted updates here like 'I made it to 18k and now I really need to get protagonist to meet the wise old man'. I don't think it made sense to others or really needed to, but including some small detail of how the story was going as well as the word count helped me...

*** I get a milder version of the same feeling when I'm quarter of the way into a short story. All the plot scenes that seemed so exciting to plan out, now seem like so much work to slog through. Questions to ask yourself: Will writing it give you a sense of satisfaction/accomplishment? If yes, that's a good reason to attempt it. Is it possible to write down the most exciting scenes first? That might keep you motivated.

*** Hello past MagicWeasel! You've been writing for, well, four days, but here's my advice to you:

- You're going to feel worse. MUCH worse. Like, "why am I bothering I am actually going to quit" worse.

- Then you'll feel better. Lots better. You'll be like, "SEE, I AM MAKING PROGRESS. Oh my god! I've written like 6,000 words! Things are happening!". You'll be proud of how much you've written

- You'll google about ww2 a lot but try not to feel bad about it, you're learning!

- Start wherever, because you'll have written it on poor, "I was up all night on NYE" levels of sleep, and you'll ultimately rewrite it

- Talk to your support system. They love you and will support you and will be a big part of making you feel better.

- You'll still be embarrassed to show it to people, but because you fear criticism about something so personal and so unpolished (the obsessive editing that your shorts get just isn't possible here). But the people who are important to you will be eager to see something you're so passionate about.

- You'll like the story better. You'll realise it's much bigger than you thought (MUCH), and you're going to have to include all that side plot with the vampire hunter. You'll want to ditch the prequel you originally aimed to write and start writing something different. You'll even plan to do so. But then it will seem natural to continue the prequel, so you will. And it will be good.

Anyway, I'm only like four days into it, but I hope that helps you.

Lots of love and support -

Yourself, 10 days from now.
