** I've also fired up an account at FictionPress, FanFiction.net's big brother for original fiction, at [[https://www.fictionpress.com/u/983729/DataPacRat]] ; and have posted the first book of S.I. there, to see what sort of traffic it gets there.

*** Fictionpress has practically no readership. The only places you aren't posting it that would possibly increase views is a wordpress account alongside plugging on the few web serial fiction topsites.

**** I have a Wordpress-based blog installed at datapacrat.com, but I know essentially nothing about it beyond 'how to update the software' and 'how to post'. Are there any variants, plugins, or instructions for applying Wordpress for serial fiction?

Which web serial fiction topsites do you have in mind?

***** [[http://thepeninthestone.com/blog/how-to-build-a-serial-story-website-in-wordpress/]] has a few plugin reccommendations.

The two "big" topsites for WSF are [[http://topwebfiction.com/]] and [[http://webfictionguide.com/]]. The first is your classical "beg for votes to get visibility" topsite, while the latter is more focused on building a community of readers, getting visibility with reviews, and making a comprehensive searchable database of WSF's tagged by genre, theme, and setting.

There's a handful of smaller sites with light to medium curation that you'd have a chance with, your best bet would be to put together a submission form letter (and TBH, give the first book a thorough polishing to bring it up to the quality of book 2-4), and spend an afternoon hunting down as many places with open submission boxes.

[[http://theonlinenovel.wordpress.com/where-to-read-or-list-serials/]]

is a decent meta-repository.

The first five links are all good places to drop in on, and the rest in the second category are worth at least dropping in on.

As for the rest, they all require previously unpublished work and exclusivity, boo.

*** Is it fanfiction, or original? If it's non-copyright-violating, I'd be glad to post it on GreenDogPress.blogspot.com (where I'm selling my own novella, "One Hot Night" </shameless_plug>) so that you can earn at least a little coin from it.

*** Weren't you going to put it on your own site?

**** Indeed, I've got a placeholder page at [[http://www.datapacrat.com/SI/]] . I'm trying to figure out what it would take to get Wordpress to use that site for that content.

And in the meantime, there's no particular reason /not/ to post the story in multiple places.
