Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I have a story I'm still writing, and I got to the point in the story where the self insert for me and the summoner I'm working with purges the depression from my soul.

I have to say, as someone with depression, putting your depression inside a story and then arranging for it to have the crap beaten out with teamwork of it feels good. Even if the method, out of context, is utterly ridiculous.

Actually, it feels EVEN better that it is ridiculous. I told depression to take a nap, and then had a pile of nearly helpless babies all punch it for one damage while it was sleeping, and that's the kind of undignified end it deserves.

With analogy to the fact that the coronavirus vaccine has just been [[https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/11/the-fdas-vaccine-advisory-committee-will-meet-dec-8-10.html][forwarded to the FDA for emergency approval, but instead of giving themselves as short a time as possible, they're waiting until December to hold their first meeting.]] It's a shame we don't feel the urgency the same way HJPEV did.

To add to this, I think the expected utility of a covid vaccine is comparable to the stone over the course of a year,

#+begin_quote
  Once you know how it works, the Stone can do one complete restoration to full health and youth every two hundred and thirty-four seconds. Three hundred sixty people per day. One hundred and thirty-four thousand healings per year. That should be enough to stop, all the wizards everywhere, and all the goblins and house-elves and whoever, from dying. Of old age, or anything else.
#+end_quote

134,000 deaths per year is about 3 months of US covid deaths at current rates, with an [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200923124557.htm][average of 10 years of life lost each]]. Now each philosophers stone healing probably gives you a lot more life years, say 100 since we're talking about wizards (how long do goblins and house-elves live?), so 13.4 million life years saved per year.

The covid epidemic is expected to most likely kill [[https://goodjudgment.io/superforecasts/][2.7 to 7.4 million people by next March]] , I.e. 27 to 74 million life years lost. So if a vaccine prevents a decent fraction of that it could be more effective than a year of stone use (assuming the qualities of life in each scenario are equal).

** I posted this on the last Friday Open Thread, but a few days late to the party. Trying again today!

I thought it might be worthwhile to create a document summarizing a bunch of knowledge that could be useful for writing a character with the power of Aerokinesis. Here is the outline that I've thought up so far:

- Gases -- State of Matter

  - Ideal gas law, vacuum, etc.

- Atmosphere

  - Composition
  - Pressure & Temperature
  - Layers

- Wind

  - Wind Speed (definitions and measurement)
  - Wind Power.

- Weather -- Other aspects of.
- Biology -- Respiration
- Geomorphology -- Aeolian processes and features.
- Mythology -- Sky, Wind, & Weather Gods.

What do you humans think? Any constructive thoughts and feedback? Or emotionally-withering criticism?

+P.S.: Is there a way to do sub-bullets in Reddit? I don't see anything about it in the formatting help.+

*** Brainstorming fairly widely:

- You mention Biology-Respiration, but that is a special case of chemical reactions involving air.
- Concepts of flow, like laminar versus turbulent
- Helicopters do some weird things: autorotation, vortex ring state. General principles of flight, including lift, thrust, stability, and control surfaces. Ground-effect. (The physics of sailing ship sails are also a bit non-obvious if I recall? Tacking to sail into the wind, if nothing else.)
- How aerokinesis and force/thrust interact (momentum-conserving or not)
- Net thrust generation by only pushing air away from front of craft. If a vacuum can be tolerated, that alone is 14.7 pounds of force per square inch of cross-section. A DBZ one-man space-capsule thing would get, what, at 6ft diameter, 239 thousand pounds of force, is that right? In excessive of 250 g's initial acceleration (drag notwithstanding)? (/"The NHTSA standard for a sudden impact acceleration on a human that would cause severe injury or death is 75 g's for a "50th percentile male", 65 g's for a "50th percentile female", and 50 g's for a "50th percentile child"/).
- Air-hockey or hovercraft effect: using air-flow or a bubble of air to reduce or avoid friction
- Cushioning a fall (or the reverse: launching)
- Buoyancy in air, air buoyancy in water, adding bubbles to water to reduce boyancy
- Transmission of sound
- Sound barrier, sonic boom, pressure waves, overpressure/blast waves/explosions
- Scattering of light, lensing, schlieren photography, rainbow effect
- Re-entry-style 'burn up' (apparently from compression of the air rather than friction with object? TIL)
- Convection
- Plasma and ions; liquids
- Moving ions are affected by and generate magnetic fields
- Particulates
- Air/fuel ratios, stoking
- Dust explosions, relighting candles by igniting the 'smoke', gasoline fumes
- Backdraft, firestorms
- Tornadoes, water spouts, dust devils, hurricanes/typhoons
- Lightning, volcanic lightning, thundersnow
- Hail formation
- Impact winter, volcanic winter
- Pressurized air can be deadly dangerous
- Bubbles in blood stream is dangerous
- Vacuum-sealed, air-tight
- Whistling
- Superfluidity
- Solar wind, cosmic wind, northern lights
- Accretion disks, Van Allen belt
- Transitions between phases (wild difference between liquid volume and gas volume, or density; latent energy; triple point; pressurizing to the point of condensing; refrigeration using both pressure change and phase change; sublimation)
- Mole (the unit)
- The exoskeleton with artificial muscles powered by the pressure created by hydrolysis; other reactions that consume or produce pressure
- Partial pressure
- Dissolving gasses in liquids
- Zero gravity
- Relationship between temperature, molecular weight, and velocity
- Uranium enrichment via mass-based separation via centrifuging gas
- Something something Jupiter's red spot and blue poles
- Viscosity, and its increasing relevance at small scales like for bugs
- Scent, scent-tracking, 'down-wind'
- Ballistics windage (and, not really related to wind, but I mean I guess air is not exactly anchored to the ground, so sort of?: Coriolis/Eotvos effects cause 'curving' of ballistic paths and thus I assume of the paths of air particles as well (between particle-particle interactions))

*** I'd add a knowledge of drag, and also heat and mass transfer. Drag calculations would help one know if one can knock things over. Heat and mass transfer is immense in this case: can one dilute poison gas? or cause evaporation of water? or cool things down? or put out fires? or make infernos?

Practical use example: Wind at your back while running would not only make you faster but make you more comfortable as well, by evaporating water from your skin. Having drag favor you instead of hinder you might make sprinting relatively effortless.

These considerations likely fall under 'engineering.'

** I have discovered what I think may be the arithmetic inverse of the unfalsifiable statement. I call them hyperfalsifying statements.

An unfalsifiable statement is one which could still be true no matter what plausible evidence you could hypothetically collect. There is no test you could do to determine whether you live in the universe where it is true, or false. Souls are unfalsifiable, as is the invisible pink dragon in my garage.

A hyperfalsifying statement, however, is one which allows you to reject all other philosophical or epistemological positions with equal efficacy, if you take it as a given. For instance, it is true that human reason is a flawed tool for determining truth. It is also true that we must necessarily involve reason in the process of doing literally anything other than being a vegetable with our sensory inputs. Therefore, if you take the true statement, "Human reason is flawed" as an axiom, it is impossible to hold any other axioms, because literally all of them must go through this flawed, untrustworthy tool. Therefore, "Human reason is flawed" is a hyperfalsifying statement in the context of epistemological debate UNLESS you burden it with a bunch of caveats that effectively draw out an epistemology anyway.

I realize hyperfalsifying statements are as useless in constructing our view of the world as unfalsifiable ones. But they're useless in /new and exciting ways/ which I, for one, hadn't considered before. So I decided I'd write it up here.

** So I've read a few time loop stories here. Mother of Learning of course, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, RE: Trailer Trash, and such.

What all would you do if the present you was inserted into past-you's body at some earlier point in time? What starting point would you pick, and why? What would you change about your own past and relationships, and what might you change about the world?

I'd likely pick the end of 5th grade for myself. I don't think I'd go for band class (with the clarinet), and probably just study guitar on my own. I'd have also done more to help my parents, and such. I would have tried to get in shape earlier, back when it was easier.

I've had ideas for at least 3 (original!) SF novels rattling around in my head, so having plenty of free time to work on those would be good. Even if I published them now, I don't think they'd have much of an impact, but back then (when the market was much, much smaller), I'd have a much greater chance of success. That in turn would provide an infusion of cash to invest in various stocks (tech companies of course). For example, I'd be able to ride Microsoft to its 1999 peak, and then shift that over to Apple, along with investing in the usual suspects (Google, etc.).

I'd also likely try to influence politics a bit, and try to get climate change and pollution more widely accepted. The Koch brothers would be a problem there.

Preventing the Sept 11th, 2001 attack seems like a good idea, and would be an "easy" way to prevent a lot of unnecessary suffering. I don't know that the Iraq invasion could have been prevented without also keeping GWB out of the president's office, so I'd have to interfere there as well, most likely.

I'd also likely try to push for greater energy independence. I like the present work with small modular fission reactors, and I don't see any reason why that couldn't have been pushed forward a couple decades. I'd also push Thorium MSR technology, but we have yet to see that pay off, so I'd want to hedge bets there. Ditto for Fusion.

There's some other social things I'd push. I would be good to find at least one major city that would be on-board with decriminalizing drugs, and pushing for treatment instead of jail. If that alleviates poverty and promotes growth (and the entire process is well documented), that could also move things forward by a couple decades.

I'd probably move to New Zealand or South Korea before 2020, for obvious reasons.

Since you mention that, maybe move to NZ by 2010.

The exact circumstances of Covid-19 are certainly subject to the butterfly effect. The reactions by the various world governments and their constituents is a lot more stable. Some kind of pandemic was bound to hit us. Maybe SARS v2.0, who knows?

Even without 45 in the White House, undermining the hard work of the public health officials (and yes, there are a variety of paths I would pursue to ensure that never happens), you'd still have the right-wing media calling it a hoax, and "freedom-loving patriots" not wanting to wear a mask or exercise some common sense.

#+end_quote

FYI, COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its mechanism is a “better” way of killing people, so it's SARS 2.0 literally in two ways, structure and function:

#+begin_quote
  Benhur Lee, MD, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says the difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 likely stems from an extra protein each of the viruses requires to activate and spread. Although both viruses dock onto cells through ACE2 receptors, another protein is needed to crack open the virus so its genetic material can get into the infected cell. The additional protein the original SARS virus requires is only present in lung tissue, but the protein for SARS-CoV-2 to activate is present in all cells, especially endothelial cells.
#+end_quote

The result is that SARS 1 was a respiratory disease, but SARS 2 is a circulatory disease that also attacks lungs. Apropos to the sub, this conceptually shows a good way to do a sequel: amp up and modify the original threat in a surprising way.

Ideas that in principle could be discovered earlier are most useful. Bitcoin, but also wheeled luggage, floss sticks, upside-down ketchup bottles, and the like. The simpler the better.

For maximum good I could memorize the critical insights from a few hundred research papers and email them to the researchers that made those discoveries. That would jumpstart their progress with relatively little effort on my part.

Art wouldn't be as easy to short-circuit. It's hard to memorize entire works, and the plot points of novels aren't sufficient; you need good writing. Even if I memorize the notes and lyrics to the most popular songs of the last x years, without starting fame I can't disseminate the compositions. Also I'd still need musical talent to actually sing or play myself.

(Speaking of which, that is a major self-improvement I'd make: learning to play an instrument.)

I'd try to get in on the ground floor of every major website. Dates are important here: Youtube couldn't happen before adequate bandwidth, for example. Timing and function are more important than the name of the organization, so this requires I keep my ear to the ground. I might just use the dates and basic functionality to narrowly beat them to the market.

With sufficient money, I don't need to write anything myself. Just pay others to do it, and use my foreknowledge to guide the enterprise. Hidden failure modes might torpedo some of my companies, but I only need a few major successes.

With all the power these activities afford me... hmm. Well I haven't actually thought that far!
