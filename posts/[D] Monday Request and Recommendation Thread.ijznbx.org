** I've been looking for more sci-fi, and came across [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]] by J P Koenig (completed).

The story follows a human-turned-AI, Nikola v1.01, as it is tasked with building a new home for humanity following the destruction of Earth. Nikola spends her time on an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1036_Ganymed][1035 Ganymed]], a near-Earth asteroid, working at expanding it and preparing it as Humanity's next home. At 24 chapters, the story is relatively short, more of a novella than a novel, and can be binged in a few hours.

I found it to be a very enjoyable read, with an interesting plot and good world-building. There were parts of it that were a bit dense when describing technology, but they were short and helped develop the story. There isn't much character development, given that the main character is an AI and how short the story is, though the AI Nikola does improve itself as the story progresses.

*** I saw that mentioned (here, probably) a while ago, and started it, but didn't finish.

The one thing that bothered me a lot was what exactly was the tech level available to the protagonist? Did humanity have access to FTL or not? That's a pretty big deal in my book. I'm fine with it either way, but it should have been one or the other, instead of vague.

OK, so you've got an alien invasion, and they have FTL. Fine. If you have it, yes, maybe study theirs to see if it works different, is more efficient, or don't if it isn't useful. If you don't have it, then study of FTL is a big deal and must necessarily be a major plot point. However, in Post Human, there were times where it seemed the protagonist did have access to FTL, but that really wasn't clear. For the part that I read, the protag was acting as if she didn't have FTL tech. But didn't seem to be trying too hard to get it. Strange.

**** They didn't have FTL. It's not vague: they mention all the time they use impulse engines in the asteroid and later gravity engines which they reverse engineered. The assault drones are specifically stated to use "ion engines for thrust, with solid-rocket afterburners for sudden changes to delta-v."

The're no mention of anyone having built an FTL engine, and the only time it's brought is when the Moebius strip is used by the alien ship to escape the solar system

***** Really?

The aliens are the "Orion Arm Trading Company", and they want to ship out rare metals from the solar system to... elsewhere, in return for gadgets. How is this going to work on a reasonable timescale without FTL?

Also, in chapter 10, they talk about one of the Voyager missions going towards the galactic core, which is ~25K light years from here. And doing that in hundreds of years.

At any rate, human civilization had some means to send macro-scale spacecraft at nearly the speed of light, even though they were not at Kardashev level 2 yet. If you're not doing FTL, that's a whole lotta energy, so something doesn't add up. I don't know, maybe that was a mistake by the author.

****** 1. They're aliens, the value of materials is relative, and so is time. To them it is a good investment of their time, to others it might not be.

2. The Mobius strip allows for FTL travel. FTL engines don't exist, that doesn't mean they can't take advantage of an anomaly that allows for FTL travel. Getting there would have taken hundreds of years, getting back to Earth doesn't. They mention that it takes 6 months for the alien spaceship to travel from the asteroid belt to the anomaly, using normal engines.

3. The Voyager mission would have used an ion engine, which pick up speed over time. They mention using them for other spaceships. In chapter 22, they specifically say “Gerry is now officially *the fastest man-made object ever to cross the solar system. He's at 0.2c*, and will be rocketing past Earth in another six hours or so.” The Voyager missions are also allowed to take time since they're (technically) unmanned here.

Most of your problem seems to be that you skimmed over chapter 16, because the explanation is there

#+begin_quote
  “I find it unlikely,” said Zia. “If the geometry is correct, than this Mobius strip is forming a band hundreds of light-years in length. Even if they could somehow enter it, and survive it, the journey would take longer than going the ‘long' way.”

  I went back to the gravimetric readings of the milliseconds leading up to the ship vanishing. In particular, I examined what the ship had done with its gravity fields just as it approached. It had a giant bubble gravity field, just like the alien craft I had disassembled had used, far larger than the craft needed. Now I had an inkling as to why it had been so large.

  “They didn't take the long way,” I said. “They bounced off of it, a ricochet that picked up velocity that shouldn't even be possible.”

  “What are you talking about?” demanded Zia.

  “Their gravity bubble, the outer one that we thought was too large. It was exactly opposite the readings of the anomaly. They bounced off of it, and got flung away at a faster-than-light speed.”

  “That would take infinite energy to propel infinite mass,” argued Zia. “That's not possible. Unless... Alcubierre was a lot closer than we thought.”

  We argued the math back and forth for a little while, before we came to an hypothetical understanding. Somehow, they'd picked up a Jupiter-sized amount of energy off of the anomaly, getting flung wildly across space. The amount of energy involved meant that space and time was compressing in front of them in a negative mass, counterbalancing their own increased mass, while space and time expanded behind them to shove them along. This could only end in one of two ways. They would careen into an object at supralight speeds, causing a truly epic explosion, of the sort that could destroy solar systems, or they would get caught by the other end of the Mobius strip. At that end, they would catch the other side of the strip, and it would absorb that acceleration, slowing them down and letting them bounce off gently.

First off the bat would be the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse][Bobiverse]] It has most everything you're looking for and focuses on user of upload / enhanced extension. It gets recommended here a bit, if you've got audible the audiobook versions are fantastic.

I'll second the recommendation already made in the thread for [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]]

Semi-Rational:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1126719.House_of_Suns][House of Suns]] Not sure if this can be rational or not, the timescales and advanced tech make it all very fantasy like. Lightspeed is still the fastest thing, with time being the medium of travel where people are in stasis for thousands of years. AI tech and all of what you mentions is prevalent.

Not so Rational:

It's pretty much not particularly 'rational' in most ways, but there's a ton of cool space opera stuff. It reminds me a lot of Iain M. Banks' Culture books in overall aesthetics, futurism, etc. The central 'twist', if it can even be called such, was super obvious to me from basically the start of the book, but having a fairly obvious plot didn't ruin the book for me. The plot twist was extremely similar to [[https://web.archive.org/web/20180201103146/http://squid314.livejournal.com/336195.html][one of Scott Alexander's short stories]] which I loved (the story in question, if you read it/have read it, could be construed as spoiler for Empress of Forever, but then again the plot of the book being predictable didn't spoil my enjoyment much.)

They always have the MC being smug and feeling all smart about being the only entity to ever make a pacifistic dungeon or put a town/inn in it, and always get way too emotional and make baffling choices. It's such an interesting concept as well, with freedom of creation that's limited only by imagination. There's a lot of opportunities to munckin the shit out of things, and the most interesting abuse of mechanics I've seen came from Lazy Dungeon Master, which fell flat in every other aspect besides clever ploys.

It has several huge spoilers for Worm, in case you haven't read that and are planning to, but doesn't really require much background knowledge so long as you are willing to accept that the main character had a past before becoming a dungeon. Overall, it mostly does its own thing with its own setting and just happens to have the main character of another story as its protagonist, and overall it's pretty decently done.

It does play the "unexpectedly friendly dungeon" trope, but better than most and with a setting that still sets up future conflict once the locals accept her. Essentially, she winds up in an impoverished buffer state between two hostile empires currently in an uneasy truce. Most of the local dungeons (which provide an important ecological and economic role) were wiped out a generation earlier, and now her appearance is both a lifeline and a promise of renewed hostilities as the currently unstable equilibrium is broken.

My only real complaint about the story so far is that the update pace is on the slow side, and the plot hasn't been breakneck either. The characters, world building, and general story development have been pretty spot on though, in my opinion.

********* I read through all of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][Blue Core]] over the last few days, and it's kinda similar. It's about a guy getting isekai'd into a dungeon core, where he decides to be a friendly one (as opposed to an instrument of terror). It is unexpectedly rational, in that both enemies and allies try to make smart decisions and optimize. The worldbuilding and magic system are well done, and are pretty deep. The dungeon and his companions gain power pretty fast, but the enemies they are facing are really powerful, so it never feels like he's getting overpowered.

My only gripe about it is the harem and explicit scenes. Some of the development feels a little off, and compared to the competence of the rest of the novel the explicit scenes feel a little added on. You can of course skim through them, and explicit chapters are labeled well. Overall it's surprisingly good!

** I've been reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends][Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends]] for a while now, and I gotta say, it keeps getting better and better. It's one of the few xianxia I've enjoyed and would recommend. The premise is that there are system apocalypses, 10 years after which the top 10,000 survivors are taken to a higher realm: The Infinite Realm. The story follows the 2 remaining survivors of one of these apocalypses, how they got there, and what they'll do from now on. There is a lot of good worldbuilding, with the author showing how having a litrpg system affects society. The main characters have depth, and while they aren't always rational, they aren't dumb either. They go looking for knowledge and power, and try to exploit the system as much as it allows. At first, one of the characters is much more interesting than the other, but the most recent volume develops the less interesting character a lot, and now both characters are fun to read. The power system is also explored really well, with there being three main pathways to power which are somewhat exclusive and very distinct. Once a month or so, we get a side story from one of the top powers of the Infinite Realm, which both shows how these power pathways pan out over the long term, as well as show the long term story direction.

Another story I've been enjoying is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34670/the-featherlight-transmission][The Featherlight Transmission]]. It's sorta like a biopunk Dresden Files. The world is like the world of Dorohedoro, except the people in power are cyborgs instead of magic users. The main character is a biomancer (basically flesh druid) tasked to find the killer of a recent string of murders. His narration is for the most part really enjoyable, with some jokes making me laugh out loud. I sometimes find the fourth wall breaks a little tedious, but overall really enjoying it so far.

Specifically, I found Chloe's character to be rather grating, and so had little interest in her as a romantic partner or friend, and Warren was... ok, but not terribly exciting. Rachel, Finn, and Cassidy likewise didn't do much for me. Instead, I liked the games for their supernatural elements and PNW setting, as well as their extended casts / b-plots.

As for mindset, the appeal here for me was the handling of Deep Time in regards to mindset and personal axioms. People change over time yes, but also become more set in their ways. Dependent on the persons, a few hundred years of extra memories isn't something that's going to cause those to drift.

I'd also argue that utilitarian =/= rational. The utilitarian approach can ignore emotions, and personal desires. Saving the Bay is ethical, utilitarian, and perhaps even the right thing to do. That does not make it the rational choice for a character when saving the bay kills the person they are in love with.

Rational characters have their own agendas, agency, and desires. How they go about executing strategies to meet their own goals is the rational approach. It only so happens that most rational characters are also bound by ethics, its very close to utilitarianism in execution but not necessarily goal.

An excellent series of stories, about batman, that genuinely feel as though they were set in the late thirties. Excellent writing and research.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/spider-liv-olivia-octavius-au-quest.53960/page-3#post-12218583][Spider-Liv]] Excellent Spider-Man fanfic in an AU marvel setting; among others, Olivia Octavia as Spider-Person, here Arachne. Features transhumanism, politics, AI.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/][Impurity]] Worm fanfic. AU Altpower, but well written, and unlike basically every alt-power out there it both knows where it wants to go /and/ that place isn't stations of canon with a new skin.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25633546/chapters/63655201][Administrative Mishap]] Worm/Supergirl. It's a post GM fic, where the only part that survived Contessa's bullets was Queen Administrator, but a queen administrator that's been irrevocably altered by binding so closely with Taylor.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.39011/][Assimilation]] Somewhat self indulgent DC fic, but much better than pretty much everything in the glut of YJ fics. Significantly more rational-aesthetic than most of the stuff here.

*** I liked "Forging Hephaestus" by Drew Hayes. It has the public heroes vs. villains setting, if I remember correctly, is relatively long and stands on its own (unfortunately it's only the first book so far). Plus the MC does a bit of power-munchkinry.

**** I believe that his earlier "Super Powereds" series was set in the same universe. It's about a group of students attending an extremely competitive school for future superheroes. It was... decent. The best parts were the actual school and training. There was a degree of munchkinry just because students had to push themselves hard to improve and use their powers as well as they could since each year they were competing for an ever more limited number of slots.

There is an overarching plotline, but I found it passable at best. The characters were decent, but nothing amazing.

From a rational perspective, I'm not convinced that the school system makes sense as described, but the moment to moment actions are mostly intelligent ish and thought out from what I can remember.

It used to be a web serial, but has been taken down (temporarily?) for an Amazon release.

*** Chronicles of Fid is a completed trilogy about the world's biggest supervillain, Dr. Fid. It was pretty enjoyable when I read it. Not /that/ rational, and some moments are a bit too ridiculous for the overall serious tone of the story.

One thing I liked is that the main character is pretty smart and actually comes off as an adult. He's able to introspect on his good and bad decisions and starts to actually change himself to better fit his aspirations.

*** I'm going to assume you're fairly new to the genera, since you only mention Worm, and are asking for such a broad class of stories. So here are the classics that most exemplify what you're looking for (in no particular order):

***** It's told from the perspective of Lex Luthor. How does a mortal with no powers go up against someone who is, essentially, a god?

The answer is lots of creative use of resources (if not powers), and significant amounts of munchkinry.

*** Dante and Blays from The Cycle of Arawn and The Cycle of Galand are really enjoyable to read. Not really a rational story, but fun and enjoyable. Their banter is excellent, and the moments where they get tricked by trying to be too smart are enjoyable too. It's about a kid who discovers necromancer powers, and uses that to go up in society.

Lies of Locke Lamora has Locke and Jean. Fourth book is coming out late next year. Great banter and dialogue, but the story beats felt sort of dubious. It's a fantasy heist series.

Zombie Knight Saga has Garovel and Hector, and pretty much all the other reaper/servant pairs. Although they aren't really a dynamic duo I guess. Really good story and one of my favorites. Really funny at times, with a great magic system and intricate worldbuilding.
