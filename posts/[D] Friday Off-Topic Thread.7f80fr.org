Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

*** You could try to chat with your sister and listen to and respond to her concerns maybe? Might be good for her to have a trustworthy and sympathetic ear (also, I hadn't read your 3rd to last sentence when I wrote this -- so I guess what prevents that trustworthy adult from being you? You could skype or call them or something without much difficulty). And it'd be good to teach your younger siblings good financial/budgeting/spending/saving habits so they don't learn from your parents, though I guess it sounds like you're doing ok? So maybe that's not as necessary (especially if they're coming up with money-saving lists on their own).

Assuming your parents are having basic needs met (and aren't buying digital goods while starving or something) and the concern for retirement is they eventually won't have $ to meet those basic needs, you could consider starting a secret retirement fund for them instead of sending money to them directly, maybe?

If you ([[/u/Kylinger][u/Kylinger]]) decide to pursue that course of action, I would recommend not initiating it up with something like "so I found your list in the trash" and instead go for something more along the lines of "so are mom and dad still being really bad at handling money and overspending" as if it's a known variable, letting her know that it's not just her and that other people also see your parents spending patterns as abnormal and that it's normal to notice it.

** I really enjoyed My Hero Academia. The music is great, the action is great, most of the characters are interesting. But that can be said for a lot of shows: objectively My Hero Academia is fairly standard "great" anime, if that makes sense. I just know it connected with me on some deeper-than-usual level because I was tearing up by the end of the second episode: the last thing that made me cry that quick was Ender's Game.

I think the premise is what really sets it apart. Not the premise of "high school for superheroes," that's fine but nothing too special. I mean the premise of "what does it mean to be a hero in a world where 80% of the population has super powers?"

In most fiction with superheroes and villains in it, the people with powers are heroes because who else will be? "With great power comes great responsibility" and all that. Those stories occasionally explore what it means to be a hero on a deeper level, but the focus is still on the superpowers, because outside of people like Batman and Iron Man, Step 1 is always "Have powers." In their case it's "Have lots of money," which is just another way to say "Have power."

But in a world like My Hero Academia, almost EVERYONE has powers, having powers doesn't make you special. Sure some Quirks are pretty terrible for crime fighting and some are awesome for it, but even if yours is something as non-combat focused as making objects lighter, or talking to animals, the drive to be a hero as opposed to just working in construction or at the zoo or similar civilian tasks is what sets a hero apart. This is what it means when the protagonist gets chosen, despite being Quirkless.

I think the real focus of the show is that, in a world where everyone's special (and so nobody is), learning to be a hero means more than just learning how to use your powers. It means everything else: the desire, sometimes the /need/ to act when no one else will, or the spirit of sacrifice that goes beyond that which others expect of us, or even what we expect of ourselves.

[[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html][Ah, so just like the real world, then!]] Though I guess the baseline IRL superpower package tends to be pretty uniform -- the booooring "walking squishy brick" -- supervision, superhearing, superstrength, superspeed, supermobility, superanalyticalreasoning, etc. and further specialization is more often the result of practice than anything else (except when you filter your reference class by "practice a helluva lot" -- then most of the variation obviously goes back to being attributable to "inborn superability", though even there the variation has often shrunk to barely anything relative to the whole population). Some supertechnology has given people even more superpowers, and inequality in its allocation seems to exacerbate matters somewhat, but still...

** (potential) ~*/WORM SPOILERS/*~

I had [[https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/7ese00/batman_vs_contessa_with_30_seconds_of_prep/dq7hw9h/][an interesting discussion]] recently on how Contessa (or, more generally, PtV) would fare in various contests, e.g. fighting Batman or playing darts or picking large numbers. It reminded me of another question I'd had about Worm when I'd first read it years ago (but never got a satisfactory answer to): is the Worm multiverse stochastic (as implied by Dinah's power, some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparison_of_interpretations][interpretations of QM]], etc.) or deterministic (as implied by a strong interpretation of PtV or Coil's power, ignoring "blind spots" which imo should very rapidly cloud the future even in a deterministic universe without overwhelming preponderance of negative feedback due to sensitivity-to-initial-conditions reasons, trapping their users in some local minimum of future-space or some entirely foreign possible timeline, respectively)? Does precognition in Worm generally allow for total knowledge of the behavior of every particle in Worm (I guess the consequences would be similar if probability is a property of the system sensu stochasticity or a property of the precognitor's mind)?

(related) ~*/REAL WORLD SPOILERS/*~

This also relates to another question I've had regarding initial-conditions sensitivity and the nature of feedback loops that structure interactions and processes IRL. Note: IANAP, so apologies if this question is ill-conceived or poorly specified. If the universe at small scales is stochastic -- how long would it take for two identical earths, duplicated at this exact moment in time, to diverge such that one could [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_the_difference][spot-the-difference]] visually at the macro scale (or if that's too vague -- until you have the case where a person is dead in one universe, but alive in the other universe "10 minutes later" in their reference frame)? Since in recent centuries we've constructed tools that allows super minute effects to be amplified enormously, how would the distribution of times-to-noticeable-difference change if stuff like geiger counters didn't exist, e.g. the duplication happened not now but 1,000 years ago?

/Alternatively/, if our universe is deterministic -- say you have the same duplication and spot-the-difference condition, but now there's a slight difference in the two universe. Where the first looks as it should, the second is missing a single hydrogen atom from the center of the planet Jupiter, and is in all other respects identical. How long before the two universes visibly diverge? Obviously it would need to be at least .5-1h for gravity from Jupiter to propagate as far as earth, but can we say anything the order of magnitude of time it would take for macro-differences to arise (a year? a million years? my intuitions fail me)?

*** When it comes to how quickly quantum scale randomness would make its way to the macroscopic level I'm of the belief it would happen quite rapidly. Because there's quite a few things like brownian motion that ought to be directly affected by quantum randomness due to being highly sensitive systems (like double pendulums but far worse). Which means I suspect in perhaps a few weeks the weather ought to be noticeably different since weather being highly sensitive is pretty well accepted.

However I think things may well diverge in other macroscopic ways more rapidly than that. More generally I expect /any/ system that's highly sensitive to initial conditions (ie the sorts of systems that are hard enough to predict they seem random) to probably diverge rapidly. This is just because even relatively simple computer simulation of sensitive systems can rapidly diverge simply because of a difference in initial conditions of one part in a million or less as is mentioned in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8wGQW-Y48][this video]].

So I suspect the number of systems that will be close enough to quantum scale effects to be affected is pretty large. Importantly however there will be many more higher scale systems that are within enough orders of magnitude of /those/ systems to also be affected and of course further systems affected by /those/ systems and so on up until you reach macroscopic levels.

Anyway I suspect that in addition to weather (though that takes weeks so it's not /very/ rapid) and things like lotteries that deliberately try to be as pseudo random as possible there would be many systems that would diverge within a day such as:

- Human behavior: I suspect some of our behavior is going to be affected by the brownian motion of individual neurotransmitters. So if the brownian motion is different then some neurons that would otherwise have reached the threshold for firing wouldn't or vice versa. How noisy particular people's behavior is however is hard to guess at.

- Things highly susceptible to /any/ difference in human behavior: If the noisiness of neurons is different I expect things like dice rolling which are fairly pseudorandom to not go the same as in another timeline.

- The specific behavior of pretty much any life: The point about neuronal noise applies to other vertebrates however even single celled organisms are going to be a little bit noisy because of brownian chemical motion.

Hmm well, Brownian motion in itself is a stochastic process, so that's putting the cart before the horse a bit imo, and it also has the Markov property and expectation (0,0...) so I don't think any non-Brownian perturbations would really affect it any. Unless you mean to say that the quantum foam itself behaves in a manner that's roughly Brownian?

Is this well established? Some of weather's current unpredictability might just be due to model misspecification and insufficiently granular observational scales -- I wonder if we could do a better job of predicting the weather if we had e.g. some ultrasophisticated mechanistic model and microdrones measuring conditions of every single cubic meter of the earth, or something. Climate certainly seems fairly predictable, but averaging chunks obviously removes variance. Maybe within some climatic range variation is chaotic? (e.g. you're very confident the weather in superstabledesertland is going to be sunny and between 110-111F exactly ten years from now, but can't say where in (110,111) it is -- likewise, you can be quite confident the earth won't freeze to absolute zero a century from now, etc.). Lorenz said something similar in his '72 talk but presumably the field has progressed quite a bit in the half-century since. IDK.

Eh just because it's easy to implement a model with a certain property doesn't mean the property holds with respect to any real world process. I took a pop eco class a few years ago and we coded up a bunch of these positive Lyapunov exponent models but the instructor made plenty sure to distinguish between math-world and real-world dynamics (e.g. models of community structure fail to account for all the negative feedback loops in actual animal behavior afaict). Has it been super well established that these systems behave as they do IRL? edit: actually a double pendulum isn't a bad example here -- in math-world super chaotic, swinging to-and-from all willy-nilly, but in real-world I can very accurately predict where it'll be at some distant future point (at rest, due to negative feedback loops in the form of air and kinetic friction).

I'd say human behavior is pretty stable and balancing, actually! Most of my every-day behavior feels rather railroaded -- e.g. I check both ways when I cross the street, eat when I am hungry, strive to maintain other equilibria/homeostasis, etc. IDK much about action at the molecular level but it seems brains have a fair bit of redundancy, too.

My go-to examples of small-to-large amplification have always been: germline mutation generating novel phenotypic variation, and the filtering of hundreds of millions of sperm to just one during fertilization (which seem to get all swirled up during ejaculation, and if nothing else usually a couple hundred sperm are solid contenders during the actual egg breaching iirc. There might be some vaguely Brownian effects on their travel, too!). Though these might not have direct repurcussions until a few weeks into the pregnancy (where alternative embryos might impose different nutritional demands on the mother).

I mean I was addressing the question of assuming quantum randomness how rapidly does that propagate up to noticeable macroscopic differences. As for quantum phenomenon behaving randomly in this context that seems basically settled, unless you want to stray out of well established models. In Copenhagen it's random, and in Many World's it's random from the perspective of any given Everett branch.

As for weather I was just referring to specific details not large term stuff/trends (though some pretty large stuff like specific hurricanes seems likely to be highly sensitive to initial conditions).

#+begin_quote
  Eh just because it's easy to implement a model with a certain property doesn't mean the property holds with respect to any real world process.
#+end_quote

I probably should have explained that with more detail: The models like that weren't deliberately designed to be random. The one mentioned in the video was designed to model weather they discovered that changing whether you rounded at the 5th decimal or 6th (or something like that) would totally change things. Yes it's a simplified model, of real world phenomenon, however I wouldn't expect a vastly more complicated one to be /less/ sensitive to initial conditions since that's not generally the trend in chaos theory.

When it comes to human behavior yeah you're right people are for the most part fairly predictable, which is why I was careful to caveat that this applied much more to some behavior than others. However it's not like you can deny that some aspects of human behavior can't be predicted with near certainty beforehand since everything is running on slightly noisy hardware.\\
For instance I frequently make decisions where I have no strong opinion one way or the other, and so I suspect my final decision is down to neuronal noise. Though I also frequently use [[https://qrng.anu.edu.au/RawBin.php#][a quantum random number generator]] to make those decisions.

As for which people are born, that is also one of my go to's for a really obvious example of the butterfly effect since it seems like any change in initial conditions will probably change which if any sperm meets the egg and it's something which is much easier to point to than a combination of many tiny changes adding up.

ah, but they're afaik not even unintentionally random -- they're still very much deterministic, just really sensitive to where you start them. Kick em off in the same place and they'll go to the same spot every time. Though I think you can approximate a chaotic process with a stochastic process, and you can also propagate your initial uncertainty through the model to get some distribution of outcomes at the end. But that's perhaps a different sort of probability than that of stochasticity.

eh, I don't see this really. As mentioned some dead simple models can exhibit chaotic behavior, some really complex models do not, and in the end it seems like plenty of real world processes are rife with negative feedback and drawn to particular optima. But I'm not that familiar with chaos theory so if it's the general trend are there examples (like, you some somehow increase the # of parameters in some particular model in some unbiased way and it gets more chaotic?).

Aha! So you'd be a quick avenue for divergence in my original question if we live in that sort of stochastic universe! Though it does say "The hardware is constantly generating random bits at a rate of 5.7Gbits/s. Currently, the rate at which the live bits are streamed is being limited by the bandwidth of the internet connection." so draws from that site are still pretty deterministic at especially small time-scales.

******* When it comes to the fact the computer simulations used for chaotic systems are generally deterministic that doesn't really matter much for our purposes since the important thing is that it's highly susceptible to initial conditions. As for these sorts of systems getting more chaotic with more complexity that will depend on whether the relevant influencers are convergent or divergent. But with something like a double pendulum adding more pendulums will only exacerbate the chaos in a lot of circumstances the more chaotic connected systems there are the less predictable things are.

I mean whether that counts as deterministic would depend on what you're using that word to mean. By the standard you seem to be using anything that's not /directly/ connected to a source of quantum noise would count as deterministic, since one could hypothetically look at the quantum noise before it affected the system in question and thus predict the outcome in advance.\\
In another sense however it's obvious not deterministic, since you couldn't predict things in advance of the generation of the quantum noise.

** *PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:*

If you don't already own a virtual reality headset, now's a great time to get one because they're all on sale right now.

I'd personally recommend the [[https://www.digitaltrends.com/vr-headset-reviews/samsung-odyssey-review/][Samsung HMD Odyssey]], but the other Windows headsets and the Rift and the Vive and the PSVR should all provide a compelling experience. I owned a GearVR for a while, and even /that/ was relatively decentish; if you've got a recent Samsung phone and you just want to dip your toes in the water and see what all the VR fuss is about, it's not a bad option at under a hundred bucks.

Seriously though, VR is ridiculous and incredible and you should look into it and seriously consider getting a headset.

Thank you for your attention. This concludes our public service announcement.

I disagree about the movement issue. There's (in my opinion too few) games that allow you to walk around with the joystick like you would in a FPS, but you have to get your sea legs to do that or else you'll get sim sick (I had a DK1 Rift back in 2013 and most of the stuff available back then used standard FPS locomotion, so all these new headsets with positional tracking are like nothing, doesn't bother me a bit). But teleporting and snap rotation (rotating in 15 to 30 degree increments) works as a replacement for people with sensitive stomachs, and that's pretty much how it's going to have to be until the generation /after/ the next generation of headsets. I know that, since before the first consumer VR headsets were released, they've been working on devices that shoot electricity into your inner ear and trigger the little hairs that control your sense of balance and acceleration, but I highly doubt that that tech is gonna be ready for general release within the next 5 years.

As far as the screen door effect is concerned, the Samsung Odyssey has a resolution of 1400 by 1600 per eye, compared to the Rift and the Vive at 1080 by 1200. While this doesn't entirely mitigate the screen door effect, it /is/ a /significant/ bump in resolution and it's enough of a bump to make the SDE practically imperceptible in most use cases. It's a crisp display. PPI isn't a perfectly reliable metric here because blah, it's more about pixels per degree and there's pixel fill and and subpixel arrangement and just blah blah /blah/, but it's good for a rough estimate of SDE. The Rift and the Vive have a density of 441 and 447 pixels per inch respectively and the Odyssey has a density of 615 ppi. That might not be true because another source put the Rift at 460 ppi, but the takeaway here is that it's ~450 against >600.

Basically what I'm saying is that the resolution is good enough to use the headset for watching 2D content on a virtual screen, which /vastly/ increases the quantity of quality content. Also, HMDs using the PSVR-style "halo" are significantly more comfortable than HMDs like the Rift and Vive and GearVR that pull the headset onto your forehead and cheekbones like heavy ski goggles, so spending multiple hours wearing the headset watching video content is actually a realistic proposition. Having your own personal movie theater where you can watch Netflix and YouTube and play video games is pretty effing cool.

  A new display from Samsung targeting use in VR headsets packs a whopping 2,024 x 2,200 pixels into a 3.5″ form-factor, delivering an impressive 858 PPI, nearly twice the 460 PPI of the Rift and the Vive.

EDIT: The DK2 you tried had a resolution of 960×1080. The lenses were also cheap and generic; most current headsets use Fresnel lenses. You should find the nearest Microsoft store and do a demo of a /real/ VR headset (if no Microsoft stores nearby, some Best Buy locations still do demos of the Rift, you can find a demo location here:

**** Yeah, I have to second this. I tried the oculus rift DK2 a while back and it was "cool" but definitely still at the "toy" stage of things, rather than anything seriously worth using. The resolution is the biggest drawback right now-- these displays are a fair sight worse than 1080p per eye, even though they have great refresh rates. I'm thinking it'll take at least another generation before the screen resolution is up to par (at least 2000x2000 per eye, and probably a fair bit more), and probably a generation after that to get the form factor and control surfaces down pat. So looking at the relatively slow pace of development so far, VR isn't going to be very useful for consumers until the mid to late 2020's.

[[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimax8kvr/pimax-the-worlds-first-8k-vr-headset][I WAS WRONG]]. It's 2 4K displays rather than a true 8K display, but this is still ridiculously amazing. I'm a little hesitant because it's being made by a small chinese startup on kickstarter, but then again, oculus got big the same way. The display is also a bit clunky in the sense that the regular version only supports upscaling regular 5k output converted into 8K output, and the 2x 4K version will be significantly more expensive, but it's still an incredible leap forwards.

***** How do you know the resolution isn't high enough /right now/ if all you've ever tried is a DK2 Rift? How do you know the Pimax headset is any clearer than any other headset if you've never tried any other headset? You know the big draw of that headset isn't its resolution, it's the field of view, right? The DK2 you tried had a field of view of 95ish degrees, the Rift and the Vive and the Odyssey have a FOV of 110 degrees, and the Pimax headset is at 200 degrees. They've got more pixels, but they're spread over a larger surface area.

Seriously, go on Google and find the nearest Microsoft store and demo a more modern headset. All of the Windows headsets have a resolution of 1400x1400 per eye (except the Samsung Odyssey with 1400x1600 per eye). How can you know that the resolution needs to be "at least 2000x2000 per eye" if the only headset you've tried had a resolution of 960x1080 per eye?

I, personally, have in the past owned a DK1 Rift and a CV1 GearVR, and I currently own the Samsung HMD Odyssey. I've done close to a dozen demos of the PSVR (I was trying /really/ hard to convince myself to buy one, but the PS Move controllers are just... I mean, if the tracking on them wasn't terrible then I'd've forced myself to build a bridge and get over how anti-ergonomic they are, but the tracking on them is terrible; Sony should've designed new controllers instead of recycling old PS3 tech, but I digress), and I've demoed the Oculus Rift and HP's WMR headset. I didn't immediately run out and buy the Rift because I was waiting for the PSVR, and by the time I decided the PSVR wasn't up to snuff I'd been waiting most of a year and I'd been following the development of things like Intel's Project Alloy and Google's Project Tango and announcements were being made about the Windows Holographic platform and I figured I ought to wait another year, and I'm satisfied with that decision because I ended up getting a bitchingly awesome headset. [*Edit from more than a year later:* It wasn't as "bitchingly awesome" as I initially thought, and I sold it.]

The point of all that is, if /I/ were to make the "I'm thinking it'll take at least another generation before the screen resolution is up to par" argument, I wouldn't support that argument by saying "I owned the DK1 Rift a while back," y'know? If I'm mistaken about your experience with VR headsets then I apologize, but "I tried the oculus rift DK2 a while back" is pretty hard to interpret as anything other than "the only headset I've ever tried is a DK2 Rift." To be perfectly blunt, you really aren't qualified to judge the quality of the second generation of products when your only experience is with a prototype from before the first generation of products was released.

Because I've read articles and reviews that unambiguously state that the screen door effect still exists. It's probably not as bad, but so long as it's there, I simply can't justify spending several hundred on what basically amounts to a toy. I currently have a 1080p monitor and a 1440p monitor; going to what's effectively a single 1400x1400 monitor would be a huge step down in quality. The tech specs are pretty unambigious-- whether for gaming or serious productive work, the current VR headsets on the market simply aren't worth buying, at least for my use case.

Again, I can definitely see the appeal of VR in general (which is why I'm so excited about this double-4k headset), but I don't feel like wasting my money for the sake of being an early adopter.

Now you're just being ridiculous. Tech specs /do/ matter. I'd never used a 1440p monitor before I bought this one, but from my experience with lower resolution monitors, and, you know, basic math, I could tell it would be a significant improvement. And hey-- it was! Similarly, I can extrapolate my experiences with the DK2 to apply them to higher resolution monitor. Sure, I'm not /as/ qualified as someone who used VR headsets regularly, but your implication that my opinion doesn't matter just because I haven't used the exact headsets as you is baseless.

Even with your example, having been on a drop tower ride doesn't replicate skydiving exactly, but it doesn't need to-- having that experience of "falling" from a height still gives applicable experience.

#+begin_quote

Huh, so it looks like my initial impression was more right that I thought-- not only is VR not worth using now, it'll be even longer than expected to get to the point where it's worth using. Though really, the article was mostly a rehash of stuff I'd already seen-- the only new information was about the lenses not being properly optimized and about the pixel fill.

Regardless, It's my cash, and I'm pretty confident in the judgement that it's not worth spending until VR has, minimum, 2K displays for each eye (and preferably, 4K displays). And that's before taking into account the fact that the VR content pool is so incredibly shallow right now, and that GPUs still need some improvement before they're even capable of running VR at the resolutions and refresh rates it would take before I found VR truly immersive.

Actually, I would say that. Or rather, I would say that the bump from 720p to 1080p isn't high enough to justify upgrading, and that instead it would be a better idea to wait until a 1440p tv fits in the budget. I could have upgraded my 1400x900 monitor to 1080p more than a year ago, but I decided to wait until 1440p monitors started dropping under $200 instead. Incremental improvements are just wastes of money-- it's best to use something until it's obsolete, then buy something that's future proofed.

And I came up with a better analogy.

It's like not having any sort of phone at all, and refusing to buy the iPhone 5 because you know the iPhone 5s is coming out soon. When the iPhone 5s comes out, you'll refuse to get it because you know the iPhone 6 is coming out. At some point you have to just pick a point in the product cycle to jump in and accept the fact that something better is going to come out soon. Better headsets will come out in 2018 and I'll be stuck with my inferior headset, but then another batch of even better headsets will come out in 2019 and those people who bought in 2018 will be stuck with an inferior headset, then more headsets will come out in 2020 and I'll replace my current headset. That's just how it works.

** Weekly update on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIWf3Nqudgh18j4RK8bm4zOTSKUFl6l9Igvdg1adzGE/edit][The Tesseract Engine]], my ongoing game engine project.

--------------

I'm running out of clever ways to say "I haven't done anything, but I've planned to do things really hard. You know, in the future." If this continues, I might have to /actually do some work/ so I can actually have something to write here.

The most concrete work I have done recently is write Trello cards; two weeks ago, I said "I should probably make a plan before next week"; well, I skipped a week (more on that in a sec), but at least I am officially done with the planning phase!

I've also contacted a friend to ask him for help staying motivated and focused; my plan is to work on the project at least every Saturday for the next while; the arrangement would be "we have a visioconference every saturday morning where I explain to him what I intend to do that day/week, and a debriefing every saturday evening where I talked about what I've actually managed to do". So kind of like what I'm doing here, with the same pre-commitment flavor to it, but more focused and more personal.

--------------

My long term worry now is whether I can stay focused on the project long enough to actually achieve something.

The thing about developing a video game is, it's hard. Like, */really/* hard. If you, average person reading this sentence, were to try making a video game, even if you gave it an honest try, made an actual effort with the actual intention of making something good, you would probably produce something shitty and worthless (and I say that with a few years of experience seeing enthusiastic students produce shitty games, and not doing any better myself).

Same thing for making a game engine. It's a lot of work, and it's extremely complex. Now, the thing with coding complex systems is, it requires a sustained effort. You need to get into "the flow", where you can visualize enough parts of the problems and how they interact to build something that meaningfully addresses these problems; if you don't visualize them, you build flaws in your design that catch up with you sooner or later. You need to stay in that flow, not for hours, but for days or weeks or months.

Once your immersion is broken, all the mental architecture you've built is lost. You forget critical details that you didn't bother to write down, the notes you did write no longer make sense to you because they're based on assumptions you don't remember making, etc. You're not back to nothing, per se; you've still written some code; but you now have to do the same mental work of understanding the problem that produced the code in the first place (which is why people say that understanding someone else's code can be as hard as writing your own).

Now, if you're working in a company on the same problem every day, that's okay. It can be a pain in the ass to be asked to debug something you produced 6 months ago, but otherwise, you're unlikely to be interrupted before the project is over.

I'm a college student working living abroad and working on this project in my free time (which I'm lucky enough to have a lot of). I'll soon have semester exams; sometimes I get depressed like last week, and can't bring myself to work on anything (I'm asking a friend for help to hopefully work through those periods); I've let schoolwork pile up, and I'll need to address it at some point.

I'm not building up to a specific problem that I'm expecting. With some luck, it'll all be okay, and I'll just develop my project at a slow rate until I reach my two-months vacation in January, where I'll pick up the pace. But with that in mind... a lot of key parts of this project exist only in my brain so far, and that feels increasingly like a house of cards that could collapse at any moment.

I guess that just means I need to work sooner and faster.

For you I ( although it's not like I have a solution to that problem , otherwise I would have finished games, but extra credits has an episode on this which you probably should watch and says basically the same plus other advice) recommend trying to read the code at least for a moment every week, even if you don't have time to do anything else, just to avoid forgetting the parts that lived in your head and how it works(of course if you are depressed you won't necessarily be able to do that).
