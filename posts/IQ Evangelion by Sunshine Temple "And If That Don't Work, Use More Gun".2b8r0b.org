** Level I Intelligent Characters---not so much on the cunning plots, just people reacting in moderately-sane ways to Evangelion's premises. I am currently 93% of the way through. Probable deadfic.

The author /has/ picked up other fics after a years-long gap though - one which I found after it 'died' in 2008 recently got a 60K word update!

****** Honestly, I saw it fairly early on (in my viewing of anime) as well, and I think it was a mistake. Eva works way better if you have some understanding of the common tropes of more standard mecha anime of the period before watching it, in the same way PMMM works way better if you have some understanding of the Magical Girl genre. I rewatched Eva later after having seen some other mecha series of the era, and it was better for it - there's a lot in Eva that seems to be deliberate reactions to certain standard genre-defining tropes.

Also, the question about seeing Eva to EY... In HPMOR he had Quirrell use an AT Field at one point (Ch. 74).

******** If you've watched Evangelion by now, have you seen /Gunbuster/? And then proceeded on to the series that reconstructed mecha (and the SINGLE BEST ANIME OF ALL TIME), /Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann/?

*** @EliezerYudkowsky Do you have any speculation how you think Instrumentality would turn out in light of the girl at the beginning?

** Presumably a deadfic as last update was in 2012. Which is sad. The presence of the ghost Rei at the beginning means third impact still happens, and it'd be interesting to see how the wheels fell of the bus, as well as which Aynami was the vessel and which one was the controller.
