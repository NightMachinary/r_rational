** I stopped watching RWBY after the first couple of episodes because the story and worldbuilding were pretty Eragon-tier generic stuff. Does this change any of that?

*** I have rebuilt some bits of the world--I spent a while looking at how cultures (e.G. prison systems and such) would respond to Grimm. Also, the mythology is now one unified thing, and the Grimm have been updated to have some level of rules and motivation

*** It looks like this fic only changed some details with characters, rather than the plot or worldbuilding. I'm fine with that since I quite like the show as it is. Volume 2 is where the setting and story started to get interesting and more complicated, but the show ultimately is and always will be about cute girls in colorful outfits fighting monsters with crazy weapons and hanging out with friends from school.

I think it executes that premise well, certainly better than similar shows I've watched, but if you're not interested in that from the beginning the series will never satisfy you. The show is good for what it is thanks to nice animation (even if Volume 1 cut corners), likable characters, over the top action, and continuously improving writing. It's not a masterpiece, but it goes the extra mile when it could've been much more generic.
