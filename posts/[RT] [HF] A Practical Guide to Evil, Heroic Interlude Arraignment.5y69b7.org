** I love the banter between the new heroes. Such as

**** It's the characters you create and the way they grow and change through their interactions with each other which really makes this story so enjoyable for me.

Thank you.

*** If you're guilty, so am I. There's several web serials I follow through this sub but only three that I'll get involved in commenting on.

**** Just curious, which ones are you following/commenting on? I've been tearing through a bunch of on-going web serials recently but they seem a bit outside the scope of straight rational fiction. I keep wanting to recommend them here, but then I sit back and think "Well, they're good fiction, not necessarily good /rational/ fiction..."

***** Reading and commenting: * Mother of Learning * Sideways in Hyperspace * A Practical Guide to Evil Reading: * Erfworld * Unsong I tend to think that most of these have small or large elements that don't necessarily fit the sidebar definition of rational fiction.

You could always post others here and see if anyone else likes them.
