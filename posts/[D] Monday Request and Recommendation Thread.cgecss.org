Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

*** I forget the title, but there was a story where the "homunculus" theory of sperm was correct, where sperm contained a "little man" that grew to size in the nurturing fluids of the womb. Part of the mad science of this story was growing the "little man" outside of the womb, to giant size. Another detail had to deal with impressing things with stamps spelling Hebrew words that described the purpose of the item, creating golems. This was against a background of an apparent maximum number of generations for the human race which was due in a few generations, and a project to use Kabbalist science to prolong the human species by replacing biological humans with a race of kabbalistically-reproducing golems that were still human.

** I am a sucker for stories where the main character is a tank, or at least fills the roles of a tank. This usually means that the main character can take lots of damage without going down. Sometimes this is expanded to extreme regeneration, lack of need of sleep or food, immovable object body, etc. Some examples of this would be The New World on Royalroad, A Bad Name (Worm fanfic), Greg Veder vs the World (Kind of I guess? he can shrug off bullets). I just want the main character surpassing the natural limits of their body. Any recommendations on this topic?

Edit: As for recommendations, I recently read Empire of Silence by Christopher Ruocchio. It's a science fiction written from first person about humanity in the 1602th century. It gives off a very Name of the Wind vibe, in that the main character is recapping his life as an old person who is a veritable legend, and there's a very 'coming of age' feeling throughout the story. You get to see Hadrian's (mc) development as he goes through hardships of both the financial and personal kind. I see people comparing it to Dune as well, since you have a space empire which works like a mix between medieval feudalism and Chinese monarchy. There's a church that bans technology. There's the future analogues of democratic nations, pirates, arabs, the people who turned into cyborgs, etc. It can be very theme-park-y as a science fiction, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I thought the main character's voice and characterization was done well, plus there's the whole mystery into his development from this naive optimistic boy into someone who has billions of deaths in his conscience. 8.5/10

The writing is quite amateurish and pretty bad at times, but it does the whole game progression schtick really really well.

** So, I've started reading the Brent Weeks Lightbringer series off a recommendation given out a while ago. After finishing book 1 I was reminded of one of my favorite childhood series, The Seventh Tower by Garth Nix. I could only find a partially done fan-made audiobook on youtube.

This made me think, are there any good fanfictions of either series out there? Either with their powers or set in their world?

I havent gotten far in book 2 of Lightbringer but Ive reread Seventh Tower dozens of times. I feel like it has a big enough world to explore making some high quality fiction in, especially with how inventive you can get with lightweaving and spirit binding.

So if anyone has fanfiction of either I'd be very greatful.

I'll also be doing a narrative of the Seventh Tower as a warm up for doing Pokemon: The Origin of Species.

If you want fanfiction and there is no fandom to generate it, the obvious solution is to orchestrate this fandom's creation.

Find other talented people who enjoyed /Lightbringer/ and would like to see fanfictions of it (and/or find talented people who would enjoy /Lightbringer/, make them read it, then stoke the flames of their desire). Get them on-board. Write a few high-quality fanfictions, publish them strategically to increase public interest. Simultaneously, raise the book series' popularity on social media via novel memes centred around it. Infer the properties which make ideas viral, and exploit them. Become good at social engineering, or recruit those who are already good at it. Create a bunch of sockpuppets, use them to softly or bluntly pressure people into writing more. Is there a good wikia about the series? Write it to make it easier for your newly-created fan+atic+s to check the facts --- having a good reference base would lower the barrier to entry immensely.

Study other fandoms' creation. I heard an obscure Edgar Poe's work went viral a few months back --- what caused it? It seems /Worm/'s fandom grew so big partly because the story had a good mechanic for introducing new characters/powers --- does /Lightbringer/ have something like this, and if no, can you /invent/ it via creative interpretation?

It's fine if most of the first works in your baby fandom will be unreadable tone-deaf garbage --- as long as they /exist/, the hard part is over. Steering your creation's development will be easier.

If at all possible, get the author on-board too --- there's no-one who would be more invested in what you're doing. Except for you, of course.

It won't be easy. The task may even seem impossible, insurmountable, insane, ridiculous. But /is/ it? You've never tried, and as far as I know, no-one else has ever attempted something like this before.

Never shy from playing god. Even if you fail, at least it'll be fun.

However, the princess in this story is very independent and has decided to rescue herself and therefore gain the right to her own hand and be able to decide her own destiny in life.

Her attempts at escape reads very much like a character who is attempting a dungeon crawl and while I wouldn't call it a rational story, there's a fair bit of munchkinry and puzzle solving.

*** Yet another Worm CYOA fic where the author has the character firmly grasp the idiot ball because otherwise there wouldn't be any conflict. It's not worse at it than the others like it, but I really don't understand why they don't just give the protagonist a weaker power or less information to start. He had to give her incredibly OP power, and excellent metaknowledge, and literally supernatural strategic ability. It's not impossible to write around that, but it mainly require giving the enemies an edge (eg simurgh is really good at recognizing blindspots and obliterating them), which tends to put the story into a super escalation loop. I'm not even sure whether I like that he has a chapter attempting to justify the idiot ball (which I obviously felt failed). On the one hand he recognizes the issue and is making an effort to ameliorate it, on the other hand it seems a bit meta, and the story might be better not dwelling on it for that long.

The plot only happens because of the idiot ball.

I kinda think it should have been explored more (it kinda is when she gets Math 3), but I get the feeling that if she put more than 3 charges into anything she'd have a depth of information that she just /can't use/, due to it being more than her purely human mind can work with.

Sure, with a bunch of points in programming / social engineering / etc she'd be a world-class expert in those fields, but still just at the top end of human ability - which means that any actual Thinkers could wipe the floor with her.

****** Taylor's main problem in the fic is that she basically /doesn't Tinker/ in the first arc. The thing you quoted comes right after some introspection in which she realizes that, due to a mental block, she's been restricting herself to her power's secondary abilities.

Like seriously forget computers, Taylor should be able to sit down and Tinker with her own metabolic pathways until she can burp out a nanofabricator swarm. She doesn't because she's afraid of all the power she's been given.

*** It starts promisingly, but quality drops off a cliff after the 2nd arc.

Throughout, the author has real problems with "show, don't tell" when it comes to what characters are thinking; entire chapters are spent inside Taylor's head and entire interludes are meant to explain character actions (and sometimes seem to be a direct response to the fic's readership). It gets particularly bad after the 2nd arc, where chapters alternate between characters jerking off about Taylor in reaction-interludes for a thousand words and dense, pointless techno-babble of Taylor musing on her future plans, sometimes without any actual dialogue.

Lastly, the fic grossly - in every sense - misses the mark on several characters, such as Coil, Armsmaster, and Cauldron. It turns them into pretty brutal caricatures. At one point several paragraphs are spent in a Coil interlude in his own head with him ranting about his own greatness.

** I recommended it in the Open Thread but I'll also recommend it here.

I watched the dub of episode 1 of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Stone][Dr. Stone anime]]. It was really good. I don't know if it will keep up, but the first episode had lots of rationalist adjacent competence!porn, with slowly working through real world science to build tech from the ground up. For example, they made Nital and walked through the process of making and distilling alcohol.

*** I'm going to have to counter that recommendation.

I dont know if you were here but when the manga first came out we were updating the sub with every chapter release. While it starts out quite rational, for such an irrational premise, it soon turns (around chapter 40 or so) into a fantasy version of science. Then they have this big reveal which completely ruins any SoD you could have about the setting and destroys whatever vestiges of rationality it had remaining.

It is an entertaining story, but it becomes absurdly anti-rational. I would recommend it if people like the genre of isekai but not if youre looking for a rationalist anime.

**** I didn't get very far in the manga for much these reasons. From the start it was Hollywood rationality and that grates at me. I have more tolerance for BS in anime, though, so I'll stick with it for a while... just not with any expectation of it being actually smart.

***** Yeah. I have it on my to watch list. The characters are somewhat entertaining but the contrivances are ridiculous.

I stopped around chapter 90 or so, when they started making some more modern technology, just because their methods were not physically possible. The characters had some decent growth and there are some scenes I want to see animated.

Idk how they managaed to geographically get that right since they had no gps or anything. Also, the science they were doing was not possible with the tools they had.

**** I'm going to have to counter your counter.

Dr. Stone itself may not be too rational - as others have pointed out it's patently absurd - however it along with several other recent Shounen (e.g. The Promised Neverland) are reactions to previous popular manga (e.g. Dragon Ball), where the main characters attempt to solve their problems via intelligence/rational decision making, as opposed to the greater application of a fist to a face.

Under this view I don't see Dr. Stone as being rational, but it is a very large step in the right direction when compared to many of it's peers.

Also aside from the question of rationality Dr. Stone is very enjoyable, definitely recommend people give it a go if they're into Shounen.

***** But rationality isn't about wits over brawn, it's about doing things that work. Fullmetal Alchemist and Fate/Zero are miles more rational than Dr. Stone, and much preceded it, so it's hard to see Dr. Stone as an advancement of anything.

** I've been listening to quite a bit of litRPG recently as I drive.

Three reasonably-well written series follow.

1. Ascend Online series by Luke Chmilenko. Decent. Author has issues with repeating adjectives and adverbs too often in short scenes. The author also heavily over-uses the word 'countless.' By the end of the third book, I was groaning out loud every time the word 'countless' was used. Nothing Grammarly couldn't fix.

2. Way of the Shaman series by Vasily Mahanenko. Also decent. I have read three of the books so far. This fellow doesn't have a problem with repetitiveness of adjectives and adverbs. However he does have one rather irritating quirk. He strongly overused the phrases "The girl" and "The girl's." Again, Grammarly, please.

3. The Good Guys series by Eric Ugland. Better than decent writing. No word-overuse issues. The Protagonist has moments of brilliance and times when he clearly was holding onto an idiot ball with both hands and his teeth. However, the author does a good job of making the protagonist suffer for most obvious bad mistakes, and I have to say that if you gave me a bag of holding, there's a strong chance that I would do a lot of what the protagonist did.

As a rebuttal I'll refer to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/litrpg/comments/c9v9po/review_home_seige_home_good_guys_book_6/et55vwl/?context=3][this comment chain]], where I note the author's gross overuse of dialogue interruptions. He starts at 78 in book one and gets up to 202 in book 4! Disgusting.

**** I have noticed the dialogue interruptions while reading. I simply considered it to be the author's style. The author's response to that thread seems to support my take.

Honestly, having the protagonist manage a dissertation-level conversation in the middle of combat is less rational. When something distracting happens, most people don't just keep talking like nothing happened.

***** I understand that most people don't really notice these things, and that's fine. But after it's brought to your attention you still honestly think it's realistic for peasants to incessantly interrupt a member of the /high-nobility/ whom they just met, as in my reply? And that was not an isolated example. Everyone interrupts the protagonist at all times, whether in battle or in a normal, relaxed conversation. Despite the guy looking like a bad-ass, dangerous warrior with a high, high ranking.

I probably haven't been interrupted 100 times in the past 5 years and this book that takes place during less than a week has 200 interruptions! I just can't reconcile that with realism, sorry, or anything but trash-tier dialogue writing.

****** The protagonist rarely uses his rank to control a conversation. He is also a poor leader, and he knows it. He is also very rarely in a formal setting which might help him remember his role.

The author was very clear and strict about the protagonist's adoptive father's very strong dislike for being interrupted, and I do not believe that person was interrupted without clear indication of irritation or anger. I am confident that if the author wrote that character's unwillingness to be interrupted so clearly, they are more than capable of writing the same trait into others, if he chose to do so.

That said, the protagonist, once he becomes a noble, definitely allows people to walk all over him in conversation. I will even say that it likely happens too much, but I still do not have a problem with it. It seems clear to me that the author intended exactly that.
