Just... not in the way you were probably thinking.

[Wherein I cover background, the story's premise, and the first problem I'm still trying to tackle]

*Background*

It's not an apocalypse of vampires, it's an apocalypse /for/ vampires. Your average human doesn't know that anything strange is going on behind the scenes. If vampires die out entirely then their prey won't notice anything different except that the rate of unsolved abductions and murders has dipped a bit.

You see, there's a /contagion/ out there. Cordyceps or /toxoplasmosis gondii/ for vampires. It gets into humans, and all that it does it cause a bit of a cough. But when it gets into a vampire, well, that's when the fun begins. As it spreads and settles into the vampire it eventually causes a compulsion to seek out warmth and light, and the vampire dies pretty soon after that.

*Pitch*

Vampires aren't stupid, but they're also not, generally speaking, scholars. They also don't come equipped with an innate knowledge about the contagion. All that they know is that it's very bad for them and that it's not magic.

The story is about an apocalypse of vampires, but it's also about one vampire's crazy, long-term plan to stop it: Raising a human kid to do the job. Humans, after all, don't seem to die from the contagion. A human will be safe.

I'm planning for the story to be somewhat non-linear. It would cover our human protagonist from childhood on, and there would also be short chapters from the POV of other humans. Our protagonist, after all, has been raised by a predator that noms on humans, and this is hardly the only aspect of her childhood that makes her strange. Alternate-POV chapters will give readers the ability to see how other humans perceive her when she isn't trying to keep up a front (and, sometimes, even then).

I want to figure out the setting (i.e. the nitty-gritty of vampires and the contagion) before I do too much about the storyline, but anything at all that might get our protagonist closer to accomplishing her goal is going to at least be considered. There's some blue and orange morality here, so she might take sides and forge alliances which the reader would take issue with, because that group has just the right lack of ethics that she needs to accomplish the next step in her research. On the other hand, if she can manage to get in good with an upstanding company in a relevant field then she'll do that just as happily. Whatever can save her people.

(Which is an important point: She identifies less as a human than as a pre-vampire, and killing people needlessly might be wasting resources but in the end we're all cows, and she's a cow that's going to be a real person someday. If she changes her stance on this then it's going to be in the direction of thinking of /everyone/ as cows that are going to be real people someday, and making that happen.)

The big problem will be putting together some kind of identity for herself, if and when she goes through legitimate circles.

I intend for the story to be thoroughly rationalist. Her whole purpose in life is to figure out how the contagion works and how to stop it. This is going to require, as well, understanding how vampirism works. And I intend for her to be as good of a rationalist as I can make her.

*First Problem*

I can go over what I have for vampires so far if anyone is interested but I don't want to be too wall-of-text here. Suffice it to say that there is no magic. However, there are a lot of varied changes that vampirism works on a human body, which means that I've got two choices and neither of them are very satisfying right now:

- Vampirism arose naturally. This has the problem of not explaining why there's a retrovirus or parasite or what-have-you that affects so many different aspects of the body. Despite that issue, this is what I'm leaning toward for the time being.

- Vampirism was artificially designed by ancient astronauts or something of that nature. In this case, though, why would vampires have been made in the first place and why would they have been given vampires any of the vulnerabilities that they have?

*Vampires and Sunlight*

There are a number of ways that I could go with this, but probably what I'm going to do is say that vampires don't normally die in the sunlight. They don't like it, mind, but it isn't lethal. Not until the contagion gets into them. I haven't settled on what it does, but possible effects range from corroding the vampire's insides and bursting out like a puffball mushroom on steroids to secreting some sort of flammable substance (there are times when vampires have very low water content relative to humans, and the probably-a-fungus takes advantage of this).

*Feeding and hibernation:* [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3105gn/bst_rationalist_vampire_apocalypse/cpya5m2]]


** One question jumped out at me for meeting that. what exactly do you mean by magic? this just seems like the best channel you for the disease to have its effect. I'd stick to the usual mechanics (can't cross running water, kill by staking and beheading, can climb walls, turn into wolves and bats, become fundamentally different people after being turned, are addicted to blood and require it to live ect... ) so your audience already knows whats going on.

If you haven't done so yet, you should look at the vampire list (same idea as the overlord list) over on tvtropes

** You'll need to make the problem hard to solve, and you'll also need some way that the most rational way to solve the problem ISN'T to found a research firm secretly devoted to this purpose.

Research, especially on vaccines/medications/epidemiology, is not a short or easy affair. It is basically never a one-person affair. Really this type of problem would be best handled by body like the CDC, not an antisocial lone wolf type.

EDIT: Also, if vampires are immortal, they have the capacity to be better scholars than any human alive. Why would they not be? Be wary of pattern matching with your personal vision of and associations with vampires.

Sure, they wouldn't want to do the lab work personally because it would endanger them, but that's what grad students and hirelings are for. The heaviest lifting is intellectual.

*** First of all, thank you for the warning in re pattern-matching.

I actually do think that our protagonist is going to be trying to integrate with the non-vampire world as she does her work. If going to the CDC turns out to be the best option, then that's what she'll do. Her most important job is not necessarily to run the experiments herself but to be, you might say, the liaison between vampires and humans, so that the latter need never find out that the former are a thing.

The vampires who are aware of our protagonist's mission (and approve of it) don't want to force the CDC or someone else to just deal with the contagion, because in the process the CDC might figure out vampires, which could be very bad.

Even worse, it's likely that an actual knowledge of vampires and their physiology might be /necessary/ to get the job done, much as you'd have a hell of a time doing much with ebola if you had never heard of /H. sapiens/.

With that in mind, they need somebody on the inside, somebody who can observe what's going on as it happens and determine if the situation is reaching a point where the plug needs to be pulled (hopefully without killing everyone, but only because murder is messy).

That she's being trained in the sciences is /almost/ incidental, a filling of requirements so that she can be on the inside at all, and know what needs to be done and who can do it.

The first thing that comes to mind is that not all humans are inclined to be scholars, and it's likely that not all vampires are. I imagine that our protagonist will be conferring with at least a couple of vampires all the same, however.

**** I just meant that the daily operation of a research firm likely doesn't make for riveting reading, particularly among readers who came for vampires. If you make that your answer, you'd have to find some way to portray it realistically without spending a ton of time there or it seemingly like hand-waving (i.e. months of operation to even potentially culture the pathogen or be able to grow it. This kind of thing is complicated (I'm no expert, but I know the basics from a class) and takes a lot of time. And that's before even thinking about vaccines/cures. You're going to need to brush up on your pathology and biology if you want to do a good job at this.

Returning to the point, you could have setting up the research firm be quite interesting, what with recruitment and secret management, but after that any action that happens is secondary to the boring stuff that's actually resolving the problem (research). So you can have splinter vampire groups kidnap a star researcher, or the FBI start to take note, but without extreme variation like in Breaking Bad, it'll start to seem formulaic.

What's more, one research firm is good, but a bunch, with shell corporations and everything, set up across the world, is much better. And writing about the person managing that empire is probably similarly uninteresting. (And rationally, why WOULDN'T you be umbrella corp and have dozens of secret labs, security forces, self-destruct mechanisms, etc? Any vampire who's been around a century is rich off the stock market and the master of some craft or skill)

The vampire scholar thing is still an issue. I suppose it's POSSIBLE that none of them are interested in their own physiology, medicine, pathology, epidemiology, bioterrorism, or anything connected to both their own origins and biological sciences, but it seems exceedingly unlikely, unless your population of vampires is very small, perhaps 50-100.

Seriously, none of your vampires are curious about how they work or why they need to feed on humans? None of them have figured out even the gut flora thing? Or even that they don't need to eat an entire human, just their stomach and some random protein mass (speaking of, how do they deal with human stomach acid, feces, undesirable fluids if they drink everything in a slurry)?

It just seems ridiculous that your protagonist would be starting from scratch here, or even exist at all. It requires that instead of using their lifetimes of knowledge and vast wealth to hire researchers or do it their goddamned selves, the vampires went through the trouble of bringing up a single human (no fallbacks), meaning waiting 22+ YEARS, to address an /existential threat./

I think you have a very interesting idea for a story and compelling protagonist, written correctly, but the setup seems to require an extraordinary series of failures of rationality and common sense.

Yes. The plot may take a mind of its own and decide to include a great many other things, but I have no illusions about the mass appeal of this story. There's a series of stories by James P. Hogan that is basically a bunch of talking heads doing Science and coming up with ideas and ways to test those ideas and it is probably the most boring thing in the world to most people but... I really, really like them (even though, admittedly, the science is kind of awful in places).

And while there would probably be a certain amount of Traditionally Exciting Things happening, there would probably be a lot more of what many people would consider boring.

(On the other hand, "boring" is not the same as "has stupid characters in it," so there are still some points you bring up with are utterly unforgivable and must be dealt with. Even if I have to give up some other aspects of the story.)

Yes. And thank you for spending some time on it anyway. >:]

There were some things that I thought that I could leave up in the air temporarily until I figured out other parts of my setting, but it's apparent that I /really/ need to figure out all the details of vampirism first, including how it affects the mind (at present it seems that they prefer small social circles than humans, so that'll flavor how they would go about with their long-term plans), and also exactly how long ago the contagion hit, how quickly it spread, and what vampires have been doing in the meantime.

Thanks again.

I'm actually kind of confused by how people can refuse to take criticism that is clearly based in reality.

Like, it's a thing that happens, obviously, but it doesn't make /sense/. Run away and hide and just not respond to biting criticism? Sure, I get tempted to do that sometimes, if I had been an incredibly magnificent idiot.

But flat out denying valid criticism is just... weird. It feels weird just thinking about it, like saying that the sky is polka-dotted when you and I are both standing outside and we both know that none of us has any color-related vision problems and what "polka-dotted" means.

** This is a good hook but with the rationalist direction you want to go you are going to need some serious world-building on your vampires. The mechanism of vampires will be a major plot element, especially since your protagonist has been promised to be made into one, so they can't be Stross's parallel evolution without lying to the protagonist, or allready having transform viruses. If you can swallow the plobotonum you might want to look at Ludnum's necroscope series for a weak set of explanations (otherworldly parasite and fungus).

*** There's no reason you can't have magic in a rational story. In the words of Agatha Heterodyne, "Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science." If there vampires that, due to magical processes, have physical changes, that's fine. Just tell us what physical changes happened on a detailed level. I mean, you could go the whole "fungal" route. Maybe blood is an excellent incubator, in fact the /only/ known for the vampire-making fungus - but only when it's at room temperature. So, to make a vampire, you kill someone by depriving a vital organ of oxygen, make sure you didn't actually damage anything irreparably, put them in a freezer, cart them to an ancient ritualized facility with fungal cultures maintained, and bathe them in cold blood seeded with fungal cultures. The fungus reboots all the things that need rebooting, rewires the things that need rewiring, and adjusts the plumbing as necessary, then poof. Vampire.

Some sort of fungus is a possibility, especially since we're already probably using fungus for the contagion as well. I'd prefer to not incorporate the "otherworldly" part of that, however.

** This seems like a really cool idea if done right. There is a movie with a similar premise called Daylight I would recommend as research.

As the protagonist I would wonder if this vampire community really needed blood. I would try to identify what nutrients were needed, find an alternate/develop a synthetic, to prevent future infection. Anyone who has survived continues to survive and the race is saved [if decimated].

Do other animals get the virus? Can vamps survive off ones who cant? Vegan Vamps?

Also, if I could identify the compulsion, I would see if I could beat the behaviors. If it is seek warmth, I would make spaces heaters necessary.

*** Yay, elaboration time! (also, I'm not finding any vampire movies called /Daylight/. Are you talking about /Daybreakers/ or do I need more skills points in Google-Fu?)

To answer your questions first: I do not believe that other animals get vampirism. It would be interesting if it could jump the barrier to, say, other primates, but I'm not sure on that just yet. No doubt the protagonist will try it however, so thanks for bringing up that idea.

Vampires can feed off of animals, but must also feed off of humans. They're not sure why until our protagonist Does Science to the problem, but this problem will in fact be solved.

(And then our protagonist might decide to "gift" the rest of the world with vampirism, having eliminated the need for humans at all. It will likely be debatable whether this is good or not)

*Why do vampires need to feed on humans?*

Vampires need your gut flora, actually. They may be lacking in just certain varieties or they may be missing pretty much everything, but they can't complete digestion without stealing your gut flora to do part of the necessary work.

Which is kind of rude because, come on, you're basically being forced to digest yourself, and that's just adding insult to injury, isn't it?

Once our protagonist figures this out, she's definitely going to work on creating cultures of these gut flora or, failing that, setting up a system of donors until she can figure out how to do the first thing.

*How do vampires feed?*

Vampires do not drink your blood. Or rather, they don't just drink your blood, and when they get around to drinking it, your blood isn't really recognizable as such.

To start with, vampire saliva is heavy in opiorphin, which is an antidepressant and anesthetic six times more powerful than morphine. Human saliva also has this, vampirism just goes crazy with how much it has. And this is important, because ideally a vampire's prey will be emotionally deadened and numbed to pain when the feeding begins.

Vampire saliva also contains insane amounts of amylase, lysozyme, and other digestive enzymes. Fun fact: Snake venom is just a modified form of saliva, and what the simplest forms of snake venom do is just digest you from the inside.

Oh, and after it's bitten you, the vampire proceeds to regurgitate additional enzymes from its stomach.

Vampires don't drink your blood. They liquefy your innards and then drink you up. The process just causes keritanocytes to toughen up, though, which is helpful for the vampires because that's what your epidermis is made out of, turning you into a bit of a juice bag.

(Side effect of this: Vampires don't kiss each other, because swapping toxic spit is a bad idea unless you /want/ your partner to die. Since the epidermis isn't digested, however, it's possible that they lick each other for social grooming and other purposes, for its antidepressant properties)

I'm still working on the details but it's probable that the gut flora are allowed to do their work in the juice bag, prior to when the vampire drinks most of its meal, and that they are killed when the vampire finishes the process and the gut flora enter the body. Alternately, they die during the long hibernation periods that vampires go into. Among other possibilities.

I'm using the calorie counts from James Cole's "Prehistoric Cannibalism: An Act of Nutritional Necessity or a Result of Socio-Cultural Conditions" to figure out a person's a calorie count, and then being very conservative and underestimating how many calories a given person will have.

Vampires are also able to eat thin soups and drinks for a short time after feeding without suffering indigestion (or at least too badly-- I'm not set on which one it is yet) but they haven't seen this as a means of getting additional sustenance. Vampires eat soups for pleasure, not nutrition.

*Hibernation*

I'm also being conservative with how much energy vampires are able to save through hibernation (they go much deeper than bears, but I'm using bears anyway to once again play my numbers safe). A vampire that needed roughly 4,000 calories a night (again, playing numbers safe and overestimating them) would still only need to feed on a handful of people every year so long as it was only active for three months or so out of the year.

Vampires adjust their hibernation cycles automatically based on the seasons. Closer to the poles, where the nights get longer, sooner, vampires are awake for a greater part of the year. Closer to the equator, vampires are asleep for a greater part of the year. This also has an effect on their longevity (because the aging process is slowed down by hibernation) so that vampires who are awake for longer periods also have a shorter lifespan. It's a trade-off on par with bad vs good eating habits.

Right now, I'm figuring that the way it works out is that vampire's naturally start getting the desire to go to sleep when the night is coming to a close. Once the waking period gets short enough the urge to hibernate asserts itself. Not sure about how the wakefulness itself gets triggered yet.

**** No, you were right. It was Daybreakers, I was just derping. Though Being Human [US version] also has a contagion arc for vampires that you could exploit [it wasn't great, but tv].

If other animals can't get vampirism, are other animals affected by the contagion? They eat a rat carrier, does it affect them differently? What are the human disease vectors?

I lack science, but can gut flora be found in poop?

I really like the hibernation bits. It would work well with mythical god-creatures of the night along the equator [Think Aztecs].

Hm. I hadn't thought about that. It'd probably be something minor, like how /toxoplasmosis gondii/ doesn't affect humans (too) badly.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Humans get it from inhaling spores (assuming it's a fungus). Usually nothing happens, but in some people there are minor respiratory problems like coughing.

Vampires get it from feeding on humans, and then later on... It depends on how it kills vampires, but almost certainly the spores get out into the air. Right now I'm leaning toward the idea that the contagion has some kind of flammable secretion that it produces, but there are a number of ways that I might take it in the end.

Headcanon, however I go: Right now I think that the contagion started to spread a bit more than a century ago. Vampires naturally don't like bright lights but can still walk around in the daylight, hence the original folklore. Despite being recent history, however, /Nosferatu/'s depiction of vampires dying in sunlight is still accurate because that's when the contagion started up (whether it took awhile to become a pandemic or not). Presumably, F. W. Murnau heard somebody, somewhere, talking about one of the early cases and that's where he got his idea.

Vampires might not even need to actually burn up in the sunlight for this to be true. It might be that the tale was changed in the telling, or that Murnau just liked his idea better.

#+begin_quote

I believe so.

On the other hand, until our protagonist does her research, vampires don't know /why/ they have to eat people. All that they know is that if they don't eat people, they get sick from eating other things.

There may be some really crazy vampires that eat poop just for the hell of it, but I don't think anyone's going to be listening to them (nor, for that matter, am I sure that they'd have the presence of mind to notice a connection to begin with, and that's even if it's possible to eat enough fecal matter to get the necessary amount of gut flora).

#+end_quote

I'm not sure yet. I need to figure out how easy it is for them to navigate society.

What I'm thinking right now is:

(1) A significant number of vampires are actually not very "with it." Vampires are pretty good about reacting to short-term events, strategizing to make sure that nobody finds their hibernation hideaways, and things like that, but their ability to hibernate has also given them a habit of just retreating into leaving, hibernating for a longer-than-normal period, or both, whenever /really/ big problems arise.

It is also possible that there is a cultural stigma against too much long-term planning, because in the past it was really easy

(2) That said, there are vampires who break that mold. They most typically organize into small groups in some fashion in order to pool their respective resources.

(3) The most successful of these communities at present are those which took advantage of the internet and are now situated around the world. Vampires in the northern hemisphere are awake when vampires in the southern hemisphere are asleep, and vice versa, so communities that are spread across the world have fewer periods where nobody was awake and horrible things could happen.

Our protagonist is going to be in contact with at least a few

--------------

It may be possible that one or more vampire groups have already been trying to conduct research on the contagion. Their problem is that yeah, the contagion is bad, but revealing too much to the wrong person might make a much bigger problem.

After millennia of skulking around in the darkness, vampires have a good idea about how conspiracies only need one leak to fall apart.

Our protagonist, of course, is the solution: somebody who has been, to be honest, effectively /brainwashed/ into seeing the world with a vampire's eye. She can be trusted. She is their representative, the one who is going to do the work that they can't do, and operate in the public eye.

(Another problem that vampires have is that they also /look/ inhuman. /Nosferatu/ at least gives the general idea, if it isn't spot on. This is one of the things that makes it hard for them to navigate human society)

Your average vampire knows about as much as your average non-vampire would, given the same lifespan, date of birth, &c. Which is to say, your average vampire may know about heredity, and some things about genes, and so on, but there comes a point where being an armchair scientist doesn't help any in curing The Plague.

*** Space heaters are definitely a great idea. They will have to be used.

An additional complication is that the contagion causes insomnia and makes hibernation difficult. This is why vampires who know they've got the contagion will still eventually get killed by it. After a point, they just aren't thinking right.

If our protagonist is present, however, then she could restrain said vampire and make arrangements for its feeding. The vampire would be safe from death, but would take an even longer trip on the Crazy Train as a consequence.

The trade-off is worth it, but will also be very sad to the degree that our protagonist has empathy for the vampire.

** Read /Peeps/, by Scot Westerfeld. It's in many ways a similar nonmagical and fairly hard bio-sf take on vampires.

Re origin of the infection: never reveal it. Without an incredibly satisfying explanation, it's better to leave the non plot relevant details alone - at least when there's no plausible way for anyone to know.

*** Thanks.

I was worried that not revealing how vampirism got started might be seen as cheating, but as you say, there probably isn't a way for anyone to find out for sure.

I'll have to at least have a number of theories that get batted around from time to time.
