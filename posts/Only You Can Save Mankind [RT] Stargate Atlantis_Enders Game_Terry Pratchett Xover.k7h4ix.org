I don't think this has been recommended here before, it's one of my favorite fics by one of my favorite authors. She also has an account with more current stuff up on AO3 too.

  The leaders of Earth looked at each other and knew that now, if any, was the time to co-operate while there was still time,

It's sad that this breaks my suspension of disbelief nowadays.

  The leaders of Earth looked at each other and knew, deep in their soul, that a number of conspirators among the other leaders were somehow faking this to screw over them and their donors,

I fixed it.

**** The leaders of Earth looked at each other and knew that they would be perfectly fine coorpoerating as long as the brunt of the world were placed on their enemies. They formed the anti-wraith agreement. 5 years after the US withdrew from the agreement.

*** Funnily enough, this line is where I decided to give this a pass, owing to the extreme disregard for verisimilitude, covid-times or no.

** Only You Can Save Mankind was the first Terry Pratchett book I ever read. My god, I haven't seen it mentioned in 20 years. The nostalgia, man. I haven't read Ender's Game, but I might have to give it a go just so I can check this out.

*** Enders game is totally cool but also something to bring your critical gaze to, but I would strongly recommend this authors other Terry Pratchett fanfics. She's got a couple of straight good omen and discworld fics that really capture Terry Pratchetts voice, and a really good harry potter DEATH crossover.

The other stuff doesn't really have a rational bent, but I am a big fan.

** That was a delightful little read. It didn't actually seem much like a crossover; it would be really, really easy to divest from the "source material" entirely and just publish as a YA novel.

*** I didn't feel much crossover either. Mostly felt like "Young SGA" to me. I don't think it could divest from the source material though. Most of the plot was just episodes of Atlantis strung together.

**** I guess I shouldn't say it would be easy to divest when I haven't watched the supposed source material. It would have been more accurate to say that it didn't seem like a fanfiction in the sense that absolutely nothing required prior knowledge of source material to make sense. Except maybe the replicator/robots thing, which kind of came out of left field.

** I was initially worried. The viewpoint character seemed awful. Then, it revealed that it was /Rodney/ and everything fell into place. I was slightly disappointed that he didn't get too much screentime with Sam, as one of Rodney's funniest traits is that Sam is better than him at everything. But still, this was good stuff.

In defense of Woosley, he is a bureaucrat, and a damn good one. The i's will be dotted, the t's will be crossed, rules will be followed. Whatever you put him in charge of will be made predictable. Some idiot decided to have him investigate the Stargate program, which is just the entirely wrong organization for it. Everyone from the general to the janitor is flying by the seat of their pants. The countdown on the onsite nuke starts every other month, because an invisible and intangible critter made it through the gate and is mind-controlling all the doors to eat people. Then gets called of because someone from engineering stapled a battery from a lost civilization that no one understands to a can open from a /different/ lost civilization that no one understands, and that can match dimensional frequencies so that the P-90s can actually shoot it.

** It's very well written for the most part. Read only the first 2 chapters so far. Some of the things Sheppard says & thinks is not something a 7 year old would do, which breaks immersion.

** What part of this is Pratchett? I was kind of expecting something discworld, but... I'm mostly done.

*** Mostly just the title and maybe a bit of how the climax plays out, it's a shout-out to this story, it could be coincidental except the same author writes Terry Pratchett fan fics

**** Ok. For most of the time it felt too much like a rewrite of Ender's game with new characters and stargate as a prop. It did get better near the end, and I finished it.
