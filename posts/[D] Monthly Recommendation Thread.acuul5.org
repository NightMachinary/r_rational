** I read a few stories on RoyalRoad the past month that very much surprised me with how good they are compared to most of the stuff on the site.

*[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21374/epilogue][Epilogue]]* by [[/u/Etzoli][u/Etzoli]] is a relatively short (about the size of a regular novel) and complete story about our heroes returning to earth after being portal fantasied away. If you have ever seen the ending of Narnia, where the protagonists who are now adults stumble back through the wardrobe and become kids in the real world again, this is a story about what happens next. What happens when you lose all of your authority, power, and most of your knowledge becomes useless. How can you go back to just being a regular kid after living through so much. This story not only explores these ideas but also has interesting characters and I would highly recommend you guys check it out.

*[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]]* by GogglesBear is a newish superhero webserial that has an pretty interesting start. Without spoiling anything the story has a lot of munchkinry with our protagonist able to biologically change their body to adapt to the situation. Overall it is a decent start for a story and I'm interested to see where it goes.

***** Honestly, not really. That's why I dropped it after 6 chapters, at least. The characters don't talk to one another which was frustrating me - I think the author was trying to preserve the mystery of their backstory (or the actual story, in this case, since it's an epilogue) but it didn't work for me. I can see why one would enjoy the story. Though. It's certainly an interesting take on things! I'd still give it a shot to see if you like it.

****** I gave it a try. Kind of got turned off by Jen's language issue. No way anyone forgets words like "bread" or "Wednesday" in their mother tongue of sixteen years because of not speaking the language for less than half that time. The author must neither be bilingual nor have asked friends that are bilingual for their take on this.

Other than that I agree with you on the lack of communication thing. Not to mention on how veterans in leadership positions seem to be back at handling their problems like teenagers.

*** Super minion is a really good easy read, thanks for the recommendation!

I'd call it a darkish superhero action story but it also had some moments that made me genuinely laugh out loud(like the mc choosing a minion name). I wouldn't say it's explicitly rational or munchkin focused but it's a very interesting world and main character. The only problems I see with it is some typos from the fast writing/lack of correction and that there isn't nearly enough of it!

** I absolutely loved John Bierce's [[https://www.amazon.com/Into-Labyrinth-Mage-Errant-Book-ebook/dp/B07J675X2C][Into the Labyrinth]]. It's from the magic school genre and, like the best of Harry Potter novels, it somehow succeeds in evoking the feelings of mystery and limitless possibility that come from exploring a wondrous new world in the company of friends.

Two caveats. First, I'm not so sure it qualifies as rational. The protagonist is a lot more curious about the inner workings of magic as compared to, say, Harry Potter, and spends a lot of time trying to understand the constituent elements of spells, and how they may be put together in new ways; but his decisions are roughly what you'd expect from a boy his age. In particular, there's a scene where he convinces his friends, in equivalent HP mythology, to go out into the forbidden forest at night and see what's really there, which I expect would rub some people here the wrong way.

The second caveat is that the book takes a while to get started. The starting point is very cliche -- a seemingly talentless boy at magic school repeatedly picked on by his social betters -- and for the first 10% of the book, I felt impatient for the moment when, /of course/, the protagonist will happen upon the key to unlocking his talent.

I mean, it's a young boy. Of course they'd do something like that. I think to qualify a story as 'irrational' you need someone doing something stupid or nonsensical /for who they are/. Ridiculously incompetent adults, experts suddenly acting like morons, and all for the sake of plot convenience. An eleven year old boy doing something stupid and dangerous on a dare? Yup, that's human beings alright.

*** I'll add a dissent on this recommendation. Here's my review of it, copy pasted:

#+begin_quote
  I suspected I would hate this story when I read its very first sentence, where the author used the phrase "very, very good", but I decided to give it a shot anyway. "Look at all these positive reviews!" I thought. I should have listened to my first instinct.

  I feel like the thought process behind this book is very simple: the author likes Harry Potter, and he likes Mother of Learning, and he thought, why not write a book exactly like that. So you have an abused, bullied MC with a tragic past, like HP, only he's not a slacker but a nerd, and the magic he is learning in his prestigious school is of the "Hard Fantasy" kind, with strict, detailed rules on its application.

  Only unlike both of those stories there is nothing driving the plot, no tension, no conflict. He thought of a world, but not the people in it, and not why this story should be told instead of any other. So in this story, things just happens. The MC does not really have any agency, at all. He starts the book unable to do magic like other students, which is a promising direction to take the story in, but that is promptly solved by someone else, with no actual effort imparted (i.e., written about) by anyone. A teacher decides to help the MC (not because of anything the MC does, mind you) and he does just that: he tells the MC exactly what the problem is, and exactly how to solve it. And he also does it to the side characters, who are also magically challenged like the MC. He just points at them one by one, gives them a few paragraphs on why they're struggling, a few more on how he will help them, takes them to the library and tosses the relevant books at them. In the first quarter or so of the book. Throughout several pages. Poof, problem solved.

  Hmmm.

  After all their problems are solved for them, the MC and side characters unload all their backstories, their insecurities, and their motivations to each other within days of meeting each other, one after the other, in long paragraphs of dialogue. This pattern holds true for exposition about the worldbuilding, setting, or characters, where it is all explained by one character to another in the same style, in the same tone, like they're reciting a textbook perfectly from memory(or the authors worldbuilding notes, cough). Sometimes the author decides to just skip that step and simply has the MC read a textbook directly. How fun.

  *That is the author's entire approach to exposition: to jerk it off and spray the reader in the face with that tasty exposition, and to not stop jerking it even when the climax ends, refractory period be damned. Just a constant spray of masturbatory exposition in the face.*
#+end_quote

tl;dr: Overly-detailed worldbuilding wrapped up in nothing, not even a veneer of storytelling. Nothing is fought for, nothing is earned, nothing is a unexpected. Worst book I've read in a long time.

**** I'll dissent the dissent :P

I really liked how the book didn't go for the 'little kid fixes everything on their own because everyone else is incompetent' trope. Yeah, a lot of things happen to the MC rather than be done by him, but for me that's not necessarily a problem, especially when they're a kid. He also improved in that over the course of the book, being more willing to stick his neck out and take action once he grows to trust his teammates. Whose bonding didn't really strike me as badly written either; I'd say if anything the time it took Hugh to open up was a bit long! Kids are much faster at that than adults with close friends, from what I remember :P

YMMV, of course - if you only enjoy lead characters that completely dominate a setting (which is pretty common in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] recommendations), this won't be your kind of thing. And the writing does suffer at times.

** [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758901-all-systems-red][Murderbot Diaries]] was pretty good. The blurb for the first book:

#+begin_quote
  In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.

  But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn't a primary concern.

  On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid --- a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is.

  But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.

All in all it's a very readable 'action flick', with reasonable characters, even if the economics don't really make much sense if you think about it more closely.

** *[[https://missiontozyxx.space/][Mission to Zyxx]]* is a science fiction serial podcast that consistently makes me laugh with every episode.

If you enjoy Rick and Morty, I think you will like this a lot. It's an improv comedy show that follows a Star Trek-esque formula where a multi-species crew of misfits visits a different planet each week, and after the live improv session they take the recording and create a fully-produced podcast complete with music, sound effects, and voice processing (to make the alien characters have more alien-sounding voices, and to give the robot characters more robotic-sounding voices). The sound design is really something special. The characters are lovable, the jokes are funny, the production value is astounding, and it's probably my favorite produced podcast of all time. Toward the end of season 1 they start introducing more contiguous plot elements, and it jumps from being just a funny show to being a narrative where you really feel attached to the characters and find yourself rooting for their success. I love this show to death.

It's one of those things that really shouldn't work, (Wuxia / magic school / battle royale in a vote/quest format with events determined by skill checks and dice rolls), but the author is able to brilliantly weave everything together into something much greater than the sum of its parts.

*** protip: for ff.net, the best way to find quality fiction that's still being updated is to search

updated within six months (or less)\\
sort by follows (to get ongoinging stories instead of oneshots)

And then you can filter based on character and genre. "Adventure" is the best way to filter out fluff fics and angst fics, Romance gets you exactly what you think it'll get, the OC tag is useful if you're looking for SI fics, etc.

For AO3, the process is similar, except you'll want to use "kudos" as your quality filter. If you use the "search" bar and "edit search", you can put in, for example, ">20 kudos" to look for works above 20 kudos. The one big issue with AO3 is that you get the crazy huge omnibus fics that include dozens of fandoms and hundreds of tags, but you can mostly get rid of those with the "exclude crossovers" radio button. Aside from that, you'll want to be looking at the tags used by fics you like there, so you can click through other works using those tags.

Why would you want too though? I can see wanting to search multiple fandoms you're interested in at once, but the main problem I have with ff.net is that there's a whole bunch of crap I have to filter through. I don't see the point of adding a whole bunch of extraneous fandoms.

Unless you mean the search function specifically, of course, rather than the generic "search." In that case, I agree that their search function is terrible and poorly implemented, but luckily google searches are much better.

** I'm interested in some non fiction recommendations that readers on here have liked, no particular genre but I'd like it if it makes me look at things differently, or teaches me something.

*** "Predicably Irrational" by Dan Ariely. A book I think a lot of rationalist interested people would enjoy. It's about all the various ways in aggregate you can predict how people will behave in ways that aren't logical, and the reasons why they do so. One example that stood out is that value is comparative: people trend towards options that are easier to compare to each other as opposed to unique options. It's a bit dry for my tastes and I haven't finished it, but the take aways are very interesting.

"The 48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene. 48 basically life lessons that are supported by logic, parables, and very interesting historical examples. Good takeaways with enough variety to keep it interesting.
