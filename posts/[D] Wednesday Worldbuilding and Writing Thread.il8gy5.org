Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Help me out with some timeline stuff.

August or September of 2020, Earth is invaded by aliens. Think "portal opens, aliens pour out and start eating people" kind of thing. Military response happens but conventional weapons aren't super effective. (I'm going for an almost magical girl sort of setting so "shoot it with guns" isn't a viable solution, even though they do try.)

By 2034, the United States and several other major nations have fallen and begun to rebuild, some on a much smaller scale.

My question is, what needs to happen in those fourteen years? What kind of events need to happen, what kind of infrastructure needs to fail, to collapse a major modern empire in under a decade and a half? Assume nuclear war is still not a serious option, but opportunistic invasion by foreign countries along with the actual alien invasion is. (I'm actually thinking that an unstable President giving the order to nuke an American city after it falls to the aliens factors in, but I'm not sure how heavily it would.)

*** The thing that makes a state a state is its monopoly on the perceived-legitimate use of violence. Once that's broken, whatever new armed group is providing government services will become the new state; or multiple states if that's competing groups.

In your alien invasion scenario, I think the fastest way for the US to fall apart would be if it lost a significant chunk of ground, prompting an internal refugee crisis. Something like losing a chunk of the southwest, large scale displacement into California, a geographically-charged disagreement on whether to commit forces to resettling folks or to fighting the aliens, and failure to succeed at either. Then the de-facto government becomes whichever armed groups successfully relocate refugees and repel further alien invasions. After that you need a few years of those groups raising their own flags and doing the work of governing before it becomes official.

The US's empire would fall apart during this, since the various subordinate states would see the same loss of legitimacy and start their own resistance and revolution movements. The US's carrier groups are a bit of a wild-card, where they're very beholden to the existing government, which is making decisions they might not agree with, and the supply chain to keep them all operational would be failing. So if one went mercenary or rogue, that'd be a possible source of sudden extra power somewhere else in your story.

**** This actually makes a huge difference to me! Thank you. I hadn't thought of it from the "perceived-legitimate monopoly on violence" angle, which is... kind of wild when you consider that the introduction of an essentially unrestrictable source of the capacity for violence is a central part of the premise I'm working with...

***** Agree with all the above except I wouldn't put the epicenter I'm the southwest. That probably the most expendable part of the US, very little agriculture or industry, low population other than Texas. Hit something more substantial that displaces the government, forcing bigger adjustments.

********* I don't know that much about it myself, just that it's in the rust belt where there'd be a lot of heavy industry cities nearby, and if the invasion spread east from there it could encompass a lot of cities (columbus, cleaveland, pittsburgh) and eventually washington. philly and new york are just past that. that's a pretty big % of industry in the US while restricting it to less than 20% of the landmass. Assume it gets as far as New york, chicago, and St. Louis but stalls out at the rivers and you've gutted a lot of the US's manufacturing and Federal Government, plus all overland transport of goods, without having to wipe out the whole country.

********* I kind of like the idea that big enough rivers stop them. could draw some lines about how the invasion would tend to travel, and end up with some cities split in half where citizens managed to organize a defense and blow bridges. This leaves a lot of the country cut off from each other and isolated regions but some city states still viable.

********* [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumKtY1n7Mo][This video]] is a fairly good overview of Cincinnati as a city/urban area, but doesn't get into some of the smaller cultural stuff. A few other, minor things that might help:

1. Cincinnati is part what they call the Tri-State Area, which includes Kentucky and Indiana (plus, obviously, Ohio). Like a lot of mid-sized Midwest cities, a lot of people live in suburbs and then commute in for either work or entertainment.
2. Cincinnati was a major part of the Underground Railroad and the abolition of slavery, and there are a number of landmarks/historical connections to it.
3. Cincinnati chili is their most iconic dish, which is basically a more runny type of spiced chili served over spaghetti noodles with cheese and raw onion.
4. There's a long history of racial tension in the city, though like a lot of race stuff, it's complicated and has deep historical and demographic roots.
5. Cincinnati has bled off a lot of industry over the years, and like a lot of cities, has been trying to find replacements for it, doing a bit better than some of the others.

(I lived in Cincinnati until I was ten years old, and have been back a few times since then, so I apologize if any of this is out of date. A lot of what applies to Cincinnati also applies to mid-sized Midwestern cities.)

*** You need to answer a couple questions first, namely, who are the aliens, and what are their goals? Do they want to preserve our infrastructure, steal our resources, subjugate us, re-educate us, kill us, or what?

How a war is conducted depends a lot on the goals of that war. War tends to be fairly costly for whoever is waging it, so they'll usually want to make sure that it's "worth it", whether that's in terms of their economy or ideology. A war where aliens come in with the intent to round up and kill all the humans looks /very/ different where their goal is to command human industry and labor for their own desires.

If these aliens are mindless and/or monsters, then that's quite a bit different, and response should (in theory) look more like disaster response, with the fallout being a bit different.

As far as political stuff (and bearing in mind that discussion of U.S. politics has a general ban in this sub, largely to avoid the culture war), there are two primary scenarios. The first is that the mechanisms of governance break down so completely that there is a temporary or prolonged state of anarchy. That seems very unlikely to happen across the board, since I would expect the impacts to be very unevenly distributed, depending on what the specific scenario is. That said,

The second scenario is one in which something or the other causes a fracture in the United States, splitting off states from each other. I would suggest reading [[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states][the declaration of causes for the seceding states]] from the Civil War, which gives a look at grievances given by states prior to their withdrawal from the Union. For that to happen in the modern day, even in response to alien invasion, would require you to consider the backdrop of the Civil War, but looking at the Civil War itself (specifically, how it got to that point) might be instructive.

One big thing to remember is that governance is somewhat fractal. If the federal government ceased to exist, the state governments would still be there, and if /those/ ceased to exist, you would still have county/city governments. They would lose a lot of their current supports, and need to quickly replace functions, but unless the people outright revolted, I would expect those smaller governments to mostly stay intact, at least in the short term.

If you can answer some questions about what the nature of the aliens is, whether they're razing everything or attempting occupation, it might be a little easier.

**** The aliens are functionally nonsentient. Physically they're described as lizard- or bug-like, while the way they spread is more like a plant: in ebb-and-flow patterns. They're largely indifferent to humans except that we constitute an easy source of biomass to be reprocessed to make more aliens.

You can largely consider the aliens to be of the "mindless and/or monstrous" persuasion.

I'm not trying to get into politics in terms of people doing things, only in terms of the infrastructure of government. Like you said, that fractal nature means that I need to have a lot of things go wrong fairly quickly, but /only/ down to the state level, for my needs. I know enough about the fictional personalities I want to represent, but I'm less well-versed in the actual structure of things, so that's a very helpful insight.

***** OK, assuming that the Aliens are basically a fast moving zombie horde:

Lots of supply chains are Just In Time Supply with little redundancy. This will quickly fall apart and (where it recovers) be reversed to have many more redundant storage. But before that .... Cities can run out of gas in a day or two (many gas stations refill multiple times per day).

The federal government has some massive stockpiles (the strategic oil reserve, etc), but their ability to deliver during the opening days will be significantly curtailed. Some states are going to be winners and some will be losers. It is not unreasonable for some locals to basically grab whatever they can to fight and survive. And the army (etc) will be busy.

People will be reluctant to "punish" people who maybe didn't do anything by the book. And commanders will be loathe to put their soldiers to position where they may have to attack their hometown/state/etc. Look at the percentage of soldiers in WWII wouldn't even fire their weapons. And we didn't particularly like our enemies. Now that they are just random other Americans who (we assume) probably wouldn't have fractured without an alien attack ... ....

So ... it's a question of political will. If (say) 20% of the states fragment, particularly if they do not make a declaration but just kind of say "Yeah, we're americans, but right now we're busy fighting aliens, so we can't be bothered to help remit the payroll taxes to DC .... we trust our people are doing the right thing..."

Would you (as a leader) want to attack your fellow humans in that situation? Sure. But it probably wouldn't poll well during a hot war.

** I have a new warhammer 40K headcannon : the reverse theorie,\\
The Warp is the real world and the Materium is a simulated universe.\\
The asumption is that the "iron men" won their side of the war and greygooed the universe, the grey goo is/was housing the sentient mind of everyone at the time of the war, from both side.\\
This theorie hand wave simultaneously all the plot hole of WH40K.

*** So what are the various Xeno races in this theory? Constructs of the iron men (maybe the C'tan or Necrona)? LARPer former human uploads (this would explain the Orks)? Power tripping super users (the emperor, daemon princes, and other powerful warp entities)?

You know this actually works surprisingly well...

I was more leaning into Power tripping super users.\\
because the warp is obviously stronger than the imperium, so early super user have an enormous advantage in keeping their personal power and amassing more.

I likely timeline would be :\\
- classic "virtual" versus "material" debate that veer to war\\
- virtual win, they create their paradise\\
- the first super user came about, create false history in the virtual world in order to legitimize existance, create super species to protecte backdoor access, invite a friend to stave off loneliness/lack of creativity, name themselves Mork and Gork.\\
-others super user came about and fight each other in order to keep power. the one with better planning, better warcapability, easiest concept to understand win (in order : Tzeentch , Nurgle , Khorne )\\
-at the same time, non-super user find way to fight off super user (like - super computer simulation that looked like premonition for eldar, ultra resistance for necron, numbers for human)\\
- then you have the latest super user who found a new backdoor via synergized emotional emulation data-overflow (Slaneeshi)

and among all of that you have strange min-max player of the materium that are the cosmic "god" (C'tan and other such entity)\\
the tyranid is either that the galaxy computer that simulate the materium is in contact with an older galaxy computer and is in the mist of being comverted, or there is a fundamental flow in the computer way of emulating the materium that break the world and that is not patched by the current super user because they are too occupied by other super user.
