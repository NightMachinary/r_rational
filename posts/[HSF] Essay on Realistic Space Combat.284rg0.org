** I can't help but wonder about something like a rail gun in which the load fragments into pieces once it reaches a certain proximity to the target, if the munition was cold it wouldn't turn up on IR and with sufficient velocity the impact/s would be devastating.

With the fragmentation you'd also ensure that there are multiple incoming targets that need to be stopped before they hit the ship which would likely make life more difficult.

It won't be cold. A rail gun involves completing a circuit using your projectile. This generates A LOT of heat in the projectile. And even if you could somehow dump that heat before it left the barrel, that heat will still be visible by your target (just like everything else) and have a characteristic that screams "rail gun." At that point it's just more college math to figure out its trajectory and not be there. Without onboard course correction, dumb projectiles are trivial to avoid in space.

**** My understanding is far from complete but wouldn't a coil gun release a cold projectile? They don't pass current through the projectile like a rail gun does.

And while dumb projections are trivial to avoid in space if you're firing a single lump couldn't a scattered shot have a far larger area of effect? I'm imagining a large lump that breaks down into, say, pea sized lumps once it reaches a certain proximity. Even if only one submunition hits the target it'll still be devastating at the speeds they're talking about.

And yes, before you object, I am aware of just how vast space is and how accurate you'd still need to be. Just kicking ideas about.

** Seems to me that if you wanted to build an unassailable "fortress world" something like Europa might be a good place to do it. There's no atmosphere to cause problems for your mega-point-defense lasers, there's a vast ocean to act as a heat sink for them, and submarine bases could move around beneath the thick layer of icy armor to avoid bombardment.

An artificial version of this can be seen with [[http://gineipaedia.com/wiki/Iserlohn_Fortresss][Iserlohn Fortress]], which had a layer of liquid metal as its outer armor. Weapon turrets moved around within it like submarines.

** The idea of using lasers for point defense or any other kind of weapon is ridiculous. Choose a method that isn't thwarted utterly by a thin layer of aluminum foil and the most trivial of heat sinks. Any time you aim a laser at an opponent armed with a basic hand mirror, you have just surrendered to them the targeting control of your weapons system.

Aluminium only has a reflectivity of 90-95% at visible wavelengths and it plummets at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Your laser now has to be 10 to 20 times stronger than you intended. The heat sink I need to dissipate your laser's beam just shrank to one tenth or one twentieth its normal size.

And of course I don't have to use aluminum. It was a figure of speech. The spacefaring warmonger will of course have the most reflective missiles science can produce, since the cost of a missile is insignificant compared to the cost of the ship it sinks. Meaning the missile will be better at or as good at deflecting lasers as the mirror at the back of your weapon's lasing chamber is, which also solves the ultraviolet problem in the same stroke. You can't make a beam powerful enough to blow up the missile without blowing the ass off your own laser gun. All I have to do is buy the same mirror you use in your laser, and put it on my missile.

Me personally, oh probably not. My targeting computer however is really good at it. It can see your velocity and acceleration quite clearly and knows where you'll be with trivial calculations it can do in the time between when it sees your laser turret turning towards me and when the beam actually makes contact.

Sure. You use the better material, it might be heavier, or significantly more expensive. You might have to be more careful launching the missile so as to not damage the surface.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That sounds heavy. My laser turret only needs one mirror assembly that, compared to the many missiles each needing these defenses. Your missile needs this mirror on every part of the missile that is reasonably vulnerable to attack.

Maybe you only put it on the nose of the missile, which seems like a reasonable compromise for a head on vector, but any sort of lead or lag pursuit vector is going to expose the side of the missile to the target. What about the missile's sensor suite?

Yes, you can make a missile impervious to laser defenses, but at the cost of making your missiles more massive or expensive.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I obviously didn't mean that humans would be doing the targeting. To put it in similar terms to your response above, it is going to be something like an order or two of magnitude more difficult to accurately redirect an arbitrary incoming laser than it is to target it in the first place.

Consider - first, where is the laser targeting your craft? Am I, the opposing combat AI going to target reflective or armoured surfaces? No, I'll target sensors, radiators, thrusters, communications. How do you propose to place a (highly reflective, non scattering) mirror in the way of my laser? Am I going to be a non-jinking target? Against any sort of laser or ballistic weapon, I'm going to be making constant adjustments to thrust just to throw out such calculations. Obviously those calculations are harder when you have to also factor in the weapon you're trying to direct is under your opponent's control.

Basically, there is no possible way it is more cost effective to redirect incoming lasers when you need significantly more expenditure of resources than it would have taken to use your own laser.

The point of my comment was that this was an arms race situation between lasers and defenses against lasers. While I'm sure one side is going to win out (and I even agree with you about the issues with laser point defense), I was trying to illustrate that you can't just brush off the argument so trivially.

No it isn't. I can turret the mirror just as easily as you can turret your laser. We don't have to be aerodynamic about this. There's not really going to be any side-chase. You're either going to turn and run from the missile and I'm going to fly up your ass, and whichever of us has the best ability to cover distance over the time to impact will win, or I'm going to have it fly straight up your nose. At the ranges we're talking about, there is only really "towards" and "away" as directions.

#+begin_quote
  The rest
#+end_quote

You raise significant points regarding sensors and aiming, and I'll counter only halfheartedly that it's a lot harder to target a small specific area like the sensor of a missile, than it is to target "whatever area" on a massive warship. But as far as expenditures of energy, I think you're entirely wrong there. It's hilariously easier to wave a mirror than to generate a laser cutting beam hot enough to punch through silver and then also heat up a missile to premature detonation so you can change course and evade its debris. Aiming the laser back at you is just gravy on the top of 95% or more of your expended effort amounting to literally nothing. But of course, you would have your own mirrors, to protect you from exactly the same kinds of lasers you're aiming at me.

******* Broadly speaking, I agree with many of the points you bring up.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I still think it's getting significantly more expensive to make missiles proof against laser weaponry - not just in pure material expenditure terms, but also in making any given missile less effective in terms of effect on target, number of missiles able to be carried, or acceleration and delta-v capabilities.

There has to be a point at which highly defended missiles stop being cost effective. Do you deal with anti-missile missiles by putting point defense on the missile? At a certain point you're firing what is essentially a suicidal spacecraft at the opposing ship.

This is complete conjecture at this point, but I suspect that apart from a basic reflective coating, missiles would be more likely to be unarmoured and trade survivability for mass of numbers. The laser impervious missiles are great and all, except now you have fewer, slower missiles than might be susceptible to other point defense systems.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I can see what you're saying - if the missile has significantly more acceleration than the target then any given lead pursuit vector will still look basically dead on towards the target, especially as it closes to point defense range.

#+begin_quote
  But as far as expenditures of energy, I think you're entirely wrong there.
#+end_quote

Not energy, resources, and specifically with regard to redirecting incoming lasers back to their source. You now need to cover (because it's a lot easier for me to redirect my laser than for you to predict and move a single mirror) your ship in articulated mirrors and devote sensing and processing to detecting incoming beams. Seems an awful lot of design and maintenance effort for minimal gains.

On a spacecraft, I actually do agree that you can slap enough armour and reflective coating to make lasers ineffective.

I mainly envisioned lasers as being damaging to sensors and other unarmoured parts of a ship and being effective against lightly armoured swarms of missiles.

#+begin_quote
  hot enough to punch through silver
#+end_quote

Amusingly, silver is worse than aluminium for reflectivity (from blue wavelengths and smaller) and specific heat capacity. But I get the point. With that said, you don't have to punch through the armour to get a mission kill. The target still needs to cope with the extra heat dumped into it. Where do you put the attitude thrusters so that they aren't vulnerable?

On the back. It's just the faintest of shutters that very slightly divert the expulsion of the main engine. I don't need much in the way of attitude thrusters. You aren't going to be juking, no. Not until after you kill the missile and then have to dodge the debris. You're a massive spaceship. You can probably out delta-v me, and that is how you'd dodge the missile, by burning your significantly greater fuel reserve until you had a higher final velocity. My missile would fall short as its faster acceleration burned up more of its delta-v. If it were launched from too far away, you'd have time to get up to its delta-v. If you kill it, it's done accelerating, and you would then have a smaller final delta-v for evasion, or could move out of its path.

I'm not saying there's only going to be one missile, I'd want to fire one missile for each point defense laser you had, plus one. And I'd want to mirror/armor them only enough to stop your burn.

Let's drop the reflecting-your-laser-back-at-you aspect entirely. The design I have in mind now is a lot simpler. These missiles are shaped like long needles. They have a lot of surface area, and a very small cross section from your vantage point. Rather than having a blunt head, they have a sharp cone. Your laser hits head-on, and spreads across the entire surface area of the missile, reflecting outwards and backwards at a very shallow angle. This is both my defense and my heat sink. Each square inch of my surface is at a steep angle to your laser and receives very little energy from it. Most of that is reflected away. The rest heats me, and is hopefully radiated away. The longer I can make my missile without it breaking in half when it tries to turn, the less energy you can put on it with your point defense, and the more energy absorbed by it it would take to kill it due to the faster rate it radiates away heat.

I probably should have put an 'etc' after that. I agree, you put the thrusters on the back. But there are a bunch of design decisions that have to be considered and in some cases performance aspects might be compromised to improve defence.

Sure. There is a balance to be struck between how many missiles you need versus how long each missile can withstand point defence.

Regarding your design, fair enough.

******* I think you're missing the main advantage a ship has: thermal mass and a cooling system. The laser powers are most likely calculated including the 90% reflectivity of the target. The problem is that even 10% of a 100MW laser is a lot of power. The laser turret copes by having an active cooling system that dumps the heat into coolant. A missile cannot afford the same weight. Instead you use an ablative material as mentioned in the article. Ideally you do both, using an ablative with high albedo (it won't wear evenly enough to bother trying to aim at anything so we don't have to worry about specularity) I've worked with lab lasers that will set Al foil on fire and these are simple benchtop things.

**** 180 degree back-reflectors are a thing, you know.

You can literally turn 95% of the beam back to the offending ship with a $1 strip bought from walmart.

Or, if light speed is a relevant factor, put some actuators along the surface so it can be curved slightly. $1000 tops.

Plus, if you cool it to 2.7K, it's an allegedly impossible cloak for as long as you don't get hit.
