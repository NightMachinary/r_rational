*** I made the post a link because my account is new, so I couldn't do a full post. Sorry about that!

​

First, the story is a fantasy drama. The first arc, which I'm currently releasing, focuses primarily on the murder of one of the main characters' friends during her time at the college she's studying at, named the Soteria School for Seekers.

​

Second, I focused on character writing while making this, and something I wanted to be sure to do is make sure that every character develops and acts in a way that indicates their experiences. The main character Sumire, for example, spent the majority of her life with her brother, who did his best to act as a father figure to her. That being said, she also spent two years of her teenage years alone with the person in her head, or the narrator of the story, whose negative outlook also did a number on Sumire's mental health and previously upbeat persona. The constant back and forth between Sumire and the narrator makes up the internal conflict of her character arc, which I feel she deals with and suffers in rational ways. Beyond that, the story's worldbuilding and the actions of the characters, I feel, are also handled in ways that make sense within the story and aren't ham-fisted like other stories are.

**** To share things on reddit you are meant to follow the 10 to 1 rule.

It originally means ten shared posts to one of your own content but even any comments showing that you're part of the community and understand the rules rather than spamming posts on whatever subreddit you can under a new account and then trying to explain yourself when called out would be somewhat considerate.

To the mods I say yet again evidence of why we should have a rule 5 equivalent on every post. Stick it on the submit page so that everyone posting can see that if they're posting content they should explain it

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror --- you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.
#+end_quote

Edit 2: Of course no one follows this stuff:

#+begin_quote
  Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

******* If that were happening, it would be a problem to worry about. However, that is not happening. It seems moot to worsen the experience that we currently have to avoid the risk of an experience that we do not. A cure should be taken when you have the corresponding disease; otherwise it will just hurt you without any point.

Obviously in general you'd hope and expect that people who post stories also participate in the community. But posting a story can be an entry point; someone lurked, read other people's stories, and then wrote their own and posted it. That may lead to them integrating more in the community. Overly strict gatekeeping might deter them from doing that. That degree of gatekeeping could be an acceptable evil if we were plagued by spam, but we're not, so for now it's likely perfectly good to keep operating as we are.

******** First off, this is a minor problem. I accept that. But this is not the first time, I've reported a dozen or so posts on this subreddit that have been removed by the mods. I didn't report this one for reference.

Secondly, it's completely possible that this subreddit will never suffer quality degradation.

However, I don't agree that we should wait for things to get bad before we address it. This subreddit is better when those who post here ARE part of the community, have read the major works (cultural tomes so to speak) and so have a strong understanding of the type of literature meant to be shared. Fomenting that attitude amongst the community will improve it.

If we, like thousands of subreddits before us, abandon all sort of community policing and just blindly upvotes decide what is allowed then as with all major subreddits the quality will deteriorate and the niche will be evaporated in favour of lowest common denominator. That is, if there is growth, which is not guaranteed, but you just need one highly upvoted [[/r/askreddit]] thread to double the numbers. You can already see that people, who even read this thread and are part of this community, fall prone to misuse of votes.

In addition, I would almost argue against self posts by authors in general as they have strong incentives to post to as many places at once with any post-hoc justification they can get away with. The account is only 22 hours old so whether or not they just googled "good places to share my fiction" or whether they were a member of the community is in doubt.

If works are shared by readers who have no relation to the author then not only do they lack any incentive to share they at least have been convinced by the work's merit that it's worth sharing.

I'm not especially interesting in posting being an entry point for this community, the entry point should be reading rational fiction. Even if they had just shared it in the recommendation thread, where there is no high standard, and someone else had posted it after reading it, then I think the average quality would be much higher for posts that grace our vaunted front page.

Taking all of that into consideration there is as of yet no one who has even read it who has commented, all we have is the author's word that it's a good fit and no ability to judge their character from their interaction with the community. This is the very reason the 9:1 guideline was designed and I stand by it in almost all cases.

We should, however, wait until things show signs of being getting bad before taking non-free measures to address them. Otherwise the only logical conclusion would be that we need to take an infinity of potentially contradictory measures to address an infinity of potential problems. Asking for restrictive anti-respiratory disease containment measures in March 2020 was sanity. Asking for them in August 2019 would have been absurd.

We're a small subreddit largely under the radar of most people. In fact, interestingly enough, despite there being a significant group of people who find the rationalist community irritating or politically problematic (there was a post about this some days ago), we're surprisingly free of trolls or people spoiling for a fight. Discussions are most of the time reasonably polite and agreeable. I'm not saying that means we're invulnerable, but for now, things are pretty okay. In the face of that, putting up further barriers to entry does more harm than good, as it is more likely to deter the entrance of members who would enrich the community than to keep away supposed troublesome people that we do not have good evidence would show up anyway.

About the subreddit being flooded with self-promotion... I /do/ see your point in that OP seems indeed to have only posted about this story (in fact, they seem to have only /created their account/ for this purpose). Though the very fact that they know about this subreddit being a potential outlet for their story suggests they probably have had contact with some rational fiction works before. But also, how many stories show up for a first chapter, and then never again? There's very few regularly posted stories here overall. In this sense, upvotes aren't even such a bad guide, as long as they're used judiciously. Anyone who receives approval by the community meets the taste of the people who usually hang out here; anyone who doesn't will likely not even bother posting again. I get wanting the community to stay relatively focused on its own original purpose rather than drifting towards being a generic blob of fantasy and sci-fi fanfiction or webnovels, but do we really have any sign of such a drift being happening? That stuff usually is the consequence of a sudden influx of popularity causing large numbers of newcomers to dilute the core group into irrelevance, and this doesn't seem to be happening. It'll be a worry the hypothetical and highly improbable day someone makes a TV adaptation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, I suppose.

Is that so? Sure, an upvote is cheaper and can be given from the front page, but as a general rule, more upvotes generally do correlate with more comments and more interaction. It'd be an interesting thing by the way to see a historical series for most upvoted posts here on this subreddit... I suspect numbers would stay pretty low, but maybe we would get some insights.

EDIT: so if Reddit's "top" functionality really is an all time thing (I'm not 100% sure but I suppose so), then the first post is Mother of Learning's ending, with almost 600 upvotes, and lots of the remaining top spots are dominated by MoL. So basically nothing has risen up to the same level of prominence in over 10 months now.

************ Useless is an exaggeration, and yes as a trend certainly correlated, but you can still see posts on [[/r/all]] with 500k upvotes and 50 comments. Upvotes are usually summarised as a comment that literally says "I like this", while downvotes while meant to be used otherwise mean "I didn't like this".

It's surprising to me that WtC isn't higher but again that's my point upvotes are useless. MoL while a fine enough story (I enjoyed reading it) is really not that great in terms of prose or characters. For the most part everyone spoke with the same voice and the most interesting part of it was the idea. Even the world building wasn't exactly incredible. I don't really know why it's done so well. Certainly if I have a handful of the top webfiction in isolation I would never think that MoL deserves the top spot, whether in popularity, patreon or upvotes. But then that's true of published works too.

#+end_quote

I never said upvotes are a measure of literary quality (something that is not objectively measurable anyway), just of popularity at a given moment. There's a number of things that contribute to that; I'm sure many people here would prefer HPMOR to MoL, but maybe the community simply grew since then and that means the latter had a bigger basin of voters to draw from.

But if you have a problem with the average opinion of the member of this community, or think it does not align with yours, there's not much that can be done to fix that. It's simply how it is. My point was that if something receives a lot of upvotes, then it's very likely that if you asked everyone around here "hey, do you think this story is rational and belongs in this subreddit?", the majority would answer "yes", even if you wouldn't. The only alternative model would be to have some sort of committee of Rational Fiction Guardians whose opinion is used to vet which works are appropriately defined as "rational" even against the opinion of the unthinking masses if need be and, well... you see where this is going, and it gets especially ridiculous for such a small community as this one.

Remembers me of the endless diatribes about "what counts as anime?" on the anime subreddit. There was a huge argument then when a link to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0][the Shelter music video]], something animated by a Japanese studio, with Japanese voice acting, almost exclusively Japanese people in its credits, a distinctly anime aesthetic, and multiple anime stylistic and thematic quirks, was taken off the subreddit because the mods considered it "not anime" due to being commissioned and produced by a western artist. That is an extreme case, but personally I'm more in favour of overly loose than overly strict criteria when it comes to classification of artistic products - a concept that is inherently fuzzy and hard to pin down exactly.

That's where I disagree, I think people just see something and think "I like this" and give it an upvote. I imagine most people saw the post on their feed and don't give two cahoots what subreddit it was in.

This post is the perfect example, there's no way 18 people have read it, considered its place in this community, then came back and upvoted it all without contributing to the discussion.

Plenty of subreddits have automod comments upvotes which moves the voting system from the main page to the comment section where at least people will see the automod message and know what community they're in.

I don't think I'm asking for much that someone who posts here should explain why it's relevant and for people to at least comment once and contribute in someway before posting their own content.

** Since no one else is discussing the merits of the story itself...

Let's start with the good stuff. The premise of having to fight off the influence of a possessing spirit (or something) in a world with superpowers (or something) is a good one. It's remarkably free of technical and logical mistakes; as much of the plot and worldbuilding that has been revealed seems to be consistent and plausible within the rules of the world.

That said, I quit before reaching the most recent chapter. It just doesn't suit my tastes.

The first chapter almost lost me within three lines. Worldbuilding is one of my very favourite things in fiction, and this story seemed to be leaning entirely into the "Person says X, Person does Y" style of narrative, with almost no explanation. Speaking only on behalf of my own personal tastes, this was not a good way to make a strong first impression upon me.

Thankfully, after the first chapter (which appears to be a memory/dream?) the style shifts significantly for the better. However, there's still a dearth of setting information (I made it ~8 chapters in, and I still have very little idea about what an Imperium is, beyond being some kind of supernatural ability, or what is special about this SSS school to make the main character want to attend), and I still find the ratio of dialogue/action to character/setting/plot development to be weighted much too heavily to the former.

The main conflict for the first few (present-day) chapters is that the main character is late for her first day of school. The problem with this conflict is that it feels like there's no stakes, for several reasons. First, the consequences of being late aren't really considered by the main character, so we don't know what kind of trouble this could cause her. It's a vague, impending sense of doom. Second, the character adopts an attitude of, "Well, I'm already late, so it can't hurt to be a little later," which robs the decision to take the time to help someone else at the further expense of her punctuality of any tension. If she doesn't care that she's late, why should we? Third, after making the decision to help the person, there's no real suggestion about how it will impact the main conflict (yes, it will make her later, but *how much* later is never considered, nor what consequences being that much later will create). And finally, to put the cherry on top of the complete lack of stakes, when she finally finishes helping out and arrives at school, it turns out she was *never late in the first place.* School doesn't start until the afternoon of the first day.

I managed to make it a few chapters further in, when the main character has to make a choice between being late (which I've already been thoroughly immunized to as a source of tension at this point) and not being able to take the bag with her clothes to school --- I guess this is a boarding school? --- which is immediately shown to have no consequences whatsoever (uniforms will be provided, and the MC is apparently cool with wearing a uniform at all times), at which point, I gave up.

A story where the main character's choices don't have consequences just has zero appeal to me. Especially not when the other aspects of storytelling ---worldbuilding, history, backstory, themes, etc. --- are barely touched on.

If you don't like the first chapter, I strongly recommend at least proceeding to the second: it takes a remarkable shift for the better (in my opinion). After that, as far as I've read, what you see is what you get; if you enjoy the second chapter, you'll probably keep enjoying it, otherwise perhaps not.

*** Thanks for the feedback! It should be pretty evident through the storytelling, but I spent most of my efforts on internal conflict and character development. The real external conflicts are whats being established in the later chapters, which is what ties into the synopsis of the story. My thought process for setting it up this way was that the things that happen to the characters would mean more when you have an idea of what makes them tick & what their goals and motivations are.

As for the worldbuilding and setting, it's more of the same. Things are explained more as the series goes on, but I didn't want to info dump or put a bigger emphasis on the external makings of the world until their personalities were established to a basic degree.

Do you know any books that you like that handle the internal/external conflict better and more interestingly? I'd love to read them for reference as I continue writing. Thanks again for the feedback!

I don't really know how to explain it, but it basically hit my uncanny valley of character dialogue, where I could tell there was a lot of thought put into narration and character motivations and stuff, but it felt /just/ off enough that I couldn't get into the story.

(also having characters talk about mangas or other bits of popular culture in the opening scene of a story is a big no-no for me)

*** Thanks for the feedback! I know it's usually out of place, but Japan inspired the setting, so I felt it'd be authentic to mention manga. Is there a way that you feel I could've written it that would've hooked you better? The goal was to introduce you to Sumire's character before launching you into the events of the story, as understanding her background makes her future choices more understandable.
