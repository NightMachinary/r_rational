** Please utilize the pinned Monday Requests thread for such, well, requests.

Although the thread is going to be replaced in about 20 hours, so that might be a better time to post anyhow.

** Worth the Candle starts in a sorta-post-apocalypse zombie setting, but that's just the first book. It's got a plot device that "contains" multiple apocalyptic settings called Exclusion Zones, and several are visited throughout the story.

CORDYCEPS is a horror story with some rationalist themes.
