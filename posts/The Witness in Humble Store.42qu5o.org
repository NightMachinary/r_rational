** Haven't played the game yet, but I'm pleased with Jonathan Blow's effective altruism plugs on [[http://the-witness.net/news/][the game blog]] regarding the release of the game.

  If you buy from the Humble Store, 10% of the price goes to the Against Malaria Foundation.

  The Against Malaria Foundation is rated one of the most cost-effective charities in the world by both Giving What We Can and Givewell, two organizations focused on ensuring that charitable donations do maximum good in the world. Giving What We Can has a good high-level description of [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/what-we-can-achieve/][the philosophy behind this movement]].

** So The Witness is currently out on Steam and Humble Store (or still in pre-sale for the next few hours if you're in America), and I'd have to say it's bloody brilliant!

This is a work of love by Jonathan Blow, the same guy who made [[http://braid-game.com/][Braid]]. He has also chosen to take the way designers currently create games and spark a revolution by showing a better way by using his games as a golden standard. For example, he has even brought in a landscaper and architect to ensure the quality of immersion in the environment which is such an unusual idea that seems like the obvious thing to do in hind-sight when making a high-priced, high-quality game.

This is why I wanted to post a link to The Witness, because it's such a strong commitment to one's goals/philosophy and I feel that this game has a lot to teach in terms of discovery, learning multiple seemingly unrelated facts which all later connect into a future puzzle, and /my god is the artwork/ */f#$!ing spectacular!!!/* It's not just that it's so beautiful (although it's definitely that!), but it all connects and relates to each other with no chance for any breaks in immersion. Considering how the artwork is made into an extension of the puzzles, this is a damn impressive feat.

Here's the [[http://the-witness.net/news/][game blog]] and reviews by the [[http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DeannaVanBuren/20151012/254238/Architecture_in_Video_Games_Designing_for_Impact.php][architect]], and by [[http://kotaku.com/the-witness-the-kotaku-review-1754919626][Kotaku]].

The only "flaw" I can find is that it costs $40, but since the game is easily over 50 hours of game play with a lot of replay value, I'll begrudgingly say as a college student it's worth it.

I will not be answering any questions about the game, because to say anymore would be to ruin the experience, just like how talking about [[http://undertale.com/][Undertale]] would ruin the game for anyone who hasn't played it yet.

EDIT: I'm linking people to the Humble Store instead of to [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/][Steam page]], because this way a portion of all sales go to [[https://www.humblebundle.com/store/select-charity/charity/113632][The Against Malaria Foundation]].

*** How is this different than The Talos Principle? or is it mostly about the execution?

**** I'm not sure, because I've never played Talos Principle, but looking at the descriptions, I'd say that Talos has more of a plotline while Witness is more focused on the puzzles with a minimal plot.

** I played this for about 8 hours tonight, somewhat against my better judgement and my need for sleep. It's really quite wonderful in a very minimalist way; I've always enjoyed puzzle games that teach you how to play them without a tutorial, and this is that over and over again.

** Is there a strong plot element to the game, or is it primarily about environmental exploration? I ask because if it's the latter, then this doesn't really belong on this subreddit. It wouldn't be rational fiction, but I'm sure there are rational elements to the game (it being a puzzle solving game, after all).

*** It's more about environmental exploration with a very good test of your lateral thinking capabilities. However, I posted it because I feel Johnathan Blow made some very rational choices with respect to the gaming industry in an attempt to initiate a change.

If you don't think that qualifies it (which I sort of agree with you), I also posted it, because it feels like the kind of game that people here would particularly enjoy.

A change isn't the right word for it. I think more of a countervailing philosophy of gamedev. Casey Muratori is becoming more popular with his livecoding series [[https://handmadehero.org/][Handmade Hero]], and there's a spin-off initiative by some of their friends called [[http://handmadedev.org/manifesto/][Handmade Dev.]]

Jonathan Blow is also tinkering on a replacement for C++, ostensibly for games, but I think it can be used for a whole lot more than that and I wish he would release it already, despite it being very unfinished. CTFE and self-directed building features prominently. [[https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888/videos][He was doing demos periodically]] until he took a break for The Witness crunch time three months ago.

I emailed him about the language where he said to direct comments and questions, and he never replied. I think he took my mention of higher-level/higher-order type features to mean I was a type system purist. :c

***** Ah, thank you for the link to Handmade Hero! It looks really interesting and I'm glad you directed me to it.

I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't reach him, but if you sent it recently, I suspect that it's getting drowned out by all other /The Witness/ e-mails going to his inbox right now. I feel for his poor, poor inbox.

****** It was not at all recently. It was in last May.

Rereading it, I started with what probably sounded like demands... This is painful to look at.
