** Ginny felt Madam Pomfrey entering her mind. I feel like this is a much bigger deal than anything else.

Also, the whole snake speak thing, is that because she already has the diary? How did she get that?

*** My assumption was that Pomfrey was intentionally non-sly about entering student minds. I'm sure like any leglimens she's capable of using her ability undetected against a non-occlumens like Ginny, but in the interests of disclosure she "makes some noise" or something so it's clear what's going on. I could see HP preferring this method. Pomfrey being a leglimens is a little unusual though, maybe she's actually Moody using polyjuice

**** The more I think about it, the more sure I get that Madam Pomfrey is Moody using polyjuice. He helped redesign the hospital, he's a leglimens (we have no reason to believe Pomfrey is one from canon) and furthermore, he's EASILY paranoid enough to polyjuice himself into a hogwarts staff member just to catch an 11-year-old by surprise with leglimency simply because she reacted strangely when that hat put her in slytherin.

It's gotta be Moody.

**** But in canon the diary only possessed Ginny through her forming an emotional connection with Tom by writing in it over an extended period, so she would /know/ that something weird was going on and we haven't even heard mention of the diary yet...

...Is what I was going to say before double-checking HPMOR chapter 102.

#+begin_quote
  /Ssecond victim pickss up horcrux device, device imprintss your memoriess into them./
#+end_quote

That seems to indicate that the takeover is immediate upon physical contact (and it didn't take the first person who picked it up because...people take care not to directly touch Dark objects?). At the very least, it's pretty clear that horcrux 1.0's work differently in HPMOR v_v.

Furthermore, the extraordinary claim of Ginny having the diary now is justified by the extraordinary evidence of her being a Parselmouth and of the Hat being eager to make her a Slytherin. In the face of these, it's not so unlikely that some /other/ "Dark" person stumbled upon the diary and then acted the same way that Canon!Lucius did, and for the same reasons (getting it off their hands, striking against House Weasley, and if it was a blood purist who also knew it was a key to the Chamber, striking against muggle-borns). Or, heck, it could be Draco, degenerated to full-on evil after the end of HPMOR and associated extreme denial of the results of his earlier blood purity research with Harry.

Edit: there's another obstacle to Ginny having the diary now: in HP canon, /Voldemort/ didn't even give the diary to /Lucius/ until sometime during the (First) Wizarding War, which started in 1970. Pioneer 11 was launched in 1973. So in HPMOR, Voldemort almost certainly stopped caring about the diary and his other horcrux 1.0's long before he would've given it to Lucius, meaning that, before this chapter went live, the most likely scenario was that the diary was still in one of those fortified hiding spots.

Harry did "plant a seed in the darkness" after all, and given the ending of HPMOR, it's a pretty good assumption that the plant growing from that seed has withered and died.

*** That's actually not clear. It's possible that Harry has learned enough about the nature of ghosts to revive them from the dead (though this is unlikely, given that other ghosts are mentioned at the feast). Though I guess if Harry thinks that ghosts aren't sentient perhaps he really would kill one.

**** I doubt Harry would kill them regardless. The HPMOR canon explanation for ghosts seem to be that they're an imprint of a person's memories and personality made at the moment of their death. Sentient or not, that seems like the kind of information which would be extremely useful in resurrecting an individual who would otherwise be considered dead in the information-theoretic sense.
