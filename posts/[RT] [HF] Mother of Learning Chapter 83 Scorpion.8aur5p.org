** If we didn't already know that this was Book 3 of 3, I'd expect for this to have been the end of Book 3 and start of Book 4, with something very critical changing fundamentally as the next phase begins. As-is I expect this will throw a monkey wrench into the works but ZZ will still figure out a solution.

Glad to see the return of real stakes, though. It's been mentioned in previous chapters that the many things ZZ need to do can get stale when the worst possible outcome for anything is losing one restart, and not only is QI one of the few opponents that outclasses ZZ his soul magic makes the stakes properly intense again.

ZZ are a lot closer to getting out now that they can get the Ring and possibly the Dagger, but the Rod is still unknown and they still have to get QI's crown. I figure we'll have at least one more 'in the loop but not particularly high stakes' arc before we start gearing up for the finale in the real world.

All-in-all, this chapter was one of the most enjoyable in quite a while and I'm looking forward to seeing the consequences of getting partially soul-energy-blasted, since last time this happened it ended up with Zorian hitching a ride in the loop.

*** Stakes had to return at some point. I'm not sure how many chapters remain (the author is cagey about it as well) so you never do know... At the same time, you're right that the Rod remains and until then, people are safe.

Unless the author decides to kills or make otherwise unavaliable Xvim or Alanic. Things were progressing too smoothly...

***** Precisely my thoughts. Zorian saved himself but still felt some effects. If Zach was closer to the blast, he probably ate it harder than Zorian.

I don't think it'll happen, but here's the kicker: What if Zach ate it hard? As in, he's comatose for the remaining loops hard? But Zach is so fun, I definitely would not enjoy that. :P

And then, and then . . . Zorian saves /both/ of them because he's a true friend of Zach, but then when he exits the loop, RR was Zach all along! The twist is real! Zachorian was never meant to be . . . /s

******* Right---that was the reason for the /s, but just to mess with you, *if Zach is Red Robe, then Zach knew how to cast simulacra all along, but due to memory shenanigans or maybe skilled method acting, Zach couldn't remember how or pretended to be unable to cast the spell!*

Remember---Zach /admitted/ to finding the simulacrum scroll /years ago/, so maybe when we saw RR and Zach in the same room, we actually just saw Zach and his simulacrum!

In reality, that theory is not likely at this point because of how simulacra work: Simulacra are linked to the original's soul, so if RR or Zach is just a simulacrum, then when RR left the loop, Zach's soul would have left too because they would share the same soul. In other words, after Red Robe left the loop in chapter 26ish, Zach should have become a lifeless husk just like Veyers and the Aranea---at least, that what makes sense to me.

Additionally, I find it hard to believe that Zach could fake being of a vastly lower skill level in soul perception than he was for so long. Even if Zorian would not have noticed Alanic would have surely noticed something being off sooner or later.

***** A theory I have is when QI learned of the loop from mind raping Xvim, he decided to adhere some of his soul to Z&Z with the detonation, knowing that ultimately it wouldn't cost him anything as a fake entity.

I imagine Zorian would proably end up with a significant knowlege boost, and possibly even the divine blessing out of that, but as a main character would have enough plot armor to not be overwhelmed in mind. Zach on the other hand might start having a split personality issue and become a real threat for Zorian as QI encroaches on his soul.

It'd be a cool place to take this, since it would put a real lasting threat for Zorian, but its probably going to just be a theory since the price of Zach would be too high and the power boost would probably be a bit much (but would offset the loss of Zach)

Namely, the protagonist will enjoy victories big and small as the story goes, but something outside his knowledge screw him big way by the arc's end.

** So Zorian's strange danger sense again.

It first appeared in chapter 4

#+begin_quote
  ... he almost failed to notice one of the winter wolves attacking Zach had stealthily broken off from the main pack and was sneaking up on him. Almost. Thankfully, some primal instinct alerted him to the danger and he threw himself to the side, narrowly avoiding the creature's deadly pounce.
#+end_quote

Next is ch 34.

#+begin_quote
  And then, two weeks into the restart, he woke up in the middle of the night to see a black-clad figure with an obscure face and a knife in their hand standing over his bed.

  Later on, he would wonder what had tipped him off that he was in danger, but in that moment he simply reacted.
#+end_quote

And then ch 83.

#+begin_quote
  later, Zorian would wonder what exactly tipped him off and made him immediately activate his marker's restart switch when realized Quatach-Ichl was rushing at them.
#+end_quote

And another thing. On the surface, it doesn't looks like other cases, but I highly suspect this example might relate to above cases.

In ch 35. When Zorian met Sword Divers.

#+begin_quote
  Zorian almost lost consciousness as nine attacks slammed into his mental shield, crushed it like an egg and then ripped straight into his unprotected mind. the pain was excruciating...(omit)

  He felt his muscles lock up as an alien mind seized his motor control away from him and started rooting in his head for facts and memories. He had to do... something... had to...

  suddenly an image flashed before him, of two necklaces hanging from his neck, one of them inscribed with the defensive spell that ultimately failed him and the other that contained...

  his mind suddenly snapped back into place, his course of action clear. Activate the suicide rings, that's what he had to do.

But again you could be right and it would be an interesting twist. I feel coincidentally having empathic abilities was already a massive deus ex machina, so to be honest, I would sort of resent yet another inborn power like that. Honestly, as much as I /love/ all the mind magic shennanigans and wouldn't change it, on principal I generally dislike those kinds of inborn power-ups in main characters.

******* It most likely is still true, yes. Simply having Soul perception is a huge plus. It allows you to better perceive what you're doing to your own soul, and what other people are doing. Being able to perceive Quatach's soul is mentioned as one of the potential tell-tale signs that Zorian perceived before he buffed up his defenses right before the blast, too.

Most likely, Zorian still generally has better defenses, and he probably responded to the attack better than what Zach did. I fully expect Zach to be out of commission for a while, although I guess that we'll see if my prediction is true next chapter.

No, /he still didn't realise what was going on/. He thought that somehow they'd trapped him in an illusion, which is why he had such a hard time believing it; his skills would make it extremely difficult to ensnare or fool him that way.

** I feel like QI's denotation of his soul was an intelligent move rather than a suicidal one. QI knew that no matter what he does, ZZ could do nearly anything to him with the help of the time loop. Once they get out, they have extensive knowledge on him while he's utterly ignorant of two adult mages in the body of innocuous teenagers. And there's no changing that whatever he does in that moment.

However, there's a version of him who is still well-off. The version of him one month ago. And all he needs to do to save that version of him...is to destroy their souls.

So I believe the soul-bombing wasn't /just/ a desperate act, but also a move to ensure a version of him will be very well-off after the time loop is over with all but one of the controllers dead. Also, some people seem to think he knows Red Robe even if he doesn't know about the time loop.

  The Guardian hesitated. A short, tense silence descended on the scene as it considered the scenario.

They expect that to escape the loops, they will need to be able to defeat him in combat and take the crown before he can escape with it - which they still haven't managed to do yet.

Keep reading; Zach went on to say that he /had/ tried to throw items at QI in the past, and QI is expert at deflecting or even returning them.

The odds of them getting past his defences in that regard within their remaining iterations are too low to warrant the risk of facing him. Just look at what happened this time; ZZ may be a while recovering.

Being very generous, I'll allow that they might have a 1% chance of surprising him and dispelling him each time they try. But they might also have a 10% chance or more of having him get suspicious and hit them with enough soul magic to do them lasting harm. And the more they gear up for the confrontation (like warding their souls), the worse their chances of taking him off guard.

Attempt to replicate this restart's palace heist with QI. If successful, repeat the gate to Xlotic.

Ahead of time, put down a plate enchanted the same way as Kael's coin right where the gate exits into Xlotic.

Humans rarely take notice of what is directly below them, so QI may not realize what he's stepping on. If he does notice (which I would expect seeing as be would be on high alert stepping through an unknown portal), fight him as planned. If he doesn't notice, well---now you have a crown and a dagger as huge payoff for a plan that was improbably successful.

************* IMO they need two methods to deal with QI:

1. A reliable way to defeat QI under specific, loop-replicable conditions so they can always get the crown.
2. An extremely robust method to defeat QI under the chaotic post-loop conditions where RR might be present. It needs to be done once, but arguably that's when it needs to work 100% of the time, which is why this method needs to be extremely robust.

Both methods could be the same method if there's a reliable enough way to do it each time. I think having QI think he needs to use soul magic was a handicap they could exploit as their method 1 approach.

--------------

In the loop where the coin was used, Zach had the students have a party in his mansion. Red Robe tracked Zach down to the mansion specifically to discover who the other loopers were. You would have to hope to create a similar scenario sans RR and that may be doable, but it may be problematic.

Also, I think Zorian could be present albeit pretending to be merely a student. A disintigrating beam to that vampire heir woman would attract QI's attention, and there you go. It's worth a try if you ask me---but I maintain that the hardest thing is to get QI and the vampire lady into the mansion in the first place without the influence of RR.

I think another attempt could be to similarly raid the Imperial Palace with QI, eventually gate away to Xlotic like in this past chapter, but ahead of time place a plate below where the gate will open so that QI steps on it. If notices the plate and doesn't step on it---well, now they get to practice fighting QI normally again, this time hopefully with the addition of a small army stored in the Orb.

**** The problem is: this isn't useful combat experience. The QI they are fighting now knows that something funny is going on and is mainly using soul magic and mind magic attacks. Not to mention he has to go easy on them with the lethality of his magics otherwise they die and he gets no mind/soul to read. In contrast, normal QI will be using straight up kill magic attacks, which is an entirely different beast. So the experience they gained in this battle isn't going to match up with the battle they have planned with normal QI.

If they could induce this sort of situation every restart and reliably incapacitate QI, then they would have a way to get the dagger /and/ crown and they'd have four of five keys. One more key and their exit path is secured. By then, the only remaining hurdle would be to have a solution for fighting QI normally to permanently end his threat---which they could also practice---but remember is a whole other project in itself because it involves destroying his phyactery. If they just want to end the invasion, they could instead try to sabotage the creation of QI's special gate structure, which I think they already know results in the Ibasans just giving up.

I think the risk was maybe worthwhile---though I agree that it probably would have been safer to just prefer fighting QI normally to avoid the dangers of soul shennanigans.

He only seems non-threatening because of the fundamental limitation of soul magic- that it's slow/clumsy in offense, which means despite his thousand years of experience QI can't actually just snap his fingers and wipe out ZZ's souls.

He invested all those years into defensive and utility magics. Hence hasting, personal Bakora gates, lich magics, etc. With all the simulacrums and fake bodies he's pretty much impossible to kill. His offense is weak because he probably didn't think he would need them to be any stronger than they already are.

#+begin_quote
  and no morals holding him back in anyway.
#+end_quote

QI does have morals, it's established that he is just from an ancient time when values are different, more based on honor than human rights. He actually cares about his country and his people, though he is incredibly strict on them. So that means he won't go around performing human experiments on his people or can't take reckless actions that might provoke other countries to declare war on his country, not without decades of meticulous planning.

What if QI's soul suicide leaves a lasting scar on ZZs' souls that will be instantly recognizable to QI (just like how Sudomir recognized Zorian fiddling with his soul marker), thus barring recruiting his help (or at least acting as a warning sign for him) for several restarts if not into perpetuity?

Well, we'll have to tune in next time to find out! It'll be something to keep in mind if they meet QI off the battlefield again---and even then, I feel he wouldn't act immediately upon seeing such a scar but use the scar as a clue that he would bring up later.

Another theory:

His soul explosion actually fused small shards of his soul onto theirs. The small shards perhaps don't have any lasting effect other than to mark them, which again would make QI instantly suspicious upon seeing them again.

As far as knocking off the crown is concerned, that would be an interesting idea. If they could fight such that Zorian is hidden somewhere, if during the fight everyone could focus on hitting the crown, maybe a well-placed gate spell when the crown falls would allow Zorian to retrieve it.

***** Well, the ring wouldn't "work" in the sense that QI would instantly know something had been done to his soul, but he probably wouldn't be able to remove it. The only reason they were able to remove divine tracking from their souls this chapter was that they were able to get out of range so the tether snapped on its own. If the ring's range is 'everything inside the time loop,' then QI wont be able to get out of range. So using the ring tracking on him has a trade-off of immediately putting him on alert for the entire loop, but when they do get the ring a week after the loop starts, they'll be able to find him anywhere. But I don't think that's a good trade-off for them, because as long as they keep the loops somewhat consistent they'll always know about where QI will be anyway, and being able to fight him when he's not on extreme alert seems more important than tracking him on the off chance something causes him to greatly change his schedule.

3. In the rest of this restart, while you do have the ring, track QI soul to his phylactery
4. Repeat over multiple restarts, sending a simulacrum towards the phylactery before you start each time. Each restart starts tracking from closer than before.
5. Go ask QI nicely for the crown. When he laughs, threaten him with the exact location of his phylactery.

Zorian is a freaking teenage archmage (or, at least, well on his way to becoming one). He has an immortal friend who can brew him potions of youth, and probably has a few other paths to immortality. He may not be ambitious now, but he'd be a fool to make any decisions right now about his possible futures. He could, almost literally, do anything he wants, for as long as he wants, when he gets out of the loop. Once the time pressure is off, he should probably devote a lot more time to considering that.

I'm sorry, I'm going to need a citation for that. Most of the monsters I've seen have gotten into bad habits of thought (e.g. "prisoners are bad people who deserve to get raped;" "there are no innocents in Gaza;" "[indigenous population] are ignorant savages who can't govern themselves;" etc.), and do bad things because they can't bring themselves to care about the well-being of others outside of their [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number][Dunbar group]].

Yes, there are people who do bad things because they have compulsions they can't resist. I somehow doubt they are the ones causing the vast majority of suffering in the world, especially compared to the systemic evil some people perpetrate on people different from themselves.

Which makes getting in the habit of thinking of real-people-who-reset-after-a-month as not-real-people-at-all a pretty risky choice, morally speaking.

  its a made-up world so nothing would apply outside
#+end_quote

But it *isn't* a made-up world. It has already been established that there's no actual time looping taking place: the sovereign gate creates a new world every "loop" and then destroys it at the end of the loop. That means the people inside are /real/.

If your argument is: "They are going to die, or they can't get out of the doomed world anyway, so what's wrong with experimenting on them?" then I must ask: Why not experiment on criminals who have life imprisonment or the death penalty in reality right now? They have the same restrictions: they are trapped and doomed, and will never escape into the "outside world".

Also it would not surprise me if some non-loopers do find a way out of the time loop. After all, it has already been established that primodial prisons connect the loop worlds with the real worlds, so there are exit paths, just highly dangerous ones. Such non-loopers would know about Z&Z's morality within the loop.

*********** My argument is that they are not searching every avenue towards getting out of the time loop due to their morals as opposed to actual consequences since everything is recreated in the beginning of the time loop.

Well as for your question on experimentation on criminals is because the criminals do infact exist in the real world and someone can trace all that back to you. Morally it is worse because these are not copies but real people who won't be recreated ever again. there's a difference between cutting off the leg of a lizard and cutting off its head.

Besides its not like ZZ are taking enjoyment in killing or other stuff they do. They do it because they need to in order to work towards getting out of the time loop.

#+end_quote

Yes, hence the later part of my argument saying that things you do in the time loop could potentially be traced back to you. After all, it isn't really looping time: it's just creating "prison" worlds and populating them, then destroying the worlds. There are ways to escape from the loop worlds into the outside world, just like there are ways to escape a prison. It's just much harder, but clearly doable: after all, Red Robe did it.

#+end_quote

What makes the copies /not/ real? At the start of the time loop, they are identical in pretty much every single way to the people in the outside world, the only difference is their location and time of creation. Neither of which seems like a good reason for why the outside world people should be considered more /real/ than the loop world people. Rather than cutting off the leg of a lizard, it's more like cutting off the head of an identical twin.

Also, "real people who won't be recreated ever again" is really weird as a moral justification. Does the ability to recreate someone magically mean that now it's more moral to kill them? That their moral rights are now worth less simply because no matter how badly you treat them, they can be recreated?

(I imagine that our future machine overlords will take offense to this.)

First off, I agree. Second, they might be on the same (un)ethical level but the damage to ZZ's psyches are different.

Let's take torture as an arbitrary unethical action, ordering someone to be tortured is easier than torturing someone. The act of physically, or in this setting magically, going through with the action is very different from the perspective of the damage done to an agent's resistance to commit such an action than ordering a proxy to commit the action.

The act of using a proxy however makes them much more likely to normalize the ordering of such actions, that's the real crux of the issue.

Then we must ask ourselves, do we think that ZZ would do this continuously for every single problem over multiple restarts? I don't, Zorain at least would try other approaches first and leave this until the point they have little other choice or something of grave importance to him was at stake where he would lose his rational self. Zach on the other hand would give me pause, he is much less patient and expects results instantly.

If someone is sentenced to death, is it still immoral to torture that person? Of course it is, even though there won't be any lasting consequences for that person pay their death. Why? Because it's /immoral to torture people!/

Can exceptions be made, due to exigent circumstances (e.g. an impending invasion about to release an unkillable horror, massacre millions, and trap their souls to be used to power wraith bombs)?

But on the whole, it isn't. Not even when the ends is "to save lives." Because the world is complicated, and you can't plot out all of the consequences of your actions. You might not be saving any lives at all, because you could accomplish your goal by different means, or you could save five lives but the cost is a hundred more when the family of the person you've tortured vows revenge. Or you could end up with a keen supporter of torture as the chief of your intelligence agency, even when no one can point to a single life saved by the torture in question.

Now, the fact that they're in a time loop, and the typical consequences don't apply, and they can actually empirically verify that lives /are/ being saved through the torture, does screw around with the equation here.

But the rule should still be "no torture whatsoever," with every argument being made against it until it's clear there's no other way to accomplish the goal in question, that the ends are /worth/ such a means, and that the ends will be effectively accomplished throughout the torture.

/Ethical/ human experimentation isn't. And, in fact, this loop would present the opportunity for the perfect controlled clinical trial: get the double-blind right, and with exactly the same patient, disease progression etc., the /only/ variable would be the treatment.

I doubt they're talking about the ethical kind of experimentation, though. Otherwise, they could figure out a way to do it legally.

I want my /government/ to be utilitarian. It (ideally) has the data and processing power to effectively make that work. I want the people /around/ me to have a moral code created /through/ utilitarianism, which probably wouldn't be utilitarian itself (short of massively expanding the human brain's storage and processing power, and correcting its natural logic). It'd probably be a series of simple rules that our pathetic brains can understand and adhere to, starting with "Question everything, including the rules of this moral code." I can't say for certain what the other rules would be (as I don't consider my predictive power anywhere near sufficient to approach functional utilitarianism), but I imagine "Thou shalt not torture" would make the list.

On an /individual/ basis, which is what I was referring to in the text you quoted, the thought patterns for "Do this bad thing" and "Let this bad thing happen" are much different, which is what I mean by saying that they're morally quite different. And since thought patterns reinforce themselves the more that they are used, if I were writing this story and could therefore predict all of the consequences of the characters' actions, I would consider the /utilitarian/ thing to do would be /not/ to have the characters reinforce the pathways which allow them to ignore pain that they are deliberately causing (or to only do so to the minimum extent necessary to escape the loop and save the world).

************** Isn't that basically the entire premise of The Metropolitan Man?

Lois tries to convince Superman to spend every hour of his every day improving life for everyone else, when she is unwilling to make such a commitment herself, because his abilities give him the power to accomplish so much more good by the use of his time than she can. Luthor thinks that Superman is obliged to kill himself because there's a miniscule chance that he snaps and decides to massacre humanity, which, even on average, outweighs all of the good he might possibly do.

I would never try to teach a dog utilitarianism, but I can teach the dog to be friendly and obedient to his owner, which, given a dog's abilities, is about the best I can do, and, given a morally good owner, should be functionally equivalent.

A dog should be taught the best moral code a dog might be able to adhere to, a human should be taught the best moral code a human might be able to adhere to, and a being or system with superhuman understanding should be able to adhere to a higher standard of morality yet. And the highest standard, for an omniscient being, is bound to be some form of utilitarianism.

Asking a dog to follow a human moral code is a task where all you can expect is frustration, and asking a (present-day) human, with all the inherent flaws that implies, to follow a code of perfect utilitarianism is no different.

Until we can transcend these bodies, in which hurting people for good reason will build habits, that could, in turn, lead to hurting people for no reason beyond those habits... Until we, to a person, learn to see past the self-delusion of moral superiority that colours every memory of our past deeds... Until we have the innate resources to inhabit a perfect moral code better then we can inhabit a custom-tailored one, we'll have to settle for an imperfect one, one that leverages our imperfections instead of ignoring them.

I can't see how it's in any way utilitarian to think otherwise.

But being unwilling doesn't mean she thinks that she is in the right.

Also depending on her ability to improve the lives of other peoples its perfectly conceivable that your effort you put in could not be adequate enough for a net utility gain though Lois as a first worlder probably could easily do so. If Lois ever said that superman has a moral obligation and she doesn't because they don't even fall under the same moral system and there is no context in which she can compare their morality then I missed that bit.

Well of course not but that's because if you personally are a utilitarian you want other people to maximise utility, not to be utilitarians. Those are two closely aligned but separate considerations.

/There/ we go. That's what I'm saying, only I'm going a step further removed. I am /insufficient to the task/ of utilitarianism, so, for utilitarian considerations, I want to outsource the utilitarianism to someone or something that /is/ up to the task (which would produce higher utility than being a utilitarian myself), so that I can adopt a moral code that will maximize utility.

** Regarding compulsion mind magic:

Morally speaking, I wouldn't have an issue with learning the skill. I would practice mostly on animals, which I really dislike animal experimentation, but I think the situation justifies it. (If you think the ends never justifies the means, I believe you're incorrect but let's discuss it.)

I would practice doing things like compelling birds to once a day chirp at my window if they are nearby (so they aren't compelled to leave their home it they usually live elsewhere), or having a friend say "Zach smells funny" every time they see me, and other relatively benign things---with consent of course.

If learning the skill involved breaking minds, I would start with cultists and have them report news to me or something. I would eventually practice having cultists sabotage things on the day of the invasion. Imagine several hundred cultists each with a small explosive device from Zorian who could, for example, destroy key parts of the invasion. It would be very useful and could save a lot of lives---even cultist lives if the logistics of the invasion were sufficiently disrupted to make them give up.

Outside the loop, it would be useful for dealing with baddies in a way where nobody dies and people just go to jail, though Zorian can kind of do that now in a limited sense, he could probably do it more effectively. I think there are unique uses for the skill that would be invaluable and not require Zorian to injure his moral compass, which is a sentiment I do appreciate.

I think a major issue with learning the discipline is that Zorian hasn't found a teacher and few Aranea even know how to do it and fewer still would be willing to admit they know how.

** What a pity, I would so much have hoped for a possible long term understanding between ZZ and QI.

I mean, if ZZ manage to escape the timeloop, then it is in QI's best interest to peacefully cancel the invasion, before it is discovered (if Eldemar is not crushed, then the backlash is not worth the hassle; and ZZ can damage QI's plan enough to become counterproductive). If they can get QI to abort the invasion peacefully once out of the timeloop, then it is in their interest to do this. Hence, QI has an interest in providing ZZ with contact info and proof that would be convincing to QI, and ZZ have an interest (in the real world) of using it.

If ZZ manage to escape, then QI has an interest in (1) obtaining time-loop info and more importantly (2) having a workable relationship and trust-base with the new ZZ power in the world. Their acquired knowledge (Bakora gate information, where to find the imperial artifacts) is priceless, even for QI. He can put good probability to them becoming important long-term players that might be more amenable to lobbying for a peace treaty (which is the thing QI wants to achieve with the invasion). I could even imagine him taking on Zorian as an apprentice and future Lich, post-timeloop and once Zorian is close to death.

On the other hand, ZZ emerging successfully from the loop without a working relationship with QI is his nightmare scenario. Hence, his preferences should be:

(1) Subvert the timeloop [too unlikely to pursue], (2) see ZZ fail to escape, (3) have ZZ escape from the timeloop with QI's help and (4) have ZZ escape from the loop against QI.

ZZ's preference order should be 3,4,2,1.

Both parties prefer 3 to 4, so there is room for trade/trust, but not easily due to the possibility of QI betraying ZZ or being less helpful than he appears to be. Also, there is an issue of haggling: How much knowledge do ZZ transfer across loops for QI, or otherwise trade him? How much knowledge that could be used against him is QI willing to divulge to ZZ? This is interesting! (but apparently not happening)

*** Great analysis. I'd rather set ZZ's preferece order as 4,3,2,1. ZZ have vocalized how they completely disagree with QI's approach. Not only that, but I feel both of them believe QI is too dangerous and wiley to cultivate a longterm cooperative relationship with. Their priorities ought to be:

1. Exit the loop and survive.
2. Halt the invasion.
3. Find a way to end QI permanently.
4. Barring ending QI, find a diplomatic solution.

Outcome-wise, this is your 4,3,2,1.

Unforunately, option 3: cooperation is so unstable. QI knows that ZZ don't trust him and he would probably admit that given the opportunity, he would betray them. After all, QI very plainly said to them at the initial meeting that he believes in maintaining power and peace through the threat of violence and so ZZ feel if QI could eventually find a way to remove the threat of ZZ, he would choose to do so---they're forced to assume that if QI is given enough time to conspire, he would eventually choose a zero-sum solution.

QI realizes he cannot convincingly promise an option 3 even if that would be the best option for everyone, so all that is left for him is option 2---do his best to prevent ZZ from escaping. And if he fails? Well, ZZ exit the loop and stop the invasion. Even in that case, QI may still survive to fight another day if ZZ can't within the loop reliably figure out how to destroy QI's phylactery.

If the above is QI's calculus, then I can see why he would choose to detonate himself, likely inducing a coma, death, or otherwise scarring them in a way he might be able to notice if they try to negotiate with him in subsequent loops. I do agree with you, though, that an alliance would be a lot of fun to read about and it's a pity QI generally views alliances as temporary until one power outmaneovers the other.

**** Not so sure. I think the only conflict between ZZ and QI is that Eldemar is hellbent on maintaining a state of cold war with QI, and QI has no moral restraints on stomping Eldemar into the ground, including civil population, if given the opportunity (which is provided by Sudomir's wraith-bombs). ZZ actually don't care about the war, otherwise than not wanting Eldemar invaded.

So yes, cooperation is unstable, but not catastrophically. Once QI's option of successfull invasion is removed, QI has no more interest in backstabbing ZZ and vice versa. On the other hand, QI views ZZ as interesting, and ZZ need an endgame for immortality post loop; lichdom doesn't seem so bad.

The real problem is that, within the loop, QI will tend to backstab ZZ if given an opportunity to reliably ensure that ZZ fail at 1.

So, let me give an example how they could ensure cooperation:

QI has several pretty good signature schemes prepared. The cooperation scheme works by QI signing (MACing) a message to himself, and ZZ transmitting this message across the timeloop. This message contains the terms of the treaty. No public key crypto is needed, because QI will have a secret book of symmetric keys prepared (possibly in his own mind!), from before the time-loop.

A treaty can also contain hidden terms / information, using Merkle hash trees:

Each valid signed message by QI is an offer of treaty. Post time-loop, ZZ can choose which message to relay, so QI needs to be very careful when signing. Trade can happen, e.g. by ZZ showing QI where the imperial ring is (for his collection), and then signing (as part of a complex treaty including conditionals) "We agreed that ZZ will show me where the ring is. The description of the location has hash xyzxyz; I personally verified the correctness of this information. Regards, QI." Then, post-loop, ZZ can trade specific morsels of info with QI, which QI has already verified in-loop.

ZZ and QI can also transmit information in an initially trustless fashion in the following way:

QI encrypts his message to self, and signs it. Then, ZZ encrypt this message, and incorporate it into the treaty. QI learns nothing from this; ZZ learn nothing from this; but if future QI and ZZ reach a higher level of trust, then this information has been preserved (and future QI can reveal it to ZZ, or future ZZ can reveal it to QI, with the revealing party learning nothing about the message).

Such information exchanges can be used fruitfully to search for an optimal cooperative solution: A way that ensures QI's peace treaty without damaging Eldemar. Once such a solution is found, if it exists, there is no conflict anymore. Hypothetical example: The fourth in line of succession of Eldemar is amenable to a peace treaty, if QI follows the correct negotiation strategy. Without the time-loop there is no way QI could figure this out; with the time-loop he can try out high-risk high-reward strategies like assassinating parts of the Eldemar leadership and offering a lot of concessions, until he finds a reliable-in-retrospect solution.

I understand why QI choose to bomb ZZ instead of negotiating; he was acting under time-pressure and with incomplete information, and probably optimally for his knowledge. I think it is a pity that ZZ did not think about attempting such a negotiation.

Now I want an omake of a serious QI/ZZ negotiation ;)

Also, such a meta-fic would fit perfectly into the lesswrong/rational-verse: It is reminiscent of simulator negotiating with an opaque simulatee, some of whose goals are known. Of course the negotiations / protocol-design would become simpler if public key crypto was available, but we cannot assume this.

However, I think it was an author error and that it is better corrected than not; most readers who happen to notice the error will think of it as a typo rather than assume that it was intentional.

** I like to think of MoL magic system as code, specially the soul magic field about markers and templates. I think QI soul bomb is a workaround against the Sovereign Gate loop, QI just hacked a mark on the timeloop to erase the template on his soul just as if it were SQL injection. This could be a pretty handy mechanism to protect oneself against loopers, as alternative to not engaging at all, I think ZZ souls are fine, but QI will be soul killed now and they won't learn more about him. It would be even cooler if all of their teachers are also wiped out of the time loop! A really nice and difficult situation for the story. Maybe that's why Demian wasn't included, the plot will need him for Blatyrre exploration.

*** I also think of the magic (in any system honestly) as programming. While I think your theory has merit, I don't think it's the most stable way to program the loop mechanism.

In my mind, the Sovereign Gate keeps a template of every soul it needs to recreate every loop. At the end of every (while!) loop, the Gate grabs all souls marked as controllers, then goes through each soul in its template and recreates it---unless the soul has a "soulkill" marker on it. If that's the case, then it doesn't matter what happens to non-controller souls in the loop because those souls are always trashed at the end of the month anyhow. This method is more stable because you're treating most of your soul data immutable in the form of a template. (Think of data safety as described in the Haskell language.)

But yeah the Sovereign Gate program could work the way you mentioned. The Gate could inspect every soul in the loop, see if it has a "please replicate" marker, and only in that case make the replica. If QI destroyed his soul and thus destroyed that "please replicate" marker, then his soul detonation was a really good move. However, that would mean that certain types of soul mangling done within the loop would affect the souls in the next loop, which I feel the designers of the Gate would have wanted to avoid.

**** Would it be possible for you to elaborate on some points of the story (if they are not going to be explained in the future):

1. "Since it was extremely difficult for a controller with an intact marker to unlock their soul perception through classical means, it made sense for the Shutur-Tarana to prepare a workaround for his successor." The story so far was that Shutur-Tarana established an empire. Does this imply that Sovereign Gate was actually created by him (he was actual god who decided to establish empire just for fun or whatever, not the person who discovered old relic).
2. Any particular reason for Z&Z not to put the golems into the orb (or any other opposing factions). It's a huge walking prison/temporary, useful detainment/sorting facility.\\
3. Why Z&Z didn't bring like 10-20-50-100-200 golems into the fight/ambush for QI?
4. While the QI is very very powerful, Xvim is actual defense based archmage. It takes him brief moment to re-establish his non-structural magic defense. Also you've explained that mind blank is unnatural state and it can be dispelled. However it can be also said that there's a resemblance to the reason why dispel spell does not extinguish fire caused by fire spell (mind blank is sort of disconnect from great physic net in the same fashion as holding one's breath). Spell allows to achieve that state, but it goes beyond that and to remove unnatural state target needs to be affected in the way that it would revert unnatural state (like start breathing in surprise). Xvim offered very little resistance.
5. Souls were supposed to be indestructible. The last stunt QI pulled kinda suggest that you can do pretty much anything to soul (it is like hologram - if you break it up, every tiny fragment contains the same image). It is very close to blurring the line between mangling the soul beyond recognize and actually destroying the soul

***** 1) No, Shutur-Tarana was not a god. The imperial artifacts were clearly made with the help of a god, but the first emperor probably had a lot of input into what his fancy set of magical tools would do and look like.

2-3) It takes time for Zorian to make golems. He mostly ran out of them by the time they fought against QI.

4) It takes just a moment for Xvim to re-establish his usual mental defenses, but those defenses aren't mind blank. They cannot stand up to QI's attack. Because the disconnect from the psychic net is so unnatural to mind, they immediately snap back to their natural state when the magic forcing them is gone.

5) They are. They have an indestructible core and an outer layer that is crucial for a person's existence but can be destroyed or modified. I don't want to explain what QI actually did, since it is slightly spoilerish, but he did not violate these principles in any way.

Even if we suppose that QI doesn't have the memories of this loop, waking up in Xvim's body in the next loop will still prompt him to find answers.
