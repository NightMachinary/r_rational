** As expected, the second part of the plan is to bait the Tyrant into attacking because a quick battle doesn't suit his goals, whatever they are. Cat thinks he needs leverage in order to negotiate something out of Cordelia, and a total victory for the Grand Alliance won't give him that.

But this isn't the end of the plan. Catherine, and presumably the rest of the Wild Hunt, aren't present in either location, so she's off doing something else. Are we still sure that this battle is the Prince's Graveyard? If so, then some more princes need to die, either at Kairos's hand or as a side effect of whatever Cat is doing, but I doubt she'll attack the, directly because, like Pilgrim said, a false surrender would backfire tremendously for a villain. However, maybe she can cause a civil war amongst the Grand Alliance between Levant and Procer--maybe the Procer troops won't follow Pilgrim's acceptance of surrender, or maybe there will be a difference in opinion on what to do with the POWs.

**** Probably fresh army v exhausted ones, the risk of the newly rescued villainous army starting to fight again with a broken pattern of 3. Since she seems to have actually meant it (surrender), if anyone attacks the Tyrant she could come to his rescue to slip out of the 'false surrender' narrative. Nobody is fighting, the threat is implicit, and the peace conference to add terms to that unconditional surrender to take some weight off whatever Kairos has planned for later.

** How can Peregrine be so sure Cat is destined to become like the Dead King unless he stops her, "Catherine Foundling had given the slip to every story that could bind her to an ending, and so left herself only one path: reign eternal, consumed and consuming, a herald of long prices and hard measures having made mantle of the woes of Creation."

Yet the Wandering Bard writes her off like she's on a suicide trajectory? I wonder if what WB has said to other characters about Cat is not true. Maybe she's guiding Cat along while making up excuses for why she doesn't finish Cat off.

*** The Pilgrim knows the first part of her trajectory in broad strokes. She went from an unknown to the Squire, to the commander of a legion of terror, to the queen of an evil aligned country. Then, he meets her in the battlefield and he sees a broken girl, filled with the full might of the fae's winter and, like the Dead king said, on the brink of ascending. Then, she goes off the grid just to return with a army's worth of horrors from the everdark and literal goddesses of Evil on her shoulders.

If it was me, I wouldn't be optimistic either.

****** That could be. It could certainly explain Tariq's side of my question.

I still doubt Bard though. Bard can be wrong (Tyrant) but she's very good. Somehow she is consistently wrong about Cat. She is also apparently involved in setting up a lot of what's happening now, probably influencing the Auger (very important to the current story because the Auger is the reason they are not letting the Legion leave, causing this whole mess) and setting Black on a path to survival. Cat plays a central role in both of these stories, so Bard is able to predict Cat's behavior this well yet still get's her trajectory totally wrong? It's suspicious.

*** If he was sure he would be scheming to kill her, what he's trying to do here is making a weapon that he could use to kill her later. He's pretty explicit about the fact that, if he lets this opportunity slip, he's not going to be able to handle her if she goes all "hidden horror".

He's Above's main fixer and there's an evil queen who he failed to redeem and is growing out of his ability to handle, the possibility of her turning into a monster is there and if he doesn't set up the possibility to bring her down now then he's leaving the fate of the world up to chance.

***** Came here to say this.

Rule of Three only applies to conflicts between named. As none of the Drow are Named in a traditional sense, this shouldn't apply.

Even if it did, I can't help but think that Rumena will be of the Black school of 'how to cheat the Rule of Three', even without /trying/. Body doubles are sort of his thing.
