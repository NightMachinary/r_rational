  Data will be uglier because some people will look at this and choose just one or two but most won't and will choose several. The sort of person who ignores this will be nonrandom. Going to select several because I think everyone else will.

  I wish more people participated in the biweekly writing challenges; maybe if something was done to lure more people in that would work. In any case, the less people who participate in them, the less attractive they are to participate in.

  I miss being able to just toss out ideas as posts and actively discuss them. I still visit for discussion of various web serials, but a lot of the initial draw of the sub has been lost. The closest thing to what I'm talking about might be the power munchkinry threads on [[/r/parahumans]], where you take a concept, sometimes inane, and run with it to find cool usages and ideas.

** So here's the spreadsheet! Got some tabs at the bottom where I've created some pivot tables and charts and what not! I also have a chart where all of the comments have been placed into their own little pivot table.

Only issue is formatting for that last section where I asked you guys what your favorite part of the sub was. Because I'm a dumbass, I put checkboxes instead of multiple choice to give you guys a+n illusion of+ choice. And because I'm a super dumbass, I put commas in some of the checkbox answers. So there goes my plan of just splitting them up with commas as a delimiter!

I've changed the questions so that they use hyphens instead of commas in them but any data before row 353, which I've highlighted in green, may not be incorporated into the table I'm planning to make, marking out people's favorites. If any of you guys are excel wizards and have suggestions on how to somehow format the data to be usable in my sheet without deleting any inputs, I'd be very grateful.

I'm an excel hack, and I basically use my very limited skill to make excel work for me. What I'd do is I'd count each unique response to the checkbox questions and then manually copy them over. So if seven people chose A,C,D,E, you'd just increment each of them once. Depending on how many unique sets of preferences there are this might save you time.

It's ugly and you can probably do something computationally that would be far superior, but that's my quick and dirty hack, just fingers crossed there aren't 300+ unique choices.

Just find and replace the string with the comma in it with an abbreviated form with no comma. Then you can use comma as a delimiter. Easy!

Holy Fuck. I think you're right. How dumb am I for not thinking of that! Some CS major I am -_-

  Doxxing myself, but I quit for a while once one of our mods advocated violence. Glad to see [[/r/rational][r/rational]] leadership pass back intto my personal overtone window.

Surprisingly not me, since I was one of the people who raised a stink about that more vocally.

**** I did not make that comment in the the survey. I did complain about the mod/event in question quite a bit, which could lead one to assume that I made the comment.

Not that it really matters all that much.

One of the mods was going around with flair saying "bash the fash", which made apparently more than just me uncomfortable.

***** It is pretty upsetting to see people openly advocate for violence against my political beliefs, but I don't tend to let that discourage me, it just drives me to be better prepared to defend myself and my people. Also, quitting just cedes ground.

******* I understand that, and such attitudes are definitely appreciated by most fascists. I believe violence and physical punishment have their place, but I'm obviously going to agree and amplify when people publicly protest violence against me, and defend my freedom of association, even if they do it for the wrong reasons from my point of view.

*********** The /in bad faith/ refers to upholding it with the explicit intent to (legally, peacefully) abolish it when/if we (legally, peacefully, etc) take power, yes. As far as I'm concerned, a legitimate ruler has every right to defend himself and his subjects from ideological threats. But I obviously won't object if our enemies refuse to do so.
