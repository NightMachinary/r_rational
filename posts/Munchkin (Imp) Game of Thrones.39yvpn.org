Knowing what we know about magic and the supernatural in the universe of GoT/ASOIAF, what are the best munchkinny exploits you can come up with?

Some existing magics to start:

Warg: possess animals and communicate with them telepathically, a few can do it to humans

Red God: kings blood (and other... fluids) can be used for all sorts of purposes, including magical murder, weather control, and who knows what else)

Dragons: big inexplicable flying beasts, can breath fire, smart animal level (so it seems)


** The rules are too poorly defined to really figure out what's going on in /A Song of Ice and Fire/. I've seen the scholars at [[/r/asoiaf]] try, but it's all mostly guesswork. If I had to do a power ranking (*spoilers follow*):

- Dragons. Long-range artillery in a world where that's basically unknown, fast travel times, morale breaking, etc. Not much way to munchkin these except to spend lots of time with them, give them lots of food, and don't chain them up in a dungeon (/cough cough/).
- Others. Virtually invulnerable to anything except for dragonglass, Valyrian steel, and maybe plain fire. Doesn't really matter, because if you're an Other you never really need to go into combat; just raise an army of undead and stand back on the hills while they fight it out. The extent to which summer time effects them is unknown, but I would work on finding an immunity to that.
- Priests of R'hllor. Resurrection is great, though their form of it kind of sucks; it's better for morale boosting than it is for any other purpose. If you're doing things right, no one is strategically irreplaceable. The costs, limits, and conditions are unknown. The priests also get access to some form of divination, and possibly shadow magic, but the divination isn't all that good, and the shadow magic presumably has some limits on it, unless the characters are stupid (or there's some contextual reason for them no to use it that's opaque to the reader). It's not clear to what extent R'hllor actually exists, if at all. It's not clear to what extent shadow magic and blood magic are R'hllor based. Glamours are really, really good, for subterfuge; impersonate enemy commanders with it to sow dissent and confusion.
- Faceless Men. Have access to better form-changing magic than the priests, but not much else. They use this for impersonation, but apparently not to take over entire kingdoms by pretending to be the king. It's not clear whether this is because they would need to have too much information, because of their culture, or because of unknown limitations on the magic.
- Skinchanging. Good for scouting. Good for leading animals on the offensive, if you can get a pack of wolves to follow the one you're warged into. Good for long-distance communication, if you can control it precisely enough to beat the ravens. Could you make a monkey write? A parrot talk? Unknown; we haven't seen it used enough. You /can/ skinchange into a person, but it's not clear what the limits or conditions on this are.
- Greenseeing. Somehow distinct from skinchanging, or in addition to it, but all by itself it seems to offer some not-very-good divination. It's poor for information gathering, but could be made better by planting more weirwoods. Nothing else that it's done has been too impressive.

*** These are good ideas, although having only seen the series I feel like the dragons are disappointingly vulnerable. Two episodes ago some masked assassins almost killed one in open combat, mostly by throwing spears.

**** That's because it was staying at ground level. A well-trained dragon who's just flying overhead and doing firebreath passes on critical areas of the battlefield would be devastating. It's a one-beast army. Also a nightmare of a siege weapon.

(Also it's still very young and small. There's no telling how big they will grow; apparently the last Targaryen ones were quite small compared to their ancestors, possibly due to inbreeding, but who knows from which stock Daenery's eggs came from.)

******** Technically yes, but not by enough. Besides, your archers will not stand and fight when charged by a flying flamethrower. I know I wouldn't.

There's in-universe evidence of this. The Targaryens landed on Westeros with three dragons and not much else, crushed every opposing army, and united the seven kingdoms in two years - all without losing a single dragon.

Most ASoIaF dragons died of old age or in a fight with another dragon. I think one of them was killed by a scorpion (the siege weapon).

*** Book spoilers: Bran's greenseer tree vision can apparently enable communication with the past, with unknown limits. Ned hears him in the godswood, but he leaves before useful information can be passed back.

This should naturally be tremendously munchkinable if Bran can find a tree to talk to his future self.

** You've forgotten the Braavosi Faceless Men -- they possess the ability to change their identity so thoroughly that they can infiltrate and assassinate whom ever is worthy of the Many-Faced God's attention.

Blah blah blah, spoilers, etc.

That said, Bran and Arya are tied for munchkin powers, since they possess warg/greenseer and warg/morghulis abilities. They seem to be on the flip-side of the same coin since Bran can't fight at all and knows so much, while Arya can sneak and kill (as Nymeria too, don't forget) but knows so little. Perhaps Jon Snow will top both of them, but that depends on whether or not he is Azor Ahai.

If I had pre-existing knowledge of all magics in the ASOIAF universe, I would first collect all of the prophecies from Maggie the Mage, Mirri Maz Durr, Quaithe, Daenerys, Melisandre, etc. as a warg/greenseer like the Bloodraven. Secrets are hard to come by, so I'd make sure that I have plenty of coin on hand to pay the Faceless Men to assassinate key advisors in places like the Small Council and replace them with my own "little birds."

Then, I would send Ravens to individuals who I can manipulate with whispers of power to show up at key moments and ensure their successes or failures based on my foresight and triple-checked/quadruple checked prophetic knowledge.

Chances are I'd probably spend centuries figuring out how the prophecies are all related and all of my manipulations would just result in getting a boy shoved out a window and making a crow say "Corn! Corn!" Because really, this is AGoT. You never want to become the main character.

Greenseers seems to be the most powerful magic users that we've met so far. Pretty much super-charged wargs who have the ability to take over animals and plants. By looking through plants (only weirtrees so far) the greenseer has the ability to see all that the tree has seen. This could for instance be used to scout ahead, plan ambushes, find hidden treasure etc.

We haven't seen much about the true power of shadowbinder yet, only Melisandres shadow that assassinated Renly. The Shadowbinders are, according to World of Ice and Fire, to be the most sinister inhabitants of Asshai, a city where no magic is prohibited. The possibilites of blood-/shadowmagic is pretty much limitless. Resurrection, assassination, glamours/illusions and the like combined with the possibility of more direct destructive firemagic makes shadowbinders kinda op. The only drawback seems to be that most powerful spells requires kings blood but with some resources an ambitious (and scruple-less) shadowbinder could find some bastards (Robert has more than a few still running around), breed them with others or each other and then just sacrifice them for more power. Rinse and repeat.
