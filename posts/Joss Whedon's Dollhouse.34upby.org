I wanted to recommend Joss Whedon's series "Dollhouse".

Setting [copy-pasted from Wikipedia]:

The show revolves around a corporation running numerous underground establishments (known as "Dollhouses") around the globe that program individuals referred to as Actives (or Dolls) with temporary personalities and skills. Wealthy clients hire Actives from Dollhouses at great expense for various purposes. Each Active has their original memories wiped and exists in a childlike blank state until programmed via the insertion of new memories and personalities for each mission.

...

Okay, so far we have standard fare. Starting from lame stories "hunt serial killer blah blah", the show (and its characters) progresses in an almost rationalist fashion towards exploring some possible implications / usages of this type of tech. We get the belovable combination of some power creep, scope creep and inexorable descent into full-blown apocalypse.

TL;DR If you like Joss Whedon (Buffy, Angel, Firefly), then you should not miss Dollhouse. Otherwise, it might be a gamble.


** I don't know about this one. I really liked Firefly and then retroactively reevaluated Buffy and Angel, which I'd blown off for a long time.

Buffy was hugely sprawling and had the usual serial fiction cancers of lack of direction and threat of the week, but was still very interestingly constructed and powerfully implemented modern fantasy soap opera.

Angel was pure monster mystery schlock, but it hit the points it seemed to be aiming for and was entirely watchable in a Scooby-Doo sort of way. Wolfram and Hart is still one of the best supernatural modern fantasy organizations /ever/.

My point is, all three of those aren't very rational (Firefly did it best), but are great for what they were.

I never felt like Dollhouse was great for what it was. It certainly wasn't more rational than his previous works and it suffered from really poor world building. Early episodes were almost unwatchable and it didn't ever get much better. It certainly wasn't very rationally plotted and seemed to follow Lost-style plotting along with some poorly done rule-of-cool.

It felt like a lot of my time as a viewer was being wasted with loving and overly long shots of scantily clad people with little plot or coherent character development. Senselessly wasting the audience's time is a cardinal cinematic sin that I can't forgive. Dollhouse wasn't good softcore porn or sci-fi drama.

I don't think I even watched the last couple of episodes. Maybe that makes up for the rest of it. I sort of doubt that, though.

** I really liked Dollhouse. The season one finale ("Epitaph One"), with its flashforwards, was absolutely brilliant - there are all these implications of the technology that have been built up over the course of the season that just hammered home one by one over the course of an hour.

And yes, it's a little uneven at times. I wish that they'd gotten a better actress for the lead, since she's outshined by the other two main dolls (Enver Gjokaj is amazing). I wish that they'd been able to skip some of the more procedural aspects that were forced on them by Fox at the beginning - episodes that you could cut entirely and it wouldn't make any difference at all. But it's still a great premise that gets pretty thoroughly explored, and I've watched it through three times now.

I cannot agree more. What's-her-face is just not very good at playing anyone other than herself. Enver Gjokaj showed himself to be a versatile and broad-based character actor: he should have been the star.

** I really loved the 50% of the show when the executives stopped meddling and let the writers give us some damned good cyberpunk. /Dollhouse/ is basically everything cyberpunk /should/ be; it's only a wonder Topher never attempted to build a recursively self-improving Doll (and even then... those Epitaph episodes...).

Oh, and the identity of the Big Bad is one of the greatest, most retrospectively sensible ass-pulls (in the sense that Joss admitted they /didn't actually plan it ahead of time/) in all of fiction. It really succeeds wonderfully in giving me that "I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING BUT DIDN'T!" feeling. The sheer Magnificent Bastardry of it all is on a level with /Following the Phoenix/'s Quirrellmort's two-day war-starting.

*** Executive meddling is what /made/ the latter parts of dollhouse worth watching. They gave the showrunners a fixed number of episodes to wrap this up, and suddenly it stopped faffing about.

** This is one of the things I liked most about Dollhouse. Initially it seems like the premise is just being used as a plot device to have Imprint of the Week adventures, but after the first 5 episodes or so (presumably when the executives stopped paying attention) it starts to really explore the horrifying implications of the technology.

Also, Epitaph One was downright chilling.

Damn. I knew about the existence of Dollhouse before I discovered the gems that are Buffy and Firefly and it never sounded interesting enough to watch just based on summaries and recommendations. I probably heard that it was made by Josh Whedon but it came in a time before that name meant anything to me so I completely failed to update. Now I know what to watch next.
