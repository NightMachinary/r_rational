** Trigger warnings: innuendo, ponies.

Status: complete.

It's a story about Twilight ascending to godhood. It's one of those rare gems that's incredibly well-written, sufficiently ‘rational' for this subreddit, and still puts the characters and story ahead of any didactics. It also doesn't treat immortality as a curse, either explicitly /or/ implicitly, which is quite a feat, especially while still acknowledging that downsides exist.

Mostly, I put this here because I read it and I think it's good fun while also being intelligent enough that the people here won't just sneer at it because ponies.

****** Seriously. A soldier at age 18 goes off to war and makes what he believes will be a lifelong friend, and then two years later he sees his good friend's head get blown off, and he has to just get on with life. He doesn't get a trigger warning before a car backfires near him, or before some redneck goes into the woods to play with their gun within earshot, or before a neighbor decides to celebrate their kid's birthday with fireworks. Trigger warnings are literally the stupidest thing. People who have /actual/ PTSD that isn't self-diagnosed and has to be treated by actual psychologists, those psychologists treat them with /exposure therapy/ where they literally expose the person to their triggers repeatedly.

The way self-identified liberals have become is so absurd that I sometimes think it's been done on purpose as sabotage. Possibly by the same group that's allowed bisphenols and phthalates (endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogen and block testosterone) to be used in such a wide range of consumer goods (from plastic bottles and toys to food packaging to the synthetic fragrances in perfumes and air "fresheners") that those chemicals show up in the urine of almost every U.S. citizen who's ever been tested.

That sounds like an Alex Jones conspiracy theory, but I think I believe it sometimes. I'm pretty sure I believe it right now, while I'm talking about it. Even when I don't believe it's being done on purpose, it's still definitely a real thing and I sincerely believe that exposure to estrogenics and testosterone-blockers in the womb is having and has been having an epigenetic effect. People are absolutely being exposed to them in utero during development. Our children's children are going to think we were incredibly stupid for allowing Febreze to be legal.

EDIT: I also often believe that the obviously stupid stuff with mommy bloggers prattling on about vaccines and GMOs and fluoride is heavily promoted by the media to make the easy mental shortcut "person starts talking about chemicals, person is an ignorant moron" so people won't pay much attention when people bring up the facts about endocrine-disrupting petrochemicals saturating our food and water and air.

I'm not totally convinced about the value of content/trigger warnings (e.g. [[https://slate.com/technology/2019/07/trigger-warnings-research-shows-they-dont-work-might-hurt.html][this article]] explains why they might be more harmful than helpful), but your argument is roughly equivalent to "Swimming instructors literally take children into the water repeatedly to teach them to swim and not drown, so the laws requiring people to put fences around their pools to prevent kids from drowning are literally the stupidest thing."

Okay. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that trigger warnings work as intended, and prevent distress.

There is a potential negative consequence (traumatic distress/drowning). There is an hazardous environment (a trigger/open water) which creates a risk of experiencing that negative consequence. Controlled exposure to that risk (exposure therapy/swimming lessons) will, in the long-term, prevent the negative consequence from occurring, as the person learns how to survive being in the risky situation (triggering scenarios/water). Uncontrolled exposure will just lead to distress.

I think that's a pretty equivalent analogy. How is it not so?

#+begin_quote
  You can't put a fence around the entirety of existence.
#+end_quote

You can't put a fence around the entirety of water. Given that you can drown in water an inch deep, your choices are to stay inside or to risk drowning.

You can, however, put fences on water that you have introduced, which create a substantially increased risk of someone wandering into unawares and drowning in it. Which is what pool fence legislation does. And which, in theory, trigger warnings do.

********** The problem I have with all of that is that life doesn't give you a trigger warning. "Uncontrolled exposure" through books and movies and college lectures /is/ the controlled exposure that prepares you for encountering the trigger in the real world. You can't put a fence around the family two tables over who met there specifically to discuss a familial issue that triggers you. If you've been allowed to avoid reading about it or your professor allowed you to sit out of that class, then you're suddenly in the pool and don't know how to swim.

*********** You're talking as of exposure therapy is just simply repeatedly running someone through their trigger, with no support, and letting them learn how to cope.

In reality, that's likely just going to traumatize then further. Exposure therapy involves giving someone the tools to cope, standing at their side while they encounter the /smallest possible quantum/ of their trigger, and then slowly escalating and stepping away in tiny intervals until they can deal with a full-strength trigger on their own. And, all the while, giving them the opportunity to call a halt if things get too intense, because /going into full-blown triggered traumatic distress may just reinforce the trigger further/. Hence, the swimming analogy. Throwing a non-swimmer into a lake unprepared isn't teaching them to swim; it's putting their very life at risk.

I'm going to change analogies here, since "you can't put a fence around all the water in the world" went over your head entirely.

Yes, therapy is needed, and yes, therapy can involve exposing people to their trigger repeatedly. But what you're basically telling people with peanut allergies is that allergen warnings aren't necessary because peanut desensitization therapy is a thing, and because you can't protect someone from every source of peanuts. *Exposure to peanuts can kill you if you are allergic enough to peanuts.* (Which is why desensitization therapy doesn't just consist of feeding an allergic person peanut butter sandwiches until they're cured). You can carry an Epi-Pen (which, in this analogy, would be having a therapist on speed-dial), but they're expensive, and a far better tactic is just to make every effort to avoid coming in contact with peanuts, to the best of your ability, until/unless you can be successfully desensitized to them.

If someone were able to learn how to cope just by being exposed repeatedly, a lot of therapists would be out of a job. The reason they're not is that it's not nearly that simple, and you reducing it to this, to such an extent that providing trigger warnings is "literally the stupidest thing," is... Well... If mental illness weren't as stigmatized and misunderstood as it is, I'd call it "facile to the point of either willful ignorance or disingenuousness," but, under current circumstances, I'll settle for "profoundly misinformed."

(Once again, all of the above is argued under the assumption that trigger warnings are effective, which I don't take as proven.)

You really should spend an hour and a half reading about bisphenols and phthalates. Bisphenols really do attach to estrogen receptor sites, and phthalates really are testosterone blockers.

Seriously, an hour and a half of research. There's no way that you can devote an honest and sincere 90 minutes of research to the issue of phthalates and bisphenols and not come away convinced that those chemicals are having

You didn't even do 90 seconds worth of research. BPA is well known, so products (especially plastic water bottles) are quick to state that they're "BPA Free." BPA has been substituted for BPS and BPF and about half a dozen other chemicals. People who kinda know about things kinda know about bisphenols. People generally don't know about phthalates, and there are dozens and dozens of phthalates. Plastic *IS* bisphenols and phtalates. Synthetic fragrance *IS* phthalates. These aren't chemicals used in the production of these products, they ARE the products.

******************* You are still doing it. Reread what I wrote and stop twisting my words. Here are the facts:

1. You claimed there is a conspiracy to poison people.

2. I disputed that statement.

3. You said that no, actually, poison is poison.

4. I said that actually, I know that; you're wrong in saying that there is a conspiracy to poison people.

5. Repeat ad nauseam.

** It's a good story. Reading along when there were large gaps between updates I admit I lost track of who certain characters were (kind of fitting, given identity is one of the main themes of the work), but I think that problem would be solved by a consistent read-through. Good fanfiction all-around.
