Since we've had a bit of a lull here, I thought I'd share [[/u/A_Lobster]]'s condensed version of /The Enchiridion/ by Epictetus, an ancient Greek Stoic. The raw .txt is [[https://pastebin.com/CvcneJ9b][on Pastebin]], though [[/u/TheWayofTheFuture]] can supply a formatted .pdf on demand. It was originally posted [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/2pxbku/ive_spent_the_past_few_days_editing_the/][here]].

*Why does it belong on [[/r/rational]]?*

I hold that a rationalist Stoic behaves no differently than a rationalist; the only difference is in how they think. Stoicism is just map-territory distinction cranked up to 11 -- mindfulness plus psychological debugging -- and provides a pretty solid solution to Camus' absurdity along the way. [[http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Inform_Yourself/About_Mental_Illness/About_Treatments_and_Supports/Cognitive_Behavioral_Therapy1.htm][It's also repeatedly been demonstrated as a fast and effective treatment for depression]], which is always nice.

While this Ã¼ber-condensed version might read a little bit like the Ten Commandments, I recommend reading the full text. It's longer -- each bullet point is expanded into one or two paragraphs -- but it explains the reasoning much more thoroughly, even if you read just the first page or so. It's available all over the internet, notably [[http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html][here]].

*** Twelve is fine from the perspective of someone thousands of years ago, who probably didn't expect to live very long anyway.

Valuing happiness over some mildly increased lifespan while unhappy is a totally reasonable position. The equivalent is euthanasia today, whee it is completely rational to check out rather than face suffering for a short period of time. There is only negative utility, hell, letting a disease take you out rather than dying while relatively healthy probably even makes resurrection harder if you go the cryonics part.

**** There are a lot of things which looked reasonable at the time, but are not so now. I'm not looking forward to reverse engineering philosophical insights of a 2000 year old text and then constructing a rational modern reinterpretation based on them. That is why I asked for a modern analysis. I'm hoping someone did all the work for me.

EDIT: As for twelve, it's a matter of interpretation. After reading the full version:

#+begin_quote
  If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: "If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, he will be bad." For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better your servant should be bad, than you unhappy.
#+end_quote

I don't think Epictetus meant euthanasia when he wrote that. I'm actually not sure what he really wanted to express with this one. It looks like a modern "you're fine just the way you are" meme, but then he prefaces it with "if you want to improve", which seems rather odd. He basically says "If you want to improve, then be happy lazing about starving to death. It's better than doing a bit of work you despise to feed yourself."

EDIT2: I feel that interpreting this as "you should optimise your life for cumulative happiness and not lifespan" is way too charitable to Epictetus. At this point it's no longer his philosophy, but something of our own creation.

***** I think I can clarify a bit. Stoicism shares a vary close ancestory with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_%28philosophy%29][Cynicism]], which was a specific form of hedonism. In that school of thought, one is trained to take pleasure in the small things. Epictetus in particular was heavily influenced by Cynical teachings, and greatly admired [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_of_Sinope][Diogenes the Cynic]]. Epictetus viewed cynicism as a perfect form of stoicism, where a person has complete self-control.

Cynicism stems from asking questions like this;

"Will the pleasure gained from having a Ferrari, minus the stress caused by the effort of actually getting one, be more than the pleasure of simply bathing in the sun?"

In Cynicism, one trains them self to take extra pleasure in small things, and takes as little effort as possible to gain as much pleasure as possible. There's more to Cynicism than this, but that's as much as I need to explain.

This isn't exactly what Epictetus is saying, but he's saying something in a similar vain. The stress of worrying about a problem plus the pleasure gained from fixing it is less than the inconvenience of having the problem, if you train yourself to not be worried about it.

The various post-Socratic philosophies were very centered around emotion. They often had a stated goal of completely avoiding one emotion or another, and/or promoting one emotion, usually pleasure, by varying definitions.

Epictetus's account of stoicism puts abnormally heavy emphasis on one's ability to choose, that is, our will. The only thing we have absolute control over is our thoughts, opinions, or decisions. And as such, it is a highest virtue to possess absolute control over these, so that we may make the "right" choice. I'd recommend reading the first few chapters (they're super short) of [[http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.1.one.html][The Discourses]], which gives a clear account of this emphasis. It may help to know that Epictetus was born into slavery, and the idea that, even if one cannot control their body, they can still control their mind, became very important to him. In his mind, anyone who possesses concern for those things for which they do not have absolute control, anything that's external to the mind, lacks virtue. Hence, it is not virtuous in his mind to worry about external problems.

If you're interested in studying stoicism in general, using Epictetus's Handbook (that's what Enchiridion means) will be woefully incomplete. It's specifically intended to be a study guide, a companion to a larger course on stoic ethics. Epictetus's writings (really [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrian][Arrian's]], as Epictetus didn't actually write anything himself) mainly consist of ethics. Most of stoic philosophy is actually concerned with Platonic/Socratic logic, physics, and metaphysics. Epictetus deliberately goes out of his way to downplay the importance of these, even though they were the chief concerns of his contemporaries and predecessors. His views on stoicism were greatly influential, but they were not always canonical.

A good modern account of these ideas is given in the [[http://historyofphilosophy.net/][History of Philosophy without any gaps]]. The Hellenistic subsection in the Later Antiquity category contains an episode dedicated exclusively to Epictetus, as well as other aspects of stoicism and its sibling philosophies.

This is pretty poor on its own, I agree, and is probably best understood as corrective hyperbole: if someone is distressing themselves about their upkeep, the point is they can drop the distress. They are very probably not actually going to die if they stop stressing, and an extreme statement like this could open their mind to the possibility that one can still be happy in suboptimal conditions.

I think it's more about realistic expectations. If you don't have absolute control over a thing, then it is wrong to expect that it will always go the way you want it to. (If it did, then it would be something you had absolute control over.) If you know that things are not always going to go the way you want them to, then you can be emotionally prepared for that eventuality. You don't have to discard emotions --- you can harness them for whatever productive ends they move you to --- but you don't have to let them /debilitate/ you.

**** If your reinterpret Enchiridion strongly enough to get output like "Do not let bad things upset you so much you are debilitated" and "Do not expect everything to go your way", then it becomes a good philosophy. But why use Enchiridion at all? Just construct a good philosophy based on modern psychological and cognitive science and be done with it. Using contrived interpretations of questionably translated 2000 year old text for this seems ill-advised.

EDIT: If it's not clear from my previous posts, I'm strongly against using any interpretation of philosophical text but the most blindingly obvious one. If philosopher wants to convey his ideas to some public the onus is on him to make the meaning clear and unambiguous. I'm not going to try and reverse engineer the intended meaning behind mangled hyperbole.

That's probably so, if you're trying to develop a philosophy. I didn't pick up Epictetus for the purpose of internalizing the principles of Stoicism; /Discourses/ just happened to be on my reading list and I managed to come away with some insights that were useful to me in my position. I also like his humor and found his prayers interesting.

Not "ignoring", not at all. "Tying emotional state to." When Epictetus says "Concern yourself not with the weather, for it is outside your influence," he means "You can't control the weather, so don't get all upset when there's rain and clouds on your birthday. Just be happy regardless of the weather."

Does that make a little more sense?

/A Guide to the Good Life/, by William B Irving, has been very helpful to me. It's a pretty straightforward interpretation of Stoic philosophy and an application to the modern day. He's written a few articles [[http://boingboing.net/author/william_b_irvine][here]], which I also recommend.

Unfortunately, [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/][quite]] a [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/][few]] purely scholarly analyses seems to focus less on the philosophy and more on the archaic metaphysics taught by the ancient practitioners. As the SEP says, "Stoicism has never been âpurely academic'." I'll do some googling and see if I can find anything.

If something outside your immediate influence does not bother you, you are not likely to try and bring it under your influence. I feel that this is a crucial bug in this model of behaviour. Humans are pretty bad at estimating what does and does not lie in our causal reach. Some things turn out to be within reach only when we are bothered enough to try and affect them. Stoicism may be a good philosophy for enduring hardship, but not for trying to cure death or save the Earth from UFAI.

In general, since our emotions guide our behaviour in ways that are not always obvious, tinkering with out own utility functions like stoicism prescribes seems a bit risky to me. You may end up happy and content as people you could have saved, if you cared to try, continue to die around you. That does not sound like the optimal outcome to me.

The whole point is that the only thing we really have control over is our map. Anything we control in the territory could be taken away. For instance, you might think you have control over what you wear every day, but a totalitarian government could come tomorrow and take that away from you. If that were to happen, would you cry that you can no longer choose what you wear? No, of course not. Breaking down in tears is hardly ever productive.

Keep in mind that when Epictetus says "the world's a stage; play your part," he's speaking as a slave who believed his part was "philosopher" and therefore won his freedom through years of effort. Marcus Aurelius, writer of the great Stoic text /Meditations/, was a Roman Emperor who led great wars of conquest against the Parthian Empire and won the Marcomannic Wars against the Germanic tribes. Being driven to do great things is not at all incompatible with Stoic philosophy.

How's this for a summary: Stoicism says, "Act on your principles, not your moods." Does that make sense?

#+end_quote

There is less motivation to try and change your situation for the better if you trained yourself to stop caring about things seemingly outside of your control. Sure I might decide to fight the totalitarian government as a result of rational deliberation completely unencumbered by feelings (not really, but for the sake of argument let's assume it's possible), but if I really hated not being able to wear my favourite pants, I might start fighting just a bit sooner and fight just a little bit harder and save one more life as a result. Like it or not, emotions play a very big part in human decision making and lowering my dissatisfaction with things that are not right will lead me to take less action to make them right.

And why do you decide that choosing what you wear is outside of your control anyway? Surely dismantling the totalitarian government would allow you this freedom again, right? Where do you draw the line between things you can and cannot affect?

#+begin_quote
  "Act on your principles, not your moods."
#+end_quote

Sounds good in theory and falls flat in practice. Human beings are not really capable of decision making not informed by emotions. Maybe I'm an extra special snowflake myself (seriously doubt that), but I'd rather have more emotions about bad things I have no control over. Then I'd have enough motivation to start doing something to make this world significantly better.

It's not that I object to thinking. It's that I don't see it as dichotomous with feeling. At least as my parents taught me to manage my emotions, the important difference is between long-term and short-term: how much /staying power/ does an emotion have to affect your later evaluations, how thoroughly do you share this emotion with your past and future selves? Thought is for serving the passions that past, present, and future "yous" all share.

Which is kinda a really short way of describing something I do by blunt heuristics that probably requires quite a lot of psychological knowledge to describe thoroughly.

More than I actually have time to read. Alas, by the material I /have/ studied, I'm merely almost finished with an MSc in Computer Science and an undergrad-level minor in math.

This might be /somewhere near/ enough, but it's going to be quite tough to accomplish since day-job sorts of stuff always interferes.
