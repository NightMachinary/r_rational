So one of the issues I'm running into right now is how to deal with giving descriptions of things that are *wrong but considered common "knowledge"*. My story does not have a rationalist dropped into a fantasy world. He's a native resident who will learn science and a bit of rationality little by little as the story progresses.

As the world is not super advanced, there's a lot of misinformation out there about how physics, magic, the body, the mind, etc. work. The problem is that a lot of the descriptions that will be given initially (that will turn out to be wrong later) are quite similar to the way things actually work in canon in other fantasy works.

Since other fantasy works accept these kinds of things as truth, I'm afraid I might turn off readers who won't realize that these things are in fact not the way it actually works in my world. But since my character is just as ignorant as any of the other natives at the beginning of the story, I don't have an easy way to present the idea that "that doesn't sound right..." early on and leave a seed of doubt.

Example: X was made by gods. At first, there's no widespread mechanistic description for how X came about, and magic does exist, so this seems plausible. But in fact, there are no gods and there's a perfectly reasonable mechanistic description for how X came about. Most characters just don't have the requisite knowledge to come up with the right answer. MC will eventually get it, but I'm afraid I'd turn off readers with the whole "gods did it" explanation that will be present for a good chunk of the story.

Another example would be the development of sapience. In some eastern fantasy novels, panpsychism seems to be rampant. (Gather enough spiritual energy into anything---a lake, a mountain, an animal, a sword, etc---and it'll become sapient eventually and become "human-like"). In my world, just like in ours, humans are the only sapient thing that ever evolved and sapience is a complex thing built up of moving parts. But there are things other than humans that are sapient in this world, like not!Elves, fairies, etc. This might lead people to a number of mistaken beliefs like panpsychism or gods or that sapience is a natural result of the accumulation of enough magic, etc. But the real answer is that all of these have their own mechanistic descriptions for how they came about and the origin of that sapience is always from humans who developed it through evolution just like we did. These other sapient creatures are the result of humans plus magic in accordance with the established laws of magic in my universe.

However, I want my story to appeal to people who won't be happy with the panpsychism description (just like I wouldn't be). I just don't know how to keep them engaged until I can get to the point in the story where I can tear down the false descriptions. I know that I've dropped stories in part because the metaphysics of the world is too unscientific or hand-wavy. Unfortunately, mine may /seem/ that way at first too. I think it'll be worth it in the end, but I'm not sure if there's anything I can do in the meantime to make it easier to swallow given that it's not portal fantasy so I don't have access to an "enlightened" character to hint to the reader that "not all is as it seems" right from the beginning.

That said, I'm not completely in the dark about what to do---I have some ideas. I just want input to help me along.

For example, when my MC is being taught magic and science in the beginning of the story, he'll be told how "we used to think the world was made up of four elements: wind, water, fire, and earth. But now we know that's not the case. Earth is actually made up of many different components." This will give hints that "common knowledge" is not always correct and that their understanding of the world is evolving, so the things they think are true right now may be proven wrong later. I just don't know if little hints like that will be enough.

--------------

Any hints or suggestions?

Any works I can reference that have done this well?

Am I just overthinking it?

Thanks!


** I think you're overthinking this a little bit, but then again, I'm perfectly fine with non-reductionist worlds where the magic is kind of vague and unexplained, and its bounds aren't explicitly described (eg Practical Guide to Evil, Glimwarden), so I'm probably not your target audience.

One approach you could take would be to have the character be told about several conflicting theories of magic, and have multiple characters debate on the merits of each one. For instance, Person A believes that sentience is the result of magic accumulating, Person B believes that sentience is a discrete quality (you either have it or you don't) that can only be granted by the gods.

*** I endorse this answer. Even if it isn't quite the way things played out on medieval Earth, having a character think about two conflicting explanations is a much stronger signal that a third explanation might be true. Even if both conflicting explanations sound tropey or irrational, having two different explanations is a much stronger hint, verging on a literary promise, to provide a good explanation down the road. Tropey bad explanations are meant to just be accepted. A character not knowing which of two tropey explanations is true, and analyzing both of them unskillfully and wrongly, is a much stronger invitation to the reader to reject both explanations and both lines of thought, even if the character doesn't think of that... though, alas, not every reader will pick up on your strongest invitations even so.

It kind of is, isn't it? Obviously "medieval" is very broad, but I think both theological and scientific debates between scholars or students were very much a thing for most periods, even if they used epistemology we wouldn't approve of today.

** Since your main character is not rational to begin with, but you want to give off the feel of rationality, perhaps you could give rational traits to a (perhaps single story arc) side character. In setting you've given, they won't analyse the faulty assumptions about the world, or even consider them as a problem, but they can act rationally towards other things, more common problems. If you can convince your [rationality-loving] reader that this story has rational elements, then they are going to be a lot more willing to see it through.

I actually really appreciate that you are going to have incomplete answers given to the main character on purpose. I was once considering a world idea where each nation/culture has a different science to explain and control magic, and they all work. One of the main character's quests would be to figure out how all the forms of magic are compatible with each other and find a universal explanation. Unfortunately that idea never got crystallised, along with the countless others.

I'm getting this odd feeling from your own suggested solution.

It doesn't really give off the rational/ist vibe that I think you are trying to give off; it just seems like some idle worldbuilding and seems a bit out of place in this scenario. I wouldn't expect a teacher/lecturer to talk about outdated models in [I assume] an introductory lesson quite like that. If I were in the teacher position, either I'd save it for a later lesson or try to make a point about it when talking about the development of science. I'm considering a different situation and phrasing where I feel like it'd have more effect: "You're acting like someone who still believes in the four elements!". Here it's used as the focus of an argument and gives the impression that the speaking character feels hubris about the advance in knowledge. This is something I haven't spent enough time on, so there might be an even better place to put it.

*** Eric Sanderson has a good set of lectures for fiction, you can find then on YouTube, it's his 318R series. The salient point is that the first chapter or few chapters are a promise to readers that this is what you're getting with the story. He mentions an author that did a similiar premise that you're suggesting, except it started as fantasy trope and flipped it on its head in the last third of the book, it flopped, readers who stuck with it wanted fantasy, and those interested in the twist left before they got to it. He suggests flashback start of the story as one way to do it, I think that's a little cliche myself. You could also try describing the equivalent if the big bang in your universe, and then link back to the fantasy and people ignorant of what really happened, but the reader knows, and knows that you're going off that premise. Or try your own take of it, just make sure it's hinted at early.

Web series are kinda exempt as you can safely assume what's in the rational reading list will be rational, so that applies more so for books, but the loss of interest is a real problem if your changing themes.

*** Cool, thanks for the input. I've been thinking I'd probably have to use another more experienced and knowledgable character to introduce the seed of doubt early on. I already have a good candidate.

Right, this is totally out of context and is not a direct quote either. It's not even brought up in a discussion about whether current theories are right or not---it's actually part of a discussion about reductionism, physical quantities, and the different "layers of reality" at which you can do math/physics, because that's the basis for systemic magic in this world. But old-school magic based on "the elements" also worked to some extent, and that's important to magical theory, so there's a reason for discussing it early on in magic training.

Thanks!

** You can't be too timid and embarrassed when you're writing your false explanations about things created by gods and such. You must write it in a way that makes me want to believe it, /then/ tear it down. It will have all the more power that way. It may turn the reader off if you set up a pathetic straw-man of a belief, but if you set up something compelling the reader won't care if it's wrong.

Readers aren't turned off by bad metaphysics, they are turned off by bad writing. Write well, create compelling characters and a compelling world, and let even your false explanations be compelling and seem as justified convictions, and it won't matter what your metaphysics are.

Check out pretty much any of the great fantasy novels for good writing with non-scientific metaphysics.

Look at for instance the Chronicles of Narnia. The metaphysics is laughable. The morality is bad. It veers into outright bigotry and racism at times. Frankly the whole thing is downright offensive. Yet it's a very compelling story. His truths were wrong but he wrote them beautifully, and by the end, you can understand why he believes them.

#+end_quote

The problem here is that it makes us think "lol what idiots, why would they just pick four random things and think things are made of that"? There is actually a perfectly compelling reason why people thought that - gas (wind), liquid (water), solid (earth) are the three phases of matter, and "fire" is another common thing we commonly encounter which clearly isn't anything like any of the first three.

...as long as you tear it down on the right story beat. In the Hero's Journey model, that'd be about 1/3rd of the way through the story. Any further, and it starts feeling like a Deus Ex Machina (if that new knowledge allows the protagonist to solve a problem.)

On the other hand, if the new knowledge /causes/ problems, you can introduce it as late as you like. Brandon Sanderson's /Mistborn/ series /ends/ the first book with a reveal that the heroes' beliefs about how the setting works were flawed. Works fine!

And then there's a whole 'nother kind of timing for world-building reveals in mystery fiction.

** You could have your explanations come from an in-universe source that is proven wrong about some other claim (of a significance for you to determine) early on in the story to establish that source as fallible.

Then, having built the rules based on that source, have the magic, as described by the narrator rather than character, start to deviate from those rules. Subtle at first, but an attentive reader should start to notice. These seeds should also be laid early so it does not run the risk of looking like an asspull later. Try to get the character to notice shortly after the reader has.

** Essentially, you're trying to create an expectation that there's more to the world than the face value presentation. There's several ways to do it, I'll list them in an order of what I consider to be most effective.

1. Have the protagonist question or remain uncertain with regards to the presented facts. This is easiest and most effective tool of introducing doubt as everyone sympathizes with the MC.
2. Establish the information comes from an unreliable source. If an old man living in the middle of fuck-off nowhere tells the protagonist elves are all evil, than an average reader will pick up that this is mostly racism. This is extreme but keep in mind most institutions have their own agendas.
3. Present many possible answers using characters. If something is not understood well, there will be debate about it. Different people might believe different explanations - this would make exposition more interesting and could tie into your characterization.
4. Contradict the face value facts with your worldbuilding. This is analogous to the point above, only instead of characters articulating different possibilities, you let the world do it for you. If an oracle is said to be an all-powerful seer but their nation is losing the war, an acute reader will realize that something is afoot.

** A nice "meta" way would couple it with something that the average reader would know but the protag wouldn't.

It depends how subtle you want it to be, for example claiming that "X is obviously magical for the same reasons Gravity is" would make the reader think that something is not quite right in that statement.

** You can get a lot of mileage in the execution, with the word choice and demeanor of the various characters. If the mentor figure is teaching about elements and describes how people figured out the truth, and then the next thing they talk about sounds more like they're reciting something they heard from someone else, the contrast will heighten suspicion of the second concept.

To make it even stronger, you can play off of the characters' personalities themselves. If the MC is asking the local priest about the mysterious divine artifacts and the priest gives a non-answer with a tone that brooks no argument, readers will notice that the priest is an unreliable source, not acting as your hand to send information to the reader but as a stubborn closed-minded old man, and that can cast a measure of doubt on what he's talking about.

If you want a really strong case for doubt though, you can connect the theory to something the readers already know is false. Imagine, for instance, a teacher incorrectly saying that magic is stored in a person's blood. It's /plausible/, in a fantasy world, but he then goes on to say that the purpose of the heart is to purify magic, and your heartbeat is your body's magic resonating with the purification happening in the heart. Readers will see that as a red flag, because we all know that hearts pump blood so that it can bring oxygen to the rest of your body. Either biology works very differently here than IRL, or the professor doesn't really know what the heart actually does. From here, execution (word choice, context, etc.) can tip the scales and make it sound like the professor's wrong about hearts purifying magic, and if the reader doubts that hearts purify magic, that doubt seeps into the idea that magic is stored in the blood.

There's honestly a lot of room for you to signal that a theory shouldn't be trusted, but the line you have to straddle is getting that across to the /reader/ clearly while still sounding plausible for the person teaching it to believe. An old priest can easily hold any religious-based teaching as dogma, but you have to take a subtler hand with your open-minded mentor who's excited about stuff like the periodic table overturning classical thought (unless it's on a topic /he's/ zealous about, in which case he can be a lot more uncritical of bad theories)

** Don't worry too much about it. It's quite possible to write from a character's viewpoint which might include many unscientific beliefs, while still having the world be rational. It could come across as being something like historical fiction with characters who were not scientifically educated - i.e. most of them.

One way to do it may be to drop in things in the background, or what the character sees, which are indications that this world of yours is not 100% Earthlike. The character may be completely familiar with them (elves run the local store), or they may consider them rare enough to be noteworthy ("Saw one of the Fair Folk today in the square; they attracted quite a crowd, and not unexpectedly.") or even completely strange and inexplicable ("The necklace glowed! Like a star, like the Northern Lights, like a beacon of holy promise!"), but the point is that it's being experienced by the viewpoint character; it's not something they've heard about from another person.

If you have multiple wrong interpretations of the world, introduce multiple characters who each hold one of those views. It generates an interest in the reader as to which of them (if any) will turn out to be correct, and provides a basis for character depth - can they work alongside or be friends with those of opposing views? Are they unable to countenance any challenge to their own beliefs? In addition, are the people holding those opposing beliefs in a position of teacher, sage, or other semi-official information source for the main character? That makes it more important to the character and plot: if Parent 1 says the world is like this, but Teacher 2 says it's like that, and Wise Sage 3 says it's something else entirely, who is right? One of them? All of them? None of them? The character needs to go out into the world and find out for themselves. And perhaps they may get ahead by applying investigatory techniques from all those sources...

** I don't think there's anything wrong with having such things. It should be normally understood that of course every world will have wrong beliefs. Sometimes people will be /absolutely sure/ of their wrong beliefs. Ask any astronomer of 1000 years ago, they would have told you the Earth was the centre of the universe.

Anyone who reads fantasy should be aware that the rules /may/ be different, but that doesn't mean everything a character (or even an in-universe narrator) says is trustworthy. If you want to hint at the existence of other/deeper truths, you may do so by having someone ask a question that challenges the commonly held paradigm and receives a blatantly unsatisfactory answer, or by referencing some minor 'heretic' belief that is considered absurd but actually sounds sensible to our modern ears.

** If you're having problems with the audience not accepting the core premises of your fiction then the problem is probably with the audience. Because the fiction as a concept relies on people being able to readily accept a fantastical premise to be told a story, and if they can't do that they're placing a pretty heavy weight on the storyteller to meet their unknown and probably contradictory standards.

The best advice you can be given on this subredddit is to just plow ahead with whatever ideas make sense to you, because if rationalists find your universe rational they will interact with it, and if not rationalists are not the only audience in the universe.

This could be used to excuse basically any setting where the core premises aren't remotely consistent and are constantly contradicting each other and displaying massive differences between what we are shown vs what we are told, with none of the characters seeming to notice the disrepancy.

Most disrepancies are fine, so long as the characters in question would notice any disrepancy that is obvious to a layman. This is called a "lampshade" and can be used to move a strange phenomenon from the "this seems like the writer didn't realize he was contradicting themself" bucket to the "this is a weird thing that occurs in the setting and characters are aware that it's weird" bucket.

If the wrong explanations extend to his teacher(s) as well, you could mention that there are other fringe theories out there that generally aren't accepted but can't be proven wrong either. Just enough to allow doubt in the main theory.

** Just like in real life? ;)

I'd make it sound like a real unscientific idea, you're not wanting for inspiration. Maybe have your character think it sounds a bit odd but rationalize it away, or mirror real life institutions and movements relevant to the idea. Have some old wise man spewing profound sounding things that don't actually have any substance. If you don't want your character to pick up on that, show them having difficulty understanding what is trying to be said and not being able to work out the problem. That will show to your readers that those ideas probably aren't part of the canon of the world.

You could have it fit the [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pseudoscience#Characteristics_of_pseudoscience][characteristics of a pseudoscience]] and see if readers pick up on that as well, but a lot of those things are something you'd see in a work of fiction with magical elements anyway since writers tend not to be very scientifically literate.

If the story is engaging people will overlook that sort of thing until you get into the deep explanations, and if it's not engaging it won't matter anyway. Don't worry too much about it.

** (The replies to this have been really interesting to read!) Throwing out an idea that I didn't spot elsewhere: if it's acceptable/intended to have a disconnect between what the protagonist and reader think is true about the world, then at the very beginning there could be a short passage where the(/a, if mostly first-person, or even the future narrator if first-person) narrator introduces the world and/or protagonist, perhaps directly commenting on the misguided nature of what is thought to be true.

Third-person narration could be something like 'Far, far away, in a land where they still think that men were fashioned by gods out of clay...'; first-person narration could be 'I sigh as I remember all the things that seemed so normal to me then that seem patently absurd today', though of course that would give away the protagonist's survival, unless it's set in a moment of reflection/conversation partway through the plot and/or right before a climax, to which the plot catches up and then carries the protagonist along in another life-risking.

** I'd start out (it sounds like your character is in an educational institution where this would be applicable) by having the character attend a lecture in which one of the teachers outright /tells/ the class that what they are teaching is less than perfectly correct. ("Half of what is in your textbooks is wrong. However, we don't yet know which half.")

After this, present everything in terms of dialogue or opinions, so that it's clear that this is just how someone /thinks/ it works, not how it really works. (Even better, have characters disagree about how it works in minor ways - e.g. one character says it's a cat spirit while another insists it's a dog spirit, suggesting that neither can be sure). Save omniscient third-person narration for things that actually work that way in your world. (Depending on your tone, you can even have the omniscient third-person narrator point out that characters have got certain things wrong - but never (or almost never) use it to explain what the right thing is, unless the hero also finds out in a nearby scene.

** I think you will get a surprising amount of milage out of having your MC cite their sources, even in their internal monologue.

For example, instead of writing "The mage was referring to the four elements which make up all things" write "The mage was referring to the four elements which Aunt Mertle taught me make up all things" or "as anyone who went to school would know those were the 4 elements which make up all things".

This will establish the epistemological provenance your MC's common knowledge, which both foreshadowed that source being relavent later, and implies that the knowledge may not be as common or correct as the MC believes. It is not after all "word of god" exposition if it's actually just "word of Aunt Mertle, who later turns out to also think all rivers flow south", or "word of some one who probably has an agenda".

** I wouldn't be personally turned off by a story where a character stated "x was made by gods" only to be later proven wrong.

if you give hints that rational explanations are being *sought* this is probably sufficient. HPMOR has plenty of characters that believe goofy things, and in fact the world itself doesn't conform to physical rules we'd expect, but harry's pursuit of a rational explanation is sufficient.

*** Right, that's part of the struggle I was trying to describe in the OP. I don't have a character who's conveniently "rational" from the beginning with a bunch of study-based knowledge. For HJPEV, it's easy to say "that doesn't sound right" or "there's no way that's the way it works" or "that violates all principles of ______!" and we as the readers instantly know that there's now a metaphysical question: does the science prevail here, or does magic mumbojumbo override the science in this case?"

That's a lot less easy to do when your MC is a preteen going through his initial education and has no reason to distrust his teachers who are misinformed about a lot of things (just like most teachers were 300 years ago in our society).

**** can you introduce a side-character earlier on that foreshadows some dissent to the mainstream view, even if the MC doesn't follow them down the rabbit hole right away?

if there's an off comment from a Skeptic in a bar or hints of a heretic sect it sows the seeds of questioning the rules of reality we are being fed as readers.

** If you're as funny as Douglas Adams, this is what a /subjective/ third-person omniscient narrator is for: saying the smart thing (or hanging a lampshade) when it wouldn't make sense for any actual character to do so.

Come to think of it, /is/ there any ratfic in the Doug Adams narrative style? Everything I've read so far seems to keep to a third-person limited-omniscient narrative style, where "narration" is just the viewpoint character's thoughts interjected as they experience or recount a scene.

This is called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech][Free Indirect Speech]] and yes, it does seem that pretty much all ratfics use it in place of having a subjective narrative voice.

I don't know any ratfics that use it, but one of the non-ratfic webnovels I'm following has a distinct, and hilarious, narrative voice and perspective: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]]. (Note that the fic name is a pun and isn't actually referring to breasts, though the fic does indeed contain lewd content) While not a rational fic itself, it's very good at playing by a lot of the rules that rational fics do: Magic A is Magic A, everyone has a good reason for doing the things they do, the things that happen in-setting happen for reasons other than just plot convenience, etc. It follows the story of a semi-sentient monster that gains intelligence and cunning throughout the course of the story. Oh, and the worldbuilding is fantastic. I definitely recommend it.
