[[/u/alexanderwales]] wrote the defining piece about how I approach any DC universe work, and now I can't approach it at all.

In the new trailer, it seems Batman clearly articulates Wales's Lex Luthor's primary concern: Superman is an existential threat to humanity, and must be destroyed. This motivating factor is explicitly stated in the newest movie trailer, and is explicitly stated in Metropolitan Man.

Yet, it is obvious that is where the two diverge. While Lex daftly maneuvers around the Kryptonian in the fan fiction, it is obvious that Lex Zuckerberg and Batman only know how to use force. They will not find out Superman's weaknesses by probing at the edge of his powers. They will attempt to destroy him by (1) building a better batsuit and when that fails (2) making an even more powerful existential threat. Batman will switch to Superman's side to defeat this Big Bad along with the help of Wonder Woman.

That is, the power balance will be changed and /the side that can punch harder will win/.

God. It could be a good movie, too. It could have a good script and good action and not be as dark-and-edgy as its going for... but Metropolitan Man will always be in the back of my mind saying "this is dumb. hey. this is dumb."


** The truly shameful thing is that they had two sensible paths they could have chosen. Either take the Metropolitan Man route, and write something that /isn't/ dumb, or knowingly, openly write something dumb, something where your brain can tune out while some neat nonsense action scenes play. And instead they chose to do the latter dressed up as the former, and, as is often the case, the refusal to specialize causes efficiency to hit rock bottom.

*** I think one thing may be just the nature of film: it's an extremely emotional medium. Batman can't be driven by cold calculation. Lex can't be driven by calculation. Batman must be motivated by visible anger- something you can see on the actor's face. Lex has to be motivated by greed. In fact, I'd put money on him literally being told to his face in the movie that he is greedy.

**** Just because film is an emotional medium doesn't mean that the characters have to be driven by simple emotions. We could have seen this from Batman's point of view, the destruction wrought by Superman even as he battled Zod. The casual, offhand, collateral damage. We see and understand his fear. Then he has to be pleasant to the existential threat, whilst planning his defeat.

Of course this would mean that you'd have to completely change the genre from comic book beat'em up to character driven thriller. You might have one big fight at the end for the movie's sake with batman going through a mad scramble of more and more desperate gambles. But you don't want to fail to take out the planet-killer.

(Thinking out loud) Though I guess you could have Superman untouched and merciful at the end if the fight (now in the middle of the movie). If you wanted to try and get as close to canon situations at the end, Bruce and Lex may have originally been working together (with separate cell structures in case one is compromised) but when their last ditch efforts prove fruitless, Bruce realises that it's better to have the Superman on your side, while Lex doubles down and can't handle the risk he poses. Bruce gets proved right as the world needs Supes to protect against some huge alien attack, just as Lex attacks again (unfortunate timing) and Batman has to take care of one problem while Supes deals with the other. The movie is not so much about Superman as it is about how Bruce and Lex react to him, Supes is the force-of-nature from Greek play. This way we get to focus on the human emotions rather than whatever Superman feels.

******** Movie Ozy plan is actually kinda better than the original comic book plan IMO. Less convoluted, comick-y, 70-year-ish tentacle monster invasion-y... That the presented enemy is (fundamentally) human reinforces the other message of the movie about the trouble humans have with coordination among themselfes.

Though as to your argument of "not well set up" - well its been a bit but the tentacle monsters arent set up at all either IIRC, and there is some foreshadowing in the movie.

I think the formula can be expanded to

[the best from what much larger online communities have to offer] ruins [work of a much smaller group of professional writers]

- Tvtropes makes it hard to ignore how repetitive and poorly written general flicks are;
- SCP makes most of horror films look boring;
- the best of fanfics make the canon scripts look underwhelming.

The effect worsens when the producers are being lazy or afraid to create something new. Both Batman's and Superman's frenchises are 80 years old by now, they should be sent to a [[http://imgur.com/lc0EJUm][retirement home for fictional characters,]] not get new blockbusters every several years.

Nolan has been working miracles with the initially bad source material that's the Batman franchise. But I think the series that he's essentially been working with for half of his career would've been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_%28film%29][much greater]] if the filming industry had better working patterns for discovering successful, yet original long-lasting ideas instead of repeatedly falling back to older ones (e.g. Spider-Man and X-Men are only 20 years younger).

#+begin_quote
  Due to the popularity of 1632 early on and the mass of Fan Fic Eric Flint has had to institute guidelines on the population of Grantville and the makeup of its residents as of the Ring of Fire. He's got it down to a list of every person in small town including their associations to everyone in the series. To use one of these persons in a story requires the approval of Flint or more likely Grantville Gazette editors Huff and Goodlett. However Flint is not opposed to these short stories upsetting his plan, and instead would like to use them to enrich the series, and perhaps take it in a new direction.

So I was wrong to say fanfiction "of any kind," but to me something isn't really fanfic if the original author has to sign off on it. For example, the Star Wars expanded universe novels shouldn't be equivocated with the "actual" fanfic of Star Wars that exists. Not because of quality reasons or anything, just to reduce confusion.

But this was only because there were so many people writing stories that if every one of them created OCs, you'd end up with a small mining town that had a population of millions. These restrictions weren't in place in the beginning when the Gazette was first published.

***** PLCD leverages time-travel in strategic planning. The primary advantage of PLCD is acausal reinforcement. The original term was "Preston-Logan Cannon", which is defined as "the gun I'm going to buy/build and aim at you once I get back to my time machine after this battle."

The tactics were developed in 1988 by Bill Preston and Theodore Logan of San Dimas, California. Their version of the doctrine involved stable time-loops which allowed for acausal trade with their future selves. It also required them, at one point, to reinforce an enemy - but that was done in order to lull their less-savvy opponent into a false sense of complacency in order to not endanger bystanders.

/Branches/ uses an iterated timeline cosmology. This opens up a much wider variety of tactics, but requires the sacrifice of hypothetical and alternative timelines in order to secure their resources and information.

***** Angular momentum is not conserved. The astronauts navigating the ship head-first reach out to the walls and push towards their legs, which would add energy to their rotation in a "leaning-back" direction. The weightless center transitioning to the centrifugal spokes was very cool, though I bet if they actually showed the transition, they would ignore Coriolis forces.

The ridiculous-definition video chat has no interface and Cisco is branded in the upper right corner of the screen.

Pictures from Sojourner are constructed on the screen as jumbled overlapping views into the actual image that are then reassembled. This was particularly pointless; the next one actually had some use in pacing of the scene.

The hex editor Johansen uses to examine the non-image sent to the ship does not include an ASCII view, when an ASCII pane is a virtual standard, in every hex editor since Adam. She is able to identify it as "not an image file" simply looking at the hex. Then, when the plaintext file is opened (how can she open it without knowing what it is?), it types itself out on screen with formatting.

The spacewalk to put the bomb on the lock door would at least involve a tether and carabiner, instead of the 6DOF thriller-level intensity that was displayed (a dive straight into the spinning spokes of the grav ring?). I don't think a spacewalk would have been necessary at all.

The Iron Man scene was created for the movie wholesale (it was mentioned as a /joke/), and would be fatally dangerous as Watney admits in the book. Angular momentum is not conserved during this stunt either; he punches a hole in the glove of his suit and holds it out to his side, and does not turn into a whirling dervish as would actually happen. Torque has been beaten bloody and bruised in this movie.

Lewis, the /Commander,/ would not risk herself personally to retrieve Watney when she needs to be coordinating the operation over radio. Beck was the one who tethered out to Watney in the book.

When Watney and Lewis are getting wrapped in the tether, pulling each other closer as though they were trying to kiss through their helmets (I ship it), AM is similarly not conserved, as their rotation should speed up when their distance decreases.

And finally...

THERE IS NO SOUND IN SPACE! Silent space in exterior shots and the limited ambient sound inside your helmet in POV shots is such a nice effect, but no.

This is one of the reasons that I've always hated kryptonite. If the weakest Superman stories are something like, "Look how hard Superman can punch! Can he punch hard enough to destroy that thing? Between Superman and the villain, who is the harder puncher?" then kryptonite is just "Look at this drama that happens when Superman can't punch so hard anymore!" Basically, a failure mode for Superman stories is that they're about Superman being strong, and the solution to that is to take away his strength, which you do with kryptonite. So kryptonite usually indicates a weak story, because it's about punching things instead of better questions (like a vigilante's place in a system of law and order, or how to be good, or the need to balance altruistic sacrifice against personal fulfillment).

** Obviously, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it seems likely that this could be explained as point-in-time difference. In MM, Luthor's endgame was still force -- make a Kryptonite bullet, shoot Superman in the face after weakening him. In BvS, the endgame is kill him with armor. The difference is that MM focuses on the investigation, whereas BvS (presumably) starts after the investigation is over. Which is reasonable, since the very first thing that Batman always does when a new hero shows up is figure out how to put them down if it becomes necessary.

The story is based on an actual comic. In it, an old Batman uses various distractions to get Superman so distracted that Green Arrow can shoot him with a Kryptonite arrow. The missile, the tank, the armor -- they aren't meant to beat him, they're meant to get him in position and distracted enough not to hear Ollie getting set up and/or dodge the shot. I'm sure Batman took some satisfaction in kicking Superman around, but it was still fundamentally a distraction.

The trailer I saw had Doomsday showing up, but didn't say that Luthor built him. Is that confirmed elsewhere?

Edit: also, MM Luthor's force ending was force along the line of doing surgery with a scalpel vs. a mallet. In the end, it was Luthor's many contingencies that gave him the window with which to apply said force. As opposed to the open combat type setting chosen by batman and luthor in the new VS movie

Superman carries the ability to exert forces exceeding the destructive potential of most nuclear weaponry, while also being as fast as sound (at minimum) and human sized AND flight capable. Trying to outforce something like that, outside of the realm of fictional convention is catastrophically idiotic and doomed to fail. The available data of what Superman could do should've led any sensible person to the conclusion that we should be very nice to our altruistic boy-in-blue overlord.

Edit: In addition, creating anything biological (specifically something with its own evolving thought directives aka the ability to make its own decisions) that could come close to matching Superman's force is idiotic. There's no way to guarantee the compliance of a being you design to out-adapt anything in its way. The biological structure of such a thing would mean that you should discard any non-magical mind control schemes. And if you don't trust the alien who saved the world and killed his own people to protect your race, and who has never shown any ill will towards humanity, why would you trust your little test tube, aggression driven doomsday baby?

And displaying the force countermeasures indicates your hostility to a being that could find you and kill you almost instantaneously. Hence making it a dumb idea, outright, unless you had absolute faith in Superman's unwillingness to harm you. And, again, it's stupid to rely on that, when he closely resembles a human, with human ways of thinking, enough that you could never say for sure that he would spare you after your attempts to murder him.

That's mostly what the first third of /Metropolitan Man/ is about, and it's a pretty classic Lex Luthor plot because it allows the writer to tie an opening scene of heroism into the larger conflict. (Superman saves the crew of a space shuttle, Lex Luthor is seen maniacally wringing his hands in the background.)

It's one thing to have anecdotal evidence that Superman can shrug off a shotgun blast to the chest, but that doesn't mean that he couldn't be killed by several tons of TNT exploding in his face.

Hence why I find the idea of someone being able to control it fairly unlikely. That's also the result of seeing this sort of trope in movies too many times, where someone creates something that ends up being too strong/too out of control and it has to be stopped.

I accept Superman's existence because he /exists/. Were I part of the movie's world, before I heard of him, I would've rejected the very thought of a human shaped being able to do these kinds of things, as that isn't consistent with anything we've learnt about the laws of physics in the world, which the Superman movieverse resembles in most ways, minus a few extra aliens.
