Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Recently a magic system has been rolling around my head and the ideas for it have kinda dried up.

The general idea is that as you train whatever part of yourself it grows. I think I have a good idea of how the body grows in the magic system but I wanted to apply that to the mind.

So far I have a couple rankings as this would be a xianxia. The general theme is acceptance/denial of certain traits as they grow. Managing yourself so you don't grow crazy.

Fearless/fearful-whether or not you can accept your fear as it grows. Basically because all things in your mind grow you have to either remove all fear from yourself, accept all your fears, or cultivate specific fears that you can handle. This would be the cultural first step but you can do them in any order.

Emotional/emotionless-pretty much a rewrite of fear. As emotions grow you either need control, removal, or acceptance. Also pretty excited to write characters with built in flaws because either way is pretty messed up.

Truthless/truthful-acceptance or denial of your personality traits. Attempting to mold yourself into an ideal or just be. Probably the weakest of the three I have so far. Not very well defined in how or what to do to achieve either. I think it's probably okay to be very undefined just because it's so wishy-washy in real life as well.

Faithless/faithful-a self consistent belief system or pure nihilism. It's pretty extreme just because if you have two conflicting beliefs that grow powerful then it will inevitably lead to a mental break. Probably the one I'm most comfortable with. Very excited about writing it. So many diverse ways of thinking that are explicitly a part of every single character.

That's all I got and I think I want 5 total ranks. Also any world building thoughts related to this stuff would be really cool.

Thanks in advance!!

*** I have a setting with a similar magic system.

It has certain similarities to xianxia. Many spiritual approaches to magic share concepts with Daoism and Buddhism. There's also focus on internal and other types of martial arts. However, there are plenty of practitioners whose perspective and practices more closely resembles the athleticism/martialism of the ancient Greeks, Persians, Vikings, Meso-Americans, etc.

The general idea is that the abilities of organisms, particularly humans, are limited more by time, effort, attitude, and creativity rather than more built-in biological factors. Magic permeates the entirety of existence, but most of its potential remains untapped. This has factored into how life has evolved from the start, creating many unique environmental resources and dangers.

Humans by far are the best species at consciously working with magic. In theory, magic can be used to enhance any physiological trait. In practice, it's not easy to do so. There are individuals who can toss around and rip grown men apart like they're made of straw, but that takes years of careful, rigorous study and excruciating, dangerous practice. The drawbacks you listed are similar.

Superhuman practitioners like that always suffer from symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Their religion is usually their main source of psychological reinforcement in the best of cases. In others, they may basically be living the life of an intelligent, anhedonic shrew, living for their own survival and the fleeting experience of consumption, often of drugs or darker fixations. Most practitioners engage with magic in moderation for these reasons.

Users will be confronted with their own physical and mental shortcomings constantly and they can choose to react in a variety of ways like what you laid out.

I wanted to do something like that but it doesn't work out with the setting I want (if the body/mind grows with use and this effects genes then the effect on evolution gets into speculative sci-fi and I want to write fantasy lol) so I relied on the many worlds/tiered worlds trope. That way I can insert a particular earth culture to contrast with the result of the cultural effect that the magic has on the setting.

Personally I'm super interested in mental abnormalities that grow with time. Stuttering that gets ever worse leading to an inability to speak. One emotion being dwelled upon so often that it consumes them. Pointing out logical inconsistency being a LETHAL weapon. Seems ripe with so many cool af ideas.

***** The ability to logic-bomb humans is an interesting one. Of course, even computer programs stall at worst when forced into logical inconsistencies or loops. The mental equivalent of stalling would be a deep trance state which would likely leave someone vulnerable to a follow-up lethal method. Human minds are good at not being stalled by their own irrationality.

Many modern computer programs are also good at figuring out a roundabout way to continue functioning in the face of unique situations, cognitive dissonance can cause stress, but they keep ticking. However, in both cases, while they remain active, that doesn't mean their thoughts and actions aren't perverse and indirectly destructive when compared with what they're actually supposed to do.

****** The idea would be that all mental aspects grow so beliefs would as well. If a person has a belief in x for 1000 years and that reinforcement is constant then the stress induced by it being disproven would fuck you up big time. The magical equivalent of a stress induced heart attack.

Of course the actual effect of this is that everyone is trained in a specific set/system of beliefs that has little to no inconsistency. Something either passed down or worked on and verified constantly.

The next level would be that individual experience breeds very individual beliefs so without careful consideration you can fall into specific thought patterns that can trip you up if an opponent is perceptive enough. All of this would be the looooong long game tho. More politics than fighting.

This. Magic would harden or alter beliefs such that they grow. Plenty of people can believe directly contradictory things for their entire lives. Just because they don't think about them at all. In this magical world if you have an incorrect belief then with time and at a certain point it will become a part of your way of thinking. If two beliefs contradict then two parts of your mind can self destruct. As you think about the opposing views they grow stronger creating a loop of stress as each beliefs reinforces itself. A big part of the world would be pruning and teaching ways to avoid/defuse situations like that.

It's all so cool to me.

**** I honestly didn't even consider how genetics would interact with magical body improvement. Bloodline abilities and the rabbit hole of world building that entails. Don't even know if I want to go down that road honestly. The main theme of the book would be the common pitfalls in the path of every human and contrasting the different paths that arise. Faith vs nihilism. How all humans deal with the same problems and the different people that come out of the crucible.

It would fuck up the theme if they were all different from the start.

**** Weird idea inspired from that topic in the context of xianxia, but a cultivation path in a xianxia story based on parthenogenesis, where all the cultivation you do is stored until you give birth to an improved clone of yourself, would be bizarre and interesting. It'd focus on a character who wants to see a vessel for their values grow, rather than their own individual strength grow, which is kind of the core perspective typical xianxia takes. So you could switch the protagonist after every (re)birth to the new one after a short period of parenthood of the clone that leaves the protagonist consistently vulnerable. The massive subversion of xianxia tropes, when the story is about "cultivating your offspring" rather than "yourself," as well as the typical "protag has a harem strung out across centuries" deal being bizarrely applied and ignored with asexual reproduction.

I'd have to read the supplementary links on identity the bloke who's doing "There Is Nothing To Fear" bought up the other day in his discussion thread on this subreddit, since the main character of that sees his identity in such a manner anyway.

*** Hmmm... your /culture/ would have a big influence on your choices there. For example; consider the stereotypical British minor nobility. Come what may, he keeps a stiff upper lip, and refrains from falling into emotion. So, people from that culture would - more often than not - fall on the 'emotionless' side of things. (One who fell into the "accept-my-emotions" side would be a bit of a rebel).

But that implies that there may be some known psychological weaknesses of entire /cultures/. And cultures can be recognised in all sorts of ways. So, it may (for example) be very well-known to the people of Valley X that, if you spot a wizard in a top hat and a monocle, you can kill him by quickly yelling "People need emotions to feel human!" (or something).

But what is humanity tho?

I've haven't put a lot of thought into an old culture just because it would mostly be for the purpose of having a familiar setting. The aesthetic would be earth like but the bones of any culture in the world would be constructed by the magics effect on the people.

Bigger stratification between levels of power. More isolated because exposure to different ideas can be legit harmful. Disdaining of any outward emotional display because it's evidence of a lack of control. Some lack of fear so a wildly eclectic society without fear of social ostracizing.

The biggest one would be the incredibly sectarian (arising from the need to form a self consistent ideology and how that essentially works like a cult if you spread it) and internally hierarchical nation states. 1000s instead of 100s of countries. Leading to constant power struggles.

***** Eh, that's fair. I was only using a caricature of an old culture to have a familiar setting to hang my points on, anyhow.

But the basic idea is valid for all cultures. A Wizard from culture A will probably have certain culture-specific biases in his thoughts and ideas - ideas which are safe in /his/ culture. But the people from Culture B, in that other valley over there... well, they probably know /exactly/ which ideas would be most harmful to the Culture A wizards, and how to compress them down into a sentence or two. (Similarly, Culture A knows how to take down Culture B's wizards).

Depending on the relations between the cultures, this can lead to interesting practices. For example, let's say that Culture A and Culture B are trying to set up peace talks (they both agree that the war's gone on way too long). Of course, at some point they must meet in person. Being sensible folks, they agree to meet without wizards (it's amazing what a hostile wizard can do when he has all the enemy rulers in front of him...). And to enforce this, they start the meeting by yelling wizard-killing insights at each other before they even get close...

Of course, there's one type of wizard that these insights /don't/ work on, and that's the Rebel Wizard. Rebel Wizards make at least one choice in their basic setup that runs /contrary/ to their cultural norms. Now, that doesn't imply that they're /antagonistic/ towards their culture - often quite the contrary. And if they've flipped on the /correct/ choice, then they're immune to the Wizard-killing phrase from the other culture over there. (But they might not be immune to Culture C's phrase, because they might not have flipped on that part of their culture). Unfortunately, the Rebel Wizard might very well be vulnerable to their own side's wizard-killing insight...

****** I don't envision the logic bomb/killing phrase working like this at all. Makes more sense that this would be a highly individual thing. In the sense that any culture would have to find a belief system without a logic bomb. A particular way of thinking without obvious flaws. Or they wouldn't exist.

Seems more likely that it would be a mind game played long term between wizards. I.e. make wizard A believe x through extremely precise gaslighting. Then wait for that idea to have power/taken root in his head. Then disprove it for a stunning blow in combat. 99% of these things wouldn't be lethal simply because every wizard knows how to deal with these exact logic bombs. It would be big character defining defects that get shoved in his face that would kill him.

The cultural aspect is necessarily somewhat stable and not self destructive imo. At least in the long term.

****** Setting up the talks in the first place would be terrifying. Imagine receiving a letter from an enemy nation, it could contain a request for peace or it could be an assassination plot where the contents of the letter highlight contradictions in the reader's beliefs. This turns letters into bombs which must be carefully disarmed, perhaps by preparing counter arguments to defuse predicted contradictions (which can only be discovered by trying to contradict your beliefs which is akin to suicide) and you might have “poison testers” which instead of eating food to see if it's poisoned before their employer tries it, read their letters to see if it's an attack or not, courtiers become powerful military units and a dangerous job to do. Also, considering this is about ideas as opposed to specifically words you could use paintings, poems, songs, etc. To equally as lethal effect, it also would have an affect on the opinions surrounding censorship and the way information is consumed. Certain pieces of artwork could be used like Trojan horses, you create something which seems normal or conformative and then you wait for it to spread amongst the populace and then “activate” it by revealing its true meaning and weaponising the idea which has been reinforced since they first saw it, like a virus it hijacks their belief system and makes it no longer self-consistent e.g. imagine if someone's entire belief was based around love and they believed the love preached by the song “you're beautiful” by James blunt to be something that reinforced their belief/was the same as their belief and so it becomes part of what grows that belief, then the artist reveals it is a song about stalking and is not true love, that would poison that belief, like a disease which causes the immune system of the body to attack itself, the belief would attack itself?

Once the letter has been checked for contact poisons. ...you know, maybe having some clerk read the letter to the King would be safer. When there are no Wizards within earshot).

This reminds me of the /Spine of the Cosmos/ from Starslip Crisis. An artwork that causes anyone who sees it to become the slave of the owner...

******** I love the idea of people being engaged in a fight and the villain saying STOP! and the heroes are polite enough to stop and listen to him explain the context of his painting haha :) I was more thinking when it comes to the art and stuff being used as a weapon you could inform them about its context through its use e.g, if there was a murderer who killed someone and leaves a symbol of an animal e.g. a goat, a crab, etc. Then you can inform people of the context/meaning with how you use it, you could kill one person during a certain zodiac period and leave your calling card as the animal associated with that season. Or perhaps it's based off of a famous legend from their homeland and by painting an abstract version of that legend it remains a mystery until someone learns of the legend in which case the meaning of the painting becomes obvious, perhaps it's one of the famous exploits of the character who painted it, whilst this example isn't about a painting I think the tridam ultimatium used by renfi on Geralt is a good example from the Witcher books, I think it was in “The Last Wish”.

*** I am unfamiliar with xianxia, so I think I've made a bunch of incorrect assumptions about your magic system, I would love to learn more about it and correct my misunderstandings since this sounds really interesting. Is growth of the mind abstract growth (e.g. you become increasingly better at learning, your learning is like a skill in a video game levelling up?) and is that growth measurable? (E.g. IQ is used to measure intelligence, stat points in a video game or tabletop role-playing game measure strength, intelligence, etc. Is there some form of statistical measurement that is used to compare the level of acceptance of fear currently to level needed to become Fearless/fearful?) or is growth physical (e.g. your brain increases in size and in order to stop it outgrowing your skull and making your head pop you must prune things you find less useful or undesirable e.g. a fear(s) and as you continue to grow you continue adding useful skills to your brain capacity whilst decreasing space allocated to useless/detrimental things which increases the efficiency of used skull capacity and brain material, 100% being enlightenment or something along those lines?) also, is growth linear or is there the possibility of demotion? (E.g. what happens if someone fearless develops a fear? Do they move down a ranking?) does progress happen forwards (e.g. body and mind growth) but not backwards? (e.g. you neglect training and so growth of body atrophies or mind atrophies? Is it like a video game where once you learn a skill or level up you don't need to maintain it, it is a permanent upgrade?). Are beliefs used like a weapon? (E.g. you convince/gaslight someone about a strong belief they hold so that they mentally break and combat takes the form of debates? (If so is it like a combat scenario and they talk during it and the strength of their argument against their opponents argument determines the strength of their abilities or is consistency of beliefs only relevant to current internal belief system and can't be overturned/go against that system? Or is combat really abstract like Ace Attorney (or death parade (anime)) but the lawyers are supernatural and truth is decided by the majority therefore convincing someone of your belief makes it true e.g. claiming your client is innocent makes it true if the jury believes it and the crime is undone or history rewrites itself so that whoever you pin the blame on actually committed the crime and all their memories are rewritten by this belief of the majority so they believe they did too?) or are they used more abstractly like a sword made of your belief? And is that thing a singular belief(e.g. a sword of gravity, which you can mentally control the weight of and direction the gravity pulls by changing your belief about how gravity behaves or it's relationship with the sword?), belief about multiple things(a projectile magic which combines belief in air resistance and combustion to create a ball of fire which can have it's air resistance change which impacts the other belief e.g. greater air resistance = more air = more fuel for combustion so it grows? Or are the beliefs uncoupled e.g. just because air resistance increased/decreased the speed of projectile changes but not the scale of combustion? Or does that vary?) general belief (e.g. you believe the world is a certain way and your belief about the world manipulates it? If you like that kind of magic system I recommend a manhua called Amentia which has delusioners who bend/distort reality to fit their delusional view of the world or realise/materialise their imagination and awakeners who remove these distortions to set the world back to how it was originally, they both work to make the world “how it should be” and have conflicting opinions about what that is) or possibly a combination of the above?) Sorry about all the questions, I just really want to understand your magic system and the genre of novel it is within! :)

**** Giving a couple core ideas to cut through the questions. Soft magic no hard numbers. Growth is based off of semi traditional training. Spending time learning will incrementally increase the ability to learn with diminishing returns. No linear growth. You can both intentionally and unintentionally train the mind. Things that you use constantly would consequently grow with time. Coordination, intelligence, speaking ability, and others. These are slight increases over years of training/use. It is virtually impossible to become a super genius within even a century (immortality is common tho). Fearless/fearful and all the other ranks are signs of personal introspection and choice. They are a lifelong journey and commitment to achieve a state of being. Someone fearless is someone working to completely stop any growth of his fears. He can develop new fears and fight against them. Things can definitely atrophy with disuse. That's probably the primary way to defeat a fear. You list off a lot of ways to use beliefs and the first one was correct "you convince/gaslight someone about a strong belief they hold so that they mentally break" combat would still be pretty physical but attacking the ideology of your opponent would be another way to attack. Strictly mental effects and attacks no mind controlling reality.

I want to have the ultra high end of some abilities be somewhat external and cool but still directly related to the mind. Telepathy for the high end of social skills, mind scapes for imagination, precognition for intelligence (open to more suggestions for this), complete awareness within 100s of ft of surroundings for proprioception, and completely perfect recall for memory.

I'd love more suggestions for ranks and high end abilities. I don't intend this to be dbz or go style magic. This is more accompanying the two others. Trying to bombard the reader with cool shit.

***** Thanks, I think I understand a lot better now! :) For the intelligence precognition is it that the person sees the future or is it that they see the possible paths the future can take and they can steer it to which ever one they want so long as they have the capabilities to steer it in that way? An example of the former I think would perhaps be a crystal ball or the predictions like the world ending in 2012 (if that was the future that actually occurred. Actually, can the future deviate or is this a deterministic world in which even if you try to change the future it ends up the same?) whereas the latter might be the yokai called the Kudan (or atleast it's interpretation in a show called In;Spectre) where you see the future as paths and so long as you have the power to realise that future you can choose to guide reality down that path so long as someone with the same power doesn't try to intervene? Is the mindscape imagination ability, the ability to create an imaginary landscape or does it have other application? Is it a place that can be entered at will like the painting world from dark souls or is it something you can force people to enter like the reality marbles from fatestaynight or is it an dimension you can retreat into like the dream in trinity 7 or is it a purely mental feat that enables you to create a world to practise your other skills e.g. creating a memory palace like the one from Sherlock (atleast in the TV series version I think the library was a purely fictional location) or are mindscapes recreations or distortions/blends of real world locations e.g. the memory palaces created in memory competitions can often be multiple places/walked paths slapped together if you run out of space to store things, I think that's mentioned in a book called “moonwalking with Einstein” which is an interesting read if you're curious about impressive mental feats and feats of memory, or are the mindscapes much smaller scale e.g. instead of a sprawling memory palace it's more like a roman room (another memory technique)? I presume that the mindscape isn't for memory since you have perfect recall for memory, the examples about Visio-spatial memorisation is mostly to explain the differences between my guesses with examples :) is the mindscape something that is used like a death room that people can wander into or get invited into but can't get out of like in the Dungeons and Dragons curse of stradh campaign? By the way, are you planning on releasing this work or keeping it private? If you release/post it please let me know, I'd love to read it! :) Sorry about the barrage of questions and guesses again

****** For precognition it would be speculation based on absurd amounts of knowledge and intelligence. No actual precognition lol. Accurate because of the intelligence of the predictor only. Processing enough data to determine the outcome of something. Predicting a coin flip because you can grasp every way it interacts with the air and it's trajectory type stuff. But on a larger scale. Varies with skill level.

The mind scapes would be personal mental abilities. If they were also a telepath then they could project the stimulus but the core of the ability is just that. Recreating the stimulus of the real world within your mind wholesale. The size, detail, and coherence of the mind scape would depend on the skill level. The use would probably be a ability to experience something without it happening to you. Training only in your mind type stuff.

If I do release it it would be published but I don't see that happening for a while (years) yet as I'm going to be working full time. Writing is just a hobby and it very possible that I'll get bored and abandon this. I have 4 half finished books the longest is 287 pages and the shortest is 15. I periodically come back to each of those main four and write new stuff all the time that I scrap.

** Take a D&D setting, roughly working on RAI core rules but with house rules that unfetter fighters, rogues and similar characters from having to seem plausibly non-magical even at 20th level. (For fighters this looks like the Tome of Battle and/or fighters who have acquired 30 fighter bonus feats by 10th level. For skill-focused characters it's a more complex system of making skill DCs scale more shallowly so that superhuman feats like "hide from someone you are currently grappling" is possible for a stealth specialist around level 15.) Stipulate that while 'level' is a heavily-simplified abstraction, XP is real, not as discrete points but in the sense that /experience/ is a metaphysical fluid gained by roughly the things that D&D grants XP for, and gaining more of it makes you more powerful in a curve resembling the level progression.

Then, apply an extra constraint: [[https://plain-dealing-villain.tumblr.com/post/178204587282/the-divine-shells][the universe is split into level bands]]. Anyone who reaches 6th level disappears from the level 1-5 world and appears in the 6-10 world. The same with someone who reaches 11th, 16th, and epic. Conversely, if you are born in the level 6-10 world you will be a 6th level character by the time you reach adulthood.

Given that preamble: what does life look like in the higher-band worlds? Trying to crowdsource this to get more perspectives and nudge the DM into making the setting more complete.

**** I have doubts they'd be more post-scarcity than us; they have easier access to basics, but also far more danger. For example, one of the other setting features is that the banding effects don't apply to dragons; dragons go wherever they like. So even in the 16-20 band, you see wandering dragons of CR 30 (maybe higher), which takes a hell of a task force to put down. And it's still pretty hard to get from level 16 to 20, about as hard as from 1 to 5 in the lowest band. (So, 1 per 10,000 or less, IIRC).

******* This is sorta an area where mechanics run afoul of world building. 5e is dominated by the action economy. I'm sure a CR 30 dragon could stomp a standard party of 16th level adventurers (Klauth nearly killed my party of 5 and we were all level 15), but in a world where everyone is a 16th level adventurer, the idea of a four-person party is obsolete.

Any time the dragon attempts anything overtly dragon-y (barring the occasional exception), every character present will have viable combat options on their initiative count. If the dragon were to attack a village, they'll get swarmed.

That said, there are also evil characters or characters who will willingly align themselves to the dragon and rounding out combat in interesting ways is part of the DMs job. Whether these villainous high-level characters are also common enough to disrupt society or not is another conversation, but I think by and large, post-scarcity societies are within the realm of possibility.

I will say, going 3.~ is really interesting in terms of casters. With all the various books, there's bound to be some crazy combos and how those effect society is a fun/horrifying thought. I don't think a caster can metamagic a 9th level spell (I think meta-d spells use a higher spell slot in 3.5). This probably helps somewhat, but you're not wrong about a properly prepared caster with 9th level spells being a force of nature, especially if they happen to be an ancient dragon besides.

What's access to antimagic look like amongst the general populace? Contingency? I imagine these have to be much more common in these 16+ bands than the lower bands, but at the same time I can't help but think that the laws surrounding the general populace's magic use are much more robust.

Friends and family would have to coordinate levelling up to jump worlds at the same time, and willingness to level up would be a major factor in social relationships.

In higher-level worlds, there would likely be factions that want to limit the number of newcomers or even get rid of them entirely; they would have security forces devoted to hunting down people who reached their world by levelling up, and shibboleths to identify people who were born there. People who actively try to level up would likely be people who are highly motivated and without considerable social or economic attachments; such types might be stereotyped as unscrupulous, dangerous, amoral in their pursuit of power, etc. In other words, they would be the kind of people who are willing to uproot themselves in search of better opportunities, like immigrants, and they would be treated poorly as immigrants often are.

*** Is it possible to decline an ascension? Is there contact between the different realms?

If one can't decline to ascend, and there is no contact between the realms, then the whole thing is kind of doomed, and very few people will be motivated to ascend. When you boil it down, what people will work and fight for is a *comparative advantage* over their *peers*, not for an arbitrary measure of rank. If being level 5 or 10 makes you a lord of your world, but being level 6 and 11 makes you a peon again, why the hell would the average person want that?

So that leaves you with only the people who are unusually ambitious, aggressive and/or otherwise emotionally/motivationally privileged to ascend to the next world. Now, imagine a world where this subset of people continuously remove themselves from society. Whether they possess a quality that is socially cultivated or genetic, it seems inevitable that the supply in the first would will decrease. This is especially true if reaching level 6 is relatively trivial for motivated individuals, and thus they don't really have time to procreate by the time they leave.

If your worldbuilding reflects that it would be interesting. An idea is that the first world experiences an accelerating decline due to "brain drain". Another is that people are socially incentivized to have children with level 5 people.

Maybe I missed it, but what happens if you have a child in bands ≥2? Is it born at level 0, and stay in whatever band it's in, or is it born at the minimum of whatever band it's in? If it's the former, the child will be at a severe disadvantage, like a noob starting in a high level zone, and the latter, then I can see a wide appeal to ascending, as you now can have demigod children and actually build a sustainable society in higher worlds.

You can try. This will in most cases be highly hazardous to the health and sanity of everyone around you, however, so they will probably insist. At swordpoint. And in the cases where you /can/ refuse indefinitely without risk to your surroundings, you can only do it by not /using/ your power. (This is easiest for a wizard, who just has to stop casting their highest couple levels of spells; this creates the 'absent-minded ancient wizard' archetype for free, since they'll be /capable/ of casting powerful magic but mostly forget the details due to lack of practice. Contrast with a legendary soldier, who can't really stop being preternaturally buff and skilled and so doesn't get a choice. IIRC they have a tradition of sending knights off to fight dragons, which will generally either get them killed or send/ascend them on their way.)

Contact is limited but I'm not sure how much; previous iterations said that no matter could travel backwards except dragons and fey, but that got walked back and I'm not sure where the boundaries are as it stands.

Empires clash with scry-and-die tactics. Evil wizards and liches rampage across the world raiding magic shops and ambushing anyone carrying useful magic items. Powerful people are turned into pawns of even more powerful wizards with dominate person and cursed items.

Divination allows countries to see that a war will happen soon, and the stronger country goes to war immediately to prevent the weaker one from building up. Most wars end up happening for unknown reasons, armies are just suddenly teleported into city centers to butcher the population because diviners divined diveners in the future divining the war happening in the future.

If killed in combat, few people go to the afterlife anymore, and just as few get resurrected. Standard combat tactics now involve destroying or imprisoning the enemy's soul to prevent them from coming back. A defensive countermeasure is to kill oneself and liberate your own soul from your body before the enemy can take it. As a result, battles rarely take longer than about six seconds for one side to launch the surprise attack and the survivors of the other side to escape into the afterlife or teleport away if able.

Separately, this doesn't seem plausible to me. If that was likely, there wouldn't /be/ magic shops.

***** There's a variety of options, but I agree, I wouldn't have magic shops in the setting. They generally do not make sense in D&D under the rules as written, even though they're practically a staple of most D&D settings.

Magic items by commission is a possibility, but then you still have the issue of the payment itself. An evil wizard could commission a magic item, pay for it, get the item, then steal their money back, or just rob banks and use the money to buy magic items. The real problem here is the issue of items with immense value for their weight which can be easily stolen. Platinum is still worth 500 gp/lb., so not too much worse than the 16,000 gp/lb. that you'd get with something like boots of teleportation.

Keeping the items at a secret location and arranging for same-day delivery of the item after an auction is also possible, but has the same problems as items by commission and is even more dangerous. This just turns it into a simple matter of abducting the auctioneer and using a combination of torture and detect thoughts to discern the location of the items and how to access them.

In general, at this level of the game, magic items put a target on your back and aren't worth it unless you're an evil wizard or someone who wants to get ambushed by evil wizards and their minions, all bristling with powerful magic items. The key to survival here is deterrence - you need to make it not worth it to attack you, and magic items are generally an incentive rather than a deterrent.

***** Suppose pretty much all countries have at least a few hundred diviners who can use [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/contactOtherPlane.htm][contact other plane]] at least daily. The entities answering these questions have limited foresight, out to about [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm#portfolioSense][20 weeks at best]]. The diviners might ask questions like "Will we end up in a war with any other country within the next 20 weeks?". If yes, you can be assured the other country is going to know that as well. The questions are asked of various entities by various diviners to help ensure reliability.

So, now we'd ask obvious followup questions. Does the other country surrender? Does the other country get stronger, relative to us, between now and when the war starts? Do we win? The other side knows all of this as well.

One problem is that this takes surrender off the table pretty quickly. Any country which would surrender in a war has no reason to even fight you - they know they'll lose, they know they'll surrender, they might as well do that now before lots of people die and lots of important buildings and infrastructure are blown up. Those countries get gobbled up quickly and effectively get united/subjugated under the banner of some more aggressive and powerful country.

The countries that remain will be those which would never surrender, such as countries which make a precommitment to bleed their attacker dry as much as possible, to engage in a scorched earth strategy, and to unleash weapons of mass destruction if necessary.

Among these remaining countries and empires, one is likely to be the most powerful (or at least to perceive itself that way). This country may make a precommitment to attack any other country which would go to war with it in the future, or at least exercise a strategy of preemptive war whenever conditions for war in the present would be better than conditions for the war in the future. Of course, if its diviners 20 weeks in the future divine that the county will go to war, then it will go to war at that time, and then the diviners in the present will divine that and the country might go to war nearly a full year before the other country is able to build up. This may not necessarily even be limited to 40 weeks notice, and could possibly stretch endlessly into the indefinite future. If conditions in the present ever change such that this most powerful country would ever end up at war with any other country in the future, there's a good chance that that war will be declared and fought immediately.

Imagine if, in the real world, we had diviners who could tell us the future, and they said that we'd be in a nuclear war with China in 2050, and that they'd expand their nuclear arsenal 10-fold by then, with significant advances in guidance and delivery mechanisms along the way. Suppose China knows the same, and obviously begins working even faster to prepare for the war, and they have the ability to outpace our growth. As long as we're still the stronger side, we'd want to fight that war today, even if our cities get nuked, because waiting would just make things worse.

Sure. In other words, information from the future can change the present. Of course, that also means that information from the future of the future can change the future, so information from the future of the future of the future can ... you get where this is going.

So, we know that both sides can get information from the future, and that new information may change the future, and that subsequent attempts to get information about the future may reveal a different future which may change the plans for the present. However, each time this process is repeated, we learn more about the future and the subsequent changes from our expectations become smaller and smaller. Eventually, we end up in a stable timeline where updated knowledge of the future does not change the future any further. And that whole process will have already happened /in the future/. So, by the time we learn that the US and China have a nuclear exchange in the future, it means both countries already evaluated all possible options to resolve the issue and still felt there was no better alternative. If we see that happening the future, it means there's very good odds that whichever country has the relative advantage in the present will have to seize the opportunity as quickly as possible.

The fact it'd devolve into an absurd "Wacky Races but make it sci-fi" scenario is probably a selling point. And the idea that any way to tell the story in-universe would have to be by someone observing the actions "sequentially" rather than "chronologically", and temporarily handing godlike powers/comprehension to a pair of race commentators who do the storytelling aspect fits the race theme, and I also find "unimaginable power turned to minor entertainment" (like a less horrific version of "entity grants someone a monkey's paw wish") to be a fun trope.

It's happened to him 15 times before. Each time, he finds a way back to Earth; back to his family, back to his life. There's a time compression effect, so every month he spends in the other world is a day on Earth.

He gets a boon every time, a boon which is at full power in another world but still gives a little bit of a boost on Earth.

His first boons were all language-related; a boon each to hear, speak, read, write, and think in other languages. (The reading and writing one also happen to give him sign language fluency.) That's five boons.

What other boons should he take? They should all be... basic. Tutorial-level boons, if you will. I'm thinking poison resistance, disease resistance, mana-sight, and being able to eat basically anything, that's four. Maybe an Analyze/Identify active ability?

The idea of the broader story is that on his sixteenth trip, his family gets pulled in with him into basically-Carcosa, and the tutorial is over.

*** What's basically-Carcosa like? If these boons are tutorial boons, basically, then they should be prepping the protagonist for that specific environment (e.g. poison resistance is only useful if poison is common on Carcosa, and otherwise something else might be a better boon).

(Something that makes it easier to keep track of / work with other people would be good if his family is coming along on Trip 16)

**** Carcosa-like: the environ is an enormous decaying library. There's a village of humans that grow mushrooms and funguses and hunt animals that dwell in the stacks, and in every direction the (as far as the villagers know) infinite ever-changing library rolls on, by turns pristine and decrepit, inhabited by creatures that grow more arcane or horrifying or both as you travel away from the village. The books are mostly book-shaped, but some take other forms; they are, as far as anyone can tell, not ordered, but a random amalgamation of every book ever written in any possible universe. By volume, 80% terribly-written smut.

He doesn't have any knowledge about what environment he's going to be in next (and in fact doesn't know his family will be becoming along on Trip 16), so his boon selections (he does choose what they're going to be) are very general. When I say tutorial-like, I mean that they're "first tier" kinds of things. Language, yes; being able to consume rocks for nutrition, no; mind control, definitely not.

Being able to drink the stream water and eat the berries without worrying about diphtheria or solanine is generally very useful. That's why I'm thinking disease & poison resistance.

Some sort of mapping / radar skillset might be interesting! And extremely useful.

*** You know you'll be exploring a new world. So, take exploration boons.

Analyze/identify/appraisal, since you'll see so many new things. Eidetic memory, since you'll be learning so many things for the first time.

If wilderness is possible, then toxin resistance, endurance, tracking, hunting.

If civilization seems likely, then rapid language learning, "good first impression", etiquette bonus, negotiation bonus.

Almanac: stare at something and you start hearing the voice of a bored expert, describing the object/place/person encyclopedia-style to a class of young kids. It appears to be somehow an actual recording of an alien classroom. Not advised to stare at yourself in the mirror once you have this boon.

You Are Here: whenever you say or think "I'm lost," a map appears in your head. The map is filled in wherever you've been, and anywhere that's "common knowledge" for your current social group. This has weird effects when you get promoted, or adopted...

Cooking for Dummies: stare at potential food while holding a cooking tool, and a recipe pops up. If you're holding a skewer while looking at a live crocodile, you get a recipe for crocodile meat on a stick. With helpful advice on skinning the crocodile, but no advice on how to kill it...

Just Needed Tuning Up: any object you use behaves as if it's been recently cleaned and serviced, as long as the maintenance is something ordinary rather than supernatural or exotic. Doesn't fix a broken knife, but you can cut with a rusty knife like it's sharp, open a stuck door like it's been oiled, or read an ancient book like it's been cleaned of mold and dirt.

**** Rapid language learning and etiquette (pretty much the whole mundane communications suite) is definitely in the set of his first five boons.

I love the "Just Needed Tuning Up" boon. It's especially funny since he's an engineer and his wife is a computer scientist, so there's a lot of room for "it works as soon as you call tech support" style jokes in the real world.

I could not possibly do Almanac any way other than Steve Irwin. Now that I think of that, I cannot possibly /avoid/ doing Almanac, can I? Which feels exclusive with Analyze/Identify/Appraisal.

*** Some sort of boon to ease first contact situations would be useful. Something like the wear-a-lab-coat-and-hold-a-clipboard combination, but in magical boon form, so that people don't immediately do a double take when they see you and your clothes.

Along those same lines, some enhanced empathy could be useful. Knowing what other people are saying is great and all, but knowing roughly what they're intending and what they think of you with greater precision is quite useful for survival, even if it only comes in the form a gut feeling.

Looking at it from the hierarchy of needs perspective, some sort of way to get crappy shelter in a box would be nice. Some sort of extremely localised air conditioning, perhaps? A few degrees towards the optimal at all times.

Some way to keep inventory without a backpack would be nice. Perhaps existing pockets are expanded slightly when on the characters person, until checked by another person.

Alongside the air conditioning, some sort of air purifying or psuedo gas mask would be useful to mitigate horrendous atmospheric conditions or being trapped underwater/underground.

After a few isekais I'm imagining our character would enjoy something to point him to his destination. An internal compass of any sort would be nice, really, since having a map on him at all times can't be guaranteed. Perhaps as an homage it could be an internal map that fills itself out as he travels to places? Difficult to abuse as eidetic memory but still nice quality of life, and somewhat useful.

Danger sense, even if it's something along the lines of 'this is bad' when there is something bad in plain sight, would be very nice. Also leads to some pleasant moments where you look into the sky, think "oh, it's about to rain", and then feel the danger sense go off and panic.

Something that allows for easier learning or memory would be an early pick for me personally, at least, given that the effects could potentially get better over time. Easier ability to retain and change physique for a similar reason.

Finally, probably general intelligence/charisma/durability enhancements for better problem solving and not-dying-ness.

Not sure how many of these are what you're looking for, given that I'm spitballing a little, but I hope it helps!

*** Putting you first /five/ boons towards what's basically one slightly stronger boon seems absurd. Maybe you'd spend 5 boons in a row like that once you already have 10 boons, but the first ones should really be widely different stuff that's useful if you don't expect to be isekai'd again.

**** Learning to communicate takes a ton of time! He's not optimizing for what's useful after he gets back home, he's optimizing for /getting back home sooner/, and that means not spending 3 months learning to speak/understand the language fluently and then another 3 months learning how to read it well enough to start putting together a get-home plan.

And he's pretty obsessive about communication.

But it's an interesting point that he definitely did specialize pretty hard for his first five boons, and anyone he discusses the matter with might point that out, so it's worth having this discussion.

** Questions for magical researchers in a high-magic society.

1. You're part of a team that has built a high powered energy containment pentagram where the five corners rest on each of the five accessible planes, and you're pumping it full of energy. What sort of hypothesis are you testing? What's a neat experimental result?

2. What sort of experimental result would convince you to join a conspiracy to shut off magic for 1000 years?

3. What sort of device does a conspiracy of magic researchers build to shut off magic?

I have ideas for 1&2, but I'm not super satisfied with my answers so I'm leaving them out. I'd rather like if the experimental result from 1 was not the one that prompts 2. I only have half an idea what 3 looks like at all.

*** 1-As containment fails, which plane does the energy start to bleed into? Interesting if it depends on the planar background of the persons who pump in the initial energy, or if there's a pattern like "demonic energy seeks the terran plane, but heavenly energy goes equally to all five planes."

2-There's a giant comet-monster that eats magical planets and it's coming into our neighborhood. We should shut off magic until its orbit has taken it safely out of range.

Unfortunately, the comet-monster grants wishes to magic-wielding individuals, as bait. So letting everyone know /why/ magic is outlawed is terribly dangerous - every desperate person will try to trigger a wish, and help the comet-monster home in.

3-Create a race of slimes that eat magic and anyone who uses it, but dependent on the radiations of a scarce substance (mithril, orichalcum) in order to convert their stored magic and reproduce. Above-ground supplies of the reagent are limited. The conspiracy can mine and bring up more Slime Reproductive Reagent as needed to keep the slimes going, until telescopes show the Comet Doom Monster is gone.

** Human Spaceflight is complicated. I /think/ my ragtag band of superpowered people can make an air-tight vehicle with something resembling the desired delta v, and can probably avoid radiation-related dangers. I might even be able to magic up viable navigation options. But if there isn't something that would make actually attempting to fly this homemade spaceship rather miserable and unhealthy almost immediately after launch, which I have almost certainly overlooked, I would be pleasantly surprised.

Then there's all the stuff I haven't overlooked, but have been mostly ignoring: food, exercise, toilet(s), climate control...

The available powers more or less allow them to ignore the tyrany of the rocket equation, so using acceleration to simulate gravity is an option. However, the engines are human-operated, and dude's gotta do something besides sitting there powering a rocket the whole time, so in practice, the schedule I've been working with assumes maybe 200min/day at 1G, with some time spent at greater acceleration if possible, spaced out so as to not overwhelm the crew. So having everyone take care of everything during the 1G burns is probably terribly impractical.

Research suggests that rowing machines and stationary bikes should work well in 0G, and I can imagine they could come up with those even if rushing the preparations. Aiui, something weight-lifty is a good idea, and I don't know how they'd go about obtaining 0G lifting equipment, but I could maybe see a couple of the powers working as a substitute?

Eating during an engine cycle is probably a bad idea, just because of how short it is. Someone would almost certainly puke when the acceleration changes. The most experienced people on this trip have dealt with 0G eating before, and I expect that experience probably transfers (how teachable the essentials are is another matter). But that they /can/ no what needs done doesn't mean /I/ know what realistic options they have. Unless someone sells novelty space food by the barrel, but I would expect that's unlikely. ... Isn't it?

I am totally lost on waste management, though. Could they modify a vacuum toilet with mere ferrokinesis and spare material? I kinda doubt. Space toilets that are used these days seem oriented around short trips with ready access to Earth, rather than month-or-more-long interplanetary voyages. The Apollo solution is ... suboptimal, as I'm sure any Apollo astronaut will confirm. And even if just giving up and going with diapers seemed like a good idea, could one reasonably expect to get a big enough supply delivered on relatively short notice?

And my solutions for climate control seem to amount to "bring a spare atmosphere" and "rotate the metal parts for more efficient radiating" and "some of those powers can help, right? Even though they should probably /all/ generate waste heat?". As you might guess, those aren't especially satisfying.

These seem like they'd go better as separate questions at one or more stackexchange, but organizing this appropriately is ... proving challenging, and it's Wednesday. Suggestions welcome (...requested?).

*** You probably need to list out what the actual powers are.

iirc special space food is just needed because it's lightweight, dense, and stores well. If you have plenty of mass budget you can just bring normal preserved foods as long as it's not liquidy or crumbly. Water you just drink from a bag.

Likewise if the mass budget and delta-v are less of an issue, you can generate some constant gravity just by rotating the craft using the RCS.

For waste management, just do it in bags and then push the bags away using powers. In a real interplanetary spacecraft it'd be unacceptably wasteful, and on the space station it'd pollute the orbit. The complicated vacum designs are mostly needed to keep things hygienic, and a ragtag bunch of superpowered adventurers might settle on simply living in disgusting conditions for the trip and taking the hit to PR and infection risk that an organization wouldn't.

For climate control, it's probably done manually with powers. Heating is simple, and cooling can be done by compressing and expanding gases to concentrate heat, and then using ferrokinesis to unfold, move around, and fold large radiators.

How about resistance bands? They're cheap, lightweight, and extremely versatile. As long as the ship inhabitants can brace themselves against a surface, they can push or pull in 0g against the resistance of the resistance band. Attaching the other end of the band to a wall should be trivial with ferrokinesis. As long as the inhabitants bring a variety of bands with different resistances, I think that should solve all fitness issues.

** I've started watching Pixar's /Onwards/ - it's not rational (at times, frustratingly so), but it got me thinking. The core idea is your default fantasy D&D world evolving to use technology and abandon magic, becoming a lot like our own. The fact this happens is pretty nonsense (since apparently magic allows them to /summon the dead/, for example), but the general concept is sound: magic needs a user, and using magic is hard; meanwhile, technology can be easy to use once it's built. What would you spin out of this concept? I am thinking in particular socio-economic dynamics e.g. how this would connect to broader shifts from feudalism to capitalism, what would end up being the role of magic in the resulting society, etc. Also, do you know of any existing works with a good take on this?
