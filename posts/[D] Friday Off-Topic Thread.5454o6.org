Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** My father has been in declining health for some time, due to a terminal disease. Over the past couple of days, he quickly went from a fully functional adult to someone who cannot live on his own, intermittently confused and lost. I suppose that any good father is a hero in the eyes of his son, and Dad was a hero to me. Mentally, he was a giant; educated in literature, science, and business, he was a voracious reader and could speak at length on any topic. He had books in German, French, and English on his bookshelf. I always had a certain awe for him, of his philosophy and his art and his books in foreign languages filled with poetry and literature. He had recordings of poetry read aloud by professionals on vinyl records, classical music, singing in Farsi, and fine art hanging on his walls. He loved poetry, as I suppose most Persians do. His favorite poem was The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot.

Dad was born in Iran, and moved to France as a boy when my family fled bad conditions there. He went to Germany for college, studying geophysics. ("Why geophysics?" I asked. He replied: "Well, I started in physics, but I didn't like all the math needed for quantum mechanics. Geophysics had the same requirements, but with geology instead.") After he graduated, he ended up moving to America to seek his fortune, and perhaps more education. ("Why move to America? Why not work in geophysics?" I asked. He replied: "Geophysics means you need to work looking for oil in the desert or drilling ice cores in Antarctica. No pretty women there. I met some American foreign exchange students one year, and they were very pretty, so I knew where I wanted to move.")

He came to America, and he was able to find a job in construction work. He had some experience, since he had started his degree in Germany studying engineering before changing to physics. Part of the curriculum for engineers at the Technische Hochschule in Koln was spending a summer working on a construction project as a worker (mostly digging ditches), so he knew what to do. What he didn't know, however, was who to eat lunch with. There were two lunch groups, the whites and the blacks. As a Persian, he didn't fit in either group. He ended up sitting with the blacks. ("Why the blacks?" I asked. He replied: "I didn't know who to sit with. Looking at the two groups, the whites looked gloomy, but the blacks were laughing, smiling, and telling jokes, so I sat with them.") This explains all the black friends he has, I suppose.

Eventually, Dad and his girlfriend decided to move across the country from Philadelphia to Berkeley, California. He'd bought a Chevy Corvair for $200, they put everything he owned in it, and together, they set out across the country. That car, "unsafe at any speed," probably wasn't the best choice for a cross-country vehicle, but it was cheap and pretty. Somewhere in the midwest, partway through the trip, the car broke down, and they took it to a mechanic. He replaced a part and they were able to start the car again.

"Will this car make it to California?" Dad asked. He knew there would be mountains to cross to get there, but didn't have money for a better car.

"Yeah," drawled the mechanic, "but don't /push/ the motherfucker."

For the rest of the trip, any time Dad went too fast, Bev would say, "Don't push the motherfucker," and he'd ease off the gas.

In Berkeley, he attended the University of California and got a degree in comparative literature (easy, for a man who spoke Farsi, French, German, and English fluently), then attended the business school. He fell in love with the city and decided to stay there and never move away. This was only the beginning of his life, in a way, and all the stories that remain would be too many to write here. He worked in startups, pitching ideas and trying to get companies off the ground. There was a successful one designing RFID tags for cattle. Another selling CDs containing medical information (think WebMD but before the internet was huge). He fell in love, got married, had a kid (my brother), before things fell apart. Then, he did it again, and I was born. A lucky child, to have such a father. He would drive, every weekend, from Berkeley to Palo Alto to pick me up and and take care of me for a couple days before returning me to Mom's place on Sunday. He did this every weekend for over a decade, so I could have the schooling afforded me by my mother's Palo Alto residence, and still see my father every week. Eventually, he became a real estate agent and eased into a comfortable semi-retirement.

He lived a vibrant life of adventure and love and intellectual curiosity. He's smart, even now. There was no gradual decline of mental abilities, because of his intelligence. Dad might get temporarily confused in conversation or while doing a task, but he would figure out instantly what was going on from context until he remembered. He'd run into a problem pressed on him by his declining alertness and he'd find a way around it with habits and patterns and ability to solve problems on the fly. And eventually, finally, when it became too much for him to route around with his intelligence, it all collapsed at once. No gradual decline of mental ability, just a sudden inability of his cleverness to overcome his handicaps, laying bare everything that he's lost up until this point.

*** I'm sorry for you and your family. My dad is another persian immigrant, came to the US to learn engineering and flee the theocracy, built himself and his architecture business up from nothing. He's had some failing health issues recently too. It's hard seeing someone who has always been so strong, so helpless.

Give your dad an extra hug when you next see him. I'm sure he appreciates having a son who loves and admires him so much.

** I'm looking for advice on productivity and depression, and since I have most of the same mental quirks as most of you, I thought I'd ask here. Here are a few details:

I've been playing around with a couple different antidepressants over the past several months, and recently, my doctor had me try bupropion, which is sort of helping to improve my mood a little, but not putting me in a state where I'm able to get things done. In general, I've already tried the stuff before the “Get Serious” section on SSC's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/][Things that Sometimes Help if You're Depressed]] page, such as thyroid/anemia tests, CBT with a counselor, etc.

My biggest problem is that being depressed means that I don't have much willpower to spend on things. When I was a student, I could reliably get 40+ hours of solid work done a week. Now, it feels like I have little enough energy that, on most days, I have to choose between writing an hour of code, going out to socialize, exercising, or cooking something decently healthy. Perhaps having a job would help boost my self-esteem and thereby raise my productivity, but that seems like a chicken-and-egg problem, as the whole point of being productive is so I can have a job, or otherwise make enough money to give some to EA causes.

/help/? Please and thank you <3

ETA: It seems like writing code takes tons more effort than other productive things, like doing e.g. linear algebra or statistics problems from a bachelor's level math class, or mundane productive things like cleaning and self-care. Maybe this is a bad sign?

Seriously, though, I think I have enough energy to do a couple hours of self-care that I wouldn't have done otherwise now that you were nice to me.

I've read the responses to your first post, as well as a few things by rationalists on depression in other places. For reasons of attention/willpower-conservation, I think I'm going to try to replace around 1/3 to 1/2 of my diet with some sort of meal replacement product (I've tried MealSquares and Soylent, and liked both).

It seems like getting out of depression with limited available mental resources is quite amenable to munckinry :)

***** I'm really happy to have made your day better! One of my suggestion was exactly to cut down on your present objectives to keep only a few of really urgent/important, and leave the rest in a temporal stasis. So good idea with MealSquares and Soylent. It's funny I was considering them too this week for time saving reasons.

Now, I have zero qualifications on the medical side of depression and I'll leave that to professionals, but some personal experience with lack of motivation. Below some disconnected ideas:

If you have close friends/familiars you trust I would reach out, explain the situation and ask for help and support.

Whithout thinking about what you /should/ do, what is the single biggest obstacle you have now from happyness or that would permit you to unlock more motivation?

You can consider yourself playing a Real Life MMORPG, if it can help, where you have to gain new skills, get better physical stats and deal with a low starting mana pool (your motivation).

I would suggest to put finding a job in maximum priority (important *and* urgent) if any of these points applies:

- Your savings are getting low
- You are living in a toxic environment and need a way out (I would consider moving to a different city too)
- You need to gain economic independency

At this level of priority you don't care much about what time of job you're gonna do, you are in emergency mode and you have to get out of it fast. You'll then have time to search better openings. It really helps to ask already employed friends to send your CV to their company's HR. HR asks always for reccomended person anyway, so everybody wins.

If you are not in emergency mode then finding a job is important but not urgent. Consider that EA suggests that the best philantropy is to focus on growing your career capital until you are 30. Or in more poetic terms, it's okay if you start saving the world one person at a time, and if that person is you.

If as I understood you are a programmer you shouldn't have much problems finding a job in the area you prefer, and as an english speaker you are literally searched all over the world. If part of your depression comes to feeling caged, consider that you would be welcomed everywhere.

Programming takes a lot of processing power, as you are always problem solving and reasoning high level. It's normal that cleaning or self-care takes much less brain power, or even feels refreshing. You could reach out to find communities dedicated to a manual/physical activity of your choice, to have a change of pace and feel a sense of accomplishment that fuel you forward to the next accomplishment and so on. This is also a moment of the year when acting associations are searching for new members, and it helps in a lot of ways, so I would give a shot to that.

So, consider this a blurt from the heart and sorry for confusing/typos bits. Don't feel bad or egoistic if you focus on your well being for the moment. Find one or two things to work on and concentrate on them with all your resources. When you will have get them to a good point you will add other two and so on.

Feel free to update us with your efforts, and know that you have our support! :D

Exercise is one of the few things that semi-reliably seems to help. If you find it difficult to summon up the willpower to go for a run or walk, experiment around with "energetic" music. You may well discover there's something out there that just /compels/ you to physical activity. Alternatively, mentally cast the exercise as a form of procrastination from coding.

  “Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.

  An you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.

  And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.”

  “Who has never killed an hour? Not casually or without thought, but carefully: a premeditated murder of minutes. The violence comes from a combination of giving up, not caring, and a resignation that getting past it is all you can hope to accomplish. So you kill the hour. You do not work, you do not read, you do not daydream. If you sleep it is not because you need to sleep. And when at last it is over, there is no evidence: no weapon, no blood, and no body. The only clue might be the shadows beneath your eyes or a terribly thin line near the corner of your mouth indicating something has been suffered, that in the privacy of your life you have lost something and the loss is too empty to share.”

  “When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me-it still sometimes happens-and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly twenty years, we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. We never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final parting. Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous-not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We knew we were beneficiaries of chance. . . . That pure chance could be so generous and so kind. . . . That we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in Cosmos, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time. . . . That we could be together for twenty years. That is something which sustains me and it's much more meaningful. . . . The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and our family, while he lived. That is so much more important than the idea I will see him someday. I don't think I'll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful.”

** Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool:

Iterations continued on the graph. The gif I have this week is kind of boring but shows off a neat feature: the example pokemon graphs are no longer hard-coded. The user can define how many they would like to show based on performance and readability issues:

[[http://i.imgur.com/6NmFMmb.gif]]

It's not shown, but you can also define the minimum gap between curves to prevent overlap. Currently the pool of example pokemon is still hard-coded, but I have plans to spin this off into a config file.

I added a settings tab for all the fiddly bits that I was hard-coding into things, including some options to disable animations for the graph to improve performance if needed.

The Bulbapedia download was improved; you can now indicate a range to download (rather than all 721), with options to overwrite or integrate if you already have some pokemon defined locally.

It occured to me that I'm going to need a way to determine how many tiles a pokemon takes up. I think I'm going to add a setting for each pokemon that indicates whether size increase is more influenced by height (onix) or weight (snorlax), with a % modifier for each. Height and weight growth may need to be added as well.

Goals this week are to produce some documentation with pictures so people who can't run it can see what it looks like, add the stuff I speculated about above, and otherwise get the species tab finished so I can actually work on moves.

**** So a while back I put together a design document and have had a few different discussions about it here on [[/r/rational]]; I've put links to them all [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][in this document here]] if you want a truly in-depth answer to that question.

I have an essay I've been poking at that details what I think a "rational game" is, and I need to get around to finishing and posting it, but the 30-second version is, I think it has a lot to do with A: being internally consistent, and B: permitting the player to make rational decisions due to rules being based on point A.

There are quite a few aspects of the game that have to be changed. To be honest, this is more "a rational game in a pokemon setting" rather than "a pokemon game tweaked to be more rational". The below are a list of points that have been designed so far.

TL;DR pokemon is a mess, and just about everything has to follow the intended spirit rather than lift the exact system.

- Types completely revamped. Shoehorned weaknesses removed; Poison for instance (currently) has nothing that is super-effective against it, because why is a poisonous creature weaker to something that a normal creature would not be weak to? Additional weaknesses/resistances modified to make more sense; Fire is /less/ effective against Steel than it is against Rock, and Poison is super-effective against Psychic (since someone who relies on mental concentration has a hard time doing so while vomiting), etc.

- Type weaknesses/resistances changed to a percentage system rather than the 2x/1x/0.5x system of canon. Poison does 400% damage to Psychic, 10% damage to Steel.

- Pokemon and moves can now have multiple types and arbitrary percentages of types (Charizard is currently designed as 10% Normal, 50% Fire, 20% Dragon, 20% Flying).

- Flying type is for all intents and purposes Normal type when it comes to damage, and an accuracy modifier otherwise. Flying types can fly about the battlefield, with their % Flying type influencing how fast they change from ground mode to flying mode. While in the air, Flying-type moves have a bonus accuracy and all non-Flying moves have a decreased accuracy against the flyer. All Normal and Fighting moves are considered Flying-type for pokemon that are in the air.

- Types have a new Affinity system that affects how easy it is to learn moves. a 100% Fighting type pokemon has a Strong affinity to learning Fighting and Normal moves, no modifier to learning Steel, Rock, or Ground moves, a Disadvantage to learning Poison, Bug, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, or Dragon moves, and a Weak affinity to learning Ghost, Psychic, Dark, or Fairy moves.

- Combat takes place on a hex grid, with positioning a major factor in battling.

- Base stats now range from 1 to 1000 (this is less a realism change and more a quality-of-life change for the designer). IVs are a one-time modification to the base stats at creature creation, defined as a % spread. For instance, if a pokemon species has base 100 ATK and a spread of 20%, any individual might have an ATK generated between 90 and 110. The % spread is configurable per stat, per species, so a pokemon might have 50% spread on DEF and 18% spread on SPD.

- Sexual Dimorphism is also a thing. For each species, a multiplier can be set for either gender against all stats. For instance, males might have 10% more ATK on average, while females have 10% more SPD. Gender is also treated as an IV, which means that a particular individual may express features closer or further away from their own gender's stereotype.

- Endurance (END) is the biggest stat change, though nearly a dozen other attributes have been added to be tracked (and improved) as stats (details in the design document linked above). Endurance represents the long-term physical exhaustion of your pokemon, and is only improved through rest or a pokemon center. Items such as Elixer or Ether will temporarily "heal" endurance, but at the cost of increased endurance usage, so you cannot battle constantly forever.

- EVs as a system are now basically a measure of how often that particular stat or move have been used. As a move's EV increases, the overall effectiveness is increased, which might mean different things for different moves. Stat EVs are gained all over the place; any time ATK is used in any calculation, the pokemon gains one (or more) ATK EVs.

- Each pokemon's anatomy is defined similarly to Dwarf Fortress' RAW files. Every major appendage or body part is represented. Stats are "enclosed" within body parts; a Leg might have SPD, END, EVA, and ATK associated with it, and injury to that body part will effectively serve as a temporary reduction in that stat for that pokemon.

- Moves by default have anatomical restrictions. To learn Bite, the creature must simply have a Mouth. To Fly, the pokemon must have one or more Wings or some other body part with the Flight attribute. This can be worked around somewhat by the use of TMs.

- Anatomy can be targeted. At the cost of an accuracy penalty, your pokemon can target specific parts of their opponent in an effort to cripple it. Severely damaging all Wings or Flight-tagged body parts, for instance, will ground a Flying pokemon. Damaging a Blastoise's cannons will severely dampen its ability to use water attacks. Breaking a Rapidash's leg will equalize its SPD advantage. Etc etc.

- Accuracy in general is getting overhauled to more closely resemble XCOM (though not /quite/ as ridiculous). If a pokemon is moving, it should be hard to hit unless you have spent time training that exact scenario.

- The trainer (you) will also have stats affecting your ability to heal, train, instruct, and inspire your pokemon, and even affecting things like how accurately you throw pokeballs. The capture system will be lifted wholesale from Origin of Species, so actually hitting your target will be the important thing.

- Permadeath will probably be a thing. It will be flexible and fair, but if you fail to get to your pokemon in time after it has been sufficiently grievously wounded, it will die. Or, perhaps, if there's nothing substantial left to retrieve to your pokeball....

- All pokemon will be redesigned to match how dangerous they should /actually/ be, using the stats from canon only as a starting point. Onix will not be a pushover.

- The world will be more dangerous in general. If you're not prepared to take on a fully-sized Onix, that's a serious risk you take in going into Mt. Moon.

- Areas in general will have more optional sections to them; maybe you just run through Veridian following the roads as fast as you can, or maybe you delve into them more thoroughly. There will always be increased risk in doing so.

- The world will have large swaths of it procedurally generated. Cities will almost always be the same, but each time the world is created the routes will be randomized somewhat. You are in fact playing a brand-new trainer, and thus should have no idea what precisely a new area holds.

- Gyms can be tackled in any order. Gating will be restricted to an absolute minimum, so the player can take whatever risks he or she deems necessary.

- Battling will occur in the same space as the overworld, so routes will be much longer to compensate.

- Pokemon will travel as individuals, families, packs, or herds as fits the species. Nests may be found. Individuals can be tracked through the overworld, so catching a particular pokemon you've previously weakened is a distinct possibility, and perhaps the norm.

And, finally, it should be noted that the VAST MAJORITY of the above will not be entirely or perfectly portrayed to the player. These are the systems that will work behind the scenes, but the player will only have limited ability to gather specific information on their pokemon or their world outside of the use of a more advanced pokedex, which will have its role greatly increased. Though it will (probably) be superficially similar to a normal pokemon game, it will play more like a roguelike.

Anyway, sorry for the novel-length "summary". If you have any suggestions or questions, be sure to let me know; this project has already been greatly improved by the input of people such as [[/u/DayStarEld]] and [[/u/ultraredspectrum]], and I'm happy to hear any comments you might have.

***** I love a lot of this, and I think we could hash out the typing interactions more if you want. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Fire is less effective against Steel than it is against Rock, and Poison is super-effective against Psychic (since someone who relies on mental concentration has a hard time doing so while vomiting), etc.
#+end_quote

To me, Fire is strong against Steel because inside all that metal are still biological organs. Different, maybe, from what we're used to, but still susceptible to heat. When you heat up a metal skin, it's very painful. When you heat up a rocky skin, it barely feels it.

As for poison and psychic, what I would say instead is that psychic should RESIST poison but NOT be super effective against it. Because psychics posses the ability to cleanse themselves of foreign bodies, and can telekenetically stop acid and poison needles and whatnot from hitting them (much easier than doing so to stop rocks thrown at them, though this could potentially be an argument against grass moves too). If you'd rather have that be demonstrated through actual attacks and defensive moves, and just want to keep things as a "this is what happen when X substance meets Y substance," that makes sense.

And I agree that Psychic shouldn't be super effective against poison. It's probably the type interaction that makes the least sense in the games. I can rationalize Ground 2x vs Poison better than I can Psychic 2x vs Poison.

While I think just about everyone thinks like this, I'm not sure it stands up to scrutiny. You know what else has organs beneath the exterior? Normal types. Yet for some reason they don't have this mystical weakness to fire that steel has, and you'd think it would hurt /worse/, since a Normal type's skin presumably has more nerve endings than one that has literal metal plating.

Would it hurt to have a smouldering red-hot plate of metal that is your skin? Yes. You know what hurts more? Not having skin because it's all been vaporized, oh and your liver's on fire.

Magma is made up of a bunch of different kinds of melted rocks and minerals, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma][has temperatures ranging]] from about 700 °C to 1300 °C

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron][Iron has a melting point]] of 1538 °C.

I mean, we make pure metal by /burning all of the rocks out of it/. I just can't see why stone would magically resist fire better than metal would.

(Sorry if this got a bit heated (pun intended), I just think this is a major case of...whatever the non-statistics version of Simpson's Paradox is.)

However, I've got a few interesting plans for the Steel type. The idea is, when you hit it with enough fire attacks, it starts to heat up, (and /the steel type begins to deal bonus fire damage with contact attacks/, mwa ha ha). You can then start dealing super-effective attacks by then hitting it with water or ice, rapidly cooling it and dealing damage proportional to the temperature decrease, which will also decrease its defense and resistances for the duration of that fight.

Also, what's that? Your skin is made up of a superconductive layer that covers your entire body? It's a shame we don't have portable trained bioelectric generators that ohwaitwhat.

#+begin_quote
  If you'd rather have that be demonstrated through actual attacks and defensive moves, and just want to keep things as a "this is what happen when X substance meets Y substance," that makes sense.
#+end_quote

That's the idea. I don't want to bake the idea of dodging into the abstraction as I'd prefer that part actually be part of the game. All of my type percentages are assuming "this is how much it hurts assuming a successful, solid hit". If through sheer chance a Tauros and an Alakazam both get hit with a faceful of acid, which one is more able to keep up their defenses?

The Alakazam should have an easier time keeping the acid out in the first place, but once it's hit, I can't imagine it's easy to continue deflecting incoming projectiles with one's brain when that same brain is screaming MY FACE. WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY FACE.

#+end_quote

Ah, see, this is where the emergent properties idea of type interactions comes in. Yes, a Normal type should be hurt worse by a flamethrower than a steel type, but the normal type is going to flinch and dodge away from fire much quicker than the steel type, who in most cases is going to just sit there and take it. For the fast steel types like skarmory, just make the composition of their metal something like titanium or magnesium, which are highly flammable.

But you're right that if you can make the properties of the types better reflected by other game mechanics, like being able to dodge or deflect better, that's the path that's much more realistic/easier to rationalize. Rationalizing the type interactions as presented in the game world requires turning to alternate explanations besides "Substance X hits Substance Y," but making a really complex game allows you to explore them in a lot of different ways.

Fans of the canon series probably won't like it (I tend to get negative scores on my posts in [[/r/pokemon]] suggesting type interaction changes that are too "extreme" in attempts to make them more realistic/balanced), but I'd love to play a game with more realistic interactions.

Realism. Ghost was the only immunity that was reasonably plausible, the rest being more or less for flavor or balance reasons. Once I eliminated the others I figured I'd try and get rid of that one, too, and came across a solution I liked.

Also the idea of hitting someone else and they just sit there and wait for the dust to settle while being /completely/ unaffected is very...anime.

Any pre-emptive balance decisions I make are likely to never see the light of day, so I try not to make /too/ many decisions for that reason, and try to focus on playability, realism, and flexibility in how I design the system as a whole.

Also, I see you're on the Discord server; it might be easier to do the back-and-forth there, if you'd prefer.

***** One thing I've noticed from when I play fan games is that attempts to make the game harder lead to two habits I wind up in that I don't really like. The first is the clear 'grind until every challenge is easy' urge. Grinding costs nothing except monotony and it gives you the tools to easily beat any challenge, which sounds good until you realize that you're left with hours of tedium and an unchallenging game if you follow the urge. I don't feel this urge in the main series because, by and large, there's no need for grinding. I don't know how possible it would be, but I feel that the game would be better if the urge to grind was counterbalanced by other incentives/disincentives or even taken out of the equation somehow.

The other urge I fall into, I've noticed, is when routes are packed full of challenging trainers that I can still beat, I often feel the need to go all the way back to the Pokemon Center, to not be disadvantaged for the next fight. It's depressingly common, and my reaction these days to a faux-endurance challenge is more negative than positive. Again, this isn't much of a concern in the main series where challenge is a minimum, but I think it's a topic worth investigating, if there's a way to make a segment like that where I have no choice but to stick it through or if such segments should be avoided entirely.

Design talking points aside, this looks like a mountain and a half of work to get through, especially where you would have to create new values like the Pokemon body part metrics. I doubt I'm in any position to be much help deep in the code, but if there's some legwork to the tune of hundreds of Pokemon to do or some part of the design you want another opinion on, I'd be honoured to help out in my spare time.

For example, when all it takes to heal up your pokemon is some real-life time to run back and forth to a pokemon center, it's the optimal decision in terms of game advantage. When in-game time costs in-game resources, now the time spent traveling back and forth isn't necessarily better than just stocking up on some potions and using the in the field.

Rest assured, my goal is to make a series of small, interesting events that are chained together into a bunch of larger, interesting events. If the player wants to grind I won't stop him, but I don't want there to ever be a wall that they are not /permitted/ to go by until their team is a certain strength. If they want to go forward, then go forward, and if you get your ass kicked, well, maybe go search for another area that you can handle, or /just stick to the road/.

If you're having trouble with a badge, go searching deep into the jungle to find a rare pokemon that would help you beat it! Or go find a guy that can teach your pokemon Ice Beam! Or go earn enough money to buy the TM! Or skip the badge entirely and come back later! Or, /if you're absolutely set on it/, spend time grinding the gym's training area before finally eking out a win. But that should be your absolute last-ditch option, intentionally made the most boring!

Trainer fights will be different in this incarnation. I'm not sure I like the whole "we made eye contact WE ARE DUTY BOUND TO FIGHT" thing, so it will more likely be NPCs that you can talk to and offer to battle. I also expect that there will be relatively fewer trainers way out in the sticks, and more of them right in or near town, so if nothing else you'd have a shorter trip on your hands.

Trainer fights and wild battles will have a difference in effort, though. Origin of Species had the characters being very careful to not actually harm the opponent's pokemon, and I aim to have a similar system. Something more like "1v1, first to half HP loses" sort of thing, with serious penalties for then intentionally punting your opponent into the stratosphere.

Anyway, I have no intention of having trainer mazes that you have dodge or fight your way through; I intend for most of the game and most of the interesting challenges to be fighting wild pokemon. Here's the pokemon I want to capture; he's surrounded on that side by a cliff that I can use for Rock Slide, but he's also got five or six friends close to him, and how can I drive them away without losing my quarry? Etc.

As for the interface itself, it looks pretty solid for having everything I need to pay attention to laid out in efficient organization.

A couple quick questions, though. In the Anatomy section, I see things like HP and HP+ for the stats of each body part. Should I conclude that if a stat is present the functioning of the body part affects the stat itself, and that a + assigns extra significance?

Also, I'm lacking a bit of perspective about the stat values. Mewtwo's better stats are well above 500 and his lesser stats are well below 500, so is 500 meant to be above average but not exceptionally powerful, as in, what a decent Pokemon like, say, Scyther, could be at with its physical attack?

And, just to see if I understand it right, Intelligence deals with the Pokemon's ability to understand complex orders, Constitution deals with the Pokemon's internal stability, or how good their body is at keeping them healthy, Accuracy and Evasion are just modifiers on hit chance, Initiative is what speed used to be (priority and turn order, etc.) while Speed is now movement speed, Critical is a modifier on critical hit rate, Respect is the Pokemon's opinion of trainers as a general rule, Loyalty is the Pokemon's willingness to follow orders, Temperament is a modifier on the behaviour of the Pokemon, and is Weakness about keeping external effects (like cold) from having an affect on it, as is it inverse, where more Weakness makes it easier to affect?

I think I'll take a stab at making a stat spread for one of the Pokemon after I've given the stats a little more thought and hear back from you. This looks interesting.

I realized after seeing this that I didn't point out the definitions I already had for all the stats and anatomy; sorry about that! I've [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Co3cS6p_5h6HGs3tzjbJRRbUFd-vI2njVGjYyz8jwE4/#][overhauled the documentation]] for Bill's PC, and in the Base Stats section there is a list of explanations for what each stat represents.

Spot on. Damage to the listed body part will essentially temporarily subtract the proper proportion of the stat. I also added a section explaining this to the documentation.

#+end_quote

All the stats from HP to Weight (read row by row) are 0-based, which is to say they start at 0 and scale up to 999. All the rest of the stats are 500-based, where they start at 500 and go either up or down; this is for stats that have a meaningful definition of "negative". For instance, a pokemon with ACC less than 500 is somewhat of a klutz that misses more often than usual.

Mewtwo should be treated as about as good as mortals can get; while some pokemon might beat him on one stat or another, no one should have anywhere close to as good a stat total as he does. This may mean we need to buff him; I'm floundering as much as you are as far as context goes.

See the Base Stat section I mentioned above, as some of the stats (such as SPD) have specific meanings; in SPD's case 20 SPD is equal to 1 tile moved per turn, or about 1 m/s. 120 SPD is thus 6 tiles per turn, which is actually pretty slow, but I was worried about turning this superpowerful end-game character into a bullshit teleports-behind-you sort of boss. It might end up needing to be necessary to buff his speed, but I also had the SSBM version of Mewtwo in mind as well. The other super-low stats have similar hard-coded meanings (except Loyalty, which makes sense once you know what it's for).

#+begin_quote
  And, just to see if I understand it right, Intelligence deals with the Pokemon's ability to understand complex orders,
#+end_quote

Not quite. Actually a modifier of experienced gained and a factor in determining max number of moves. I have toyed with the idea of messing with "complex orders", but I'm not so certain how that would play out in an ostensibly turn-based game.

#+begin_quote
  Constitution deals with the Pokemon's internal stability, or how good their body is at keeping them healthy
#+end_quote

Pretty much: it's a modifier to how effective status effects are against it.

#+begin_quote
  Accuracy and Evasion are just modifiers on hit chance, Initiative is what speed used to be (priority and turn order, etc.) while Speed is now movement speed, Critical is a modifier on critical hit rate,
#+end_quote

All spot on.

#+begin_quote
  Respect is the Pokemon's opinion of trainers as a general rule, Loyalty is the Pokemon's willingness to follow orders
#+end_quote

The player character will himself have stats, two of which are Leadership and Compassion. Leadership is a measure of how inspiring you are to your pokemon and modifies EV gain, damage output, and initiative. Compassion is a measure of how connected you are to your pokemon, and modifies stat growth, move training, and healing amounts. Respect and Loyalty are tied to these two; a pokemon with high Respect won't listen to you unless you have a matching Leadership, and same for Loyalty and Compassion.

(To borrow from OoS: Blue's Shiftry has a high Respect and trash Loyalty, where Red's Pichu is low Respect high Loyalty. Pichu would cower in fear if Red's Leadership were too much higher than his Compassion, but Shifty won't even consider doing anything but decapitate Blue until he's shown his Leadership off.)

Now that I think about this, I may need to change these two to be 500-based, so a pokemon with "negative" Loyalty is actually annoyed by a high Compassion stat on you, and vice versa. The intention was that Mewtwo's low Loyalty meant he didn't give two shits if you were luvvy-duvvy, he only cared if you could beat him and inspire him with your badassery.

#+begin_quote
  Temperament is a modifier on the behaviour of the Pokemon
#+end_quote

Yup, specifically on the overworld, though I might find another use for the stat in other situations. 0 = flees in wild panic, 500 = zen, 999 = aggressively goes bananas on you.

#+begin_quote
  is Weakness about keeping external effects (like cold) from having an affect on it, as is it inverse, where more Weakness makes it easier to affect?
#+end_quote

Weakness and Resistance are just straight modifiers to the type weaknesses/resistances. A Charizard with a high RES stat takes even /less/ damage from a Grass-type move, while a Charizard with a high WEAK stat can't even get rained on without dying. The initial idea was to actually allow custom type definitions per-species, but that was waaay too much, so I compromised with this.

Though I like your idea of using it for environmental stuff, too. I hadn't really thought about external weather, but wouldn't it be funny if you had to be careful where you used Rain Dance cuz now you have to trudge through mud for two days...

Glad to hear it! Do let me know if you have any complaints or suggestions. Be sure to check out the Bulbapedia mass import; I gave it its own section in the documentation, as it speeds up, well, mass imports pretty damn well. Just note that importing from the canon stats is an inaccurate science; especially since so many canon pokemon will need to be adjusted to let their badass side truly shine.

********* I pieced together what I think might be a reasonable stat spread for [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/zxb5ucz1tb3nwrc/With%20Machop.dex?dl=0][Machop]], under the assumption that it is a Pokemon naturally tough and strong (for a juvenile Pokemon) with a tendency to spend free time exercising and training itself. Since there's still little in the way of baselines (I basically had to extrapolate from Rattata), I'd be happy if you could look at this thoroughly so I can be confident in having a second baseline.

As a side note, I tried to save Machop's stats as the smaller .pkmn file through the 'export' button, but the file never appeared. No error message, as if it had worked, but the file never showed up. So I had to save the entire Pokedex to save Machop's stats.

*********** I decided today to go through Machop's evolution line and try to get a sense of how Pokemon strength should change as they evolve. I think the Machop -> Machoke evolution is fairly representative, and the Machoke -> Machamp evolution is above average, and all in all Machamp is near the upper end of how I think strong regular Pokemon should be. I put the three of them into [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/a2xtquqwg86ybza/Pokedex_2016-09-26.dex?dl=0][a single .dex file]] alongside what's already there.

I have two pieces of feedback about the interface, as well. The first is that I often find myself looking at the wrong stat box for the stat name. As in, the text for Defense is closer to the box for Attack than its own box since the 'Defense' text is left-aligned. I think if the text were right-aligned, or the boxes were put to the left of the text, I would mistake which stat corresponds with which number less often.

The second feedback is that I'm doing a lot of flipping between Pokemon tabs to get comparisons for the stat I'm looking at. Since a lot of this is inside the evolution line, if I had a keyboard shortcut to quickly switch to adjacent Pokemon I would find myself making a lot of use of it. In lieu of that, actual tabs brought up and discarded like a browser would serve a similar purpose, though I'd imagine that would be harder to implement.

And just one clarification: when I set Machamp's Resistance stat to 450, that means he takes a further 25% less damage from moves he already resists, right? Intuition tells me that if a high Weakness stat takes more damage, a higher Resistance stat should take less damage, even if they cover different things, but the documentation leads me to believe both stats affect damage taken in the same way.

The browser tabs idea would require a complete overhaul, you're right, so let's see if we can't alleviate this somewhat elsewhere.

The key combination is a good idea. I'm thinking ctrl+E to switch to the evolved form, ctrl+D to go "down" an evolution? Obviously it would just fail if there's a branching evolution...maybe a way to select the "current focus" evolution. Then maybe ctrl+up or down arrow to cycle through the drop-down or something. Thoughts?

No, your intuition is correct: higher RES = less damage, higher WEAK = more damage. I'll clarify the documentation.

************* Regarding the paging through evolutions, I think I'll maintain that a simple combination to move one up in the list of Pokemon and to move down in the list of Pokemon would be sufficient. Pokemon in evolution lines that aren't next to each other are relatively rare, and having a simple button like that would mean I could go look at other nearby Pokemon with just a few keystrokes.

Which isn't to say that there isn't reason to move between evolutions specifically. If the evolution tab had links to each of the Pokemon defined there I could go from Poliwhirl to Politoed in one click just fine (though I have no idea how difficult/easy that would be), and if a keyboard shortcut is to be used, the branch-evolution problem could be solved by having the 'forwards' button cycle through evolutions (as in, Poliwag --> Poliwhirl --> Poliwrath --> Politoed --> Poliwag) and the 'backwards button go in reverse order. Though again, I'm not sure if that would be as easy to implement as it sounds, with the way evolution information is stored in the program.

And if my intuition was right about Resistance, I guess I'll have to update the stats for Machamp. Also another question about them: if a Pokemon takes 150% damage from, say, Fire, and has a Weakness stat of 400 for a modifier of 50% less damage, is the resulting effective damage taken 100%, a flat reduction, or 125%, or removing 50% of the effect the weakness has on the Pokemon? The second one sounds more intuitive and is what I've been going with, but I'm well aware that it could be the opposite, and I've inadvertently turned Machamp's very slight weakness against Bug types moves into a major resistance against Bug type moves.

Edit: the .dex file should be updated by now.

Ctrl+E to go up one evolution (the first evolution if multiple are there, I haven't done any fancy logic yet), Ctrl+D to go down, and Ctrl+Up/Ctrl+Down to step up or down the main species dropdown.

I had to include the separate up/down/e/d because the combobox can be sorted alphabetically, in which case simply cycling once doesn't guarantee hitting the next evolution.

***** Holy crap this sounds stars-in-my-eyes-/amazing/. Few questions:

Given the rather more complicated math behind type advantages, will there be any tools given to players to calculate that?

Your goal is for there to be multiple options to make progress; does this include there being multiple "goal" or "win" conditions to the game, or will it be open ended (for instance, either Red or Blue's approach to Pokemon from OoS)?

What sort of interaction can be expected with NPCs? What about with wild pokemon? With the latter, you mentioned that a temperament of 500 would be "zen" -- would this allow non-violent interaction with a wild pokemon? What would that amount to? (Feeding them, offering to let them join you without fighting them, etc.?)

Given the degree of detail given to pokemon, are there going to be pokemon with human-rivalling intelligence (Mewtwo, psychic types, the Lucario line, legendaries, etc. seem the most likely to have such)?

Man this sounds so cool, I'm giddy.

edit: Some more questions because aaaaaaaaa.

Will there be opportunity for specialized, non-level-related training? For instance, if you wanted to train a pokemon to be faster or better at dodging than its counterparts.

It's mentioned that training against other pokemon improves moves more quickly than when used in the absence of a target. Would it be possible for a trainer to use themselves as the target for a less-than-lethal move to improve their pokemon more quickly without battling?

The sliding scale of psychics concept is valid, I think, but it should be on a per-pokemon basis, not typal -- Riolu and Lucario would be significantly stronger psychics than a Machop, given that Lucario can learn Psychic, and Riolu has access to Protect, a move which I can only type out as Psychic (in spite of being normal in canon).

This is a tough question. On the one hand, I want this to be a rational title, and you can't make rational decisions without reliable or semireliable information.

On the other hand, I don't want it to be as immediately a simple calculation as it is in canon. The way I will probably handle this is by the pokedex giving the player vague data--at least, until the player has upgraded its capabilities, but even then I don't want there to be too obvious a winner in every case just by looking at it. I want the player to have to evaluate the individuals involved--this one /seems/ to kick harder, but that one /seems/ to run faster.

When it comes to types this will be further compounded by Weakness/Resistance being IVs. Sure, this pokemon might be 50% Fire, but it's got a higher-than-average set of resistances with only slightly augmented weaknesses. The types will be broad-strokes, of course; you'll still want a Blastoise to counter their Charizard, but getting the feel for the individuals involved will be as important, if not more important than the particular type spread their species have.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I haven't given as much thought to the win condition--I probably should, heh. The way I see it, this is a game first and foremost about being a Trainer, but how do you measure the end goal of being a trainer? I'm not sure, and I'll have to give it some thought.

What I /do/ know, though, is that it will (in it's perfect state which I may or may not attain to) permit the player to choose the path that is most appealing to them. Some trainers are Champions, some are Breeders, some are pubstomping Battlers, some are Rangers, some are Coordinators, some are Gym Leaders, some are Legendary Hunters, some are Professors, some are Researchers, some are Vigilantes, some are Renegades.

I guess the answer is yes, I want it to be open-ended. Being Champion is probably the easiest and most traditional end-goal to start with, though.

#+begin_quote
  What sort of interaction can be expected with NPCs?
#+end_quote

Off the top of my head, there are two kinds of NPC I want to have for version one (not counting your typical shopkeeper/busybody town NPCs, which are fairly bland and not much more than walking sign posts). I have this idea of a Ranger system in my head that closely matches how OoS handles it: there is a network that pokedexes tap into that list nearby marked threats, distress calls, ranger stations, and general warnings. You would have a faction standing with the Rangers that goes up when you help trainers in distress, goes down when you go all Renegade, and may go up or down if you call them for help, depending on how stupid the threat was.

The other major type would of course be battlers, of which the Gyms would be the primary source of them. I like the idea of having an always-open training area in the gyms that you can access if you've impressed the denizens enough, as well as the city-ran trainer halls. I want fights between the player and NPCs to be controlled situations, more interesting in some ways due to the fact that you just don't know what they've trained their top-tier Rattata to do, but in other ways less interesting (they're not going to gang up on you 5 v 1, for example).

At any rate, though, I expect the wild pokemon interactions to take up most of the game's time and focus.

#+begin_quote
  What about with wild pokemon? With the latter, you mentioned that a temperament of 500 would be "zen" -- would this allow non-violent interaction with a wild pokemon? What would that amount to? (Feeding them, offering to let them join you without fighting them, etc.?)
#+end_quote

Y'know, I hadn't thought about that, but hell, it makes sense to me (this is why I post these; [[/r/rational]] is a veritable gold mine of ideas). The pokeball mechanics will be straight lifted from OoS, so I see no reason why you couldn't just walk up to a calm pokemon, feed it some stuff, lock on, toss, and boom, captured. I don't hold to the anime idea that pokemon understand humans in some weird metaphysical way, so I'm not sure how you'd convince one to just join you out of the blue, but I like the general sentiment. Consider it stolen.

For most interactions, though, you'd be able to see the pokemon on the overworld wandering around, and their temperament and your actions will determine whether they attack you or run away. You can very easily find yourself in over your head if you try to just walk into a herd of tauros, but maybe you can scare most of the herd away and ensnare one in the web trap you had your pokemon weave. Or sing them all to sleep. Or rock slide the nearby cliff into the herd and hope you find one that was only 80% crushed to death. Or maybe you just pull out your One Punch Hitmonchan and see how many of them you can sucker punch before you need to teleport out.

#+begin_quote

The current scope is limited to the original 151 + maybe gen II, so Mewtwo is about the only one that I think would be human-like. I haven't thought so far ahead as to how I will handle him specifically, but I smell an interesting quest line possibility...

I hold to the OoS idea that Alakazam has about the same intelligence as a four-year-old, and keeping pokemon for the most part limited to the intelligence of animals. For one, I don't want to have to go and implement serious AI for human-intelligent pokemon to work, and second the idea just doesn't appeal to me, for some reason I should probably identify.

I would however love to lift OoS' system of legendaries being this unstoppable storm-force that are more forces of nature than anything, if I can get it to work well.

******* The scope is noted, but still rather exciting -- as pokemon additions strike me as something that could be rather modular. You'd need the basics of where they're located at, what sorts of trainers might have them, and their stats, etc., but that stuff can be outsourced if you would like once you have the basic system down.

I really like that you're going with a Dwarf Fortress-style system for a lot of things, and it could help a LOT in adding things. DF is spaghetti code at its root, but its modularity is incredible and could be used to make just about anything: buildings, trainers, caves, you name it.

Something worth noting is that while it hasn't been explored very much in OoS (and while this would be a rather... discomforting thought for some given its implications), it's possible that pokemon and humans evolved from the same ancestors, and as such, that some of the more humanoid pokemon evolved a similar intellect.

I love the idea of impressing pokemon in non-combat ways to get them to join you, though. For instance, finding a colony of psychic types and, as a psychic trainer yourself, impressing them that way. Or helping one out that had gotten injured, or whatever else is appropriate.

Yup, I just feel like this is the best possible way to go about it. I want to spend most of my time working on the procedural generation, the mechanics, and the game systems. Already other people are offering to help design the specific pokemon, and the map system will be similarly customizable. Once I drop the project in the future, I can only hope I've gotten it to the point where others can mod or expand it simply by making new *.map or *.pkmn files, letting the game live on for as long as there are people willing to tend to it.

Certainly! The idea is that EVs are trained by actually using the stat they're based on rather than canon's awkward cannibal-essence idea. Specialized training will need to be introduced somehow; I haven't designed the specifics on that yet, but there will be /some/ mechanic for focusing on things like dodging that would otherwise only be trained by, well, not getting hit by things that are aimed at you.

I mean, hey, a target's a target. It might be funny to include that for the lulz, but hopefully there are other, more sensible options available, such as, y'know, setting your pokemon on each other instead. This may be another area that gyms come in handy, too.

  The sliding scale of psychics concept is valid, I think, but it should be on a per-pokemon basis, not typal -- Riolu and Lucario would be significantly stronger psychics than a Machop, given that Lucario can learn Psychic, and Riolu has access to Protect, a move which I can only type out as Psychic (in spite of being normal in canon).
#+end_quote

The sliding scale thing was something I was toying with to see if there was any useful information that could be had by modeling it, but I'm not sure I'll do anything with it at this point. I may change my mind once (if) I get to the point of making players psychic.

Also remember that things like that are assuming a mythical, 100% typed creature, which by and large probably won't exist (though there's probably some pokemon somewhere I'm missing that would only make sense as being "pure" typed). Lucario could be modeled as 20% Normal, 50% Fighting, 20% Steel, and 10% Psychic, for instance (or something like that; I'm not as familiar with pokemon from gen III and beyond).

Oh yeah, I totally understand that. That was more in reference to the intellect of humanoid species of pokemon. While most species are probably fairly intelligent by real world standards for animals, I feel they would be most likely to comprehend complex commands.

Pokemon intelligence could be of use in certain areas of the game: for instance, in how likely they are to understand motivations (I'm reminded of a story of a person who set two groups of crows to war with each other by being nice to one and mean to the other), and how likely they are to appreciate non-combative approaches, or attempting to heal them, or whatnot.

Following the crow example, it could also lead to pokemon of an area knowing a person to be "good" by whatever measure they use and defending them. Fun, dynamic stories could develop as a result of that, though it's probably a bit out of the scope of your immediate thoughts toward the game.

Hmm, this /might/ be possible by giving herds and nests an opinion of trainers that is modified whenever a pokemon that belongs to the herd or nest has its "faction standing" increased by the player, modified by the individual's intelligence stat (how much it understands an altruistic action). I like it, it uses the INT stat for one more thing, which is nice.

(It occurs to me that the design doc might not have a current list of stats, of which INT is a relatively recent addition, so I don't know if you were aware it was a thing or not. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Co3cS6p_5h6HGs3tzjbJRRbUFd-vI2njVGjYyz8jwE4/edit#heading=h.1ugqpqwylq1p][The Bill's PC Documentation]] has a section detailing the current stats in use.)

I'll throw it on the list of things to consider once I put groups of pokemon in. I don't see a simple way for that to cross species barriers, off the top of my head, but there might not be many common actions that affect more than one herd/group at a time, anyway.

Thanks for the input! Keep it comin.

********* While using offensive moves /in general/ on humans would definitely be a renegade thing to do, I can see plenty of exceptions in sufficiently extreme circumstances, and more broad ones for non-offensive moves, though I'm unsure of how the world would handle them... and it's out of the confines of your game for the most part. Questions like use of pokemon in self defense (is it justifiable if someone pulls a knife on you to order your pokemon to attack them? What about a gun?), or water gun to slow someone falling, telekinesis for the same or a myriad of other uses -- a sufficiently skilled psychic in a mind link with a human might very well be of aid to a surgeon, for instance, or to augment their own psychic ability in therapy.

Fighting-type Aura-based moves would probably have medical use too, though a little more ambiguous as to how and how well. It would definitely have use in identifying people and of metaphysical use in that regard, based on the movie involving Lucario, though.

Other examples are less clear cut, but I still think they represent a trend towards the criteria we associate with rational and rationalist fiction.

Zootopia has intelligent characters and detailed worldbuilding, Limitless is a detective show about solving mysteries through munchkinism while dealing with a conspiracy of munchkins, and the Marvel films like are now deconstructing and reconstructing themselves by exploring the implications of the Avengers' actions and motivations.

Combine that with critics and fans alike complaining about issues that rational fiction was specifically designed to avoid, and I think our community has a huge opportunity for growth if we play our cards right.

In the series I'm thinking of, it really kicks everything into a new mode. The protagonist spent years and book after book fighting to save his city, gaining allies, training others, learning to be the strongest and toughest and smartest he could be, and becomes the de facto leader of the city's good guys/defenders... thus painting a mark on his back, and getting sniped at the end of a book.

The subsequent one details how everyone reacted, and how they basically all stepped up to take up his mantle, and continue his work and legacy as best they could, even though none of them individually was as strong as him. It was very bittersweet and inspiring.

That's helpful as a story element, sure, but it really reduces the impetus to keep reading a story. The great thing about sequels is that the author has already established their cast and setting, so they can move straight to the plot. In a work that had previously focused on a main charachter, that means the author needs to go straight back to the drawing board and flesh out a side charachter.

That can lead to good results, of course (the series I'm thinking of had a spinoff I enjoyed, because the side-charachter-to-MC switch was done well) but still slows down the story.

That's why resurrection is so common in comics, the fans keep demanding bad stories be fixed.

I had seen so many stories that did pull it off that I thought character death was a good thing for a story until I had it explained to me that when a character dies, all their story potential dies with them. If you end a character arc without a satisfying conclusion, that hurts your story.

With comics in particular, death is counterintuitive. The series is meant to keep going until people stop reading, so authors need to utilize all the story potential they can get. Killing off characters denies the creator and audience all the plot and character development that could've happened because of them.

*** In terms of a single event, I can't come up with anything easy to wipe out a galaxy. Galaxies are far too large and far too sparse to be easily dealt with using the sort of energies we can manage.

You could cause a lot of havoc if you collided two galaxies together. It's my understanding that this would lead to lots of new star creation. There might be other effects as well, but I don't know enough to say. As mentioned, galaxies are sparse enough that there won't even be many direct collisions of stars when two galaxies interact.

You would be able to do a lot of damage if you [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet][fed a large star to a spinning supermassive black hole]]. That creates a jet of highly energetic matter along the axis of rotation, which may be enough to wipe out things in its path.

The caveat there is that it's subluminal matter, and we're about 26,500 light years away from the galactic centre. If you had a way of creating a black hole closer to your target you might be able to make it happen in a reasonable time, but if you could do that you should just create black holes near your target.

Really, the only thing I can think of that's plausibly efficient (i.e. low requirements, high effect) is some sort of grey goo scenario. Nanobots convert planets and stars into more nanobots which self-assemble into ships which fly off to other systems. Would probably take a very long time and could probably be easily stopped by the victims if they had forewarning (e.g. from seeing the stars die).

Killing a solar system is by comparison easy.
