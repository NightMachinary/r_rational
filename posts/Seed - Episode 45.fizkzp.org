** I'm getting an urge for more AGI stories. This is a good one, properly creepy and mysterious as AI should be but still kind of ambivalent where you don't know what Turry really wants. Gorgeous, demonstrative art style and just enough philosophy to feel natural.

**** I will take a slow, steady update schedule over irregular, faster updates any day.

This updates just about every week, which is great. I'd rather that than something like, say, Homestuck, which averaged more content per day than pretty much anything else on the Internet, but went through several extended hiatuses (hiatii?) where the fandom was never really certain that it'd ever be finished (even though it eventually, finally, was). I never get that feeling with Seed, having an update every week, and three queued up and waiting.

this is actually bothering me a bit. For me to get invested in a story like this, I have to trust that the author knows what they're doing, that the weirdness will all make sense in the end. They haven't given me much reason to trust them yet, so I'm in this uncomfortable limbo right now.

** I liked this story. It's a unique premise for a webcomic (sentient AI in modern world) and the art is really beautiful. I'm about halfway through the series and plan to come back to it soon.

*** Thanks for your review. I quite liked the themes which this comic touches. After I bingeread it in a couple hours I simply need more.

** Wow, Sam is making the same mistake that Less Wrong complained about in the Roko's Basilisk incident. He's considering ways that Taurus might be currently blackmailing him. Like, this should be obvious: if the AI wanted to blackmail you, you have to realize it's blackmailing you for that blackmail to work. So why try to piece it together?
