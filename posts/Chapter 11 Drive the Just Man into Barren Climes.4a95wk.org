** Random theory: We are currently in the "Aaron" portion of the story, based on the kabbalistic "rn" messenger archetype. Later, we will reach the "Smith" portion (theory below), then the "Teller" portion, for calling down dangerous celestial energies.

Halfway-independent of the above, I think "Smith" has the kabbalistic meaning of "one who knows the value of things" which we get from Adam Smith.

*** Theorization in the comment thread has Sarah herself as the friend.

I am not entirely sure I buy it.

Guesses as to the identity of Sarah:

- Ana or Aaron, or some future ally of theirs, having timetravelled back in time and used invisibility to arrange these shenanigans, and therefore has the predictive powers ascribed here by being from a future where it was true.
- Sarah the internet which was collectively ensouled and is busy becoming a superintelligence, and is using Ana and Aaron as a distraction.
- Sarah the computer individually
- Alvarez or the Comet King or Sohu or someone else in the giant "mysterious powers and not-fully-explained-backstory" list.

**** I don't think it can be Sarah. Even assuming that the vital name made Sarah independent, which I'm skeptical of (since Sarah didn't get the animal soul), there hasn't been enough time to get very many names. Most names wouldn't be useful in breaking into an unsong detention facility. Three names which are perfect for it coming out of a small set of random names is too much. This would have to be someone who ALREADY has a lot of names, not merely someone with the ability to find names. Sarah the internet would qualify potentially, but has other issues

***** As a counterpoint, if Sarah was independent I don't think that too little time has passed in order for it to purchase computing power and vastly increase its ability to churn through names. So it might be that the set of new names is very, very large.

But we don't know to what extent the ensouling worked, or how it worked.

****** Sarah wouldn't know the vital name, even if it can still be used. We don't know exactly what the vital name targets, and neither would Sarah even if independent-humans had the vital name applied to them and didn't know how to apply it to other things or what the exact requirements of human involvement were. So even if Sarah managed to get a lot of computing power, Sarah might not know how to move itself onto the bigger cluster.

******** Well, I suspect the Animal Soul Name would count as the 'right kind of software', but no one used the Animal Soul Name on Sarah. And a computer with the Animal Soul Name and the Divine Soul Name but not the Moral Soul Name sounds really bad. But without the Animal Soul or Moral Soul it seems like Sarah would be rather lacking in drives that aren't explicitly programmed in. Animal Soul might give you self-preservation, and moral soul might make you helpful, but in the absence of either of those why do anything (except the 'software soul', but that just says 'run llul in a non-consequentialist way')

Assuming that this is correct in Unsong's universe, at least in its broad strokes, then that means that future ensouled computers will need to be derived from Sarah, perhaps by copying her software and transplanting it to new computers.

***** I had forgotten about that.

Two possible ideas: something klipah related happened, whether due to to a new OS in general, the harddrive being encrypted, the audio codec, or something else. They should have run Bill Dodd's computer with Llull long enough to see if it could discover a name.

Llull only detects /new/ names and the feeling that goes with them. All computers share one soul (until new ones are manufactured) so it was not a new discovery. They should have had Sarah search for the moon-finding Name again.
