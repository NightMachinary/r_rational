*** Though given the bonus chapter, that may not be the case. Sure, it wasn't as dramatic as what captain did there, but apparently messing with name-givers can result in new names anyways.

Either way, it's certain that take is her aspect.

*** Presumably the universe has a similar story to the Arthurian legend of the sword in the stone. In it, only the "true king" can take the sword.

I'm guessing that Catherine made a play at being the heir to the king of Callow and that the sword is on Callowan land. If so, she can pull out the sword and presumably use the angelic magic within the sword / ritual to restore her life. The Angels owe her because she set up the story to take the claim the sword, so denying her the magic inside it would be like the sword rejecting her. (As was mentioned previously, only angelic magic can truly restore life.)

***** In chapter 15, Catherine brings up that there are no goblins or orcs with Names, and Black says that the Miezans are responsible for the orcs' lack of names since they dismantled orc cultures that give names. He also says that their main name was Warlord. I'm guessing that you're right, but there was nobody to give the name to without being noticed previously.

On a sidenote, in chapter 16, there's the promise between Catherine and Hakram where he names her Warlord and she names him Adjutant. Maybe Catherine will grow into the name of Warlord, especially with the aspect of Take.

****** I mean, I think that place is where claimants went to try for the name, if there's any elements of ritual to namings that don't have a prior claimant alive. That this is the holy place where you could become Warlord, and while the name might still be around, the orc's traditional acquisition source has just been killed.

A more terrifying possibility is that Captain is a corrupted form of Warlord, which means the name is closer to returning than ever before, and only held down by Captain. On the other hand, it means the name won't be back for a while. It looked like she was going to become a Warlord in there, after all.

"Warlord is an orc Name, now used as a courtesy title by some greenskins the same way “Tyrant” is for Dread Emperors/Empresses. Catherine is not an orc, not particularly well versed in their culture and numerically speaking the majority of her followers are humans."

which leads to Catherine claiming it's actually Callowan ground and gets the Lone Swordsman to back her up. This is what Catherine needed.

If Catherine had tried to bring this up without the Heiress's claim, she wouldn't have gotten backing from the Lone Swordsman.

****** Quote from the author: "Queen of Blades was a nickname for Elizabeth Alban, and was only ever applied to her. Her actual Name was Queen of Callow.". So technically, yes a Queen of Blades role could be created, but if the woman called that couldn't make the role happen, it seems unlikely. And considering her character, if she were to become a queen Queen of Callow would be a much more appropriate for Catherine than Queen of Blades
