Just in case the author takes the story down anyway, I think I've managed to coax the Wayback Machine to archive the currently available chapters, available [[https://web.archive.org/web/20180813222138/https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3323184/1/Aeromancer][here]].

*** I don't care if he does have a problem with distributing offline copies; if he's just gonna abandon the work, I don't care what he wants. I don't really support intellectual property anyway. If he had a good reason, maybe, but if it's something like believing that his previous work was sinful and would be corrupting minds, then I have no problem with going against the person he was turned into's wishes. It's probably what the pre-brainwashing version of him would have wanted anyway.

So even if you take these down, I'll post them back up. I don't mean that in a rude or hostile way (towards you at least, somewhat hostile towards whoever brainwashed him though), though I understand it sounds like it.

First, I would argue that ownership is a statement of moral rights that law is instituted to protect. The law follows from the ownership, not the ownership from the law. Second, the law does not give ownership over ideas, merely a temporary monopoly over some expressions of those ideas. Copyrights and patents are there to reward and incentivize creators in exchange for releasing their writing and inventions to the public, not to give perpetual control over an idea to the first person to express it.

**** I'm actually kinda worried about him. I don't know if this is what happened, but given that it was a 'bible camp', the story I'm jumping to in my head is that he (a minor, I'm assuming, given that he was sent to a bible camp) was an atheist, which his parents discovered and sent him to a VERY heavy duty religious camp, where he would be all but brainwashed. Either they succeeded, or (and I hope for his sake that if the version of events I'm imagining is true, that this is what happened) he pretended to have been successfully brainwashed in order to ease the pressure on him and hopeful escape unindoctrinated.

This is just the idea of what happened that's running around in my head, and while it seems plausible, we really don't have enough evidence to conclude any of what I said. It's just a possibility I'm worried about is all.

The plausibility of the update is interesting to contemplate, though. Whether true or not, it's true that we don't know much about the author or other people online.

*** If it is indeed a hack, it appears [[/u/Gelifyal]]'s Royalroad, Patreon and Fictionpress accounts are compromised, but their Reddit account is intact, since this is the only medium in which they didn't actively communicate the serial's end. That's a relatively severe hack, but far from unthinkable if they were sloppy with password reuse.

On the other hand, I would expect at least one of these sites, Patreon in particular, to have slightly better secondary security measures in place. I'm also surprised that a malicious actor would take down the Patreon and post updates everywhere but leave the story itself up. It's a strangely halfway measure.

That's true. It's also halfway in the sense that the author didn't post to the reddit about their decision. They were quite active here, so I would have expected something--unless the hacker didn't want to go to the trouble.

Then again, it's plausible the author didn't want to face arguments against the decision from the rational reddit.

Author mentioned earlier that

-his weekends are dedicated to other activities (presumably more important then the story)

-story was designed with multiple drop points

-something else I dont remember

Specified reason might be a joke, but the drop is entirely possible.

A pity, since the story was very promising, on par with MoL.

** If this turns out to not be a joke, I truly wish the author the best of luck and happiness. Its not that uncommon that one will need to stop something he likes and enjoyes to better the rest of his/her life (think about stopping gaming or other hobbys while studying or starting a new job etc.. or because of getting kids/married). I think Aeromancer had the potential to end up as a mayor success not only as a rational story or online novel but even as a published and finished book. But actually the current plot point is absolutly enough to end it as is, as a short story. Seti succeded in joining the world of mancers and even to attend Prestige so all his dreams and wishes got fullfilled and the rest lies in the future.

All I would then hope for would be for the author to publish his work on worldbuilding etc ... as i would be truly interested in those kind of materials and also to see where the story could have been going.

Also the END Authors Message at the end of chapter 14 on fictionpress got eddited and now includes the same message. So it seems to be real.
