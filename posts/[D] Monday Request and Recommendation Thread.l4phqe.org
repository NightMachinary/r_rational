Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I have been enjoying “Beware of Chicken” on royal road ([[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken]]) a lot lately.

Beware of Chicken is a xianxia isekai series that follows the journey of Jin Rou after his death at the hands of an inner sect member. Our protagonist is inserted into Jin rou's body only to promptly quit the sect to become a farmer.

*** It's about the purest "numbers go up" LitRPG I can think of. I do wish it would branch out a little with the character voices though. The sheer number of repetitions of a snarky/sarcastic male-identifying companion being brought on a tour of everywhere the protagonist has visited to that point is getting a little old.

You could snip entire back-and-forths between her and the former-dagger/former-king/Meadow/elf-dragon, then mad-lib the power references to match the flavour of her current companion, and it'd be very hard to tell which of the tours the material came from. Throw in the pirate, the curse-elf, and the fire-fox for shorter sequences of the same template.

** I've recently been enjoying a lot of smaller scale works, and one thing I noticed a lot of these stories share is that they take place within one set location.

Think Fall of the House of Usher or the thriller-suspense movie Hush. All the suspense and action is tied into one house.

I've been trying to think of other works that do this and for the most part I keep reverting back to horror/suspense. I understand the reasons for why that story telling mechanic is so useful here, but surely there are other genres that make good use of this too right?

Some of my favorite parts of long running series certainly have aspects of this during a climatic arc but then its back to traveling the nation/world/etc.

So anybody know of any work that prominently features one set location? Doesn't matter the genre or medium, just ask that it be something you would actually recommend as good. Something in a rational/rationalist vein would be a plus but not necessary.

Some other examples off the top of my head that I've enjoyed:

- Fly - Breaking bad episode that's just in one room
- Breakfast Club
- Source Code - which actually if anyone else knows of groundhog day stuff that's very small scale like this that'd be great.

*** - The Cabin at the End of the World (short novel): A (gay, but I don't really think that matters) couple and their daughter gets unexpected visitors in the form of four very odd home invaders. The entire book is basically a hostage negotiation. 5/5 and while maybe not a central example of “rational fiction”, is scratches many of the same itches.

- Phonebooth (movie): Colin Farrel answers a ringing phonebooth. The caller is the sniper trained at the phonebooth. The entire movie takes place in or around said phonebooth.

- Buried (movie): Ryan Reynolds is buried alive by insurgents while working as a contractor in Afghanistan. The movie is basically all dialogue, with close up shots of Reynolds' face lit up by a phone screen.

- Alien (movie): The crew of a space freighter respond to a distress call and picks up, well, you guessed it.

- Cordyceps (written fiction; web original): Rat fic. The protagonist wakes up in a hospital (?) with memory loss, and the staff won't tell him why he's there, and certainly won't tell him why a long-term acquaintance is in the next room. Lots of hypothesising about what's going on and explicit explanations of the MC's reasoning. Quite short, and one of the best pieces of web original fiction I've read.

- Testimony Before an Emergency Session of the Naval Cephalopod Command (short story): This arguably counts as a single-location story since it is all testimony delivered at the titular session. Some cool ideas about how intelligence relates to theory of mind. (If you liked Peter Watts' Blindsight you'll probably like this as well).

- I Identify Sexually as an Attack Helicopter (short story): A short story published in Clarkesworld maybe a year back, but has since been scrubbed from most places because some assholes who didn't read it decided it was anti-trans. It takes place in the cockpit of an attack helicopter (who'd have thought), and explores what the famous meme would actually mean in practice: What would it /actually/ entail to sexually identify as an attack helicopter? I'm still not sure I agree with the author's implicit assertion that it is even meaningful to sexually identify as something orthogonal to the man-woman spectrum, but after reading it I was certainly less sure than i was before.

- The Test by Sylvain Neuvel (novella): A recent immigrant to the UK is taking a citizenship test when masked gunmen occupy the classroom. Entirely contained within a few rooms, and contains a bunch of rationalist tropes (questions like “Given this information, what is the likely state of the world?”).

*** The classic bottle episode. Like already said, /12 Angry Men/ is required movie-watching. It's not perfectly rational, but it's just damn good.

More contemporary: Tom Hardy as /Locke/ chronicles a guy driving a car one night and the phone calls he makes (to his subordinates, wife, and mistress). A whole movie carried by Hardy's acting, basically, and I think it was a good time-killer.

Closer to horror-movie territory is the cult classic /Cube/, featuring the eponymous murder room. Also in the 'strangers wake up in a strange place and things happen there' genre: /Circle/ (2015) which was . . . okay.

It's probably not relevant as a recommendation, but Luigi's Mansion is a great Gamecube game featuring the titular mansion. It can be emulated onto Dolphin if you've, ah, 'lost' your own copy in the past ;)

For another example of single location movie that's not actually a horror, there's “Carnage”. “Destination wedding” is a weird case in that it's relatively limited in locations, but it's a lot more limited in cast. The whole movie is just Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider cynically quipping at each other. You may love or utterly despise that.

Honourable mention for a comedy example: the half episode “Nothing to room” from the anime show “Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt” is literally all a single shot of a couch.

** The most recent chapters of /[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy]]/ have been focused a lot on what can or might be capable of thinking, and what that might mean (in addition to a bunch of plot going on). In particular the sort of shape the whole of (their) human society forms and how that might be a thinking thing independent of the humans that make it up, to some degree. Does anyone have any recommendations for works that explore similar ideas? Stuff like :

- fractal intelligences where the sub-parts are themselves intelligent (e.g. what sort of minds are formed by human organization)
- thoughts that think themselves
- environments that are fertile ground for producing things that think
- the nature of conscious thought
- what a "self" even is

The only other thing that really comes to mind is Nighzmarquls' excellent /[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence][Onward To Providence]]/ ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/][SB]]) ([[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.45926/][SV]]) which /definitely/ covers some of this ground, with things like the character who is actually a micro-polity made up of a market of individual agents bidding on things, cultures that are capable of flirting (like, the whole culture, not the members of it) with characters who are actually able to reciprocate, or beings that are mostly or entirely made up of information and have to continuously think themselves into existence.

*** Wildbow's [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][Pale]] has some truly fascinating ideas about consciousness. Within the first arc, there's a Ritual Incarnate, which is basically a sentient lethal "game" that self-propagates by drawing in new people. Other examples include the Forest Ribbon Trail, which is part of the Paths, a realm partially made up of the collective human dreamscape; the Callers of City Spirits, people who work with the incarnation of an entire city; a Dog of War, which is an animus (human-shaped thing) that naturally emerges in mass casualty events and is spiritually made up from fragments of the dead, evolving with every human it kills; a Ghoul inhabiting a casette player that feeds on abandoned children who died of medical causes after basically being their last friend; the ability to cut away parts of your human Self, Soul, and Spirit to make yourself into something more than human; and Cig, a sentient (?) cigarette that only communicates with the rest of the world by burning holes into a map to indicate intruders.

The story approaches the question of "how much can we call this sentient" from the angle of "hey doesn't that... thing... deserve rights as well?" because the entire world is really really cut-throat and most Practitioners don't think anything about summoning and enslaving Others, which our main protagonists are much more sceptical of.

***** I dunno what the other guy is about. Pale has rather dark moments, like all of Wildbow's stories so far, but in total it's less dark.

Pact spoilers: Blake was often alone and had no one to depend on for most of the story. Even the people who he should have been able to depend on were often set against him by circumstances (an effect of his seven generations' worth of bad karma). The three protagonists from Pale don't have that problem; they awakened as a trio, and therefore the world itself is invested in keeping them together. There's arguments between them, but they're usually of the "You're doing this thing we all agreed is bad for you, you're worrying us" angle. Also they're thirteen, there's lots of moments where they're just... being kids having fun playing with cool magic.

If you want a low-spoilers look at the limit of how dark Pale gets, you can read [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/06/06/lost-for-words-1-z/][Interlude 1.Z]], that's pretty much the biggest gut-punch we've gotten so far.

** I just read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47701.InterWorld][InterWorld]], by M. Reaves and N. Gaiman.

Honestly, it's not all that great or rational, pretty typical YA stuff, but ten years ago I would've loved it. Multiverse, science, magic, all the big words like "Singularity", "Möbius strip", "Klein Bottle", conscious-centric interpretation of the quantum uncertainty principle - and it's used to tell the story of a boy who joins a multi-dimensional organization of his alt-world doppelgängers who fight against two armies that try and force the entire multiverse under either a scientific or a magical paradigm. I would've loved it if they'd /done something/ with that "versions of this boy exist in every universe, no matter its underlying metaphysical/magical principles". Stuff like explore how their different upbringings shaped them. Stuff like have some of them join the magic-fascist army, or the tech fascist army. Or I dunno, use the different alt-versions of him to externalize some kind of conflict within him. Or have some kind of conflict with how some versions of him are male and others female. I dunno, I just feel the way it was used kinda wasted the potential that format had.

And maybe that happens in the other parts of the series, but right now I'm not feeling like investing the time to find out.

As it stands, the book is good popcorn reading, but not really a must-read. Gaiman's other works that I've read or experienced, namely Good Omens and American Gods, stand head and shoulders above this one.

The MC is about as rational as you can expect, given that she's got the body of a kid, which is to say she knows herself pretty well and seeks her own best future and best self... and mangos. And flying, and fireballs, and healing people, and mangos, and long hot baths, and definitely mangos.

I like the setting and the system well enough, and I like the other characters quite a bit. The author does a good job with team dynamics, banter, and friendships/working relationships in general.

**** Eh, no, I don't agree. I'll give three reasons:

1 - The population pressure argument made in-setting (that is, women held as second class citizens as a measure to maintain high population growth).

2 - It could just be arbitrary; if such an arbitrary thing grew (and it could, even with zero merit) it could calcify.

3 - There could still be biological gender differences (though obviously miniscule compared to the stat differences of Classers). Children will have their initial attitudes towards gender influenced by their pre-unlock experience, and maintain that at least subconsciously.

None of these reasons is commanding, but none of these reasons is bullshit, and the first one is offered explicitly in-text.

That said, even if the reason were purely Doylist, it would be unlikely to lower my opinion of the story. Sometimes people want to write about a thing, and that's fine.

I'm writing a 1st person limited POV, so I literally can't get information to the reader that the protagonist doesn't know. I've thought long and hard on it, and have dozens of different ways and interlocking pieces for the existence of sexism in the setting, but again - without being able to get that information to the MC, there's no way to show it to the reader.

Effectively, she acts her physical age, with a massive host of additional information to draw on - while she's treated as a kid. Dont want to give too much away though.

Either way I maintain, baseline, that redoing the 0-3 years does nothing to advance your “age”, and the rest is a natural extension off of that.

  they developed all over the planet for different reasons in different places and for the most part the reasoning behind it was quite nonsensical
#+end_quote

Social norms usually do provide utility for the society in question /when they first get instituted/, or at the very least they don't meaningfully cost any. Even if the reasoning is faulty, the underlying cause that led to the norm usually has a reason for existing. If social norms start being detrimental, for most of human history the society in question would usually get absorbed or destroyed by another. Maybe Carthage would still be around if it didn't sacrifice children to their gods, or more likely it had nothing to do with it because it's a relatively small part of their society. In the case of a patriarchal social order in which women are relegated entirely to breeding, child-rearing, and tasks which can be accommodated whilst/between breeding/child-rearing, it's such a major and consistent part of every society we know of that you can't dismiss it as simply "nonsensical".

Just on the basis of pure math--without opening an anthropology book-- it's possible to see that a society that didn't culturally enforce the role of broodmares on women would quickly get out-numbered by a society that did do so, and then that egalitarian society would get conquered and extinguished. Check out this [[https://calculator.academy/population-growth-calculator/][population grown calculator]], you'll see that a difference of 1pp growth year over year can result in a difference of millions of people over a few decades, which is untenable. From a starting population of 100,000, the difference between 2% and 3% growth over a hundred years is 1.2 million people, 700k to 1,900k. This is a dynamic that would remain intensely relevant for all of human history until relatively recently. Even when farming became more efficient and agriculture no longer required 9/10ths of the population to feed the other 1/10ths, that just meant that there were more men available for warfare, and the number of men in a society who could be solely dedicated to war grew and grew.

That's just one cursory examination of "why sexism", a proper one is a career. So while it's true that contemporary "reasoning"(i.e. adoption of legacy norms) for the continued existence of a patriarchal social order are non-nonsensical like you wrote, they are grounded in real and relevant factors, an existential factor, most of the time. When those factors changed and stopped being relevant, so did our society change(with lag).

  the primarily limitation on population growth for most of human history wasnt related to the production of a certain number of offspring but was instead limited primarily by agricultural output, disease, and death during child birth.
#+end_quote

A high mortality rate requires a high fertility rate to achieve a replacement rate. It doesn't matter the cause of mortality since they didn't understand or couldn't address the cause back then. Typically, 50% of children would die before 10 years of age. Just to maintain replacement rate *the average woman would have to have ~5 children*. If you take into account wars, famines, plagues, it's much more, between 6-9 children per woman, just to maintain a baseline. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_Roman_Empire#Fertility][See here the details of fertility of women in roman egypt]], one of the few places in the ancient world we have in depth census data for.

#+begin_quote
  it is also incorrect to say that more efficient farming lead to a higher proportion of society being able to engage in warfare - the people engaged in warfare for most of human history were precisely the same as the people engaged in farming, and the development of a professional soldier class was primarily driven by the formation of more organized states.
#+end_quote

My reference to farming efficiency leading to more men in was about the last few hundred years, not for antiquity. Even in the 17th century ~90% of people still lived and worked in agriculture.

Regardless, your incorrect refutation was itself incorrect. "The formation of more organized states" was in fact *precipitated by more consistent agriculture output*. That is, high fertility areas(nile, yellow river, mesopotamia, indus, etc) allowed more sophisticated nation states to arise, which allowed more intensive agricultural methods and more food output, which allowed bigger and more organized states, and so on and so on.

Additionally, if as you say, most people are engaged in agriculture, and most soldiers in a given society were primarily farmers, then wouldn't a larger population of farmers necessarily give a nation state more soldiers? You seem to be arguing against yourself.

  the idea that patriarchy was a sensible evolution is just not supported by any evidence
#+end_quote

I'm going to steelman your argument rather than dismissing it. Maybe you meant something like:

#+begin_quote
  "the idea that patriarchy was a +sensible evolution+ *natural result of social darwinism* is just not supported by any evidence"
#+end_quote

I think the main problem with this is that there is no evidence regarding the formation of any ancient cultural norms, especially not of the patriarchal social norm, which predates human history and probably human civilization. Just observations, extrapolations, and theories. Some theories have more support, some less. The idea that women were "dominated" in order to ensure their "reproductive labour" is fairly well supported, I believe. Another is that women are further sequestered in order to ensure paternity and the continuation of a husband's genes.

It is all supposition, so I guess in essence you're correct.

#+begin_quote
  there are plenty of agriculture cultures *that did not have features of patriarchy*
#+end_quote

This is... interesting phrasing. I admit genuine ignorance about what you're referring to. There are many societies where women had a more "respectable" and somewhat equitable position in society, the Spartans, the Hittites, the Scythians, Vikings, a lot of Celtic and Germanic tribes, but none of those could be categorized as anything other than patriarchies as far as I know. Maybe matrilineal for some, but beyond that it's a stretch.

I'd be interested in an example or two since you claim there are "plenty" of such societies.

#+begin_quote
  development of patriarchy was most likely driven by ideology

From this point on you lost me. A lot of value judgments based on your social norms.

***** Having read through the story, I have to agree that there's not really a good reason for it to exist. An argument could be made that women would tend towards less dangerous jobs, but that wouldn't be nearly enough to make them second-class citizens the way they are here.

(As a side-note, before puberty there are no real differences in strength due to gender - it's quite common for a girl to be stronger than a boy.)

It's been a constant minor irritant in an otherwise excellent story, which is a shame. I give it 4 stars, with the recommendation that people who are worried about it push on through the early parts where it looks like it's going to affect the protagonist more than it does for [reasons].

****** It exists because the setting is heavily based off of ancient Rome, mixed with MTG's Ixalan. The patriarchy is 'justified' by the strict caste system, the martial culture, the effect of high vitality on incumbent lifespans, and the lack of human planetary domination that would allow greater social development. Besides the issue of 'high mortality rate = strong cultural pressure into motherhood roles,' there are plenty of plain old social reasons that some people would want to, given the opportunity, oppress others for their own benefit.

I think it really adds to the story and the theme of freedom vs obligation. Also, overall, the author has greatly toned down the level of sexism that would be present in such a setting. The MC encounters quite a disproportionate number of 'enlightened heroes' who just so happen to have more egalitarian mindsets for the setting, likely because the story would just be too grim otherwise.

In a violent, high mortality world, many women of a successful 'tribe' would spend a significant amount of their time physically weakened and in need of protection just to meet the rate of replacement. They would naturally have fewer combat capabilities just from spending less time fighting and more time producing new 'tribe' members. It would be human nature for at least some of the men of such tribes to take such an opportunity to hoard power.

The idea that a patriarchy emerging is somehow unrealistic given a fantasy world with an inherently hierarchical system of magic seems a strange conclusion to me. Ultimately, we don't even know all the lore, and we haven't seen anything that makes a patriarchy particularly less likely, either.

** I'm throwing in a strong rec for [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He who fights with monsters]]. not because it is the best out there, but because I had read a few reviews for it which discouraged me from reading the work which turned out to be *completely wrong.*

1. Setting aside how rational the story is its bloody *rationalist!!!* I couldn't believe that I hadn't seen a rec for this here. The MC is (in his own words) "very good at people" (specifically, not good *with* people but *at* people), and the perspective is from a social rationalist (someone who understands and approaches social interactions from a rational perspective). I have personally learnt a lot about social interactions from this story.

2. From a review: "The MC stupidly stays an atheist when there are gods in-front of him." This really tuned me off, because I remember another Isekai story I read in the past which I got completely turned off of when the MC said "I never understood how people on earth could deny the truth [being Christianity in this case]". Being Isekaied is irrefutable proof that your religion (as you believed it) is completely wrong, its just so petty for an author to add a line like that I couldn't believe it XD. I assumed this was the same thing but for atheism, until I read it and its completely the wrong impression; the MC doesn't stay atheist, he stays principled against the very idea of religion (worshiping someone by virtue of their birth not actions). This perspective is completely reasonable and IMO exactly what many in this community would enjoy.

3. Various reviews talking about inconsistencies: From what I read so far (chapter 200) I can't think of any glaring plot holes or unrealistic actions anyone has took really, maybe a little stretching to fit in the overall plot but IMO as good a quality as later chapters of MoL and better than Azarinth healer.

4. Various reviews not liking the MC cos he is pretentious, (comes off as a closet Atheist) etc. He is pretentious, but to me his interactions are believable (and I'd be happy to discuss this) and IMHO I suspect most people put off by him are religious people for obvious reasons (his philosophy is directly antithetical to religion) which colors their opinion.

So, if you haven't tried it because you saw some negative reviews, I recommend you give it a go. Its not perfect or like super incredible but I would say may appeal to this community more than the layman.

**** Yeah, the guy created an MMO-depth system, only with random skills instead of a skill tree. Of all the lame things in this story, that's the worst.

- Each "essence magician"(universally lame naming btw) has 4 essences, and each essence has 5 skills.
- Each skill gets an additional effect every time you levels up.
- At the second level, bronze, an essence magician would have 20 skills with 40 possible effects.

How do you keep track of that AND maintain an interesting narrative with decent pacing? The answer is you don't. Because such a complex system doesn't leave a lot of room for intricacy and depth, it's too much for a reader to handle. So naturally what ends up happening is that despite having dozens of skills, every character is necessarily reduced to a single archetype just like in a system with 10x less details. Just look at Farrah for an example: she has 20 skills with 60 effects, but in combat she's just a glass cannon that spews lava. That's what every character is, in the end.

Add to that:

- what skills you get are random(!!).
- you can't learn additional skills, or spells, or anything magical except for rituals. Those 20 random skills are what you have for the rest of your life.
- You can't change any skills you do get. It's been mentioned that if you get a deleterious skill, something that harms you or doesn't synergize with your kit, you're shit out of luck.
- You have to level each skill individually, and every skill must be leveled in order to rank up
- You feed yourself with... coins? iron, bronze, silver, gold, diamond coins. Why that (modern) arrangement of value? Essences are supposedly a natural part of the world since time immemorial, so Iron was more valuable and rare than bronze until relatively recently, so how does that work? Oh, and diamonds are much more common than anything except iron? And bronze is an alloy and not a natural metal?

The whole thing is sloppily gamified, bad worldbuilding on bad worldbuidling. Even though it's not a bad story, per se, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

It will cascade in perpetuity until the target is dead. Furthermore, he doesn't just load his 3 debuffs into a target and move on. He continues to fight for some reason.

*** Eh. I'm still reading it, but I got to a recent point where, yet again, there was a third-party interlude where people go "well he seems powerful and dangerous yet somewhat reasonable. I guess we better not piss him off, at all" -- for like the 8th time. And it just... the blatant power fantasy was showing through a bit strongly and it was offputting. Still following the updates intermittently, but I don't rate it nearly as highly as I used to.

*** Harry turtledove and SM sterling are two of my favorite alt history authors.

I particularly loved Turtledoves darkness series [[https://www.amazon.com/Into-Darkness-Harry-Turtledove/dp/0765383314][here]] which was a alt history of WWII with a scientific magical system which takes the place of technology. It's executed well and works better than it sounds. He also wrote Guns of the South and many other alt history books.

SM sterling wrote [[https://www.amazon.com/Island-Sea-Time-S-Stirling/dp/0451456750][island in a sea of time]] which is quite good and ends up in the ancient world which may satisfy your desire for pre colonial alt history. He also wrote Dies the Fire and the Novels of the Change. Modern tech fails due to an apparent change in the physical rules of combustion leading to chaos and disaster. Communities struggle to survive and merge old technology with modern understanding to create something new and unique. The first several books of the series were excellent but I dropped them around the 5th book as the introduction of magic was not handled well in my opinion.

I also enjoyed the +Years of Rice and Salt+ [[https://www.amazon.com/Peshawar-Lancers-S-M-Stirling/dp/0451458737][Peshawar Lancers]] in which a meteor shower led to a temporary ice age around the height of the british empire. This leads to widespread starvation and a regress in technology. The book is set a couple decades after the fall as society begins to stabilize and recover. The regress in technology and setting in India give it a different cultural feel that may satisfy your desire for a pre colonial period setting despite it being set in a byproduct of colonialism.

Hope you enjoy! If you happen to have any alt history you enjoy, I'd appreciate any recommendations you have.

*** Not exactly alt-history, but [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-grandmaster-strategist][Grandmaster Strategist]] is a very well written historical story about a Three Kingdoms Analogue China. It has a lot of politics, scheming and of course war. It also has some very interesting martial arts.

*** Not precolonial and kind of a weird alt-history but Twig by Wildbow is really good. The premise is that instead of the industrial revolution, there was a rapid increase in biological sciences resulting in wars being fought with Frankenstein monsters/plagues/chemical weapons/etc. The protagonist is a kid experiment on improving brain function that is focused on social manipulation

** Forty Millenniums of Cultivation.

It's both extremely rational but also so "anti-munchkin"

It's not just self-consistent but consistent with the way we see humans act irl.

The author will go off on long but also genuinely interesting tangents.

It will reexamine its own Nationalism/racism in a far more nuanced way than most other things.

Y'know the trope where the MC has like some evil thing sealed in its head? MC has socratic dialogue with it, and like real socratic dialogue, not like "Don't do bad things" "No me like bad things"

It's very rational, but it's also willing to accept dramatism and emotion as driving forces.

Good takes on philosophy and ethics in general.

Good subversion of the xianxia genre.

Extremely likable protagonist and cast of characters
