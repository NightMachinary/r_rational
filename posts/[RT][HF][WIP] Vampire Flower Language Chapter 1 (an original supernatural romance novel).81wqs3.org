** /In 1944, American deserter named Red falls for a powerful vampire named William - and the feelings seem to be mutual./

/However, Red soon finds that vampires have a complex society with inscrutable rules that must be followed - or else./

/Will they be able to make it work, with their relationship at the fringes of both vampire and human society? Or will Red be caught up in the wrong part of William's many rivalries?/

--------------

This story was written as a direct result of discussions on the Wednesday Worldbuilding and Saturday Munchkinry threads and, while it seems like a shallow romance novel, has a very deep and detailed worldbuilding behind it - and hopefully you'll enjoy how it pays off.

You won't find any "but let me explain, honey!" moments in here, and we've strived for historical accuracy (it's set in 1944).

--------------

So, you might remember me from posts I've made about this on my main account: I've been working on this supernatural romance novel for the last year and a bit, and I've finally been able to post the first chapter!

I'm using an author account because this is actually written by me and a very good friend, so I'm posting this story under our combined pseudonym.

** Sweet! I'm in. :) Deserter, though? Man, that's... I'll give it a shot, but deserting from the military back then, whoa.

*** I'd be interested to hear more about your reaction to the whole deserter aspect! Is there context I'm missing beyond "being a deserter was about the worst thing you could possibly do and nobody will ever speak to you again"?

**** I was military, voluntarily. The concept of serving something larger than yourself, even if it absolutely sucked, was and still is a big deal. To have deserted, something had to have gone really really wrong on a lot of levels.

Like, you're in, right? You are in a unit. You interact with the other people in your unit, with your leadership, and with the mission you are given. Those are the big three.

If you desert you are deserting all three of those things. It means you abandoned friends, or absolutely failed to make friends - or lost the ones you did make. It means you deserted your commander (not as big a deal most times, since most commander are only average. If you desert a good commander, man, wow. A bad one though makes it more likely.)

And you deserted the mission. Even if you're barely alive you are a part of that, of the group struggle to survive. To leave isn't to just betray your country, but to betray all the core values you've been living and working for the entire time you were in the military, voluntary or not. It's a slap at the people- good, bad, and indifferent- who stay and try.

Sometimes it's justified- but rarely. There's usually another way, and often the situation that you're in is temporary. Most folks cope with it by enduring or slacking off or trying to make it better somehow.

To desert is a big deal. You can never go back. It's a sort of self exile, a social isolation.

***** Thank you very much - that is very beautifully put. There's a few passages later on that I would especially value your input in.

(FWIW, since I'm not sure it specifically comes up in the story, Red was drafted and narrowly missed out on being one of the many casualties in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cisterna][Battle of Cisterna]])

****** Ahhhhhh, yeah. If you've lost everything - and you would have truly loved some of those folks like brothers, problems and all- walking away from your life would seem a lot more reasonable.

That bit would explain a lot. The casualty rate described there is horrific. That said, it helped prevent a German victory down the line. That... Would be difficult to hear though, from leadership who would never have seen the piles of bodies of their best friends. Survivor's guilt would be a heavy thing.

** I like it so far. I'm looking forward to seeing more details on the vampires' culture. Honestly, I think it promises to be interesting, I particularly like the influence of immortality on opera length. The romance so far seems good enough to me(Also, the way I'm imagining this makes it look incredibly cute). I don't usually read romance, but this seems like a familiar pattern. Shy, cute, awkward meets rich, powerful, confident.

The upcoming interlude will have some of that!

Yep, the romance itself is very in line with established tropes: I remember when I was in high school we studied /Pride and Prejudice/, and this is what my teacher said the defining elements of a romance story were:

1. Hero is more rich/status/etc than the heroine

2. Conflict to break them apart

3. Happy ending

aside: the teacher also said that a romance novel that met all the criteria but was not heterosexual didn't count. 17-year-old me, of course, wrote a 20 page romance short story that included all the necessary elements but was two men. It was set in ancient egypt. I gave it to her to prove her wrong; she of course never read it. I posted it on deviantart and I think fictionpress at the time so I could probably rustle it up, I haven't read it in 10+ years but I can't imagine it would be very good

** minor note on style, I thought the first use of "look a gift horse in the mouth" was a little unnecessary, though not the sort of thing that I think would bother most people. The second use of it on the other hand was repetitive and weird

I've removed the second one, and another one from the yet-to-be-uploaded third chapter that seems equally out of place now I think about it.
