***** Both views have been found in the EU, across the entire ideological spectrum from that there is only one Force - the light - to there is only a dark side a la the Warp. One Sith Lord went as far to say as that the Force was some sort of insidious god, and attempted to destroy it. The fact that the player character was heroically obliged to stop her was one of the most difficult times I had convincing myself I wasn't actually being forced by the game to play the villain! The Force being an artificial creation of the EU's most powerful Precursor race has been an idea as well.

Essentially, with a world as big as the Expanded Universe, pretty much every idea about the Force - including its lack of existence - has been thrown around at some point. ;)

** Aren't dark and light matter a naturally occurring binary(actual question, not a physicist)? I'm trying to think of more but I suppose most are actually just the presence and absence of a single thing. Actually, if you want to go full blown reductionist I suppose you'd just say dark and light matter are just different things altogether, which is the type of argument a reductionist would use for any such claim. But that seems to me more a product of assumption and method than evidence of the universe working that way. If I assume apriori that everything can be reduced to zero's, one's and infinities(which reductionism seems to do) then I shouldn't be surprised if that's what I find because any two's I "find" I'll just reduce to separate categories.

I don't see (or it isn't explained) why there are fewer Jedi now and how the problem of the Force will be solved. Generally speaking, if the rules of the universe make x% of sentients force users, and if y% of those users "go bad" if trained in Jedi techniques, while z% go bad if left untrained, then x*min(y,z) percent of the sentients will always be bad force users.

****** Nice explanation!

Thinking about it some more, a potential issue with a plan of genetically eradicating force sensitivity is that it isn't very robust. Suppose you succeed but miss just one person, some random guy hiding on some asteroid. If that one guy has descendants that are force-sensitive they will likely become Sith lords (as there is only the dark side of the force) and there will be no Jedi to oppose them.

In other words, if this goal is only accomplished to 99.999% the plan may end up doing more harm than good.

Edit: actually, in some ways such a scenario is inevitable. Imagine what happens if force-sensitivity is genetic and based on a complicated combination of genes and finally rare enough so that there have been no Jedi for generations. Eventually, though, someone gets the force-sensitive combination of genes, and what will that person do?

Of course, Palpatine is justified in thinking it very unlikely that Anakin will be making such objections.

It's not so easy to locate all "force-sensitive users". You'd push them underground if you forcefully tried to eradicate them. So instead you want to provide an incentive for force-sensitive users to come forth themselves. Thus a prestigious Jedi Order, honored and respected by all, which will also deliberately breed itself out of existence the moment no new Force users can be found (and their task will then have been done).

*** One other lore complication is that Dooku was on the losing end of his battle with Yoda and only escaped with his life because he threw a pillar at Anakin and Obi-wan as a distraction before running away. Also, Dooku was a fully trained Jedi Master (by Yoda, no less) before becoming a Sith Lord, so it sort of seems like the Dark Side didn't help him all that much.

This can all be chalked up to Palpatine being manipulative rather than any actual error though. He'd just have to be reasonably confident that Anakin wouldn't call him on it. I suppose that Anakin would be more than ready to believe that Dooku was a superior foe given that Anakin lost an arm in that duel; people like hearing that the guy they lost to had an unfair advantage, because it means that it wasn't a personal failing on their part.

***** I think the best way to make sense of the Jedi's canonical beliefs about the prophecy is that they saw the Force as being like a spinning top or a see-saw. To their way of thinking, the Light Side /was/ balance and the Dark Side was unbalanced. If we're using the see-saw metaphor, then love pushes down one end and hate pushes down the other, and they feed each other, causing more unbalance as the see-saw goes back and forth. Or if we're using the spinning top metaphor, love/anger/fear cause the Force to start wobbling on its axis, which gets exacerbated really easily and is difficult to recover from.

So to the Jedi Masters, ten thousand Jedi and two Sith basically means that the Force is almost entirely balanced with just a small unbalancing to it, and the prophecy about the chosen one meant elimination of the Sith, bringing the Force back to perfect balance (and thus, the Light Side). Or to use another metaphor, the chosen one is going to remove the last of the impurities in the water. (This is canonical to Legends but non-canon to the current universe, though it's not been contradicted.)

So if the Jedi at the top really believe that everything has been flipped on its head - the natural state of the Force is imbalance, which I guess still works with the spinning top metaphor - then their interpretation doesn't have to change. The Force is naturally imbalanced, the chosen one is going to be bring balance to the Force, that can't be anything but a good thing, right?

In the SW canon, there's also a family of ancient, deific beings who somehow control and/or personify this abstract balance as anchorites. I suspect the only meaningful definition of balance is to be found in these beings, whose affairs don't have much to do with the movies' events at all, and even less to do with Anakin, who may very well be a Sith creation (by Darth Plagueis) in an attempt to bring into being their own prophesied savior.

****** Not any one series, but sourcebooks and Wookieepedia would give more details. To summarise:

There were many tens of thousands of Jedi with Jedi Lords ruling the Republic as Chancellors, multiple temples, conclaves and academies, during the close of the Draggulch Period, for instance, and before Nomi Sunrider's reforms following the Great Sith War, love wasn't forbidden, with multiple ancient Jedi families such as the Qel-Dromas. This contrasts to the Jedi Order during the prequels, where power is centralised in the Jedi Temple, no more Jedi generations (outside of the Corellian and Altisian Jedi splinter sects, that is), and 'only' approximately 10,000 Jedi at the start of Order 66.

The no-attachment policies and end of Jedi dynasties took place long before the Reformation, and as for dwindling numbers of Jedi, no reason is given.

My own idea to make the handmaiden-switcheroos more interesting would be that "Queen Amidala" is a constructed persona, all the 'handmaidens' taking turns acting out the central role of Queen Amidala and in reality ruling by majority. Padme would be merely one of the "Queen Amidalas" that exist, not the only one.

I'm guessing that idea could actually be combined with yours: if Padme had retired from the role of "Queen Organa" already by movie 3, Vader would not think that a child born to Queen Organa had anything to do with him (and in reality it would be an old friend of Padme's adopting her old friend's child.)

Obi-Wan must be "moving on" to become one with the Force a scant few years after the movies. Now, if we realise "becoming one with the Force" is merely a nice way of dressing up the permanent dissolution of identity, the Jedi remain deathists, and the few who borrowed other Forceful traditions' techniques to temporarily guide the living did so with a sense of sacrifice, citing becoming one with the Force - their ultimate demise - was the will of the Force and so on!
