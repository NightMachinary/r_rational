Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I've noticed recently that I have a muscle-memory habit of clicking on my right-most tab when I have a moment of distraction, and apparently I can make drastic increases to my productivity solely by positioning my active writing project as the [right]-most tab. This works better for me than productivity "rewards" seem to, and I'm trying to think about the pitfalls and possibilities for other things.

I think the biggest problem long-term is going to be the wearing down of muscle memory, since the muscle memory seems to be keyed to "need a distraction". Any advice for building muscle memory back up, or self-improvement that uses it? It's surprisingly effective for me, in a way that things like blocking specific sites is (somewhat) ineffective.

My personal workflow is to always have two accounts on every computer: a games account and a work account.

The games account has steam and battlenet shortcuts with auto-login, bookmarks to Youtube and Inoreader (my RSS feed aggregator), stuff like that. It helps me avoid distraction, by explicitly switching between a "work" mode and a "browse reddit and play overwatch" mode. These days, my workflow is even more segregated, because I use a desktop PC with windows for games, and a laptop in a different room with linux installed for work.

*** Regarding self-improvement via muscle memory, I had a bad habit I'd been trying to break for years, then one day I decided to try this technique where I would snap my fingers every time I did it. This didn't really do anything other than draw my attention to the fact that I was doing it; eventually I would snap my fingers before doing the thing, and then finally I would snap my fingers and not do the thing at all. It helped way more than anything I had tried before. Unfortunately, I seem to have regressed recently, after about a year of enjoying being free. RIP :(

Regarding writing, I found that I can be way more productive if I write in a notebook (far away from my computer, I mean, like, a mile away from my apartment, for example) and copy into the computer later. Doesn't help with editing though.

**** I used to use Scrivener, which seems very similar, and wrote ~4 novels and two novellas using it, totaling ~500K words. I think there are definitely some benefits, but those benefits are geared more toward professional publication or intensive, small scale editing. If all I want to do is put words on paper, then it's better to have something lightweight, and while I wouldn't consider Google Docs to be lightweight, it does its job well enough so long as you don't go over a certain word limit, which I avoid by splitting the project up into chapters. My current project is at ~600K words and working well within that framework, though I would probably convert it into a different form if I intended to do intensive editing rather than preparing chapters for immediate release as a web serial.

(I /am/ curious whether yWriter runs into performance problems once past 200K words, because Scrivener definitely did, though that might be because the developers put their priorities toward the Mac version and I was using the PC version.)

Though one problem with artificially maintaining such a reward system is that I'm not sure what could work as the reward itself.

** MagicWeasel's personal life overshare, go!

Just got back from a great fun holiday, and had my first day back at work yesterday (people thought I was crazy having my first day on a Friday, but it was great: I was at work and suddenly aware of how much being at work sucks, but I now have two days to recover before I have to face the reality of my job requiring me to work 5 days a week).

Anyway, it turns out that my application for an EOI in another department got accepted while I was away, so on Thursday I will stop being a project manager and start working in the road safety department! An EOI is a "temporary transfer/promotion" where you fill in for someone in another department who has left, and then go back to your original job at the end. Mine is unfortunately not a temporary promotion, it's just a sideways move, but I think those of you who read my offtopic threads about my dissatisfaction with my current job (specifically the management) will know how excited I am to both learn new skills and have a change of management. So yeah, that's gonna happen! I'm excited.

In terms of writing I have missed so many self-imposed deadlines for VFL and I don't like to blame other people but seriously it's all my coauthor's fault - but she's going to be in a much better position soon and I might give her my PC since I'm planning on upgrading so she'll actually have her own computer, maybe, instead of having to borrow a laptop from her work.

** Just thought I'd share a few life details: I quit my job at the end of June (after giving proper notice), and left the state of Oregon entirely. I am now living a quasi-nomadic lifestyle, staying with family and friends. (I haven't yet verified whether I can collect unemployment, but I have been filling out the paperwork just in case. It kind of looks like I will be getting a check.)

At my job I was doing computer software support with a small amount of programming, whereas I mainly wanted to be doing programming. My former employer only hires programmers who have a degree, and I had only completed about a year's worth of college. So I was gradually getting bored and discontent, and was confronted about the fact that I apparently wasn't giving it my all any more. They moved me to a position with an MySQL coding emphasis about 3 months before I quit, but by then I had the bug to move, so I did.

Now I'm in Georgia, staying with a retired space engineer and contributing to the Seed Factory project, which is adjacent to self replicating robotics. The project's work is mainly not physical at this point, so much as gathering information and planning. However, physical proximity will make it possible to stay involved, and Dani has offered me a place to stay while I attend a local school a few miles away. It is a much quieter environment than I had before, and (paused due to thunderstorm)

** I'm helping my partner out with some analyses she's doing for one of her projects, using Stan to fit some GLMMs* to a medical dataset she's collected, and am reminded of an amusing tension (paradox? inconsistency?) I've noticed before wrt Bayesian inference -- one of the big selling points people tout is that Bayes lets you encode your prior beliefs, but I almost never see people doing that!

Sometimes that's just because one's actual prior beliefs regarding the components of some complicated model are hard to coherently or exhaustively specify (my own work is frequently like this), but I also think it's because if you're honestly quite confident that (e.g.) some effect is large and positive and specify that belief in the joint prior, and then get a large and positive (or otherwise informative/meaningful) distribution in that parameter's marginal posterior, your reviewers will (perhaps inappropriately) call your results into question (related: I've heard it repeated that if you want to “lie” with stats, lying with the prior is way too transparent -- better to just cook the likelihood (or the data))! Obviously you can examine nuanced shifts in corresponding distributions or look at kl divergence or w/e, but those are often hard to appreciate, especially if your reviewers are domain-experts more than they are methods people.

So instead people always specify conservative or vague/"uninformative" priors (e.g. expected effect = 0), even when there's good reason to expect something else (and then rightfully do some prior sensitivity analysis). So there goes that selling point! Am I mistaken in my expression here? Is it just the papers I read that do this? I do see “weakly informative” priors on focal parameters every so often but not nearly as often as one might expect.

*(w/ 100k+ nominal parameters for the most complicated model -- her PI amusingly expected results on his desk within an hour, which I feel happens often? I guess b/c people are used to just used to just running chi-squared tests on contingency tables or w/e -- which is what they were doing before -- and that takes some fraction of a second. So when I'm like -- it'll take me a week or two to specify/implement these models, fit them, run mcmc diagnostics, do model comparison/averaging, and visualize the results, they get impatient. Never mind that it took months and $100s of k to collect the actual data, the analysis is just a minor afterthought! even though they'll not be publishing the dataset itself anyway! /rant/ he also wants a figure representing the model(s) so I'm gonna send him some plate diagrams lol)

*** I think there's a distunction between updating on data and making predictions. When publishing analyses of data the prior doesn't matter too much - you just build models and find their [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/share-likelihood-ratios-not-posterior-beliefs.html][likelihood ratio]]. But when you make a prediction, you need a prior and you need to review the other evidence available to you.

**** I'm a little... confused by the linked blog post. It's very common to share /marginal/ likelihood ratios for model comparison, but ofc those are often /very/ prior sensitive. The blog is instead suggesting the sharing likelihood ratios of various pairs of points in the model's parameter-space, which maybe makes sequential analyses /slightly/ easier when you have a very simple model with a very simple statespace -- here, they seem to take everyone's favorite toy example (coin flipping) and instead of specifying the usual beta prior (which is extra nice for being conjugate to the binomial likelihood) simplify it even further by loading all the prior density (now prior mass, I guess) onto two points {0.5, 0.75}. If they want to share information it'd be much easier to just share their number of heads and trials, but apparently "they don't have time or memory enough to" remember those two numbers (and if the trials are non-independent so they need to remember their order and not just their sum, they're definitely not specifying their model correctly).

Outside toy examples people will usually have different models with multidimensional, continuous parameter-spaces, which makes any sharing of likelihood ratios way to onerous. You get an even stronger curse of dimensionality than with e.g. grid approximation, because your reported values are now pairwise. So in e.g. the most complicated model I mentioned above, if I have ~100k continuously valued parameters (and a few thousand discrete) and can identify the relevant space for each (since many are defined on the reals) and want, say, 100 points on the grid for each, I'd be sharing 1E200000 choose 2 ish, which is a lot lol.

But maybe I'm just misunderstanding things.

***** I think this is a good point, but the same challenge is more or less faced by sharing posterior probabilities. And the way you get around it is by fitting some continuous function to explain the probability, or just using graphs, or reporting particularly important models. And I think the same sorts of strategies can help when reporting probability updates rather than final probabilities, with bonus points for reporting your data in an easy-to-use way.

** I stopped reading To The Stars a few days ago, and I regret needing to. It has some fun military science fiction, good world building, and I think is decently well written. I don't have any real problems with the execution. But I just cannot get over the premise of magical girls. Hundreds of years in the future, with space ships and FTL and AI, humanity's most elite warriors are prepubescent teenage girls wearing frilly dresses shouting named attacks. Not only that, but the older ones often choose to look extremely young, often around 14, with one character who heads an intelligence agency choosing to look 9. I just can't take it seriously. It's like watching a court drama where one of the lawyers is dressed up in full clown makeup and dress, and everyone else is treating it as completely normal, or explaining the psychological effect that the squeaky red nose has on the jury.

If you are able to get past that, then I would recommend it. It's fun sci-fi. But I just can't get into it. I read about 20 chapters in, so I gave it a fair shot.

**** Yeah, the characters were somewhat bland. I don't think it's really bad enough to knock points off for it though.

What really gets me is that it would be so easy to fix. Mandate that they have to be at least 18 or so before going out to fight. Old enough that I don't get the constant feeling of "these are prettily dressed child soldiers", old enough to actually make somewhat adult decisions. Make their magical uniform thing changeable, and then have them wear something that isn't a frilly dress. Something that doesn't make me think of that Family Guy skit where Peter is dressed as a clown in Vietnam saying "see, they're *looking* for guys in army uniforms." STOP CALLING THEM MAGICAL GIRLS. And finally have them maybe choose cherubic or very youthful faces, but not make them look like actual children. It's copying that fucking weird anime trope of "it's not creepy because I'm not a child, I'm actually hundreds of years old!". Just burn that trope with fire.

None of these would seriously impact the plot if a few minor changes were made and some numbers shuffled around. I can stomach some minor stuff like the advanced alien race that is trying to reverse entropy apparently doesn't notice the male gender, or super powers, magic, whatever. That's all stuff I've gotten accustomed to mostly. And then I could actually enjoy the story.

No, jokes aside, I think what you're describing is a significant part of just what makes anime anime. Dissonant or out-of-place concepts are a weird taste - sometimes an acquired one - but I think most anime fans end up actually enjoying it. Madoka Magica is actually a pretty straightforward Magical Girl setting with a dark twist, but there's weirder stuff.

  "I don't want Fenn to change because her loyalty metric increased. I want her loyalty metric, if she's going to have one, to just be a reflection of how loyal she is, not an invisible lever controlling her. I want her to be a real person, or at least as real as I am. And... I'm hesitant to want that for everyone else in Aerb, because sometimes existence is pain, but... if they're not going to be real, or at least as real as I am, then I want them to be real enough that I can't tell the difference. I want that for the whole of Aerb, alright? I want to poke at the seams and find out that you thought of everything. And at the end of it, I want Arthur back. That's the only way that this game is ever going to be worth the candle."*
#+end_quote

This passage reminds me very strongly of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4025200][/The Unincorporated Man/]], which was extremely disappointing because the protagonist's goal was /literally/** the destruction of what made the setting interesting (the division of every human into shares that could be traded freely on the stock market) and all his actions were directed toward that goal. /Worth the Candle/ seems to be pursuing a similar path, in the long run...

*Insert obvious CinemaSins joke here. (Actually, I unsubscribed from him quite a while ago, after his /Mad Max: Fury Road/ video included a diatribe against the fat-shaming of Immortan Joe's milk slaves, so I don't know whether he's still making that joke.)\\

My previous comment originally was going to be a complaint against how selfless, goody-two-shoes protagonists are boring in comparison to such selfish, edgy protagonists as [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/25076][Paul/Grayven]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122][Howard Roark]]. However, I failed to invest enough effort into that version of the comment to complete it. Still wanting to get some (You)s from this week's thread rather than waiting for next week's, I hastily tried to rework the comment into a complaint about protagonists who seek to destroy the interesting parts of their respective settings. However, on further reflection it turns out that the second complaint is very weak with respect to /Worth the Candle/ (which wouldn't be much worse if the protagonist lacked the game layer but still had his prodigious learning abilities), and I don't have any other examples of this phenomenon (other than /The Unincorporated Man/), so I'll just switch to the first complaint instead. Feel free to downvote me for accidentally getting (You)s under false pretenses due to laziness.

#+begin_quote

The game layer and the protagonist's ability to gain power much more quickly than other characters, both of which open up many interesting paths for the protagonist's progression through the world. (My previous comment is based on the incorrect assumption that it's only the game layer that I like.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

In fairness, Juniper hasn't /taken action/ (or even /been able/ to take action) to destroy the game layer, in contrast to Justin Cord, who (again, IIRC) /did/ take action to destroy the institution of incorporation in /The Unincorporated Man/. However, the quote presented in my previous comment illustrates how Juniper's mindset closes off options, and even the /contemplation/ of options, that might make the story more interesting.

Let's look at the quote presented above. Should Juniper discover that he could increase Fenn's loyalty level by spending experience points (or just generic magical power, if the game layer doesn't exist), he would refuse to do it, without engaging in any significant amount of internal debate. That's closing off an entire fascinating avenue of the game layer (or of soul magic), for no reason other than a moral quibble. Similarly, would Lantern Paul assimilate Superman with the orange light if Paul knew that he (Paul) could do a better job of protecting Earth if he did so? No, because he doesn't want to take agency away from other people---and that closes off an entire fascinating avenue of growth for Lantern Paul's abilities.

In-story, Juniper /literally complains/ when a character intentionally increases her loyalty level toward him, because he value's that character's agency over her usefulness to him. What a boring little goody two-shoes.
