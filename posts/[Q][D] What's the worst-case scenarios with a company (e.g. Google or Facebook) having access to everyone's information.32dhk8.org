Sorry if this question isn't the best fit for this subreddit. I enjoy this community and it was the best I was aware of.

Anyways I've heard many people worry about the extent of an organization's influence because we willingly give them our information. They claim it's for advertising purposes but what sort of damage could they really do?

Basically, they use all of that information in concert with the government to screw you.

Now I'm going to leave it, but please let's stay related to rational/ist fiction - I know subreddit discovery is terrible, but still...

** In [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash][Snow Crash]], which I just finished reading, the CIA merged with the Library of Congress to become a kind of Pay-per-View/Wikipedia where anyone could upload anything, and you can pay to find out anything for the right price.

- "how many turds were in the bowl before you flushed"
- Manuscript drafts that famous writers thought they deleted
- Blueprints of a government facility
- A politician's favorite beverage

And like E-Bay, some people make a living off of it, and the site's listings are completely public. I can imagine a future like that coming to us very soon.

*** What I really don't understand is how it keeps happening that we had anticapitalist (or at least, anti-current-form-of-financialized ultra-libertarian wannabe-anarcho-cyber-capitalism) fiction, done to the point of parody, /decades ago/, and the social tides are only now turning in favor of /maybe/ not letting large companies and governments fuck us over.

To use certain terms, I have to ask why it has taken so long for people to try using Voice to fight for their own damn civilization, when even the thought of a society built entirely on Exit is almost always dystopian-grade grimdark.

  */Snow Crash/* is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson][Neal Stephenson]]'s third novel, published in 1992. Like many of Stephenson's other novels it covers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History][history]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics][linguistics]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology][anthropology]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology][archaeology]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion][religion]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science][computer science]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics][politics]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography][cryptography]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics][memetics]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy][philosophy]].

  Stephenson explained the title of the novel in his 1999 essay /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Beginning..._was_the_Command_Line][In the Beginning... was the Command Line]]/ as his term for a particular software [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_causes][failure mode]] on the early [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh][Apple Macintosh]] computer. Stephenson wrote about the Macintosh that "When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap][bitmap]], the result was something that looked vaguely like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(video)][static on a broken television]] set---a 'snow crash'â€‰". Stephenson also mentioned a book by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Jaynes][Julian Jaynes]], /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind][The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]/, as one of the main influences for /Snow Crash/.

  The book presents the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language][Sumerian language]] as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware][firmware]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language][programming language]] for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem][brainstem]], which is supposedly functioning as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS][BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah][Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus, similar to a computer virus. The god [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki][Enki]] created a counter-program which he called a nam-shub that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah (a re-interpretation of the ancient Near Eastern story of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel][Tower of Babel]]).

** Planning to set a story there? Well, worldbuilding is fun, so:

At a tech level /slightly/ higher than our own, it would mean they would see literally everything. (Although no one individual or organization could reasonably /know/ everything without some pretty good AI to check and index it all.)

Opting out is an impossible coordination problem, because you would be outcompeted by opt-ins, they can watch you if anyone merely /near/ you is an opt-in, and its at the very least suspicious-looking if not actually illegal. You'd have to set up an entire parallel Amish economy of opt-outs, and a single detector would gain vast economic advantages even if they only used it to look up stuff on Wikipedia.

Enough people in key positions have done /something/ wrong to steer the media and government into making various common-enough things abhorrent enough transgressions to ruin your life and credibility; so that everyone has at least one thing that society would excommunicate them for if it was made public. Racist comments, perhaps, or some Unacceptable sex thing.

First-mover advantage, natural monopolies and infighting mean this will eventually be in the hands of one person. Who decides they hate, say, Germany, or Africa, or China, and have everyone else seal them in, starve them, and then nuke the place. (Any leaders they have are discredited and Evil Monsters; whatever justification you need can be engineered through quiet blackmail via the CIA or whatever, with no one individual aware they were responsible for anything but helping the CIA bust a terrorist ring.)

*** Ooh that could be fun. Does that include information such as credit cards and social security? It would force politicians to quickly come clean about EVERYTHING so it couldn't be used for blackmail later on. I think if Facebook (as a random example) played their cards right they could even keep the majority of people happy while still pressuring people in key positions.
