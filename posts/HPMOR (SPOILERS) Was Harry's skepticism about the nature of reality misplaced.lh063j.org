Harry often criticizes Dumbledore for acting as if the world ran on "stories."

In Chapter 39, they have a lengthy discussion about Morality, Death, and the nature of reality.

This is one of my favorite chapters, as it lays out Transhumanist ideals and progressive optimism very concisely and eloquently.

As Harry puts it:

#+begin_quote
  The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and proud, and said: "There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don't have to! /We/ care! There /is/ light in the world, and it is /us!/ "
#+end_quote

This is a beautiful rejoinder against both spirituality and cynical nihilism, and is my go-to answer to Camus' Absurdist Paradox. In our world, I think it is the best answer.

However, in the world of HPMOR, is Harry's disbelief in Dumbledore's worldview well founded?

#+begin_quote
  And /that/ was when Harry realized that there was exactly one person who'd /originally/ told Professor McGonagall that the Dark Lord was still alive in the first place; and it was the crazy Headmaster of their madhouse of a school, who thought the world ran on cliches.
#+end_quote

HPMOR is a world where Prophecies and Time Travel exist. The stars quite explicitly DO care. There are literal prophetic "stories" that speak of the stars destruction, and the stars themselves apparently communicate future facts to Centaurs.

In such a world, is a belief in an uncaring universe founded? Given that his core beliefs were wrong about all of physics and the base nature of reality, shouldn't Harry be putting a little more credence in the opinion of the widely proclaimed most powerful wizard in the world?

Or are these really just mental hold-overs from Harry's scientific training and home culture, layered on top of Riddle's cynicism and dislike of Dumbledore?

Harry seems to come to this realization at the very end of the story:

#+begin_quote
  "You're acting like you think Dumbledore was unaware of those facts, or just ignoring them, when he made his decision. It's true that sometimes stupid people, like me, make decisions that crazy. But not Dumbledore. He was /not/ mad." Harry swallowed, forcing a sudden moisture away from his eyes. "I think... I'm beginning to realize... Dumbledore was the only sane person, in all of this, all along. The /only/ one who was doing the right things for anything like the right reasons..."
#+end_quote

At the conclusion, upon learning how true the prophecies were, he is finally able to reject his prior bias as to the meaningless nature of reality. But I find it interesting that his very "rationality" and reliance on things like Occam's Razor prevented him from accepting Dumbledore's perspective sooner, and failing to update his assumptions and overcome bias.


** In the beginning he's probably right to be skeptical of Dumbledore's claims, since when a muggle makes similar statements they're usually deluding themselves. But you're right. He should have figured out he was wrong sooner. His pattern-matching on what felt rational rather than what actually was rational caused him to make many mistakes.

There is no real evidence that 'the stars care', just that there is transmission of information from the future to the past. Dumbledore abused prophecies to get to the point where there can be a chance for a good outcome but that's because he used them as a tool. There's a lot of suffering in that world which is already evidence against the stars caring.

Anyway, Harry was correct to question it but for the wrong reasons (as misanalyzing is the theme of his interactions with Dumbledore) - Dumbledore was neither crazy nor believed the world really runs on stories - he was using those masks as a pretence to abuse the prophecies and maybe have a bit of fun on top. The closest related thing he believed in was that the world is ultimately just which you touch on but we don't see evidence for that.

*** Is it really that, or is it more that Dumbledore /did/ believe in stories, and thus that informed his way of acting on the Prophecy, and thus that necessarily led the world to work as a story, because it had to accommodate for a self-consistent loop which included Dumbledore acting by believing the world works as stories do?

*** I take your point, and certainly agree that there isn't evidence showing that it is the "stars" that care, but from our limited exposure to prophecies it sure seems like what information is transmitted from the future to the past isn't random. It seems like only things of sufficient "weight" cause the metaphorical pressure forcing prophecies out into the world, and that what is or isn't "weighty" seems to be judged by something like human values. To our uncaring universe there should be no difference in "weight" between two asteroids colliding in a distant galaxy and the destruction of Earth and its sun, and neither event more or less likely to result in a prophecy, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I suppose an answer could be that people able to read omens or produce prophecies are themselves in some way making their own judgments as to what kinds of information is worth finding, and somehow pull out the potential prophecies most relevant to themselves from an almost limitlessly larger set---but I can't say that's the impression I get reading. But who knows, it's all made up anyway!

What I'm saying it's that my guess it'd that it can be something 'objective' like huge shifts in magic usage, so things like a big proportion of magic users dying would often count by default as in the quirrel case or things like the founding of hogwarts which caused magic to be streamlined in one portion of the world, or Harry deciding to abuse magic until he defeats death which would be a whole paradigm shift.

For that stars should have self-preservation motivation. But "stars care" is not the same as star being anthropomorphic or animalmorphic enough to have self-preservation motive. They may only care about minimizing some loss function, utterly incomprehensible to humans.

You know that. I know that. TvTropes knew that. It sure seemed like a huge chunk of the audience refused to notice that because, like Harry, they were swept up in Quirrel's badassism and charisma. I also feel like people's opinions of the story and Harry wind up pretty thoroughly established in the first 10 chapters, in which it's easy to miss that Harry's flaws are intended as flaws because they keep succeeding. Like, he just walked all over MacGonogall and Hermione and it seemed like he might get away with terrifying Neville at 9.75. It takes the Sorting Hat laying out how messed up it all has been to make it abundantly clear that the author intended Harry's darkness to be bad, rather than badass.

After that, if you like Harry, it's hard to hate Quirrel because he shows up to mentor Harry like a stone-cold sensei whenever our lovable protagonist makes a mistake. It feels like he's making Harry stronger and serving as a role-model. By the time he does the really, really obvious "wtf?" thing with Azkaban, a lot of people have already decided how they feel about the character, and aren't going to go updating based on mere evidence.

I guess the tldr would be that it takes too long to get to the point, and things which feel right to the protagonist, by virtue of being convincing enough to convince someone as smart as Harry, also has a tendency to convince readers who are sufficiently similar to Harry. And since it's fanfiction, a lot of detractors assume the author must be sufficiently similar to Harry to also make the same mistakes and fail to notice.

******* Ok? So your beef is with the audience, then, not with the story. You're trying to construct this narrative where HPMOR is bad at telegraphing Harry's flaws and the mistakes he makes, but clearly a bunch of people noticed if even TVTropes was keeping up with it. HPMOR is plenty transparent and doesn't owe its audience an accounting for anything.

All aspiring rationalists make mistakes, the whole point is to learn to notice them even when it's difficult. If the story simply told you when to stop and think it wouldn't be as effective, neither as a narrative or as a didactic tool.

***** Maybe there's a nicer way to say this, but I can't think of one right now...

In my experience there's two main groups of readers we're talking about here: the first thinks Harry is super rational and right all the time because they see him as /more rational than they are/ and so fixate on all the ways he's brilliant while not being able to distinguish actual brilliance from his mistakes in the story. They see people being upset with him but take his side implicitly rather than recognizing when he's wrong on a case by case basis. The second thinks he's /presented as/ rational and right all the time because they /disagree with his choices/beliefs,/ and so when he succeeds anyway sometimes they fixate on those and ignore all the times he gets burned or admits his mistakes.

Neither group of people are particularly good at reading comprehension, in my honest opinion.

I get that at some level responsibility can rest in part with the author too, but this story really does bash you over the head with how mistaken Harry is when he messes up, and I think readers who don't pick up on it are failing to understand that Harry can both be right in his epistemics but flawed in his values, judgement, and execution.

To say the story doesn't do "enough" to show his mistakes is a judgement call; it may not have done enough /for some people,/ but, speaking for myself, I found it very obvious that the story was showcasing failure modes of an aspiring rationalist alongside his successes even the first time I read it... and I had no idea what a "rationalist" was then.

It's honestly kind of hard for me to understand how people can read the same story I did and not pick up on it when Harry is /surrounded by people who disagree with him/ and the only person who does mostly agree with him is /the main antagonist/ who /utterly fools Harry./

It's like... sure there are stories where "the only sane person in a world of idiots" is a thing, but in those stories the "sane person" doesn't fuck up nearly as much as Harry does, if at all.

******* Sure, but stories shouldn't be judged by "some people who read/watch them aren't as smart as others and might get the wrong message." A writer can definitely make good choices over bad ones to get their message across better (for example, in my view Wolf of Wallstreet ended up glamorizing the lifestyle it was attempting to condemn because it cared more about having fun/entertaining scenes than telling a good story, as compared to say Lord of War), but I think HPMOR did a fine job with it, and am glad it didn't sacrifice more nuance for the sake of readers who ignore things like Harry /admitting/ that he's been a massive idiot /multiple times./

He's literally responsible for Dumbledore's death/banishment. He gets stuck in an Unbreakable Vow against his will. He ends up being forced to kill people, including Draco's dad, which costs him their friendship... I don't know what people who want more consequences would be satisfied with.

********** No, that's basically a Disney death situation. There's no intent to kill, so it wouldn't be murder (except perhaps felony murder, but that ignores most of the rules).

On a civil standard, I don't think you could even prove liability for wrongful death. There's a legal concept called "contributory negligence", where even if another party did wrong, the victim can be found in whole or in part responsible for their own misfortune. This might be when someone whose land gets flooded sees it happening and does nothing to mitigate us, or when someone struck by a teenager drag racing was themselves drunk driving.

Getting caught in a trap you set up yourself would likely be on that level.

That said, Riddle had clearly committed robbery, forced kidnapping, terrorist threats, and several instances of mind control, so there's lots of felony equivalent crimes to go along with here that he would likely be convicted for felony murder. All felony murder requires is that a death which was reasonably foreseeable occurs during the commission of a felony.

Harry has a pretty rock solid defence of duress, as "a gun to my head" is one of the most textbook examples of that.

******** It's because a lot of that stuff came too late. Not everybody has the patience to power through a story they are beginning to dislike just to check if it gets better in the end. Everything you are saying here happened in the final chunk of the story - but this is fanfiction, not a book you spend money on and feel compelled to read. People who don't like a given piece of fanfiction, just stop reading it. And, honestly, that's fair - that's what people mean when they say this stuff came 'too little, too late'.

Take the great Hermione debacle. A bunch of people didn't like how Hermione was treated in the early/middle part of the story. This came to a head when Hermione was killed by the troll - if I remember correctly people even wrote blog posts about how much they hated her death and how the story handled her character in general. Now, of course, at the very end of the story Harry finally admits that Hermione would actually make a much better hero than he is, and gives her his invisibility cloak just to make certain the reader's know he's serious. But that's too little, too late; the kind of people who cared the most about Hermione's treatment in the story stopped reading ages ago. If a more downtuned version of that scene/realization had happened earlier in the story, maybe they would have stuck with it to the end. But it didn't. So they stopped reading. And we can't fault them for that.

Similarly, the kinds of people most annoyed by Harry's behavior and how often it gets rewarded simply stopped reading before he started facing truly serious consequences for it. The kind of people most annoyed by the 'Dumbledore bashing' stopped reading long before the story revealed Dumbledore was right all along.

And that is a legitimate flaw in a story as long as HPMOR - a flaw perfectly encapsulated by 'too little, too late'.

People like us don't see what HPMOR was trying to do more clearly because we're 'smarter' or anything like that. We see it because the flaws people complain about, for one reason or another, didn't matter to us enough to make us stop reading before we got to the end of what is a decently long piece of fanfiction nobody was ever under any obligation to finish.

************ Eh. In my experience most of the critiques of HPMOR are pretty valid. While I did enjoy it when I first read it back in the day, going back over it now I can recognize that the story does have some serious flaws and the 'lack of consequences' thing is one of them, but they ultimately all boil down to main problem people have with HPMOR - HPJEV.

His character arc is too slow, and his behavior never really changes. The story relies on him getting into shenanigans in order to solve the entire plot of Harry Potter within one school year, so by necessity he can't change, and he often can't face serious consequences that would force him to change. Mcgonnagal can lock his Time Turner and yell at him about being reckless all she wants - he is still accompanying Quirrel to Azkaban a few arcs later, and he is still going to get away with it almost flawlessly, and he is still going to face almost no consequences for it (because the story ends before Bellatrix being free can really have any effect).

His 'dark side' is portrayed as a flaw, something he has to overcome in order to not become a Dark Lord. But it never really makes him lose - instead it makes him win. He never 'fails' an Encounter because of it - instead he gets lambasted for being too dedicated to 'winning' after the fact, which doesn't have nearly the same impact. It's one thing to call a character an idiot because of a flaw - its another to have a character actually fail like an idiot because of that flaw. The only time it really becomes a serious, potentially Encounter Ending impediment is in Azkaban, and even then its pathological fear of death can't make him lose the encounter because there's simply no time in the story for Harry to get caught - instead he just shoves it aside and wins.

Harry doesn't win the final battle because of anything he did to combat his Dark Side. He doesn't defeat the Dark Lord because he learned to lose, or because he learned to trust and value people who aren't academic geniuses like Ron or Neville, or anything like that - he wins because he thinks of a really clever plan under time pressure and executes it flawlessly. Large chunks of the story (and the character development they contain) could be removed and the Final Battle would barely change. For example, Harry did not need to lose that first battle to Hermione and learn a lesson about too easily discounting other people as NPCs because at the end of the day, when he faces off against the Dark Lord, the Death Eaters basically are just NPCs.

We can go back and forth on the specifics all day, but that's what most of the flaws in HPMOR boil down to in the end - things in the basic construction of the story that rub people the wrong way (like the pacing and characterization). On the micro level it can be really fun to read; but on the macro level you start running into problems. And if you never liked HPJEV in the first place, then even the micro level stuff is ruined as well.

Everything about HPMOR hinges on HPJEV - the people who like the fic can, at the very least, tolerate him and so enjoy the stuff the fic does well. But if a person doesn't like HPJEV, then they are not going to enjoy the things HPMOR does well, and the flaws of HPMOR are going to stand out to them a lot more clearly. If someone finds HPJEV pretentious and annoying, then they are going to find the entirety of HPMOR pretentious and annoying.

That's why I made my point about the final battle - HPJEV doesn't change that much throughout the story, didn't need to change in order to win the Final Battle, and many of the critiques of HPMOR boil down to, in the end, a desire for HPJEV to change. Critics are right to focus on HPJEV's characterization. HPJEV's characterization is the biggest flaw in the story because of how omnipresent his character is - he is the main driving force of the entire story. His point of view colors almost every scene (even if the author has said HPJEV's opinion isn't always meant to be 'correct'). The other characters orbit him. The only other characters with similar agency are Quirrel (and I shouldn't have to explain why HPJEV haters also hate Quirrel) and Dumbledore (who unfortunately spends a decent amount of the story being 'bashed' - and I've already gone over how people don't stick around to finish fanfics they don't like).

HPJEV is a very polarizing character. Maybe that was intentional. Maybe not. Maybe the main character being annoying shouldn't really count as a 'flaw'. But it is a valid critique (and in my opinion the criticism that underlies most others) and it is what drives many people away from HPMOR.

"Annoying" is subjective. "Arrogant" is not. He is arrogant, and that is a legitimate flaw. That some people find him annoying is no more meaningful as a criticism of the writing than me saying the same of Hamlet would be.

  Mcgonnagal can lock his Time Turner and yell at him about being reckless all she wants
#+end_quote

To be clear you seem to be dismissing this as not being sufficient /to you/ for x, y, z reasons. I want to make sure it's acknowledged that, objectively, it was a consequence, that Harry brought on himself by being imperfect, acknowledged by the text and characters.

#+begin_quote
  he is still accompanying Quirrel to Azkaban a few arcs later, and he is still going to get away with it almost flawlessly
#+end_quote

"Getting away with it" is not the only metric of failure. Regretting it is a much more powerful one, to me, and the further alienation from those he might otherwise turn to for help and support is another. In stories with heists, "getting away with it" is often taken for granted, but there are often consequences that go beyond it that matter more to the story than them just being locked up or failing in the heist.

#+begin_quote
  His 'dark side' is portrayed as a flaw, something he has to overcome in order to not become a Dark Lord. But it never really makes him lose - instead it makes him win. He never 'fails' an Encounter because of it
#+end_quote

...obviously? If it led to failure he would stop using it. The reason it's hard to stop using is /because/ it makes him so much more effective. But that's not even true, there are times it leads him to "win" but not in an optimal way, such as...

#+begin_quote
  The only time it really becomes a serious, potentially Encounter Ending impediment is in Azkaban, and even then its pathological fear of death can't make him lose the encounter because there's simply no time in the story for Harry to get caught - instead he just shoves it aside and wins.
#+end_quote

It also causes him to fuck up with Snape in their first encounter. "Inability to lose properly" is the first lesson Voldemort tries to (literally) beat out of him, with only middling success, and part of the problem is that he HAS a dark side he can just keep using to win. The actual success condition in Azkaban once he was there was giving up and turning himself in.

#+begin_quote
  Harry doesn't win the final battle because of anything he did to combat his Dark Side. He doesn't defeat the Dark Lord because he learned to lose, or because he learned to trust and value people who aren't academic geniuses like Ron or Neville, or anything like that - he wins because he thinks of a really clever plan under time pressure and executes it flawlessly.
#+end_quote

This is the only point you've made that actually lands; a lot of people had issues with the final battle for reasons like this, myself included. But the vast, vast majority of critics of HPMOR do not get this far, and of those that do most still get many other things wrong about the story leading up to it.

See, here's the thing; I don't think we /can/ go back and forth on specifics all day :P I think if we did we would very quickly reach a conclusion that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/][I already spent a lot of time documenting]] because I was tired of hearing people say stuff like this.

Yes, HPMOR has flaws. Yes HPJEV is a divisive character. These are /not the same claim/ as the "Harry's character arc is too slow and he doesn't change enough," and those are not objective claims, they are subjective preferences from people who consistently fail to remember specifics about ways Harry failed and changed, and then say things like "well it's not about specifics" when this is pointed out to them.

Harry is a flawed character. He is flawed in a way that rubs many readers the wrong way, and the way he was written in the early chapters particularly was rough around the edges, but that does not make his flaws /poor writing/ any more than Hamlet's flaws make his character poor writing no matter how annoying some people (myself included) find him.

************** But... we're talking about a piece of fanfiction. Almost all critique is going to be, ultimately, subjective. I even laid down a pretty comprehensive argument as to why different people react in subjectively different ways to the fic (whether or not they see HPJEV as annoying). If enough people find a character annoying, that is a legitimate flaw in the story - just because it isn't purely 'objective' does not mean we can just dismiss it. If enough people think the pacing is too slow, that is a valid critique. Almost every judgement of a given written work's quality is going to be subjective. Almost no piece of art is 'objectively' good. You find Hamlet annoying. If enough people also found Hamlet annoying, to the point where they refused to read the play because they hated him so much, people would not think that play is good. The play would be badly written, because it failed at the most fundamental goal of any written work - getting people to read it.

What would a purely objective criticism of a story even look like? The only one I could think off the top of my head (pointing out flaws in basic plot construction) you already agree with me on. I guess inconsistent characterization could be another? I'm more than willing admit it; if there is one thing HPMOR has, its consistent characterization. But Art is all about how something makes us feel - Shakespeare is considered good because of how it makes people feel; people aren't robots that plug all the jokes into equation and give a thumbs up if the result is positive. If all someone feels while reading HPMOR is annoyance, that is a valid critique that you can't just dismiss because it can't be mathematically proven.

I'm going to ignore your counter-arguments to my various points, because I have already explained at length why HPMOR haters don't think many of the consequences HPJEV faces in the story are 'real' consequences - and since that is entirely subjective we could go back and forth on that all day on, so lets not do that. Every single argument you could possible make for why those consequences 'count' would be subjective, and every single argument I could make for why they don't would be subjective as well. We can debate what is a more powerful metric of failure all day till we go blue in the face - its subjective. Your opinion is just as personal as mine, and there's nothing we can do to change that.

Instead I'm going to go after what I think is our more fundamental disagreement. You seem to think that the people who critique HPMOR simply failed to understand it, and I strongly disagree. HPMOR fans are not, in my opinion, any more 'rational' in their opinion than HPMOR haters. They just had a different subjective experience while reading the fic. That's it.

You can say their subjective experience is valid or "all critique is subjective" and so on, but critiques often base their views on objective claims, and far too many critics, including those I've seen of HPMOR, do not know the difference between their objective and subjective claims.

That is my point. Someone can read something and dislike it for subjective reasons, but their criticism loses value to me if I can objectively point out factual claims they make that are incorrect... and it doesn't matter how couched in subjective opinion something is if it's basing it off a false assertion.

It's like watching a CinemaSins video and saying the movie is bad because it has 73 sins or whatever, until you actually watch the movie yourself and realize that over half their "sins" are inaccurate and the other half are subjective, leaving maybe a handful of "actual," objective sins.

Even if the final message /is/ sufficiently "Harry fucked up," maybe those you're arguing with mean they wanted failures hundreds of chapters sooner.

For me, I was a little annoyed with the story because it seemed like Harry's successes consistently and significantly outshone his failures. I don't mean the number or, like, the magnitude of them - it was more like his successes were just /flashier/ than his ultimately pretty mundane failures.

When he screwed up, it was like, "Harry let his temper get away from him and lost his Time Turner," or "Harry underestimated Hermione," or "Harry forgot to update his priors and so failed to call attention to Quirrell." Reasonable mistakes that a normal person could make.

But his accomplishments? "Harry is the only person alive with a patronus shaped like a human, and he can kill Dementors and control them with his mind." Or, "Harry invented partial transfiguration, which everybody on the planet insists is impossible, and it honestly didn't even take him very long." Or, "Harry subdued the villainous Snape and instituted effective rules that forever disallowed him from bullying students." Or, "Harry transfigured a rocket engine and used it to blast out of Azkaban and into the sunset." Or, "Harry is so special that the Sorting Hat came to life for the first time ever, sorted him into two houses, and started cracking jokes."

His successes were these big, bombastic, chapter-ending moments, and so many of them felt like they were pointing out how /special/ Harry was, how his unique extreme brilliance enabled him to do all these fancy special little Harry things.

I'm perfectly ready to accept that he ended up almost destroying the world because his mistakes were so significant, but to me, it really felt like the story was going out of its way to highlight how /awesome/ he was, every couple steps on the road there.

*********** Yeah, Harry definitely is presented as pretty awesome in a unique way. Personally I'm okay with that, and I think most people are in most circumstances, but are just unused to these. Most people don't bat an eye when James Bond kills a hundred dudes while dodging every bullet, or an anime protagonist turns out to be a better fighter at 12 than grown adults who spent their whole life fighting, or a single high schooler outsmarts the entire world's police force (other than a secret world detective who happens to also be around his age).

At least in HPMOR we have reasons for Harry's stupendous successes, for the most part: 1) he's got the mental patterns of Voldemort kicking around in his head, 2) he's the only wizard who learned lots about the material world and scientific thinking, 3) there's multiple prophecies about him (personally I hate prophecies as a justification for specialness, but this is a carry over from the canon in any case), 4) he's got a fairly unique value system, etc etc etc.

So sure, I understand why someone might feel like Harry comes off as too awesome even with all the mistakes he makes, but I don't find it particularly out of the norm for the genre, and much better justified than most stories.

  people actually started literal fight clubs IRL - completely ignoring the actual text of the movie
#+end_quote

IMO this is a matter of personal values, not of intelligence or understanding. The movie illustrates a story which features a conflict and tension between two "characters" who really are two worldviews. Tyler Durden is fascinating for a reason. He makes the world a starkly contrasted, easily understood, somewhat more interesting place. He suggests an almost spiritual philosophy of abandonment of your body, of safety, of comfort, not unlike a bunch of religions - except instead of proposing frugality and self-flagellation he proposes to flagellate each other, because that's more fun. That's the driver of the first part. The second part of the movie shows the many ways in which that mindset can go wrong. But whether you think those sort of consequences are /bad/ is in itself a value choice. Maybe you're okay with widespread death and mayhem, maybe you really think our society is so rotten it has it coming. Maybe you're genuinely ready to face your own death if you think it has meaning, and don't care for other people's. Evil? From our viewpoint, sure. Inconsistent or irrational? Not really.

Imagine making the same movie, but about the dangers of democracy. It starts with a small group of people gathering together to live in a democratic commune. It looks fun and pleasant and they all get to decide and do their part. Their movement expands, and in the second half, they take the country by storm. There's a revolution, the king is beheaded, the aristocracy flees. Democracy becomes the law of the land. At the beginning it seems like it goes well, but then populists start emerging. Democracy eats itself and is paralyzed by indecision when it matters. The country collapses, and the protagonist, finally seeing the madness of it all, starts plotting to try and get back the rightful heir of the King.

That wouldn't be such a weird movie. In fact it could be an almost perfect historical movie about the French Revolution, save a few details. We would all consider its morals repugnant - for all of democracy's flaws, /no way/ monarchy would be a better option! - but for someone with a 17th century mindset, that would reflect their thoughts perfectly.

If that percentage is significantly lower than you'd expect, that's a failure on the author's part.

It struck me the most, personally, when Harry staunchly argued that souls couldn't possibly exist, using well-reasoned arguments against a specific definition of 'soul' and using that to claim the whole concept disproven, in concurrence with what he had reasonably believed before he learned of magic. I was left thinking "Of all the magics of the world, you don't think it's even /possible/ that something that one might describe as a soul exists?" I can imagine someone like Merlin or those before him crafting a viral magical construct that copies brain-states until a person dies, or other formulations that make for a similar effect, and the possibility of something like that is something that should greatly intrigue Harry if he hadn't stayed stuck to the surety that souls can't possibly exist.

- If the soul existed and could think, brain damage wouldn't change a person

#+end_quote

Harry basically trades one set of chains for another. He sticks with what he knows and feels comfortable with. Magic is real? Sure thing. A person with the body mass of a human adult turns into a cat in front of his eyes? No way, Jose. The story shows us right from the start that while operating under some kind of logic (or lack there of), it doesn't operate under the kind of logic which Harry is fluent in.

He basically keeps falling into what I personally call the smart idiot's trap. His whole life he's always had an edge over people with his ridiculous education level. He was never truly shocked to his core and thus believed himself immune to logical fallacies.

I think the whole exchange between Harry and Dumbledore makes more sense if you view it as a language fluency issue. Treat different logics as different languages. Harry can't understand a whole sentence in Weird Logic, because he isn't a native speaker, like Dumbledore is.

Harry might be able to grasp a rough idea for a concept but wouldn't know what it's called without Dumbledore telling him. Dumbledore might be able to explain certain concepts like cliches to give him a basic vocabulary. But if he strung a complete sentence together, Harry would be completely lost. (I believe this is also how oracles work.)

Like take a modern physicist and put him in the Middle Ages, everybody would call him insane. Few would be willing to listen and learn his vocabulary. Of course us modern people would call them morons and laugh at them, but that's because we are already native to modern physics.

In conclusion: Harry's skepticism is misplaced (in hindsight), but you can't expect him to have a magical sense for truth either. Harry's logic 100% makes sense in context, it just so happens to be that his logic system itself is wrong. You can't blame Harry for not figuring this out himself. It's like learning a language without knowing any of the words.

Although there are arguments to be made either way, if you don't ascribe to any established deities then there really isn't any evidence for or against the universe being created by a non-specified omnipotent(?) entity.

And for the record, I fail to see how religion prevents people from having a sense of wonder. It might sound cheesy, but I feel as though I appreciate the beauty of the universe more when I think of it as created - it's like art.

#+end_quote

Premise: I am agnostic atheist myself, just to clear any doubts on that.

Follow up: it's not that simple. If you want to be objective, discussing about what is more "likely" for a Universe to be is absolutely impossible to judge because /we have a sample of one/. Let's consider it from a Bayesian perspective. We know the universe allows us to live. This includes stuff like the fine structure constant being juuuust right for matter structures of sufficient complexity to exist. Lots of physical laws, if tweaked in one way or another, would turn the universe into a very boring place! Let's call this observation FT, for Fine Tuning, and the hypothesis of the existence of a God, G. Then

P(G | FT) = P(FT | G) P(G)/P(FT)

Now, P(FT | G) is obviously 1: if God exists, he finely tuned the universe, that's the whole /point/ of there being a God. So it's now all down to P(G) and P(FT).

What's P(FT)? Well, if every possible universe ever exists, then P(FT) is 1 by the anthropic principle: we ought to exist in a /livable/ universe, after all. But we don't know whether the multiverse really is a thing. And what's P(G)? Again, who the hell knows. The atheist says: your description is eerily reminiscent of just a Big Man in the Sky and a projection of your inner desire for protection and order from above! You just took your mental image of a father or a chief and made it one gajillion times more powerful!

And that makes sense. But the (smart) theist could respond: well, but those images exist within me /because God created me this way!/ I possess intuitive knowledge that reflects the fundamental truths that have been etched into me by the laws of the universe itself! The causal relation is the other way around, fathers and chiefs are just our pale attempts to reflect what God is to the world.

And the atheist argues, there are no fundamental truths etched into us! Empirical investigation is the only way we can access true knowledge!

And the theist can rebut, oh, yes? Then what /is/ a number, and why do you understand how to manipulate it and other symbols? Why are you so sure that if a thing happened 99 times, it will also happen the 100th? Why do you think the world ought to be regular at all?

And the atheist, because those things are the very foundation of my brain-software - they're the firmware evolution itself built into it. They're essential tools to survive, and they've evolved because they /work/!

And the theist: right, and so why wouldn't our tendency to anthropomorphize rules and see a greater human-like intelligent entity behind it all not work the same way?

In the end, it's not an argument that can be ever finally settled. All evidence is inaccessible. People have different priors, and that makes all the difference. An atheist is someone for whom P(G) << P(FT). A theist is someone for whom P(G) = P(FT). Neither can be proven right or wrong in a final sense (which is why I classify myself as agnostic). If you think the universe /obviously/ has to be regular and have laws and such, you haven't thought enough about the universe.

This is the point I disagree on. Consider something like the simulation hypothesis, outlandish as it is - wouldn't anyone who set up the universe as a simulation be, essentially, our "God"? There's many ways in which you could have a created universe and it would just be impossible to know unless you can see how universe look like /in general/. Though what I do agree is that I don't believe it is possible for example for there to be an absolute /ethical/ paragon, but that's only mostly Christianity's claim anyway.

So, imprimis, the universe that we're being simulated in pretty much has to have massively different laws of physics, like one of Greg Egan's alt-physics novels, so the inhabitants are not in any way anthropomorphic, and we are astronomically unlikely to be able to derive their characteristics to anything but the vaguest level.

And, secundus, they're actively hiding and trying to not have an effect on their simulation, so inside the simulation they're more like no god than any god.

That did more to advance our understanding of QM than most of the work done by those who sheepishly bought into Bohr's "you're not allowed to ask that question!" nonsense. I actually studied this a bit as in, I read some of the transcripts of the Solvay Conference at which QM really got some traction, and in it already Einstein tried to bring up how QM implied nonlocality. That's the insight that eventually led to Bell's theorem. Those transcripts are frustrating because Einstein was /clearly/ saying very sensible things and everyone else didn't even understand him and went "haha you just didn't get how this works, let's move to the next topic".

I agree, insofar as evaluating the /truth/ of an hypothesis goes. But before you get to test a hypothesis, you need to formulate it. And for each phenomenon there is an infinite space of possibilities that would explain it; the idea itself of a "law" restricts them immensely, because for example it precludes the possibility that the universe has a gigantic lookup table that says "if X happens, then Y follows" without rhyme or reason. As a general rule we expect a certain amount of symmetry and simplicity in these laws. Nothing that we know of says it must be so! Similarly, God or not, Einstein was expressing a fundamental distaste with the notion that the universe could not be governed by deterministic causal relations. As far as principles go, it's not too awful; and to a point QM obeys it too, save for the weird anomaly of measurement that rightfully jumps to the eye as needing a further explanation. Of course it could be an entirely wrong gut reaction, but Einstein didn't claim "I feel it is wrong, therefore this proves it is so". He felt it was wrong, investigated, and made a testable prediction. It turned out that the test proved his expectation wrong, but we still learned a lot from it. And to this day we still don't have a final answer on whether QM is truly random or not.

I think the speed of data transfer from the memory node to the local simulation node would be a massive limiting factor, unless the memory modes are just cloned over and over. In the cloning case, that does imply a high likelihood of the occurrence of corrupt bits in the memory nodes, where the laws of physics are different for no discernible reason, simply because the lookup table spits out the wrong answer.

The bits probably got flipped by cosmic rays too, since that's such a convenient excuse.

Which he never really did. Instead of updating his model to fit the new evidence he basically handwaived anything that messed with his worldview.

And the narrative sort of supported him. Harry's random guesses based on his outdated model of reality turned out be true many times.

For example, in HP Canon souls exist. The existence of animagi, ghosts, the resurrection stone heavily implies this. You could argue the technicalities but the intention of JK Rowling was for those to exist.

Wouldn't it be interesting if Harry had to grapple with that fact? He would have to reevaluate his entire transhumabist worldview, as well as the fundamental tenets of the universe. It would be interesting seeing a rational secular character deal with that.

But the author basically handwaived it away as them being some sort of simulated mind state backup.

Allowing Harry to not have any real challenge to his worldview. Basically his preconceived biases were proven right. Plus it allowed him to be more knowledgeable then Dumbledore.

To answer your question, in a canon like world his skepticism would be misplaced. And he would be the equivalent of a flat earth atheist.

*** I think you're ignoring his first experiments with Hermione. The whole point of that chapter was that he had a hard time updating his beliefs according to evidence when the suggested belief was too "weird". He was wrong there, and lost a lot of face over that. His flat earth atheism was wrong but expected, and he updated somewhat using that failure. Rationality doesn't mean you're always right, especially if you don't have the evidence needed to reach accurate beliefs.

So should've Harry simply thrown away everything he believed in originally because he was obviously wrong? His outdated model of reality is still useful in many ways, given that it was developed over centuries of active research. Throwing it away because MAGIC means losing predictive power. Whenever magic doesn't clearly say something different will happen, it seems clear that the outdated model of reality is accurate. That outdated model of reality found no use in the concept of souls. The new evidence for SOULS could be more concisely explained without a concept of souls that means death is not bad. Therefore the current model after updating says there are soul-like constructs that can be supported/created with magic, which either takes a single flash of magic to generate a limited copy (ghosts, paintings), or a continuous supply to generate a flawless copy (transfigurations of various kinds). However, there is a lack of evidence that there is a universal law that governs sentient minds and supplies an afterlife.

Basically, I think there's a semantic issue at fault here. Other people (mostly Dumbledore) are jumping from evidence of soul-like constructs to universal afterlife. Harry refuses to make that jump. To make his refusal clear he says he doesn't believe in souls, because that word carries expectations of an afterlife for him. A different story could have had different evidence, and Harry would've had to grapple with that worldview changing. I believe there is a metafic called Harry Potter and the philosopher's zombie that deals with these ideas.

**** I'm more critiquing the theme and narrative of the story rather then Harry's specific thoughts process within HPMOR.

Basically regarding updating his model of reality, I don't think he was a good rationalist. And I feel instead of the narrative addressing this it basically rewards Harry with being right.

The way HPMOR handled souls is a good example. Why are afterlife souls less improbable then non afterlife magical constructs?

We know animagi exist. As well as ghosts, human to animal transfiguration etc.

This implies there is a part of the mind that exists outside the physical brain. Otherwise how could yhese things exist.

Additionally we know magic responds to the emotions, thoughts, and beliefs of human minds. So there is something special about human consciousness that the universe treats differently. So really, the likelihood of souls existing is greater then magical constructs.

But ultimately that situation doesn't matter, it's just an example. I would like there to be souls.

It would force Harry as a rationalist to fundamentally alter his worldview and confront his deeply held transhumanist beliefs. That would make a more interesting story.

Btw, that's why I liked Harry Potter and the Philosophical Zombie.

Bottom line, Harry gets rewarded for being a poor rationalist by the narrative. When he makes leaps in logic about important stuff, he is rarely wrong.

***** You have a point in general, but I think your wishes here color your perception regarding souls. You need to more accurately note what evidence we've seen that is relevant and what simple models could support that evidence.

Ghosts, animagi, human transformations etc. tell us that it is possible to think without a physical brain, but only so long as there is a clear source of magic supporting it. We never see a muggle thinking without a brain. Draco will tell you that it's because muggles don't have souls. That may be true. It is also possible that the magic of the transformation includes a part about thinking without a brain, creating a brain construct using magic. There is no reason to jump from that to an afterlife, except for wishful thinking.

We don't know that the universe cares about human emotions, we know that something apparently "listens" for specific combinations of thoughts and actions from specific kinds of people, and also that something gives magical animals and plants their characteristics. That only points to the existence of an afterlife if you want it to point there, if you're working from the bottom line. You could also say that all of this points to "souls" being a universal fuel for magic, being burned after death to power regular spellwork and magical plants/animals' abilities in the world. This sounds horrible, so you wouldn't want it to be true, but it doesn't make (qualitatively) less sense than the afterlife. Your bottom line says what you use as evidence, and what you ignore as it doesn't fit.

I think JK wanted a story where souls and the afterlife are real, and yet there is no clear evidence for them, only hints. I think this is by design. She knows concrete evidence would've changed society drastically, and she doesn't want to write a story occurring in a society that different. I also think a rational person living in a world where god decided to mislead them is going to get misled. Rationality doesn't lead you anywhere the evidence doesn't exist for.

In general, Harry is wrong often (mostly about Quirrell), but we don't see the results of all of his mistakes untill the last ~20 chapters, so it doesn't feel like he's wrong often enough. It is also true that after his first serious mistake in the experiments (thinking spells are a crutch that can be ignored), his conclusions regarding magic are often true (patronus and dementors, the cloak, partial transfiguration) , though at least the cloak is given as a riddle that he is in a unique position to solve. I think a lot of us would like more of a story of Hermione and him making mistakes together and learning the secrets of magic, but that isn't the story we got. If you'd write something like that, I promise to read it.

****** We don't "know" any of those things, but we should lend greater weight to those possibilities then before.

Occam's razor plays into this situation with this new evidence.

You're basically rephrasing the same evidence but in a different way.

We have evidence that there exists magical mind structures that contain and preserve human consciousness. Via these structures, a human mind can control and live in a nonhuman body with vastly different brains.

These magical mind structures can also exist after the physical destruction of the human brain. And these structures have self awareness since they can reflect on their death and have a culture (death day's and such)

Some sort of universal system responds to the cognition produced by these mind structures to produce effects in certain ways that violate conventional physics.

So why aren't these magical mind structures souls? What's the difference?

Just from a cursory glance,, there seems to be compelling evidence that souls exist.

Of course it can be handwaived away as some sort of temporary simulation that the magic system sets. Emulates human minds so it can respond to human mental processes. Emulations that do all of the things above. Some sort of weird esoteric computer thing. Maybe some ancient hyper advanced AI intelligence system?

That's a more complicated less probable explanation then just saying souls exist.

Souls existing is a much simpler less complex, and more elegant conclusion. Doesn't that satisfy Occam's razor more?

Why does he believe in magical AI emulations that do all sorts of bizzare things that conveniently line up with popular u derstandings of souls? And not believe in souls. Like...

It doesn't matter if souls exist in HPMOR or not.

I'm not critiquing Harry's conclusions, I'm critiquing the way he came to these conclusions.

It would be a more interesting story if Harry had to confront these things and work to update his model of reality at a fundamental level.

To me, that is fundamentally a more rational and enjoyable story to me.

******* I think you're making some valid points and some mistakes.

The ghosts from canon is pretty solid evidence of souls. I agree with that. Souls in HPMOR are rarely interacted with, and their consciousness nerfed to reduce the strength of evidence for souls, because souls clearly existing would change the story to a different one from what EY wants to tell, I think. An increased probability to the existence of an afterlife would reduce the narrative weight of Hermione's death, though as we've seen in the metafic that does open other venues for character development.

Regarding your points on Occam's razor, I don't think you're using it correctly. Just because some incredibly complicated idea has a short name "souls" that carries agreed upon meaning in society, doesn't make it more probable. If you tabboo the word "soul" (stop using it), you'd have to exchange it to quite a long description, which would make it sound less plausible. If you insist on remaining vague, your "souls" hypothesis doesn't have predictive power. If you define it carefully, you'll find it doesn't sound less complicated than Harry's supposed hypothesis of some magical artifact that serves as a emulator for sentient minds that are detached from physical brains (also, no AI necessary, just the hardware, and each magical process using it would be like connecting your phone to wifi, or your electrical appliance to the electrical network).

I suggest Imagining that you never heard about the idea of souls, specifically the concept that includes an afterlife. Would you directly jump to assuming an afterlife if you've seen animagi? Or ghosts?

For example, he doesn't tell Harry his mentor is doomed cause it's a cliche , he says that cause there's a specific prophecy.

*** right, harry made a wrong assumption about Dumbledore's beliefs based on his behavior (which D was being intentionally confusing with to throw people off)

However, I do think that Harry is consistently too quick to return to "scientific" explanations for things like Souls when he already knows his entire model of the world is wrong. He hasn't fully internalized the real impact of what he learned in chapter 1. He knows animagus exist, yet he still says things like "the brain is the mind, brain damage proves souls can't exist." This is clearly false given a woman can turn into a cat and keep thinking - he even notices this contradiction the first time he experiences - but he still fails to update his model and question other related assumptions.

Given that his base assumptions are fundamentally flawed at a very deep level, he should be much more willing to listen to the opinions of experienced authorities who DO know about magic. Harry is pattern matching on afterlife = religion = dumb muggles, a behavior he criticizes others for, including Dumbledore, but fails to notice in himself.

I feel like a lot of people seriously missed the point of "all physics and causality as we understand it is out the window."

I totally agree that in muggle space there's no correlation between belief in afterlife and its probable reality.

However, the "brain = mind" argument implies that harry is still operating off assumptions about the base nature of reality that are fundamentally incorrect. There's not just some tidy explanation for animagus and magic in general like it's advanced technology that is consistent with prior models; the models are wrong at their core, and so you can no longer make predictions based on them.

Harry can no longer take as reliable the assumption that the physical reality he knows and observes is the base system the universe runs on, and further whatever does lie underneath magic (if there is any consistent system at all) is clearly tuned to respond to conscious minds in ways physics do not.

Elizier implied this in a post script comment once, but it's much more plausible to assume that base reality is magical and tied to sentience somehow, and that muggles and physics are a restricted subset of that reality, than that magic exists as a subset of physics.

Given this, it's not at all safe to say the physical brain = the mind based merely on brain damage as evidence, especially when there are clear counterexamples like animagi, metamorphmagi, polujuice, and mental magic like legilimancy, confundus, ghosts, etc.

Even if harry is right in being cynical that ghosts are non sentient "afterimages" they are still non corporeal minds.

Does all this mean harry should immediately jump to the conclusion that there is a happy afterlife? Of course not! But he should be slow to judge those with more magical experience, and not at all trust the modes of thought that applied when physics was the only law.

#+end_quote

I think that while I agree what this sencence says I disagree whith what I think you mean.

Obiously in the hpmor universe there are some ways where how wizards think affects the world. Thing is minds are complicated, this mechanism will also have to be complicated. That is because minds themselves are pretty complicated and have lots of internal moving parts and can't posibly be just fundamental.

The way people intuitively think about the universe whith animism and things like justice being fundamental while does vaguely correspond to ways the universe could work it just isn't really a coherent model of any logicaly posible universe.

If you try to munchkin magic systems that work like people think you quickly realize vague verbal ideas can't possibly be a perfect model of any universe at all cause they aren't even complete, they don't actually tell you what happens if you do x or y thing , and there's lots of nuace and details that could work in very diferent ways depending on what the actual rules of the universe are. Your mind is alowed to not have all the answers but the universe isn't.

Anyway going back to the brain thing. Well if you think about how souls or whatever could work there are lots of problems.

Mainly that well affecting the brain does affect people's minds. Like you can't claim this is not the case, then your model doesn't explain why I can affect minds by messing whith brains. So like even if there's some extra soul stuff or something if I cause you brain damage you are still going to be brain damaged whith all the corresponding changes to your mind. I mean because that is what we have observed so far. Maybe not in some weird edge case that doesn't come up arround mugles(for example voldemort would probably be fine if you gave him brain damage, cause he does have something like a soul) . Hpmor is not set in a fantasy world completely unrelated to our own.

Also It seems like having anything like the usual idea of an afterlife would take a really complicated and purposely designed mechanism for this to work, and would take an insane amount of patches for it to work in a nice way, even only for the edge cases I can think of, much less the edge cases that actually happen and would be unnecessarily more complicated that a simpler approach which was more obious. I mean unless muggles don't have souls and wizards do and all of the evidence for brains = minds comes up differently when tested on wizards.

The story even touches in lots of the problems of this. Harry exploits one of the flaws of voldemort's attempts at making something like this to defeat him for example.

Neville's parents are permanently damaged, turning into a cat presumably wouldn't help then so seems weird to assume dying would. And pretty much anyone that dies in a way that slowly degrades their minds , which is most people nonadays is doomed. Maybe even going to experience a fate worse that death.

I mean maybe the whole ghost thing is a side effect of someone's attempt at making an afterlife or something like that but if so it probably only works for wizards (I mean muggles don't leave ghosts) that die in certain kinds of circumstances. Or maybe it's just a big cryonics like thing, and people are stored for future revival somewhere. Or it's a failure and it's a have no mouth and must scream kind of thing.

Or its actually just the result of whatever thing keeps track of wizard thoughts to affect other stuff breaking or something like that.

Figuring that out is pretty important, might imply some policy changes in hospitals and life in general are necessary depending on the details .

Thing is this is not obious and wizards are not acting like they really believe this or any other form of afterlife. They act exactly like mugles act about death. They are doing something wrong both if they are right about the afterlife existing and if they are wrong. Harry is correct when pointing out their mistakes, even if he doesn't have the clarity necessary to see his own.

woah that's a really big claim you are making about the possibility space for all conceivable universes. we are going to have to step that back and dig in a bit because claiming that no other universe can function this way is pretty broad and I don't see how it can possibly be supported, given that we are positing worlds that work fundamentally differently from our own.

I definitely agree with your final sentence here. Harry may be pointing out real flaws in wizard philosophy, and he also is blind to some of his own cultural bias.

I don't think brain damage is conclusive. You are calling souls "extra stuff" but what I'm suggesting is that you could have an entire universe where the fundamental substrate is Mental, and the Physical is just a projection. The Physical still interacts with the mental, of course, and there may be rigid rules around how this works, but the fundamental nature of this world could be wholly based on information and consciousness, not matter.

Think of it like players in a video game that has fairly realistic physics. Yes, the game has rules, and when you are hit by a car in the game the physics simulates damage to your "body" when is then translated into reduced ability to interact with the physics engine. But under it all is just code - pure information.

If Magic works like Harry suspects - that the metaphor for a computer program holds true - it's FAR more likely that the physics they experience are a restricted subset of that program, not that the "magic" program was built /within/ the physics. The magic engine is an admin layer that supersedes the physics engine and grants limited access to the code itself.

This seems like a perfectly plausible way to build a universe, and not logically incomplete or inconsistent, and it entirely throws out all notions of using physics and material interactions to understand the fundamental nature of reality. Running physical experiments in a simulated world only tells you /how the physics engine of the game you are playing was coded/, it tells you nothing about the operating system or architecture of the fundamental stratum.

This is why I think Harry is not adequately grokking how little he knows, and leans much too heavily on ideas from his prior context which are based on a fundamentally flawed model of the world. All he knows are what other players figured out about the rules of the game game through trial and error; these are all but useless when trying to hack the code of the root universe itself.

******** I agree with a lot of what you say but not some stuff like for example

>I'm suggesting is that you could have an entire universe where the fundamental substrate is Mental, and the Physical is just a projection.

So like i think that it's possible that the physics observed are a special case of whatever the actual rules of the universe are.Its in fact like a good hypothesis.Like to me the thing in eliezer's author's note makes sense.And that opens up to a lot of posibilities.

But I don't think that one posibility is that the world is fundamentally made of mental stuff.

Mental stuff is complicated, it feels simple from the inside but its necesarilly made of other stuff that isn't mental.

True there are definitely possible universes, computable universes even , that have rules that a person could look at and think of them as stuff like "justice" being part of the laws of the universe.

But like there is an infinite amount of universes like that with completely different rules and none of them completely correspond to people's intuitions.

Cause people's intuitions are vague , and the universe can't be fundamentally vague that's mixing the map and the territory so to speak. Like if I wanted to program a simulation based on the description of the typical vague concept based magic system people like to exploit in the munckinism thread there are unlimited simulations with really different rules, not just internally but in terms of actual outcomes, as the questions the people in those threads ask show.\\
It feels like there's some coherent idea of a world with fundamental justice would look like, I've seen people discussing fiction on the internet implicitly talk like that's a thing.\\
But I think that is not true, or at least not obviously true until you start explicitly trying to get more coherent philosophical views out of your intuitions, if it was it would constrain your expectations more, and DM wouldn't need to basically arbitrarily decide what the sword that can only be lifted by just people does when [insert convoluted edge case here]

And anyway rules like that are wayyy more complicated.

You need lots of evidence to actually be convinced the universe works like that, compared to simpler ways that the universe could work. Cause otherwise there's always a more complicated model that overfits to your observations, so you need some working form of Occam's razor.But obviously that doesn't mean that no evidence can convince you the world doesn't have that kind of rules, that's not how good reasoning works.\\
And in hpmor there's definitely some way what people think affects stuff like dementors, and how spells seem to work the way their inventors expect to work.

Going back to the souls thing. Human minds are affected by brain damage.Maybe like in the "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie" fic wizards don't get brain damage,and like their minds are actually running in something else than brains. But like this actually would look differently than what we observe in muggles(and well the fic actually goes whith this).

Saying brain damage affects people's minds in complicated ways and the activity of the brain mirrors the behavior of the mind but minds don't actually correspond with brains requires the thing that minds are actually made of to have really complicated rules for that correspondence.It is more likely in the world of Hpmor than our own give the evidence that Harry has seen.But it's still not the class of hypothesis I would bet on after reading the entire book. Saying that brain damage and neurodegenerative diseases and torture and obliviation affects people's minds but somehow that damage is not permanent and they are fine after "death"(which brings an insane amount of edge cases depending on the rules of when people dies happens, and like if it coincides with the ghost thing seems like would require extra rules to prevent exploits like filling the afterlife with Hermione copies by reviving and killing her, she wasn't even braindead yet) requires insanely more complicated rules and is maybe not even coherent[had a few paragraphs about the coherent part and my model of identity and stuff but post already is too long and probably shouldn't start juggling too many lines of discussion at the same time]

Anyway those are separate things that require separate evidence.

Evidence that harry doesn't really has.

And I think that if there was really obviously strong evidence people wouldn't be acting like normal about death.

Acting like normal about dead is not at all like being in the same epistemic state about the afterlife than about whether other countries exist.People acting like that are in fact some evidence against the afterlife, it discards a whole class of obvious afterlife hypothesis(plus I mean duh conservation of expected evidence).
