Blue: What? No, he has to apologize to ME.\\
Leaf: You literally told him he should have died.\\
Blue: Well, obviously I didn't /mean/ it.\\
Leaf: What if, and this is just a theory, Red doesn't think that's obvious.\\
Blue: ...Shit.

Ahh, I was so glad this conversation happened. I really like that we address the Aiko thing from all sorts of different perspectives in this chapter, and that we got to see all 3 of our protags interact. Last time we got a Leaf POV was the big argument itself!

** "Every region needs its own legendary under a trainer's control. That way no region would want to mess with them. They could just send their trainer over and wreak nearly as much havoc in revenge."

Quite some parallels to nuclear weapons here, but there are some key differences. One is that the number of legendaries are limited - once they're all caught, there won't be anymore. The other is how people assume that, at least at first, a single trainer will be controlling a caught legendary. That's a lot of responsibility to put on a single person, especially since they might even be a teenager at the time. Scary stuff.

It felt as if I should have a strong response to the name Natural, but I just haven't played enough of the games to know who that is. He seems to have a bulbapedia page, maybe I'll read that. Or maybe just play Black/White? Is there a way to do that without a console?

*** Natural (simply "N" in the games) is a central character to the story from Black/White, and his introduction absolutely made me reel. We've seen so many earthshaking* sideplots getting hinted and twisted together (we've already got Mewtwo, the Hoenn disasters, and now Unova's too?) -- I'm honestly kinda afraid that they'll overshadow our protagonists! Intellectually though, I'm also really curious how N will be adapted to this version of the Pokémon world.

* I mean, /every/ region's story in the games after gold/silver has dramatically earthshaking consequences, and so far Daystar has made each and every detail even scarier!

Still cant wait to see how his appearance ropes team plasma into leaf's storyline. Interesting that with all the talk throughout the chapter of escalating national threat levels by catching legendaries is contrasted by ending the chapter with the introduction of the person who wants to de-escalate threats by releasing captured pokemon. (P.S. is N gonna be a psychic in this series to explain how he can talk to pokemon? Thatd be an obvious explanation but I cant remember if he's ever shown interacting with dark types.)

Speaking of which the little interaction between Leaf and MG made me chuckle.

Other than that like others said it mainly felt like a clean up chapter. Tying up some loose plotlines, connecting some others together while reminding people of earlier chapters.

Not too mention setting new goals for people, Red already has his but giving a more defined role to Blue and a new arc for Leaf. Its looking good!

** With all this talk of pokeball conditioning and even the potential to use pokeball technology to overwrite the brain of pokemon I have to wonder. Is the real reason why no one has solved the human storage issue (edit: specifically the issue that humans get brain damage when stored in pokeballs) because people in power don't want the technology to exist. The sort of abuse humaballs could lead to is quite astounding after all. You could for instance kidnap people and condition them to be unquestionably loyal cultists. And with Bill's hypothetical copy pasting of brain states you could achieve a sort of memetic immortality, and all you have to do is use a TM to murder the person with a mind overwrite.

**** The intelligence declined is what I meant by the human storage issue, though I should have been more clear about it.

Right now the human catching balls would be seen by wider society as really elaborate way to kill someone. (Meanwhile people like Bill see them as an extreme measure to avoid death and hope someone can revive them later) If human catching balls could be made fully functional the danger they would represent would be so much greater, think invasion of the body snatchers. So my comment was to wonder if the previous attempts to solve the human cognitive decline problem were failed intentionally.

***** Ah I get it now. That's plausible.

My own experience with the real world is that a lot of things would be pretty easy to implement but haven't been because it takes a lot of work to get the business side of it going well. Like, you could make a cryogenic preservation concept into a pokeball form, but to make it useful to anyone you also need to figure out how to store the balls, which can get expensive, and you have to get the knowledge across to people who would give you money for making the thing, keep on top of legal and social demands, and so on, and if any of that fails the work of development becomes a waste of time because even if someone else takes up the work later they'll have to retread the ground you covered because documentation has a way of evaporating.

This isn't a sentence with a lot of thought, just a kind of tossed off hat on the real message of her anger, but the reason that their friend group was doomed to split up is that Blue, Red and Leaf would each register that sentence coming from Leaf to Blue, and his subsequent apology in this particular situation as meaning a different thing.

Unrelated, how do you handle the "the pokémon world can't make sense, just domesticating a growlite would skip the fire mastery technological step and kickstart metalurgy". I know in your world pre-pokeball only a few people could handle them, but they still got to the point of having armies. So pokémon influencing technology is a given, but how you handle that influence? Don't you think those are too many factors to actually predict where humanity should be in that regard at present time?

It seems it's just a question of adding, removing and modifying some modules. The bigger issue seems to be what consequences Bill's proposal, if made possible, would have. Copying and modifying brainstates like a piece of code makes it so that you can basically make everything that can be subdued enough to go into a poke ball do your bidding.
