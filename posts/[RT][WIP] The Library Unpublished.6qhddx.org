Long time no see, [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Some of you might remember me from my somewhat hpmor-related recursive meta fanfiction [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9829580/chapters/22071191][On The Continuity of Consciousness]], or from my non-rational [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11244174][Worm/Inside Out crossover oneshot]]. I've started writing something original, and was unsure whether to post it here. My trusty proofreader [[/u/Noumero][u/Noumero]] and I eventually decided that we'd just leave the decision of whether it's "rational enough" to all of you.

In *[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498][The Library Unpublished]]*, a bookworm gets his hands on a fictional book, which soon proves to be merely the first of a long series of similar oddities.

Updates will be posted every Sunday. There will be 10 (or 11) chapters in total, depending on whether you count Chapter 0. Do you want me to post updates in this subreddit? Post your opinions in the comments!

Thanks to [[/u/Noumero][u/Noumero]] for encouragement, feedback, proofreading, and general inspiration. Also, thanks to nostalgebraist for writing [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]], without which The Library Unpublished wouldn't exist. Lastly, thank you for reading :)

TL; DR: Link here: *[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498][The Library Unpublished]]*


** I like it and I would like updates. What is the point of Chapter 0?

*** Thanks :)

Chapter 0... well... You might have noticed that the last work on that list is The Library Unpublished. There's also the somewhat puzzling Editor's note on Chapter 1. Rest assured that we'll be learning more about what both of those mean, and while parts of Chapter 0 serve only to illustrate cio_cielle's character, other parts might be more relevant later.

**** I noticed that the word count for The Library Unpublished is 2029 words with 2/11 chapters while the description for The Library Unpublished in Chapter 0 says 2029 words with 1/10 chapters.

***** Yes, that's not completely unintentional :)

I don't think I should spell out everything. Feel free to speculate out loud :)

(FYI, ao3 doesn't add author's notes onto the word count.)
