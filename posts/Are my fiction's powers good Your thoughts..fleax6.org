** They make a nice thematically coherent triad. It's good that they have costs. It's interesting that the physical invulnerability's cost is immediate and clear, while the others are more vague long term terminal menaces.

What is the power level here? Invulnerable to scratches or bullets? A vague sense of emotions when facing someone, or detailed info on everyone around? Can you mix powers?

*** The invulnerability is to fatigue, hunger, thirst, and ageing not physical injuries it even makes them deadlier.

Clear and instantaneous read to the point that it makes the person think it's even their own, making them lose their sense of self if they keep it up for enough time.

No because the person can only train to manifest one of them, the body cannot handle more then one, the powers are extract from their own soul.
