*** Really? I was hoping he'd died just to prevent the cliché. I mean, I like Dominic's character, but I like creative plot twists even more.

**** There were hints that he'd survive, though. It's not a really unexpected twist. I'd even say that, although it had been foreshadowed too, Welexi's 'descent into madness' last chapter felt more surprising.

**** At this point, pretty much everything is a cliché, including killing off the protagonist. It hasn't been truly unexpected since Hitchcock's Psycho.

***** ? Killing off the protagonist isn't unheard of, but it's definitely pretty rare in my experience. And mid-story protagonist switches due to said killing? I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, so I can't really consider that cliché at all.

****** Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It's diluted by the fact that you play multiple characters in the campaign, but you definitely perish after playing one of them for several missions in a highly memorable sequence.

******* Definitely a great example, thanks for reminder. [[#s][MW spoiler]] Scenes like that are exactly the reason I would like to see it used to great effect.

******** You're thinking of MW2's "No Russian" level. I was thinking of MW1, where your character gets literally nuked.

********* Now that you bring it up, I think I remember that... Sorry been a long time.

Just out of curiosity, have you played any of the CoD games after those? Worth playing or any amazing scenes/plots?

********** I've played every main CoD except for the first one. MW3's campaign was silly (more so than MW2, which in turn was sillier than MW1, which was actually pretty realistic). The other campaigns have ranged between silly and forgettable, although they've had good moments (e.g. there's a neat space sequence). I actually liked Advanced Warfare's campaign until the end - it started off as a good futuristic extrapolation before falling into boring (and irrational) tropes.

Multiplayer's a different story. I never got into any of the WWII-era MPs (including World At War), but the other games have had increasingly good MP. For reference, my favorite FPS MP was Deus Ex, due to how your character "leveled up" during gameplay with super powers. CoD has essentially gained this kind of system, albeit without the ridiculously awesome powers like super speed and friend-or-foe vision. Each MW, BO, and Ghosts consumed probably 100 hours of my time each, and I get addicted to non-Hearthstone games very rarely these days. Great maps, great progression systems, etc. The exception, unfortunately, was Advanced Warfare. I really, really wanted to like it, especially due to its movement system, but they removed Dead Silence, the perk I absolutely love. (Silencing your footsteps makes you sneakier, which is nice, but it also allows you to listen for others, which is almost like having X-ray vision. I enable it ASAP in every game and I always play with headphones.) After realizing this, I lost interest quickly. Hopefully BO3 (Treyarch) will be a return to form, since AW was Sledgehammer. We'll see.
