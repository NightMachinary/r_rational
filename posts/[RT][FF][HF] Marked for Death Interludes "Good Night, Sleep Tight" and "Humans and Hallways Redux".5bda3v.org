The latest chapters by forum plebs QTesseract (E: [[/u/1101560][u/1101560]] here) and [[/u/oliwhail][u/oliwhail]] (that's me!) are *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1182#post-7195351][here]]* and *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1182#post-7196271][here]]*.

Today, a bedtime story gives us a peek into the past, and we take another look at the story so far from [[#s][Pandaa]]'s point of view.

--------------

Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.

The first chapter is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][here,]] and the story-only thread (if you'd like to get caught up quickly) is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/][here.]] There's also a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/][guide to voting]] put together by Twofold, one of the thread participants. Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja.

The story updates every Thursday ([[/u/Velorien][u/Velorien]] of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up the Dark]]) and Sunday ([[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko][Team Anko]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][2 Year Emperor]] and [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html][Induction]]).


** I just caught up with the story. Waiting on 81!

I love the direction its taking so far! I really hope we get Team Uplift in a face-to-face with Sarutobi soon. It'd open up a vast swathe of opportunities to integrate canon characters.

*** Nice! I'm with you there - super excited to find out what some of the canon characters have turned into in a rational version of the world.

Hopefully the whole party lives to see it!

**** I only posted like, twice, back when we were still deciding on what the characters' bloodlines should be. Since then, it's just been reading.

***** Even if you don't frequently help out with plans directly (as I don't because, uh, stressful and lazy :D), we could use more folks around tossing ideas at each other. Minds for the hive mind! ...plus it's hilarious, honestly.

Up to you, though!
