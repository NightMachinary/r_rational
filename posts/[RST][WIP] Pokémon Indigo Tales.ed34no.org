*** The blurb:

#+begin_quote
  An anthology of realistic short stories, with narratives in various styles and addressing the most diverse themes. Like my other works, it is done in an attempt to close the gap between the childishness of the Pokémon franchise and the demand for greater realism and complexity of adults and young people who grew up with the Pokémon.
