** I just got a Less Wrong email about this too... are you the creator of this game?

*** Nope, just saw it linked on [[/r/HPMOR]] and played a round. Surprised it wasn't posted here before, really.

** Three things:

a) I got that this is tongue-in-cheek parody, but it still gave me flash backs to this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwZsSfu6QmY][horrible kickstarter covered by retsupurae]].

b) Elevator gate - does anyone really want to bring that up again? I didn't even knew that had any crossing with the Less Wrong community, and I fear that if I dig into that I will facepalm a lot.

c) I find that the concept hardly works, even in the most "perfect" examples shown in the page the humor doesn't work as well and the information is not transmitted well enough.

** I can't think of any likely situation where I'd play this game, but I do want to read all of the cards.

** I'm not very impressed?

I mean, I understand that it's satire, but it's not very funny, and the random Elevatorgate mention was just... weird and distasteful?

Also I've never heard anyone actually use 'neurotypical' as an insult.
