The latest chapter, "Roar," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/69330477][here]]. CW for Violence.

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

*This series is being posted in various places:*

** [[/u/gramineous]] suggested that I mention that I have a Patreon campaign, so [[https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks?fan_landing=true][here it is]].

It looks like most "get early access to chapters" reward tiers are $3, so that's what I've set that particular tier at, but it's worth noting that I write a lot of other things, too, including worldbuilding resources and original fiction, and there's a $1 tier that just covers getting free access to anything I'm putting on my store. That's what the campaign was originally for, actually.

Recent releases have included "108 Titles & Epithets for Gods" and "Cooking for Vampires," which covers the kinds of flavors that vampires are likely to be sensitive to (and why), what happens when you bake or cook with blood (it can replace eggs in pancakes!), and stuff like that. Both of these are still available for anyone who joins the Patreon in the next couple of weeks.

(And for those of you who prefer to not mix Patreon with fanfic, rest assured that it'll be months before I talk about this again, if at all)

Okay, there's no way that blood, which is almost entirely water, would actually act as an emulsifier, so this is clearly...

...Huh. I think I'm more disturbed, knowing that this is actually plausible.

**** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecithin][Lecithin]]*

Lecithin (, from the Greek lekithos "yolk") is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues which are amphiphilic -- they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both hydrophilic and lipophilic), and are used for smoothing food textures, emulsifying, homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials.Lecithins are mixtures of glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid.Lecithin was first isolated in 1845 by the French chemist and pharmacist Théodore Gobley. In 1850, he named the phosphatidylcholine lécithine. Gobley originally isolated lecithin from egg yolk---λέκιθος lekithos is "egg yolk" in Ancient Greek---and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874; in between, he had demonstrated the presence of lecithin in a variety of biological matters, including venous blood, in human lungs, bile, human brain tissue, fish eggs, fish roe, and chicken and sheep brain. Lecithin can easily be extracted chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether or benzene; or extraction can be done mechanically.

Serious question, as you have [[https://nordicfoodlab.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/2013-9-blood-and-egg/][linked]] a recipe and probably researched the matter:

What about the iron in the blood and all the pathogens. If you also eat meat and a lot of blood you should get an overdose of iron. And I guess they didn't always cook the blood enough to kill all pathogens. So it seems quite unhealthy.

After reading the linked article a bit: Egg intolerance as major allergy in Europe is new for me. Maybe only in specific countries? I have never even heard of that in the first place. Okay a quick google scholar search confirms at least that it is a thing.

[[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1398-9995.2001.056005403.x][This study]] says 1.6-2.6% of children have egg allergy.

Here the [[https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=egg+intolerance+prevalence&btnG=][search query]] if anybody is interested in further information.

**** It's no different than keeping track of fiber, or vitamin c intake. Blood does have a lot of iron in it, but it's possible to not consume an unhealthy amount. Consuming blood is great for people with anemia, and [[https://www.amazon.com/Hematogen-50g-1-8-Oz-bars/dp/B01MSN40V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8][blood candy bars]] are relatively popular in the former Soviet Bloc (you shouldn't have more than one a day, but really, should you have more than one of /any/ candy bar in a single day?).

I haven't read anything to suggest that bloodborne pathogens are hardier or trickier to deal with than what you'd find in meat, and most of the recipes I've come across do thoroughly cook the blood.

Other fun blood foods:

- Black pudding

- [[https://www.vice.com/en/article/4xb4ww/blood-custard-tastes-better-than-it-sounds][Blood custard]]

- [[https://www.shine.cn/feature/taste/1707140720/][Black "tofu"]]

(To repeat what you said, though---real people shouldn't eat this stuff too often. Cooking for Vampires is meant for worldbuilding, not IRL meal planning.)

** Only read HG-at-SC of this series, but like it so far. Especially the writing style and how Hermione and her thoughts are described.

The bullying in the beginning is realistic outside of the fact that this is a trope in HP fanfiction where Hermione is alone. The connection with Fleur was therefore necessary to build up Hermione so she isn't just the punching bag and manages to go to Hogwarts for the tournament. Still very okay for my suspension of disbelief.

But what would be a put-off and potential reason to drop this fiction is if Hermione is selected as Triwizard Champion although she hasn't put her name into the cup. I hope that doesn't happen. Her deciding to compete would also be quite unbelievable after the duel.

The duel itself didn't surprise me in its violence, not that I suspected it outright, but it is a society ruled by Voldemort, which shapes the window of your expectations.

​

I am also waiting for a believable explanation for why Malfoy is how he is. And what happend with Harry and why Cedric seems not to exist. But the latter two might be explained in the prior stories of this series.

There are a couple of other people who are in the same boat, and I'm /very/ interested to hear whenever you have questions (as you do at the end of your comment). I'd obviously prefer if everybody read every story, but it's kind of a weird format and to be honest they were written over such a span of time that I feel like there's a noticeable quality difference in some of them, so I'd like to make sure that Silent Country is comprehensible for people who skip all that.

Erring on the side of brevity, and possibly leaving out too much: Abraxas Malfoy and Dumbledore were on the same side originally, but then Abraxas died and Lucius decided Dumbledore's defeat was inevitable, so the Malfoys turned their coats. Now that Riddle's won, however, Lucius might well be more useful dead than alive, and Lucius knows it, so he's spent the past decade or so being very terrified and hoping that, when he does die, Riddle at least won't have any reason to go after his kids.

(Most of the above is in "What a Very Nice Fire" and "Any Other Virtue".)

Incidentally, most of the "pure-blood aristocracy" types are no longer in Slytherin. Riddle isn't running wide-scale purges (perhaps because Britain simply doesn't have the population to support that) but he's still wielding the carrot and stick skillfully enough that many people want to show that they've "reformed," and when everybody in your family for three hundred years has gone to +Pure-Blood Supremacy House+ Slytherin House, telling your kid "anything but Slytherin" is a relatively cheap way to signal that you've reformed.

#+begin_quote
  And what happened with Harry
#+end_quote

James and Lily are dead, and Snape and Harry are hiding out in Denmark---where Snape is pretending to be a squib and Harry, last we saw him in summer 1991, is preparing to attend Durmstrang.

Some readers have suggested that Harry is going to show up as part of the Durmstrang delegation. One reader has suggested that the "sharp-looking boy" walking close behind Karkaroff is Harry.

#+begin_quote
  and why Cedric seems not to exist.
#+end_quote

Cedric exists, but he was in the wrong year to be in the Opening Duel.

A few months ago, I was all set to have Cedric Diggory be Hufflepuff's champion in the Duel, actually, and then I thought, /hey, maybe I should double-check his birth date/, and...he was a seventeen-year-old Sixth Year, like Hermione will soon be a fifteen-year-old Fourth Year, so I had to figure out a replacement. I'm pretty happy with the change, though, because Haywood is really going to shake things up in a way that Diggory wouldn't've (for one thing, Diggory would /not/ be setting anybody on fire, and Hermione would not have been so shaken by the Opening Duel).

***** All of the previous stories in TINTF are canonical for HG & the SC. You can think of them as a very long prelude.

(HG & the SC will probably be as long as the rest of TINTF, and then there will be 2-3 more stories of that length, then an equivalently-sized postlude, plus some number of interludes scattered throughout).
