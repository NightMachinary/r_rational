Hi [[/r/rational]],

Late last year I got the itch to continue a D&D campaign that got crippled by having children and then murdered by Covid. In planning it I somehow started rewriting the campaign and setting as a story focused on an amalgamation of the PC's with the most significant backstories.

The campaign was not a rational story, but in adapting it from a campaign to what the story is now it has adopted some rational aspects in the main character and the way the story is presented. The D&D campaign itself borrowed heavily from some stories posted here, but that's mostly been removed from the story now.

I'm writing the story as an outlet for my pent up DM energies, but really would appreciate any feedback, grammar, plot, ect.

The upcoming chapters are going to get heavier into how the magic works, so I'd particularly appreciate feedback on those areas from this community.

Royal Road Summary:

/Tal is a sorcerer in a world where they are killed on sight, traveling with a man charged with carrying out the task. Every night Tal must pretend to study his/ /Spellbook/ /to maintain his disguise as a Wizard's Apprentice. If his disguise slips and his charade is uncovered, it will be his death sentence. Seeking answers to mysteries that arose after his parent's murder, Tal must accept any allies, no matter the risks, to uncover his family's secret./

/Despite his best efforts to avoid “Adventuring,” as his father would call it, adventure seems determined to find him. The big problems of his past seem to keep being eclipsed by the problems of his present./
