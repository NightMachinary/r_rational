** If you're starting out, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][the wiki]] is a good place to start.

Personal recommendations: "Worth the Candle" and "A Practical Guide to Evil". Both are quite popular around here.

If you have more specific things about MoL that you enjoyed, we might be able to narrow down some recommendations.

** What I loved about MoL is the gradual improvements Zorian made throughout the story. Cradle by Will Wight and the Arcane Ascension series by Andrew Rowe. The MCs in both stories start weak and gradually improve their strengths to overcome challenges.

If you like the time travel aspect, Time Braid, which is a Naruto fanfiction and is complete is written pretty well. The MC in there is Sakura, but Naruto gets enough screen time as well. She is not stupid or annoying as in canon either. You need a little familiarity with the series to enjoy it though.

*** Or, if you want the badfic version of Time Braid, you can read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day][Chuunin Exam Day]], which is inarguably its inspiration.

I mention this because I'm fairly sure Mother of Learning owes its existence to Chuunin Exam Day - the author was active in the Naruto fandom before writing it, and a lot of worldbuilding elements and themes are similar. (Chakra control exercises versus shaping exercises, the long time loop in specific, the emphasis on finding different masters and learning things from them, and Zack in particular, who is basically Naruto with Sasuke's backstory.) I'm not certain, but that's definitely what I had in mind when I was reading it.

**** My favorite thing about Mother of Learning's worldbuilding is how obviously Naruto/Chakra-system-inspired it is. I absolutely love that aspect of Naruto, and it adds so much depth to Mother of Learning. A world in which magic is literally omnipresent, bloodline limits exist, the huge focus on (ahem) chakra control, etc.

****** I watched and enjoyed naruto, but nothing about MoL specifically screamed "NARUTO REFERENCE" to me... Even now that the connection has been pointed, it's not obvious to me that shaping exercises were adapted from chakra control exercises. I've seen similar things in a bunch of different fictional universes.

For example, one of Andur's books (I think it was Agent of the Realm) has a mana control exercise in a classroom setting where students have to try to hold an floating object in place without anchoring it to the position of their hand, just like in MoL. Isn't stuff like that fairly standard training fare for fantasy?

******* I think it's a level divorced from that. It's "Naruto-fanfic" inspired rather than Naruto-inspired. Again, read Chuunin Exam Day. Or don't read it since it's pretty garbage, quality-wise, but it was certainly influential.

Many of the elements from Arc 1 of Mother of Learning have the same "flavor" as the powerups in Chuunin Exam Day. For specific examples, basically all of Zorian's work with working on (the basic 3) shaping to make your attacks invisible and modify magic/techniques fall into that category, including the idea of a "basic three" techniques for training/needed to progress to better magic. The numerous shaping exercises (in Arc 1) that improve control were clearly inspired by it and had analogues in Chuunin Exam Day in terms of how they were described. Some of the later ideas like bringing people across loops and some of the mind technique stuff also have a similar style to how those ideas are implemented in Chuunin Exam Day or Time Braid.

Edit: Another thing that comes to mind is how Zach claims that people are willing to train him due to being the last Noveda when explaining himself to Zoria- this is basically what people do for Sasuke (or rather, Naruto impersonating Sasuke) in Chunin Exam Day and is phrased in a very similar manner. It gets actual further development later on in MoL, when we actually learn about the Noveda, but the initial shorthand explanation in Chapter 8 of Mother of Learning definitely feels like it's straight out of CED.

Another minor thing that gives it the same feel is the one-month time limitation. Both Chuunin Exam Day and the early parts of Time Braid use time loops that only last one month (more accurately, just over 5 weeks, with one month of training before the end of each loop), due to primarily taking place during the Chuunin exam arc. Most other groundhog day/time loop-type fiction uses a different timescale- some have each loop last for a full lifetime, some are a single day like the titular movie, some are loops that slowly progress forward in time, etc.

****** Timebraid's ages are weird. Technically Sakura and the rest of the genins are 12 years old at the beginning of the story, at least that's what canon says and the fic never claims otherwise. On the other hand, within the first few months of Timebraid Sakura has sex with Ino and Sasuke, and it's heavily implied by her inner dialogue that she'd had sex at least a few times before that.

That and some other little things give the impression that the author wrote the genins like they were at least 14 or 15, even though canon says they're 12.

******* I'll agree Timebraid's ages are weird, and it definitely requires a disclaimer before being recommended. His Daniel Black series also has a high amount of sex, but lacks the whole squicky age problem.

But it's source is pretty weird about ages too. Ninja are typically given minimal training and enter a death match to try and become Chunin at age 12 or so.

It's a world where valuable magic users, even the children of the powerful leaders of communities, are made into child soldiers and have their lives, IMO, wasted frivolously.

They shouldn't act like normal children, because they haven't had anything like a normal childhood. It's also possible Chakra changes how people mature mentally.

Kakashi became a Chunin at age 6. Frankly, I don't see how else to make sense of that without Chakra making humans have some pretty big biological differences.

******* Just to tack onto what Aardvarkeating101 said and forestall arguing about definitions, not only is pedophilia usually condemned for the power imbalance (which is present in this example), but even when young children (who are usually abused and are essentially using what they've been taught) have sex play with their cohorts, the other children then generally show trauma afterwards. Time traveler having sex with 11 year-olds ticks all the components for what makes pedophilia objectionable.

********** Well, in no particular order:

1. Sakura was locked into her mind and tortured moderately early on, by creating a smaller virtual time loop starting from a particular moment where the torturer has godlike controls. It hints at rape, directly mentions being dissected while still alive, and a good number of tortures that we don't have words for because it is not possible.

2. With these tortures he created a second trick by "releasing" her, and then giving orders, and putting her back into the other full torture system any time she slightly failed so as to condition her to be as perfectly mindless of a slave as possible.

3. Straight up mind control happens at several points in time.

4. As she is sneaking into a house she gets attacked. casually murders the guy trying to protect his family. This was basically a single sentence, but when murder is such a common occurance "opps, well moving on" is your answer, that is a bad sign.

5. Locking hinata's very soul to be always owned by demon sakura, for eternity. But that is alright, because over the past few weeks they "fell in love". ( for those keeping score, this is pedophilia, followed by claiming an immortal soul, pleasure pain conditioning, and controlling her to harm others and herself because the demon said so)

6. The plan to literally carry every soul in the world physically into hell, along with the world itself, to be tortured for all time.

After that it gets foggy. Does wanton murder count? Stripping someone, tying them up and carving their skin? How many different ways of losing your free will? They carved a guys eyes out early on, so she could wear them. Manipulated pretty much everyone, including kids, into having kinky sex? Throwing kids into basically a pit fight with knives to murder each other? Does the training of child soldiers count as worse? How about the Caged Bird seal?

hell, even canon has mutilation of babies by parents, powerful drugs, mind control, suicide, training of child soldiers, and pit fighting them to death.

The scene with Ino and Sasuke happens very early in the story, when there's only been aimited number of short loops. The main character is still basically the same age at the point.
