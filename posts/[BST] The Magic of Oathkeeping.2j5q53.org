National Novel Writing Month is in two weeks, and I'm trying to make sure I have a solid foundation before I start writing.

1.  Using a simple ritual, you can make an Oath. Anyone can do this, though it's usually done as a declaration in a public space.
2.  You can't fake making an Oath (/Edit: The Oath-making is accompanied by a display of lights that's impossible to duplicate./).
3.  You can't accidentally make an Oath.
4.  You can make as many Oaths as you'd like.
5.  An Oath can be either negative ("I will not ...") or positive ("I will ...").
6.  Oaths are mediated by your internal mental state. The Oath is only kept insofar as you believe that you have kept it.
7.  If you believe, +even for the briefest moment,+ that you have broken your Oath, it is broken. Even if you're "wrong" about having broken your Oath.
8.  When an Oath breaks, all other Oaths you've made break as well.
9.  If your Oaths break, you can make new ones, or even remake the old ones.
10. Oaths give *benefits*. The basic benefits are strength, speed, and durability, but there are others as well, and they vary from person to person in ways that are unrelated to the nature and number of the Oath, and which can't be predicted.
11. The benefits get stronger with time, but start out very weak (it would be highly atypical for even the strongest Oath to have any effect earlier than a year).
12. The benefits get stronger with the /Edit: gross, not net/ desire to break the Oath. If you have no desire whatsoever to break the Oath, you gain no benefit from it.
13. The benefits get stronger with the /ability/ to break the Oath. Making an Oath +not to speak and then ripping out your tongue results in far, far weaker benefits than being able to speak and choosing not to+ to never use your right hand and then cutting your right hand off would have no benefit.
14. The benefits of an Oath are cumulative with all other Oaths a person has made (so there is a point to making multiple Oaths).
15. Breaking an Oath immediately loses you all of the benefits.
16. /Edit: Once granted, benefits are never lost, except by breaking Oaths. Power increases or stagnates, but never decreases./
17. /Edit: If multiple Oaths cover the same thing, you only receive the benefit once. For example, if you made an Oath to not eat grains and another Oath not to eat bread, you would gain nothing from making the second Oath. Duplicate Oaths have no effect./
18. /Edit: You cannot gain a benefit from an Oath you do not remember, but any benefits already gained from a forgotten Oath stay in place./
19. /Edit: The increase of benefit over time is not linear - it is very mildly exponential. Keeping an Oath for ten years gives more benefit than keeping ten Oaths for one year each./

I believe those are the rules that I currently have in place. Because it's internally mediated, I believe that it resists /most/ attempts at munchkinism - but one person isn't terribly good at probing a system for weakness. The specific benefits aren't /that/ important, and they tend to be pretty weak unless you make some major Oaths and keep them for decades. Here's what I have so far:

- Get yourself addicted to some kind of drug, then make an Oath to abstain from it. The more addictive the drug, the more powerful the Oath.
- If you can double-think hard enough, you can break your Oath without actually breaking your Oath - but I have to think that this is on the level of making yourself believe that 2+2=5. Harder because you're not allowed to slip.
- If someone already has some benefit from oathkeeping, you can use it as a lie detector of sort. Test their benefit (make them sprint some distance, for example), force them to make an Oath not to lie to you, ask them whatever questions you'd like, then test their benefit again to make sure that they kept that Oath. This works because breaking one Oath breaks all others as well.

Anything else you'd try doing with this? Any obvious flaws? Any ways in which it possibly exceeds the intent of "betray one part of your utility function in order to gain some benefit and in theory fulfill other parts of your utility function"? Anything that needs clarification?

Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented for helping me work some of this stuff out. It's quite helpful.


** Not sure whether this is munchkinism or working as intended. But this setup creates a very strong incentive for people to trade portions of their utility function.

Example: Alice takes an oath not to personally work to benefit Cause A (which she supports). Bob takes an oath not to personally work to benefit cause B (which he supports). Alice and Bob then agree (but don't take oaths) to work to benefit causes B and A, respectively. Now both A and B are benefited, and Alice and Bob both benefit personally because of the oaths themselves. Assuming Alice values A roughly as much as Bob values B, this is stable against betrayal: if Bob stops working to support A, Alice stops working to support B.

This example generalizes in many ways. A few examples:

- People agree to take care of each other's children (and swear not to take care of their own). Scale this up to an entire village/town/etc. providing childcare in this way.

- There's an incentive to solve large problems via specialization. E.g. if a town has two doctors, it makes sense for one to commit to taking care of men and one to commit to taking care of women (i.e. one swears not to take care of women, the other not to take care of men, respectively) as long as the benefits of the oaths outweigh the lost efficiency from forgone coordination. This scales even better when things are non-binary (I only take care of people ages 20-30, i.e. I swear not to take care of people from 0-10 and 10-20 and 30-40 and ...) or when multiple binary divisions apply (I take care of male children, i.e. I swear not to take care of women or adults). (EDIT: It's possible that your edit 17 applies here, but it definitely doesn't work as per your example. Bread is a subset of grains, but these categories overlap without being contained in each other.)

This would work.

I'm less certain that having doctors specialize by gender (or age) would, since it depends on what they want. If they just "want to help people" it wouldn't work, since they're satisfying that desire. However, if you had a doctor that wanted to work on women and a doctor that wanted to work on men, they could swap and get some power from it.

***** It depends on whether there's an actual cost involved. If two people with equal skill and equal values are both serving half of the community, there wouldn't be any real cost to them, and thus no incentives or desire to break the oath. If there was a single doctor who wanted to help people and took an oath to only help men, then I would expect for him to get some power from that oath as he watched the women in his village die during childbirth or succumb to infections he could have prevented.

*** I believe this is exactly the situation rule #12 is designed to prevent. By trading those portions of your utility function, you are removing the incentive to break the oath, and will not gain any benefit from it.

That being said, I think the children thing could work, if it's an oath of non interaction. It would be very easy to break, being in the same community, and it would be an Oath that most parents would find hard to keep (or at least, parents with utility structures similar to ours. This doesn't work after a few generations, when you know the benefits far outweigh the costs)

Pretty much, the way I see this working as being fueled by your own misery. If you're even slightly content with what's going on, your Oathing wrong.

**** But the point here is that you're /not/ removing the incentive to break the oath. All things being equal, Alice /would/ prefer to break the oath and work to benefit cause A. She still supports it, i.e. it still contributes to her utility function. But she chooses not to break it because she knows doing so would ultimately have negative (or at least neutral) consequences. That's no different that the usual situation of "choosing not to break my oath despite wanting to do so" which is what everyone with an even moderately powerful oath experiences regularly.

** Social-fu and deception is now incredibly powerful. If you can make your enemies believe that they have broken an Oath, you have removed a good deal of their power.

Is there any point to making Oaths like "I will spend 1 year and 1 day, starting now, in contemplation on top of this mountain." or would the short duration preclude any benefits?

If forgetting about an Oath an effective way of never thinking that you have broken it?

As your desire/ability to break an Oath goes down, does the benefit decrease, or just stop growing?

For meta-gaming Oaths, a kingdom could get very powerful, quite quickly with this. First, restrict Oath making to serious, low risk, high reward situations to prevent people from losing power. Next, have every citizen swear an Oath to follow the laws of the land (or the Natural laws of humanity, or whatever), and have the military swear an Oath to follow the lawful orders of their commanders. Ideally, this would solve lawlessness, desertion, and insubordination.

Generally speaking, there wouldn't be a point - but it's possible that you could bind a tight enough Oath that it might actually have an effect in so short a time. Say, closing yourself into a small box, subsisting on only token food, minimal water, blinding yourself, etc., with the ability to stop and give in with only the smallest motion. (The year rule is just a lower bound - there's no watershed.)

You only get a benefit if you actively want to break the Oath, which means that lawful people wouldn't gain any benefit, which also means that there'd be no way to test between those who have broken the Oath and those who had no desire to do so. You would have to engineer another Oath that gives people some benefit, which means forcing them to do (or not do) something that they don't want to, which seems like a good way to start a revolution.

Could you make an oath to not punch annoying people in the face, not follow through on your intrusive thoughts, not chew your fingernails, and/or other things like that? If those Oaths would work well, it would be a relatively painless source of power.

Or is it net desire, and the Oath has to be the actual deciding factor in your choice, which may make drug addiction a questionably effective tactic.

For a police state. Measure strength. Make subject take an oath not to lie to you. Have them tell you they are and have been loyal to the glorious leader over the past X number of years. Measure strength again. Execute the disloyal subjects.

That seems like a mistake.

For example, of the oath is no longer breakable, the power lasts forever?

So a child might go with 'Will not have sex before I am 20' oath; might be hard to keep for a while, but once they are 20, if they have not yet broken it, it becomes impossible to break, supposing they cannot get any younger.

** Everyone should swear an oath to live. I don't see any downside, and on the upside, anything that doesn't kill you literally makes you stronger. This oath would be especially potent for those who develop suicidal tendencies, leading to a somewhat unusual superhero demographic.

If there is a reliable way to memory charm (hypnosis?), rule 18 allows oaths to be "taken back" while still retaining benefits, making the decision to swear an oath still high-tension, but ultimately reversible.

Speaking of taking back oaths, most (if not all) oaths should have temporary escape clauses: "I swear to do X except during the time periods after I think 'disable oath X' ten times in a row and before I think 're-enable oath X' ten times in a row". Even if you plan on never breaking the oaths, there might be a case where you just have to make an exception, additional power be damned.

We might be able to munchkin using humans' irrational utility functions:

1. Our animal brains disproportionately stress out about low probability events. One might swear an oath that causes such stress knowing rationally that such occasions are unlikely. For example, oaths to:

   - Not look under the bed for inhuman monsters
   - Not resist attackers under certain conditions (the downside being that anyone who discovered those conditions would be able to attack you)
   - Never look up when crossing a street
   - "I swear that I will never accept Pascal's wager/mugging."
   - "I swear I will refrain from eating bacon for a decade if this billion side dice lands on 22".

   Of course, the stress is real, so this isn't a costless endeavor.

2. "I swear I will make the rational choices in any [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/mz/zut_allais/][Allais Paradox bets]] (which seems to bother people so much that, even understanding the paradox, they still want to defend the irrational choice) of which I am aware." Proceed to have friends engage with such bets, and be bothered by it every time.

3. Take advantage of [[http://www.moneycactus.com/hyperbolic-discounting/][hyperbolic discounting]]: "I swear I will exercise tomorrow as long as the morning coffee is worth it." The effort of exercising seems worth the coffee now, so as far as you're currently concerned, this commits you to exercising tomorrow. In reality, once tomorrow comes, the effort of exercising will no longer be worth it.

Additional munchkin ideas:

1. Open-ended oaths: "I swear I will do X eventually."

2. Oaths open to interpretation:

   - "I swear I will be open-minded"
   - "I swear I will do anything within reason concerning X"

   counting on our abilities to rationalize our choices.

*** You can certainly make "no downside" oaths, and many people do, but the benefits are usually negligible enough that there's not much of a point. And yes, someone with suicidal tendencies would be able to leverage that for some benefit.

There is a form of mental magic, but it's very difficult and very imperfect. But if you could find a sufficiently skilled mentalist, and wanted to consent to having her poke around in your mindscape, she might be able to remove the memory of the oath and make your existing benefits permanent.

You can definitely hack oathkeeping by exploiting irrationality. The Oaths work better if they're big and powerful, but you could make little Oaths about trivial-but-still-stressful things and gain /some/ power. The key here is that you would want to stay irrational so that there's still that desire there.

**** I think your edit 16 was meant to fix this, but it creates at least as many problems as it solves. The basic issue is that I can benefit from oaths that were once very constraining but now are not constraining at all.

Example: while in city A, I swear never to [insert hard thing here, e.g. never buying food in city A]. I suffer for whatever period of time is required to get the oath to full strength. Then I go to city B and repeat the same process. (Note that these are not duplicate oaths, so 17 has no bearing). Then City C, etc.

Possible fixes: -Modify or elaborate on 14 to say that benefits don't stack linearly. -Change 16 back to how it was. (This seems more attractive to me, but that's because I don't know /why/ it's important for you that the benefits of oaths are never lost).

So in your example of going from one city to another and swearing your oaths, you don't actually gain any more benefit than if you just stayed in one city and kept the same Oath, or made an Oath that applied to all cities instead of just one.

These tend to be fairly weak, though it depends on how much you don't want to do the thing you've made an Oath to do, and how much time you spend meditating on it. Generally speaking, it wouldn't be worth the effort unless you were psyching yourself up about doing something relatively painless. For example, if you had a fear of water and made an Oath to swim the Juniper Sea a year from now, you might get a little out of it, with the only real cost being psychological. An Oath that is fulfilled can't be broken, which is one of the major benefits of doing it that way.

This would give you /some/ benefit prior to cutting off the first finger, but it would be so minor as to be nearly undetectable, even if you spent a half hour every day meditating on how much you loved your finger and how much it was going to hurt to have it cut off.

So in theory, you could make an open-ended "I will do /x/ eventually" Oath where /x/ is some extremely negative thing, and obtain some small power from it until the point where you decide not to do that thing.

Either society would have to make "forcing an Oath" as illegal and strongly prosecuted as kidnapping someone's children, or else very few people will ever take Oaths. Only A) those who can hide it, or B) those who are already very powerful and thus not in significant danger of being forced to make Oaths they don't want to make.

I am mostly thinking that social conventions are in place to prevent Oaths from being forced - there exist major institutions which are dedicated to oathkeeping, and which have a considerable amount of power (and work to prevent external abuses against oathkeepers). But yes, it is something of a liability if you are public about it and there are people in a position of extreme power who can use force against you (though if you're in that position already, you've got other problems).

And you could also just give up your accumulated power to break the "slave obedience" oath, so there'd be strong pressure on your "captor" to not push you too hard.

It does raise the mechanic question of when rule 8/9 actually triggers in such a circumstance. If I swear to never make oath x, and then make oath x, will the breaking of the first oath unmake the second, or does the breaking "game tick" take place before the binding "game tick"?

You just kidnap their children and force them to make and break an oath to let them live. Repeat with literally anything else they have.

Something like that. The thing is, assuming you survive, it is very easy to get a new gun. Getting a new oath to the same strength level might be literally impossible in the time you have left - break an oath that has been gathering for thirty years, you are over 50.

If you relied on oath power to get into a position of high political or other social power you are actually /inherently weaker/ than a person who got into a similar or even lower position without using oaths directly.

For a better example, think of a politician who got into a position of power by performing one evil act which they must hide, because if it got out it would destroy them. While it is not evil persay, power through an oath is similar except /everyone knows you have a secret and in most cases even knows what it is and how to use it to harm you/.

You have contingent power and the fact that you have it, and that most oaths are public knowledge means that you aren't just leaving the source of your power around where anyone can find it, you are Achilles living in an empire of heel-seeking arrows.

Anyone who steps too far out of line, who uses oath power to gain temporal power merely because they are stronger/faster/ more enduring than others would be taken down by someone who is smarter, or more cunning, or more ruthless or any combination of all three.

And the way oaths /work/ ensures this is much easier than recovering from it is, meaning it will happen pretty much universally to anyone with actually intelligent enemies.

Kings would be people with powerful oath-using knights, who do not rely on oaths themselves. The strongest oath users would likely be 70+ year old monks, who neither have nor look for temporal power, and thus haven't attracted intelligent enemies.

If it takes a year with heavy, restrictive Oaths to show any power at all (let's say, a five-percent increase in strength and speed), and five years until an outside observer would be able to measure it (in other words, to get to the point where an outside observer could be sure that the person isn't just strong, but supernaturally strong), then I think it would be much more rare as a political or commercial tool. A hypothetical trader that's spent five years under heavy restrictions might be able to sell his wares for a bit cheaper because of the lower risk associated with doing business with him, but he would in theory have to charge more to make up for the fact that he's incurred a real cost by denying himself something for so long.

It's also sort of funny that you'd argue that kings would have to have long-standing oaths, since other people in this thread are arguing that kings would have to /not/ take any oaths, because this would be equivalent to exposing their Achilles heel and giving someone a way to strike easily strike at them. Or the other people, arguing that the possibility of blackmail, drugging, or even intense debate would be enough that oathkeeping is nigh worthless.

Mostly I think you could make the argument either way. I can picture a society with two classes of people - the trusted oathkeepers and the oathless, with the oathkeepers having almost all the power and carefully wording the multiple oaths that they make every day. But I can also imagine a society where only a few people take oaths as a quasi-religious ordeal, and don't really operate on another level. Or another, where the oathkeepers are the underclass by virtue of the fact that they can be bossed around and can be kept on a chain by their oaths so long as no one pushes them too far. And all those societies could even exist under the same rules, maybe even next to each other.

Train toddlers to be strong willed. Get them to make oaths e.g. "I will not eat sugary foods." "I will not buy goods" Have watchers for them, perhaps with oaths, to physically stop them while dangling sugar or goods in front of them.

Or get the toddlers extremely drunk, make them make numerous potent oaths e.g. 'I will not walk or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not eat or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not drink anything except alcohol or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not lust after men or women or say zaasasauuooooosasa'.

***** Yes, it does /somewhat/ weaken the Oath, though only to the extent that it weakens the desire to break the Oath. I more think that a public Oath would only make you more conflicted. So that if you made an Oath to not have sex, and you really wanted to have sex, knowing that you'd face public condemnation on top of losing your powers wouldn't necessarily kill your desire for sex (and in fact, might increase it because of the forbidden fruit aspect).

So yes, you can swear an Oath on those things that you can do and want to do but aren't willing to face the risks of - but for you to get much power from it, it really needs to be something that you /really/ want to do. So the average person doesn't get much from "I will not voluntarily kill", though someone with a strong bloodlust might (though again, it depends on whether that desire is soured by the consequences, or whether that's just a rational choice - the latter gaining you more power).

****** Well, you could do a bunch of oaths for all the things you find morally wrong. They wouldn't give /much/ power, but haven't we all thought about committing one wrong or another from time to time? For instance a no stealing oath would probably strengthen me whenever I go shopping because even though I've never stolen I always think about how easy it would be and look out for security cameras

Something else. If you manage to forget an oath and still stop yourself from doing it then the power would again be slightly stronger, no? Because before forgetting you don't /want/ to break the oath just for it being an oath. Risky though, because after forgetting nothing is really stopping you from just going through with that immoral thing just this once.

***** That led me to do some reading. The study is about /identity/ - that is, people tell other people about what they're going to do because they want to be the kind of person that would do that thing. Telling people satisfies that need for identity, at least partially, and that in turn makes them less likely to actually do the thing.

But I don't really think that's the full story. I mean, if we looked at recidivism rates for people with and without community support, I would suspect that we'd find those rates to be higher without support. If the public pledges were structured more like "I have made this pledge, help me to keep it" I wonder whether you would see the same problem.

But in any case, it may be that they /believe/ people will keep their pledges better if they declare them out loud, even if they are (counter-intuitively) wrong.

** Is there a minimum age for oaths?

In such a society there are many factions (sports,military,etc) which would have huge incentives to take children as young as possible and put them in "monasteries" where they make all kinds of oaths, which makes them super-specialized and effective. In addition brain-washing is probably applied so they stay in their (forced) careers. Ever increasing oath-boosting, like the drug addiction you mentioned, is most certainly applied until the point where too many kids die.

Even for kids not in a monastery, there is immense pressure. As a non-oath boy you cannot really compete (for jobs,girls,grades,etc) against other kids with benefits. Even loving parents should encourage their children to make some oaths very early.

** What if the desire changes? E.g. I have a crush on Alice, but I make the oath not to talk to her, which is very hard right now. A month later I am deeply in love with Beccy and do not care about Alice anymore.

Vice versa, what if desire grows over time?

I guess, benefit strength ~= desire * time since oath.

That might enable another boost, if I can increase my desire. For example, taking hormones or drugs? Might be exploited temporarily for a short-term boost.

*edit*: Wait, by (16) I cannot lose benefit strength if desire fades. After a quick desire spike and getting large benefits, it will probably stagnate for a long time. Finding the right drug means we could mostly ignore the time constraint.

1. Make an oath.
2. Take desire drug, which boosts benefits to 90% of what you will ever get.
3. Drug effect fades, but benefits stay.

The tricky part is to maintain the oath, while under drug influence. Under lab conditions this should be possible. Making the drug fade faster is a worthy research goal.

However, the internal mediation might be resistant to any drugs? We cannot be sure, though. At least, some crackpot researchers will claim to find such drugs. There could be a whole industry about (useless) benefit boosting, just like our fitness and weight-loss industries.

the ability to immediately retroactively justify their actions as in accordance with rules even when it doesn't match reality

extremely strong impulsive behavior paired with an equally strong ability to resist. (as long it is balanced by an equally strong will you can get more power the more intense your drives are. Basically-Vulcans from star trek. Insane when you remove the rational programming overlaid on top.)

Considering the number of oaths people see you will see people getting drunk, etc, very very little because it's just not worth the risk.

When the Oath is less desirable to break its power goes down, this makes it more desirable to break which makes its power go up, which is fine if the Oath doesn't change in power, but every day the Oath goes up (rule 11) in power it's a) you're going to lose what you mention (you won't desire a steak as much in year 20, but that's not as relevant) and b) there is more reason not to break it because you get more out of the Oath in Year 20 and Year 1, but as written the more you get out of the Oath the less it gives you the more it gives you the less it gives you ad nasauem.

That's in need of clarification, but I'm not a hundred percent sure what the best way to phrase it is. The intent is that of you take an Oath, and I then make the credible threat of "I will murder you if you break your Oath", your Oath doesn't get weaker by virtue of that extra incentive.

So I need a wording for that rule that means that the accumulation of benefits is dependent on how much you want to break the Oath, regardless of how much you /don't/ want to break the Oath - it's not one desire subtracted from the other, it's just that singular desire. So being conflicted about something gives you power, while being dead neutral doesn't, if that makes sense.

** The extreme use cases are not the interesting ones, the thing you have to consider is how /everyone/ would attempt to use it, and the social implications over time.

Everyone has aspirations, plans and long term goals, great and small, many of which are such that you do not anticipate deviating from them ever being a good idea. So making oaths about such things is a freebie. These are temptations you are going to be fighting anyway? Make it an oath.

So standard oaths would be things like fidelity, faithfully executing an office, studying diligently..

Not extreme or complicated wows, but formal and public commitments to the basic norms of a community. Which will have social effects - I guarantee that almost everyone will be extremely reluctant to make any wow which hasn't stood up to the test of "most people manage to keep this one", because an unblemished record in this regard is going to be the definition of being a respectable citizen.

There would quickly arise standard formulations for the most common ones, which would be carefully worded to avoid both the possibility of sabotage causing you to violate them, and to render void the possibility of playing games with them (to boost the power gain)

Thus, a standard oath of honesty would not be to speak the truth - that's just begging some smartass to fuck with it, but simply

"I will not speak with the intent to deceive or mislead".

That preserves your ability to tell stories - that are clearly stories - keeps the option of keeping your gob shut under duress, but forces honesty, so it is a significant wow.

And in a relatively short time you end up with all positions of authority being filled with people who have kept wows like that one and other obvious markers of good citizenship for a span long enough to have easily verifiable effects.

*** Hmm. If this Oath is unbreakable, you'd get no benefit per rule 13 above. But if its nature caused it to automatically break, you'd break your other Oaths per rule 8. Making this Oath both breaks *and* maintains your other Oaths.

More importantly, however, I assume that promises describing individual actions like 'I will break this oath' or 'I will pay my debts' or 'I will kill my boss if it's the last thing I do' simply don't take hold as Oaths. You probably can't make retroactive Oaths ('It wasn't me, I swear!') or vicarious ones ('He'll be good, I promise.') either.

** So basically if as a child you take the oath to not have sex until you're 18 or something you'd become really powerful, especially towards puberty right? And if you didn't break oaths the power would be kept even after X years had passed. I suppose that'd be a frequent oath.

Also...how about a bisexual, so equally attracted to both sexes, although that can fluctuate, making an oath not to have sex with one of the sexes? I suppose you're going to say it'll be weaker than a heterosexual and/or homosexual taking the same oath for their prefered gender. But how about a bisexual taking a full chasity oath? It'll be stronger than that of a heterosexual or homosexual right?

How about we combine the two previous suggestions? A bisexual taking a full chasity oath for X amount of years? How strong would that be? Compared to the same by people attracted by one gender?

I'll suppose this is a very frequent type of oath.

*** The strength of the oath depends on the desire, so being bisexual wouldn't have much effect on total power gained from a chastity oath unless being bisexual was associated with an increase in total sexual desire (and I have no idea whether that's the case - intuitively, I would think not).

But yes, it's fairly common to take oaths like that. But just because you don't have any power to show for it doesn't mean that you broke your oath, since it might /also/ mean that you just never had that desire in the first place (if, for example, you're asexual).

** Reminds me of aspects of how Nen works in HunterxHunter; making restrictions and recieving proportionate power boosts. There are clear differences though.

- oaths are (must be?) publicly made, restrictions can be secret

(for an oath to work, how public must it be? being able to keep your oaths as secret as possible is very important, if you make your oath in a public space while no-one is watching, does that still count? you could conceivably make this aspect very strong, so that every oath made is logged on a public database and everyone knows what everyone else's oaths are, or you could make this much less important, and only some people have their oaths publicy known)

- nen powers are chosen by the individuals making the restriction, oath enefits are not related to the oath

- anyone can make an oath, nen powers are strongly moderated by talent and hard work

- breaking restrictions is about the actual breaking of the restriction, rather than belief in whether oaths are broken

- penalties for breaking oaths is uniform, penalty for breaking a restriction is chosen by the restriction maker and is tied into the proportionate power boost (the stronger the penalty, the stronger the power boost)

Still, the nen system was lots of fun, and this is similar enough that I'm looking forward to reading it.

** Idea 1 - Meta Oaths: Step 1. Make an Oath to not tell your friend about your favorite color. Step 2. Check if Oath_counter is set to an arbitrarily large number. If it is, jump to Step 6. Step 3. Make an Oath to not tell your friend about previous oath. Step 4. Add 1 to Oath_counter. Step 5. Go back to Step 2. Step 6. Receive huge benefits.

I guess you could say that the oaths are about the same thing, but I bet a lot of people would disagree. In either case the point is to be able to make new Oaths that depend on pretty much the same want mass. There are probably more elegant ways to do this though.

Idea 2 - Willpower Benefits. Step 1. Make an Oath with want mass proportional to what you can handle, in order to increase your resilience to giving in to your wants. Step 2. Wait for the benefit to grow over time. Step 3. Go back to Step 2.

Additionally you could throw in the occasional Oath to increase your want to break your oaths instead of making new ones. Could be combined with Idea 1.

In general, the most important stat looks to be Willpower.

*** The big problem with Idea 1 is that rule 12 means that you have to actually want to break the Oath for it to have any effect. So if you have no desire to tell your friend about your favorite color, or about the oath to not tell him, or about the oath about the oath, it just doesn't do anything. The idea of a meta-Oath is a sound one though - I can imagine making an /Oath of Chastity/ and an /Oath of Silence About the Oath of Chastity/, and experiencing a genuine desire to break the second oath which is different from the genuine desire to break the first oath. Though I think you can avoid having to go meta by properly wording the second oath (or even just combining the two oaths into one).

Imagine a woman who's taken an Oath of Chastity, and can't actually tell people about it, and that causes all sorts of problems because she can't explain to her suitor why she's rebuffing his advances.

Idea 2 is currently canonical to the setting for the story (which I'm writing now) - you take as many Oaths as you can handle, and generally add more as time goes on, always staying at the limits of what your will can handle. I'm happy that this is an emergent property of the system that's not explicitly written into the rules.

**** I don't know about other people, but I'd be tempted to break any oath due to pure masoshism. Thus any oath I'd make would have some want mass, and if you would just stack enough of them you could probably get some pretty hefty benefits.

But can you choose the benefit of your Oath? The precondition of Idea 2 is that the benefit would be additional willpower. Since the benefit increases over time, while want mass doesn't, you would gain a net increase to your ability to keep your Oaths. Patience rewards you with exponentially increasing avalible want mass, in this scenario.
