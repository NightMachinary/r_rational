** Not sure I'd call this rational, but it's a fun rational-adjacent deconstruction/parody of the Order of the Stick (which is, itself, a parody).

Regarding teleportation and communication magic, I don't think they're very reliably available. Shoujo seems to have only one wizard who can cast teleport, since the Order had to wait for him to be resurrected after he was eaten by a roc. Not sure how many casters know sending, but there's almost certainly more demand than supply, so people who ride around carrying messages (like Miko did) are still necessary.

But getting the Order to Azure City would have been a top priority, so limited supply isn't a good reason not to use magic there. And your comic has a solution that sidesteps the Order entirely.

I consider that to be another example of "nonsensical wasting of Miko's time", to be honest. Any message urgent enough to warrant the attentions of a 16th-level paladin is urgent enough to just use Sending/Teleport for.

The number of people who can cast Sending and Teleport are doubtless limited, but who exactly is going to pull rank on or outbid Shojo in terms of getting first pick on the service? Even if the teleporting wizard he lent to Roy was unavailable for some reason, Sangwaan is also sufficiently high-level to learn the spell and he has clerics who can cast Wind Walk (a 6th-level spell, same as the Planar Ally they would have had to cast to summon angels.) That's without reaching out to, e.g, elven allies or wizardly acquaintances of Eugene or Julia. Or making a trip to [[https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0989.html][magic walmart]]. This is a universe where it's basically implausible that the Guard could /not/ have worked out some rapid long-distance transport options.

**** Oh, I agree that they didn't need to send Miko in particular to deliver messages. It's inefficient, and they only did it to keep her far away for as long as possible. I'm just pointing out that messengers aren't out of a job in this universe.

***** Yeah, but the problem is Miko herself is going to be aware of the existence of Sending and Teleport spells unless she spent the last 28 years of her life under a rock. People who aren't electrical engineers are still aware of the existence of airplanes and telegram services, and will reasonably ask why they can't make use of such devices.

****** Miko doesn't seem to be particularly difficult to manipulate. I bet they could make up reasons that sound good enough to convince her. Off the top of my head...

1. We can't use Sending because we need too many words - it would take all our castings combined to relay this 1000-word message, and our clerics have other Sendings to make.
2. We can't use Teleport or Wind Walk because the wizard and Sangwaan are off on another, equally important mission.
3. The journey is perilous and the recipient of this missive is a vital ally. That is why we entrust you, the strongest of us, with seeing it safely to its destination.

These don't need to be the real reasons, they just need to sound convincing enough to Miko (who was tricked by Belkar of all people). Heck, given how much power Shoujo has, he might be able to say "Mr. Scruffy said so" and Miko would do it.

This makes no sense if the journey takes days or weeks, as would be necessary to keep Miko busy. It's easier to just wait until the next day for the clerics/wizards to refresh their spells. (If the message is long, you just use Teleport instead.) A journey being perilous is also /more/ of a reason to use Sending/Teleport- i.e., circumvent the journey entirely. (Unless Miko particularly enjoys random encounters I suppose.)

The other problem with coming up with these various cover-stories is that it basically requires all the other paladins/clerics to be more-or-less continuously lying through their teeth to a superior officer, which is not a very paladin-ish thing to do. I mean... it's entertaining to imagine the mental effort of Sangwaan et al extemporising various excuses for comedic effect, but it's not something that could realistically be sustained very long, and... we're presupposing this is rationalist fiction. It's better to just concede that any job important enough to involve Miko will probably involve her getting Teleported to her destination.

******** With foreknowledge that Sendings occur, equipping main operatives with a codebook and map might be prudent.

Sending:\\
"code: seven b. location: seventeen A, Crooked mountain stronghold. primary target: lich. level twenty-two. secondary target: red cloak goblin priest level fourteen. - verification: ghibli"

code-book:

seven - recon, unnoticed. when target verified, destroy all targets and any hostiles on the way to targets.

sub-code b - destruction of greatest magical artifact present primary goal if targets likely to survive encounter.

map:

grid seventeen-A: Redmountain Hills, partially. contains Crooked mountain.

verification:

ghibli: trusted sender for Miko. orders verified.

** A lot of this won't make particular sense to people who haven't read The Order of the Stick extensively (including prequel/bonus materials), but basically-

OOTSverse is, as you can probably gather, essentially a D&D parody universe where spells that allow instant transport and communication over long distances are, if not exactly commonplace, at least known generally to exist and pretty reliably available to high-level characters and central governments. One of the major early plot-points is a chapter where the titular protagonists wind up being dragged in chains to azure city so that Lord Shojo, the head of a major paladin organisation, can hire them to go on a secret McGuffin quest. Given the range of options at his disposal, Shojo's methods are inefficient to the point of verging on sabotage.

(This is not to say there aren't any number of irrational decisions on the part of the cast earlier on, but half the protagonists are legitimately characterised as not-very-bright, so it's mostly easier to overlook. Mostly.)

** reasons why this is not a good plan, from the gods point of view: this way, you do not stop the snarl with help from the purple diety that redcloak represents, you just keep it in its cage for a while longer.

the meta of OOTS is really deep, you have a posthuman community of 'gods' who have been running millions of simulations in a row to get to this point. their mind-states are directly altered by the souls worshipping them. and the problem is all down to their buddies that got killed by the snarl way back when.

all the mortals? they dont matter. the gods will just make a new world. what does matter, is dealing with the snarl that is trying to kill them, that is imprisoned inside the world. and the snarl may have its own world inside that mess.

The mortals in question, who are making all of the decisions shown in this comic, disagree with that position.

Although I do agree, there are absolutely gods who don't want this outcome. There are probably gods that do, because the OOTS gods are super divided on basically every topic. But still, getting the Dark One on board with stopping the snarl is their only win condition.

Actually, do you think that the Northern and Western gods are super mad at the southern gods? They insist on antagonizing the only hope for a lasting existence that anyone has seen in a very, very long time. I mean, yes, the Dark One is Evil, but substantially less so than some of the gods that the various pantheons put up with willingly.

**** I think it's more the Dark One's habit of trying to actively murder the other Gods and/or threaten them with death if they don't kowtow to his demands that might have pissed off the Twelve. (It's been suggested that Rat might be playing a different angle here, however, and there is the rather large question of why they don't strip their powers from Tsukiko, given all the crap she gets up to.)

I've toyed with the idea that Dorukan might have been researching alternative options for handling the Snarl, given that his Talisman apparently had dominion over all 2nd-edition creatures. (What 'edition' would the Snarl be, I wonder?)

*** I think immortal_lurker covered this already, but while the whole mess involving the quiddities is still a problem, it's also not something that the primary agonists are /aware/ is a problem. So it doesn't really refactor into how the story would end unless you wanna project ahead a couple of centuries.

***** Background plot point: the 'big celestial messenger' is actually Eugene Greenhilt, the main protagonist's deceased father, in disguise. (He's a seasoned illusionist and managed to [[https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0292.html][hijack]] the summoning process.)

An /actual/ celestial messenger acting on behalf of the Twelve Gods might not want the Guard to go chasing after the Crimson Mantle, but... in that case he could just as easily explain the whole business with the quiddities and tell the paladins to take Redcloak alive instead.
