I've been having some shoulder pain for the past couple of weeks, which I've seen a doctor for. I've also noticed that I haven't actually written anything new for S.I. for almost that long, and have just been posting chapters from my buffer to the forum I post them in.

Given my previous attempt at writing long fiction ("Myou've Gotta Be Kidding Me"), I anticipate two likely courses. One, pain sucks, and when it goes away, my writing motivation will return, and I'll get back into the swing of things. Or two, my writing engine has run out of motivation-fuel for this story generally. In the latter case, I think I can avoid leaving the story entirely unfinished, though there would still be all sorts of dangling plot threads and unsolved mysteries; I should be able to muster up enough typing to have my protagonist finally feel overwhelmed by everything she's facing, retreat to Elliot Lake, and jump to my intended finale. It's far from a perfect solution, but seems better than putting the story on permanent hiatus (or more formally cancelling it) without any finish at all, as I ended up doing with "Myou've".

I'm hoping it's the first course. What I don't know... is if there's any way I can tweak the odds to /favour/ the first course.

Any ideas?


** Continuing on with a project that you've lost your motivation for is a learned skill. I feel like most people /don't/ learn it, because it's really easy to get by without it, and you hear a lot of authors and artists talking about "inspiration" as though that was all there were to creation. The question shouldn't be, "How do I get my inspiration/motivation back?", it should be "How do I keep writing, and at the same level of quality, when I don't feel like it?"

Partly it's a matter of practice. The more you work on things that you don't feel like working on, the better you'll be at it. If you want tips on practice, what works for me is blocking out time to do the thing that I don't want to do, and being held accountable in some way. If that's not working, I think it's helpful to step back from a project for a while (though that's dangerous, because that's the kind of motivated thinking you'd do when you just never wanted to see the project again). It's also helpful to get someone to read through what you've written so that you can get some fresh eyes on it, and maybe rediscover what you liked in the first place.

But mostly, I think it's a matter of sitting down and doing the work, regardless of the fact that it's not so fun anymore - so long as you can ensure that it will be fun for the reader.

*** Definitely agreed. As an author I respect once told me, "inspiration is, like, 2% of the final product".

As for me personally, after assessing my life ambitions and the like, I decided it's not actually worth it for me. I accept the doom of never publishing any long work because really I write for fun, not for profit.

OP, you've written a very long work and as such probably know way more about the subject than most people here. My biggest advice, though, is don't let a medical problem cause you to cut out a source of joy and satisfaction in your life, /without/ filling it with something else. If you make a conscious decision that "yeah I'm probably done with writing in general for now", try to have a plan where to go next. (That /is/ speaking from experience, now.) Good luck! And bravo for writing such a large volume already - that's something most never accomplish.

*** But would it still be fun for the writer in that case? I mean don't get me wrong as a reader its definitely in my interest for writers to write. But what you said sounds like it would mostly make sense for someone who is gaining something other then fun out of their writing, so i suppose its relevant if you are trying to convince people, or maybe make money out of the story, or possibly not make money at the moment but aim to in the future thus using the current story as practice for then.

Unless i misunderstood and you are saying that after a while the motivation\inspiration will come back to the writer so it could be worth it regardless of other benefits..

**** Writers can get into this trap where they start something, let it run for some certain amount, and then put it on the shelf for some shiny new idea. And in this way, nothing ever gets completed. This is /very/ common.

And yes, I do think that this is bad for the writer, even if there's no financial incentive for them, and even if they're not showing their work to anyone at all. It's a stunted form of expression. What happens if you keep starting up new projects and not finishing them is that you get really good at starting projects and never improve at actually finishing them. And then, looking back, you'll see a bunch of failed projects behind you that were entirely transient and ultimately hollow.

There's probably someone out there who loves beginning things and hates finishing them, and who thinks that it's perfectly fine and natural to have never finished the act of creation. But to me, this is a fundamentally /untrue/ way of creating art. Which is not to say that you can't make a work of fiction intended to run in perpetuity, or one that leaves threads open for sequels, or one that leaves threads open because that's the whole point of it, or one that ends right in the middle because /that's/ the point of it, or other ways of being unconventional. But that's not the same as stopping because you weren't having fun.

(And sometimes, you need to know when what you're writing isn't working, and you're falling victim to sunk costs. The problem is when you do this on a regular basis.)

***** Again, as a reader what you are saying definitely works, I would much prefer authors finish stories and not just start new ones all the time. And I would definitely prefer for authors to improve their writing by continuing to write even when they don't feel like it and get better.

And of course I don't think anyone could really argue that as an art starting lots of stories and not finishing them, not because you are doing it intentionally but instead because you lost the drive, is bad form.

But, I cannot imagine how that would be convincing if i were the writer and I didn't feel like writing. Again if I had other motivations other then the direct fun that is one thing, but I figure a lot of people that write fiction, fan or otherwise, do so because they enjoy writing and your description doesn't suggest there's too much of a happy ending for them.

You did add a point though about people who are going to look back and feel like they are less capable\successful, which is a good argument for anyone that feels its likely they will be disappointed in themselves looking back at it..

**** There is definitely happiness to be found in a job well done, and from creating something that others enjoy. It's not the same kind of instant gratification that you get from writing while inspired, but in the modern world of the internet, videogames, netflix, instant communication with friends, etc - I sometimes forget that there /are/ other kinds of fun. Heck, many of us here prefer the faster gratification of fanfiction over investing time and risk into a new novel.

***** True, though it really depends on how much happiness is there in the end, and how long is there till you get there..

** First, try modifying your work environment. When I hear "shoulder pain" and "typing" in close proximity, my first thought is "keyboard is too high." Read up on ergonomics, find what the correct height for your body would be, see if moving your keyboard to that height fixes the problem.

Second, try getting an ergonomic keyboard. It used to be that typing for a full day gave me horrible hand and wrist pain. I bought a Datadesk Technologist Smartboard II keyboard and boom...problem solved. Sadly, I think DT is now out of business, but there's probably other keyboards out there that will work as well.

As to how to keep writing, several options. Use them in whatever order seems best:

- Butt in Chair, Hands on Keyboard

Put your ass in your chair, put your hands on the keyboard and /do/ it. Life is full of things you don't want to do. Pick a time that you're going to block out for this and BiCHoK. You'll find some words.

- Pomodoros

Ugh-y things are less ughy when they have known limits. Trying doing a 25/5 pomodoro where you set a timer for 25 minutes and then break for 5.

- Wash a spoon

Every day, you have to write one sentence. Once you've done that, you can stop. Just one sentence, and then you're done. Usually when you write your sentence you'll find that more words come. At that point you've done your sentence and everything that comes after it is you being awesome; when you get to the point where you want to stop, stop. And then smile, fist-pump, and say out loud "Yes! I'm awesome for doing more than I had to!" (No, literally, do that -- it's a simple, low-cost, and effective form of reward.)

The only rule is that you have to write your sentence /every single day/. I don't care if you're sick, the dog ate your homework, or your mom just died. You can find 20 seconds to write your damn sentence.

- Aversion Factoring

Set a timer for 5 minutes. Write down what it is about this task that is ugh-y for you. Keep writing things down until the timer dings.

Look at the list. Is there any way to get rid of item one? Item two? Etc. Example: "This is ughy because I'm really excited abou $OTHER_PROJECT and this is keeping me from doing that." Okay, can you make this more like $OTHER_PROJECT? Is this /really/ the only thing keeping you from doing $OP or can you set aside time for both things? Maybe you can watch less TV in order to free up time for $OP so that you can keep doing this as well?

For the things you can't get rid of, is that a limitation that you actually respect and think is reasonable, or is it something that you can accustom yourself to? One of the CFAR instructors had an example: he wanted to climb trees, but (among other things) he didn't like getting his hands dirty. He decided that wasn't a limitation he respected / wanted to have, so he practiced putting his hands in mud and then just sitting there, looking at them and experiencing the emotion until it stopped bothering him.

I've had a similar experience recently, traveling in Southeast Asia. One hostel that I stayed in had bed bugs; at first this was a horrible disaster for me, a great calamity that I was afraid of and all aflutter about. The hostel did their best to get rid of them, but it took a while. I had already paid to stay there for a month and didn't want to lose my money, so going elsewhere wasn't an easy option. After a couple of days I realized it just wasn't that big a deal. It stopped bothering me and then they managed to get rid of the bed bugs.

- Goal factoring

Do this on a piece of paper (obviously, substitute your own reasons and goals):

Goal: write this story Why do I want this?: because finishing things is good. Call this "completion satisfaction"

Goal: completion satisfaction Why do I want this?: There are reputational benefits to being known as a person who finishes things.

...etc

For each item on the list, see if there is an easier way to get it. For example, instead of finishing the story, would it satisfy your various goals to simply post an announcement "I am moving on from this project, here is the plot outline that I was writing to so that all you readers can have closure. Meanwhile, here is my other project that I'm excited about!"

Good luck. I hope it all works for you.

*** +1 for writing 1 sentence every day. This is how I wrote my first novel. Actually, my rule was that I had to just write /something/ each day, and there were days on which that was a /word./ There were of course other days when it would be 10 pages. The point is to keep some amount of forward motion happening, no matter how small. It's surprising how effective this is, in my experience.
