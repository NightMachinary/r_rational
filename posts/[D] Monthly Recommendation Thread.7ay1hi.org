Welcome to the monthly thread for recommendations, which is posted on the fifth day of every month.

Feel free to recommend any books, movies, live-action TV shows, anime series, video games, fanfiction stories, blog posts, podcasts, or anything else that you think members of this subreddit would enjoy, whether those works are rational or not. Also, please consider including a few lines with the reasons for your recommendation.

Alternatively, you may /request/ recommendations, in the style of [[http://np.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6rjai2][the weekly recommendation-request thread of r/books]].

** I'm going to do something different from the usual story recommendations. I will be posting the authors I follow on reddit.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/][Luna Lovewell]] - She is an author who started out by posting to [[/r/writingprompts]] and has never failed to write a short story that I enjoyed reading and feels self-contained when I normally dislike short stories. My favorite story by her is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/6h9hxn/the_batman_delusion/][The Batman Delusion]] which is a crossover between Batman and Inception.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/][Leoduhvinci]] - He mainly writes adventure stories and just like Luna, got his start by posting to [[/r/writingprompts]]. While I can't say the characters are rational, they are well-developed and what I find rational are his settings. He is amazing at writing how the fantastical would realistically influence the world. In fact, he has two books available for free and one book heavily discounted on Amazon [[https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/7ay4fv/free_and_discount_day/][today]] only.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/][The Snake Report]] - Okay, okay, this isn't an author, but it's the only story written by wercwercwerc that I'm paying attention to. It's an amusing story of how a man has reincarnated as a magical snake in an RPG-like world and while it starts out as a comedy about horrifying situations, in the most recent chapters it has evolved into a mystery about how the current world's magic and where it came from.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/search?q=author%3Ademons_dance_alone&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all][Demons Dance Alone]] - A great horror story writer. I don't think he posts to [[/r/nosleep]] anymore, but I've been going through all of the stories he used to post. His stories often include family horror (how do you deal with a monster when you are related to the monster?) and some supernatural.

Is there anyone you follow who writes and posts to reddit?

*** Following up on this to share my single favorite entry on [[/r/WritingPrompts][r/WritingPrompts]] that isn't as easy to find now that it's no longer the top post. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PaulsWPAccount/comments/3q223j/index/][A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rogue planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".]]

The closest thing I can compare it to is The Martian, but it's not /as/ rational and it's appeal for me was very different. As a person with autism, the story of a man basically trapped alone with his thoughts and having to solve an intellectual problem with no clear solution in order to escape social isolation /hit home hard/.

Reading this forced me to confront some dark existential fears within myself that I couldn't even admit to feeling. Seeing that fear of indefinite social isolation presented so well made me bawl in anguish for hours on end. I emerged with a better understanding of myself and will be forever thankful for the dark place it took me to.

*** While not the /best/ rational fic out there, there is a lot to like about WTR. Character interaction is well done, dialogue is realistic, combat is continually interesting, and there are just so many moving parts that are just begging to be munchkined.

Also, it's hard to understate the value of a sizable update */every single day/*, and that the author takes community advice, criticism, and general comments with due respect.

*** Piggybacking off of that Young Justice SI recommendation, I'll promote [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/life-ore-death-young-justice-crossover.489535/][Life Ore Death]], a Young Justice Not-SI story.

The main character is Renka, an OC with Feruchemy (from /Mistborn/) as a power set, a history of being a wanted runaway in a violent empire, and no knowledge of Earth before she drops in. The first thing she does on-screen is ask for a meeting with Superman, because being a hero is better than her other option of being a criminal. She has mildly blue-and-orange morality which puts her into conflict with the Team, and is learning the language throughout her time there (though most noticeably at the start) which has some funny moments as well.

It's a highly underrated story IMO, and the (pseudo) predictability and consistency in both her magic and her interactions with people are a good fit for here.

***** Question: Does this story eventually get away from [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][stations of canon]]?

So far apart from the beginning and a few chapters here and there, it seems like the story is just a retelling of Young Justice with a new character added. Most of the events even play out more or less the same way.

I do like that the interpersonal stuff is shifting around because of the SI's presence. But I think I may drop it if there isn't any major divergence from Young Justice.

*** I came here to recommend With This Ring. Here's what I said about it on another thread:

...

OK. I used to read a few comics when. I was young and I have enjoyed the Avengers movies but I'm not I to Marvel or DC. But there's this fanfic on Sufficient Velocity called 'With This Ring' that has me hooked. The author posts about 1,000 words every single day and haven't missed an update since he started over two years ago. I kid you not.

It's the story of a rational Orange Lantern (you might not know what that is but you've probably heard of a Green Lantern) who is pretty darned rational in his desires and how to achieve them. It's absolutely brilliant and I can't understand how this can be as consistently good as it is.

If you don't like superheroes because you think they aren't smart enough then you'll love this.

** Now that I've finally finished the RPG/comedy podcast [[http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-1-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-one][The Adventure Zone]], I can wholeheartedly recommend it as hella fun pulp fantasy. It's put on by the same guys behind the comedy podcast/VRV Exclusive TV show [[http://www.maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-336-twenty-something-teen][My Brother My Brother and Me]] and the YouTube series [[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT6duuVl_8qxJ5eaaPHRX_ij][Monster Factory]] and [[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT6FvTs9d2JPLJnVRjnjIlfo][Car Boys]], which are all worth checking out, as these hilarious improv comedians play Dungeons & Dragons with their professional radio personality father.

It's like HarmonQuest, except I like it more in every single way and there is a lot more of it. The players and DM are better improvisers and have great rapport with one another, all of the characters are funny and likable, the scenarios they get involved in are very imaginative, and the overarching plot may be one of the best examples I've ever seen of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome][Cerberous Syndrome]] with a wonderfully emotional conclusion. It's not very rational, especially at the beginning, but I was damn satisfied by it.

**** Cerberous Syndrome is when a series becomes more dramatic and less comedic as it goes on, in this case because of the reveals brought by the overarching plot. It takes a long time for that to happen here, but if you liked the first arc you should enjoy the rest plenty. This was when the DM realized that combat wasn't interesting by itself so focused on creating crazy scenarios.

The initiation test is pretty boring compared to the rest of the series, but I listen using the app Overcast that can speed up the recording so it was no problem to get through for me. It does not represent a sudden shift in style for the series, the next arc is even funnier than the first one and has way less combat.

** I've been reading some quests on Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity recently. In case you don't know what quests are, they're choose your own adventure stories where the readers vote on the course of action that the main character will take. Here are my recommendations:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]] is a xianxia-style quest. The story is good, though slow-paced, and the magic system is pretty interesting.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/][Paths of Civilization]] has already been mentioned on this sub, but it's a very good civilization-style quest where the readers play as successive kings of a civilization. The details are surprisingly historically accurate in terms of how the technology develops.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hunger-frozen-disney-dark-fantasy-au.40401/][Hunger]] is a quest where the readers control Elsa in a dark AU of Frozen where Elsa's powers come with the cost of a constant hunger for heat and food, including human flesh.

MSPA is probably the most popular of these, though there are a fair number of ass-pulls and it gets pretty text-heavy later on. I thought problem sleuth was better, it was more action-heavy.

There's also prequel adventure or "making a cat cry" the adventure that started updating again after like 2 years that's pretty nice, though it's not very rational either, just fun to read.

There were a bunch of other pretty nice adventures on the MSPA forums but I think the forums died in a fire for some reason.

** Ooh I actually have something new to contribute to one of these. I don't think this game has been mentioned anywhere else on the sub, though I might be wrong.

Doki doki literature club is a free steam game that has themes that this sub tends to enjoy/talk about. I want to remain as vague as possible to avoid spoiling any of it though. It's a "dating sim" - read the steam store page description (I skipped it and dove into the game and regretted doing that later) and try to get the bad route first (don't date anyone), that's probably the best way to see if you'll like it. Getting the good route might be good too but I've only finished the bad one so far.

[[#s][After you play that one, a similar game is]]

I also think it's a good idea to caution people away from stuff sometimes. "the leftovers" tv series has pretty high ratings on metacritic but at least the first episode is pretty irrational.

I also watched a few episodes of "supernatural" and that's not really rational either.
