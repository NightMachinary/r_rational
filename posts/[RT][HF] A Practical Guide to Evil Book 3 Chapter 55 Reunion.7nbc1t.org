** This is one of the few stories that makes me /feel/ things. Things you don't expect to feel when reading or watching a grisly high fantasy story. Amazing writing.

** I like that even at his lowest, Black remains extremely collected and rational. That said:

Yeah, but... when an Empress doesn't want to do something, and you do it anyway, this is basically the definition of rebelling.

** Despite Black's calm and composed attitude I can't help but think Malicia was right.

He's just got dealt a serious blow and his immediate reaction is to turn the Empire into a war machine. It feels too much like a desperate move to obtain as much power as he can so that he's not beaten by an opponent he now overestimates.

Consider this - the Empire can play a lot of hands that Procer can't. It has more Named, it has greater sorcery, at least several "magical super-weapons" and it's united as a single entity rather than a collection of separate states.

It feels like even after the current civil war Praes and Callow could still match evenly with Procer, admittedly with some difficulty.

*** Her assessment of Black was spot on. He believes the war is inevitable to the extent that he fails to see any other alternatives
