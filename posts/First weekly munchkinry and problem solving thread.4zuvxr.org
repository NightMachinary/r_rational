Let's do something simple for today! You have the power to perfectly fool someone into thinking that you are someone else. But only once and only for fifteen consecutive minutes before your power leaves you, forever. There is no upper limit on how many people the power can affect at once.

What's the worse you can do?

Or alternatively here is a challenge a character might face in a fictional world. This character, let's call them A. A has two doors before them. One leads to death and the other to riches. There is a guard before each door. One guard always lies and the other always tell the truth. A doesn't know which is which. What should A do?

I apologize for the rather rushed challenges. I was supposed to prepare them beforehand but something came up. Sorry.

Edit: I'm an idiot who forgot to specify the rules for the knight and knave puzzle. You only get two questions and you can't ask the following questions.

If I asked you if the door you're guarding leads to where I want to go, would you say 'yes'?

If I asked the other guy if the door he is guarding leads to where I want to go, what would he sat?


** 1) I'd choose Jesus as my best option. 15 minutes is enough for a worldwide TV broadcast. From there I can undermine worldwide churches' leadership and basically deliver 'The Newest Testament', which describes unambiguosly the new commandments, forbids finding 'deeper meanings' as the false ones and has a mechanism of text integrity self verification (and meanings'). As for content, it establishes basic 'game theory' society interactions, instigates rationality, defines mechanism of "content updates" and builds a framework for switching from religion altogether later.

Picking a figure from a preexisting religion would basically confirm that religion and would likely stunt societies ideological development.

** I'll post a challenge of my own here. It's an interesting computer science problem disguised as a logic problem. I'll post the answer late on Sunday or Monday morning.

#+begin_quote
  You are someone who works for a company who needs to find out how durable a new container actually is. But you're bored enough that for kicks and giggles, you're going to find out by throwing the containers out of the windows of 200-floor skyscraper you work in. If it survives the fall from the Nth floor and not from the N+1th floor, it's a good enough measure of it's durability for your company. Unfortunately, someone screwed up your order and you only got 2 containers instead of the 200 you needed and time is short.

  You only have the two containers in your hands and you are standing in front of the 200 floor building. You want to know the highest possible floor the containers can handle falling from before breaking. But you need to minimize the number of tries you have to save on time before the very important meeting in 4 hours (it's going to be time-consuming going up and down stairs to retrieve the containers you're dropping out the windows).
#+end_quote

UPDATE: You don't know which floor the containers will break on, so while you can skip testing the first few bottom floors to save on time, it's a risk. So assume that the containers are equally likely to break on any floor.

Also, I worded the problems slightly poorly. You want to minimize the number of tries since it's very stressful to worry if the containers will break or not. You prefer two tries throwing the containers from the 200th floor than three tries from the 1st floor. Going up and down the stairs is not a problem.

*** Interesting.

I can figure out the highest possible floor with 20 tests. Drop the first container out the 20th floor window, then the 20+19=39th floor, then the 20+19+18=57th floor, etc, until it breaks. When the first container breaks start testing the most recent interval. Start with the floor above the last floor the other container survived, work up, and you'll know for sure within 20 tests.

For example, if the first container broke on the 20+19+18+17=74th floor, you've done four tests and you know it can survive up until the 57th floor. Test 58 to 73 (sixteen tests) and when the second container breaks, you are done and you know what floor it survived at maximum.

This strategy doesn't necessarily save me from having to run up and down the stairs a lot. I'm not sure if it minimizes the total flights of stairs one has to cross.

Actually, I know it doesn't: the 20th triangular number is 210, so you could save many flights of stairs by starting on floor 10 instead of floor 20 (then going up by 19 to 39, etc., until you get to 200 exactly). Even then, I'd expect the average number of flights of stairs crossed to be around 2000 (average number of tests is 10, average number of flights is 100, and you have to go both up and down), which means you'll be crossing a flight of stairs every 7.2 seconds. Really you should cross a flight every 5.34 seconds so that in the worst case you will still finish in time (20 tests, container breaks on floor 200, you have to cross 2670 flights of stairs). That's a rough workout for four hours.

Ah well. Did I give the answer you were seeking for the riddle?

**** Yeah, that's the rough outline of the correct answer. I need to double check the exact numbers which I don't have time for now, but you got the idea right with minimizing the number of tries. I worded the problem a little poorly and didn't mean for people to think they needed to minimize the number of flight stairs to travel rather than the number of tries. I updated the original post.

*** An important point to use: Cycle your containers.

Say, drop 1st container at 20th floor. Drop 2nd at higher floor before going down to grab both at once. Cuts your movement by half.

EDIT: I'd say to attach a chain for quick retrieval, but will probably affect the results/

*** We need to know an /exact/ breaking threshold at the end of an experiment.

Therefore, if we only have 1 container, our only choice would be trying to throw the container from every window starting from first floor, incrementally.

However, we have two containers.

I have already shown that no optimization is possible for 1-container case. With two containers, once our first container breaks, we will be stuck with 1-container case. So, all optimization must be in use of first container.

There is some floor number N that lies between upper bound (200) and lower bound (1) If we throw our container from i-th floor, either it doesn't break and we know N>=i (and can try throwing again), or it breaks and we know N<i (and have to resort to iterative testing with remaining one container)

Now, we need some more clarifications.

- Do we think that breaking threshold is equally probable on every floor?
- Is time cost of floors proportional to floor number? (does throwing container from 30th floor take 3 times longer than throwing it from 10th floor?)

We should try maximizing average reduction of range where N lies with first container, then do iterative tasting of entire range with second container. The specific algorithm for first container depends on the answers to questions above.

** On the first, it's important what happens after the fifteen minutes is up.

Does the belief disappear afterwards, or only your ability to continue influencing? If it lasts, then when people meet you again after your fifteen minutes, do they recognize you as the pretend person (only to be dissuaded as they get a chance to interact with you) or do they recognize you and not know why, do they recognize you as a giant fraud, or do they not recognize you at all?

Does the power work over video or audio broadcasting channels... and (if so) does that broadcast then work as a believable fifteen minutes forever or does it immediately seem absurd afterwards?

Also: Do you have to be a specific individual or can you be a generalized ideal: The Creator of the Universe, your most trusted friend, your own great-grandchild time traveling from the future?

** A more interesting variant of the knights and knaves puzzle I once heard runs as follows:

There are three statues. You know that when asked a yes-no question, one responds truthfully, one lies, and one produces a random response (say based on some long ago recorded data). Unfortunately, they respond in a language that you do not speak, using the words Da or Ja. Given three questions, solve which statue is which (and ideally also what Da and Ja mean, though I do not remember if this is part of the problem).

Silly tricks like asking non-yes-no questions (which only the random statue can respond to) or paradoxical questions (same) should probably not be required.

** What's the worst you can do?

Well there was no limitation you could only fool someone into thinking you're a real person, so presumably you could make them think you were Harry Potter or Superman or whoever, and there's no limitation that you need proximity, so can you just make everyone in the city you're in or whatever assume you're Obama or the like. Useful as you can only use it once so being able to indiscriminately use it on everyone prevents people being missed even if they miss the start of your message.

So what's the worst you can do? Choose some super well known being that means the apocalypse is happening, or just fool people into that. For fifteen consecutive minutes everyone in the world think you are the nigh-omnipotent 15min mark herald of the apocalypse and that anyone alive then will be tortured for eternity or whatever. Now the catch is, if people don't know you exist wouldn't they not know the herald-you exists? Except you've fooled everyone so everyone believes you are them, by the nature of the character and the prompt everyone should know they exist.

Note if the power is based off something like super social skills it's not as effective at all. As is that requires exploiting some vagueness but in theory it could result in most of the world killing themselves and as many others as possible within the 15mins, since they all now believe the world will end in fifteen minutes and eternal torturefest for the living. Abusing it to basically turn it into a limited power to make everyone on earth believe one thing for fifteen minutes is kinda cheating though.
