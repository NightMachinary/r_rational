Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I suspect a good portion of this subreddit has at least a passing interest in space, so I'm happy to notify everyone that [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/314650/SpaceEngine/][/SpaceEngine/]] has been released on Steam. It's a highly realistic space simulator which uses massive amounts of astronomical data (and procedural generation) to create what they call an "interactive planetarium." You can visit almost any astronomical object you can think of, look up close and read reports about its physical properties; also, there's a spaceship simulator mode and VR support.

[[http://spaceengine.org][There's an older free version available on its website.]] However, SE has been in development for seven years by pretty much a single person who lived on donations, and now that it's released on Steam, its creator plans to use earned money to hire a team to help him with updates. So if you like either SE itself or at least an idea behind it, please consider buying it to support the developer.

**** /Kerbal Space Program/: They are very different as KSP is a realistic rocket builder first and foremost. Their spaceship mode is rather similar, though, as both use a physics-based approach. You also can land on planets and explore them on foot like in KSP.

/Space Engineers/: I've never played it, but a quick googling shows that it's a sandbox game. SpaceEngine doesn't have any gameplay (except maybe spaceship mode, but even then it's barely gameified). There's no resource management or building.

** [Another [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bxvocf/d_friday_open_thread/eqac711/][Glowfic]] extract. Context: Beka is a half-orc who just escaped Mordor and is now held in captivity by elves, with Maglor as her jailer. (Elves themselves die if imprisoned.) Maglor has been steadfastly deflecting Beka's flirting.]

 

"I am very glad to know you, Beka."

"You could be gladder."

"I don't think I've done a very good job of explaining -"

"Yeah I'm still kinda confused."

"So - say a boy likes a girl.

Maybe the rule we actually want to have is 'they can do things that they're both agreed to and that make them both happy', but we're talking about the rules society enforces, here, not about individual virtue, and 'everyone is obliged to check and make sure relationships meet those standards' is absurd and invasive, so instead we make rules that don't require nosy external investigation, and we say that if people follow the rules they get the benefit of the doubt.

 

And the rules are that you shouldn't pursue someone who's in no position to refuse you, and you shouldn't pursue someone who is in a state of dependence on you, and you shouldn't pursue someone who for any number of complicated reasons might not be good at saying 'yes' when and only when it makes them happy, like because they're very young or because they've been taught never to say no or because they are not sane or because they're presently intoxicated.

 

So, if you break those rules, you're doing two things. First, you're telling everybody that you don't mind being mistaken for someone who'd do something very evil, and you don't mind imposing on them the costs of trying to figure out whether the situation is okay and what to do about it if it's not - costs that we just agreed would be too high to be sustainable if lots of people did this. And second, you're weakening the rules, and people who might want to be careless with the well-being of others will use the weaker rules to do that.

 

Elves do this thing where - if there's a trade-off to be made of individual fun and excitement against - risk of permanent kinds of harm, or costs to social trust, we always pick and enforce rules that get us the second thing. Even if it's lots of excitement for just a small price in social trust. And this wouldn't be a small price, not at all."

 

"...shit, I'm never gonna get laid again."

"You can pick someone who doesn't have your life in their hands!"

"The taught to not say no thing is totally me. Although for whatever it's worth the saying pretty please is all my own idea."

"That would make a difference, yes."

 

" ...

    Pretty please?"

"There are still very much the other two rules."

 

" ...

    Oh no I have got Elfier all of a sudden and you must release me at once and among the places I wish to be free to go is wherever you put your bed?"

"I didn't explain the thing so you could try to rules-lawyer it!"

/Giggle/ "Can't that be a delightful side effect?"

*** One of the most useful pieces of advice I've ever received: first impressions matter.

Obviously in the long term your performance and fit with the new team will matter more, but the way people perceive you within the first second (and then the first minute) of seeing you has an outsized impact on the way they will think of you going forward. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect][halo effect]] hits hard too, so use both of these to your advantage. Stand straight, dress well, firm handshake, make eye contact, use their name. Donuts couldn't hurt, but might seem a bit pandery on day one.

More generally, people will love you if you remember small things about them. Your deskmate likes spicy food? Bring a nice bottle of hot sauce for the break room fridge during week 2. Your boss has a kid who plays baseball? Ask how the season's going a few weeks down the line.

*** Possibly not relevant depending on the specific type of job, but...

A great many people show up to work and only put in 80% effort, so maybe start off at like 82% effort so when you push up to 85% effort the higher-ups think it's impressive. If you start out putting in 100% effort from the outset, the higher-ups will see that as "the norm" that they can just /expect/ on a day to day basis, and they'll eventually start asking you for 110% effort, which it isn't physically possible to give, and if you ever start to burn out and can only put in 95% effort then you might be reprimanded for not putting in as much effort as they're used to from you even though you're still working 15% harder than most other people.

TL;DR: Don't be a tall poppy, because if your coworkers don't try to cut you down for it then your higher-ups will berate you for not being taller. Take stock of how other people seem to be going about their business and try to match the average level at the beginning while you take stock of the work environment.

**** I disagree with this, especially at the start, you should definitely show more effort than your already established/trained peers. I'd say a energetic 90% effort, not a unsustainable effort but one that takes an effort to maintain. Bright eyed and learning driven is the goal, and offer to help out coworkers where you can for learning and team building.

That being said establish your boundaries from the start, don't allow work/"coordination" outside of the workplace initially and expect to roll that back later. Anything you tolerate initially is harder to change later.

**** I'd dissent here too; at least in software your first couple months is where people establish their judgement of you, and you get much more return for effort spent because of that. If you can work at 90% for a couple months and then start coasting at 70%, you'll have a very good opinion and people will interpret anything you do positively, assuming that the tasks you were given were harder than they thought, and thus the drop in output.

Of course it's best to be at a place where you can sustainably work at 90% for most of the time, because it's interesting :P

I don't think I can subdivide my expended effort by 2% without expending 2% or more effort on characterizing my efforts.

My plan is to go 100% from the get-go, and as I become familiar with the job and gain efficiency I'll expend less effort to make the same or better progress. I'll settle somewhere sustainable.

*** An idea: consider the symbol zero (0). The number is something we take for granted, but it is more important conceptually than most people realize. It is something you discover in a basic sense by counting (eventually you'll need a placeholder). The more complicated 'zero as a number' is discovered through involved reasoning about mathematics. For example: by wondering at what value two different equations will be equal. It's complicated enough that it wasn't used as a number until the 7th century AD.

Also, from [[http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues][Twelve Virtues of Rationality]]:

***** I got the serotonin one because one of my friends at the time was getting into tattoos and needed to practice, so he offered to give some of us free tattoos. I decided to get something un-eff-up-able, just straight lines because it's hard to eff up just straight lines, and it ended up looking exactly like it's supposed to look.

For a while I thought about getting dopamine on the other shoulder, but I decided that having a neurotransmitter on each shoulder would a little bit on the nose, considering all the serotonergic and dopaminergic substances I was experimenting with at the time.

Eventually I saw a necklace with a phylogenetic circle as the pendant (possibly [[https://www.ilovesciencestore.com/products/phylogenetic-tree-circle-pendant][this exact necklace]] because I followed "I F***ing Love Science" on facebook way back when I still used facebook) and I wanted it as a tattoo as soon as I saw it, and I feel like it's recontextualized the serotonin tattoo as being something more meaningful instead of being something that I picked just because I thought ecstasy was fun.

Edit in response to your edit:

If I get another one, I'd want it to be something like a stack of books with the top book open and a tree in the back left corner of the left page with a treehouse in the tree and a waterfall coming off the bottom right corner of the right page, and maybe a bridge in the middle. But that'd need to be pretty big so the smaller elements could be sufficiently detailed, and I don't know where on my body I'd put it.

**** I was mainly wondering if there was any sort of symbol that people here already had in mind, but it seems like there's a lot of variety and very little in common. I did some research into various symbols for truth and enlightenment, but there isn't really any common defined symbol out there other than stuff to do with eyes.

WARNING: Huge info dump on my musings and thoughts about designing a tattoo.

I iterated through three different ideas for the tattoo.

The first one was going to be the image of a brain, but with a simplified design where instead of having so many wrinkles and folds that usually appear in anatomical texts, the folds and wrinkles will form molecules used in the brain such as dopamine, adrenaline, endorphin, serotonin, and so on.

After making a practice drawing, I decided that while I liked the idea of it, I didn't like the ascetic of it so much. Brains don't naturally look pretty. So I might commission a drawing of it to be made into a refrigerator magnet, but I won't get a tattoo of it. But I decided to keep the idea of hiding smaller symbols in a larger image.

The second idea was to ditch images and to go for symbols since symbols are a really neat and easy way to convey personal meaning. I really like how [[https://library.kissclipart.com/20181002/zle/kissclipart-elven-star-clipart-heptagram-elf-symbol-e74db4597f637d3a.jpg][fairy stars]] look and wanted to put seven different icons or symbols at each point that each have some sort of significant meaning.

The seven symbols, starting at the top, were: [[https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/universal-signs-symbols/128/buddhism-dharma-512.png][Samsara Wheel]] (what goes around comes around), [[http://www.penninetaichi.co.uk/index_files/image8421.jpg][Labyrinth]] (the path to see the right answer isn't always obvious), [[https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/51/71/symbol-of-yin-yang-vector-1735171.jpg][Yin Yang]] (two opposing, irreconcilable sides can turn out to be two parts of a greater whole), [[https://cdn5.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/27/04/triskelion-or-triskele-symbol-sign-icon-black-vector-23362704.jpg][Triskelion]] (breaking the black-and-white view of duality to look for a third side), [[https://ui-ex.com/images/compassing-clipart-plain-5.gif][compass]] (the pursuit of truth is an ever ongoing journey), [[https://as2.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/17/29/79/500_F_217297989_FychE5I3p7dGrdx2Deywnjg7jyBgJAWO.jpg][Jain Symbol of Ahimsa]] (the absence of desire to harm any life forms), and the [[https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/40/66/the-star-of-david-or-the-shield-of-david-vector-19164066.jpg][Star of David]] (the symbol of Judaism which is important for remembering where I came from before adopting a skeptical view of the world and my beliefs).

While researching all of these symbols was really cool, I felt the resulting image was way too chaotic and had too much stuff crammed in. Each symbol conveyed either an important lesson I learned, a guiding principle, or a virtue I desired to live up to. However, while each one had its own significant meaning, there was no unifying overall /theme/ which was the role that the fairy star was supposed to play. I tried something like this by having the symbols follow a numerical progression from 0 (Samsara wheel) all the way to 6 (Star of David), but it wasn't enough to bring it into one cohesive whole.

So for my third and final idea, I decided to simplify things by only focusing on one symbol from before which ended up being the triskelion. In my mind, out of the eight symbols from before, the triskelion came the closest to representing the ideal of pursuing truth (compasses are overdone!). It represents the breaking of duality by looking for an unknown third side in an argument and the flowing pattern of spirals represents the ongoing process overcoming our biases.

While researching the triskelion, I needed to pick what trio of concepts it represented. Common ones are life-death-rebirth, spirit-mind-body, mother-father-child, past-present-future, power-intellect-love and creation-preservation-destruction. I considered spirit-mind-body, but they didn't come close enough to the truth concept I wanted to evoke. I briefly flirted with the trios sun-moon-earth or sun-moon-star, but then I ran across the most perfect saying:

#+begin_quote
  Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, the truth.
#+end_quote

So I decided to have a triskelion tattooed with the above trio in the spirals. Two of the spirals will have the sun and the moon, and the last spiral will have the triskelion repeated again in it because of how it represents truth for me and I just love having some form of recursion in the tattoo itself. Furthermore, the large triskelion will not look like a normal triskelion. It will have the [[https://s.pngkit.com/png/small/5-51085_vector-curve-ribbon-spiral-fibonacci-spiral-clip-art.png][Fibonacci spiral]] as the arms (who doesn't like hidden math references?). The small triskelion will simply look like a normal one.

I still don't know if I want to include the saying itself looping around the entire tattoo image as a circle. Probably not, since fine details in a tattoo can be lost over time and words are likely to be blurred out in a short period of time.

TL;DR - If I ever wanted to try to make a pithy symbol to represent rationality as a tattoo, then I'd go with a triskelion with Fibonacci spirals as the arms.

The premise was that instead of Light attempting to reduce suspicion on himself by (mild Death Note spoilers) Continuing Kira's murder's while he was imprisoned he decided to engineer a scenario where L would be forced to recognise that they were equally likely to be Kira. The way the plan was executed and the deductions were handled felt intelligent and was definitely fun to follow.

***** Aside from that, there is something you want to go to school soon and that turned out to me are recorded in a blaze of glory. Those have to send a simulacrum on top of them. As you guessed, a simulacrum on a deserted beach, with a known solution. /Excessively Lucky Protagonist/: Too often, the Gamer want to tag me by username or even send me the corrections via PM.

**** It's very hard to speak. Mainly because when I was mentally balancing the number of errors which were only an infinitesimal fraction of the lesser thing. Dumbledore said, looking surprised and am tempted to bet against it.
