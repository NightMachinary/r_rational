** I feel like, if both lovers are emotionally mature and have excellent communication skills, it can't really be a romantic comedy. Romance can drive the characters' motivations, but there has to be some external problem making it interesting, and the "romantic comedy" genre is defined by the problem making it interesting being internal, a result of failures and flaws on the lovers' part.

*** I don't think I agree that romantic comedy needs to be driven by problems internal to the couple. I think that's /usually the case/, but that's because most movies in general have character arcs, which work better in romantic comedies if they tie in with the resolution of the central conflict (because they're one and the same).

So you could do like /Kate & Leopold/ and have the central conflict between characters be more about a clash of cultures, which provides both the romantic tension and humor. Or like /50 First Dates/ where the romantic tension mostly comes from the male lead coming to terms with the female lead's unique disability (though that movie does /not/ do the emotional maturity thing, I'm not sure that it couldn't be done with emotionally mature people).

(I guess there's a discussion to be had about what "emotionally mature" means, but I think it's entirely possible for emotionally mature people to nonetheless have difficulties deciding what it is that they actually /want/ out of a relationship or a partner, and romantic conflict can happen even if both parties are fully communicating their conflicting desires.)

Edit: On reading some of the responses to that thread, it does seem that many people take "emotional maturity" to mean that any internal values conflicts can be solved instantly and decisively without much thought or data gathering, and emotionally mature people never change their mind about what it is they want. And excellent communication skills means that people instantly communicate everything with all parties, including damaging and/or intensely private personal information.

If the characters in 50 First Dates were emotionally mature would the movie still be funny or just sad?

*** Gave it five more minutes of thought, and the best I can think of for a pure romantic comedy where the lovers are emotionally mature and communicate well is "Alice and Bob are a rational couple; Carol is a malicious but competent antagonist figure conspiring to break them up."

**** You could also have a "romantic, comedy" - romance (at least for the leads) is not a subject of comedy but a part of the genre.

For example, John and Jane Smith are so mature that their marriage is in danger from boredom - so as a couples retreat they decide to take one year to pass the world-famous /Clown Exams/. The remainder of the movie features plenty of communication, slapstick, personal growth, romantic moments, and when everything seems to go wrong in the performance for their final project... they just spent a year having fun together and that was the whole point.

**** Or "Alice and Bob are a rational couple who also have strong (and compatible) senses of humor, and use them to perpetually dance with and support each other."

The humor in that case would come from them having a solid and abiding relationship, but other characters constantly misinterpreting the things they do and say.

*** [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103484/][Mad About You]] is a comedy about a married couple. In that show the humor is more slice-of-life-ish than dramatic and it worked pretty well.

Edit: Some episodes were about silly misunderstandings and such but some episodes have none of that and are still funny.

*** This is an interesting way of looking at things, but I think that real world things called romantic comedies are more varied - e.g. My Big Fat Greek Wedding is all about external problems.

*** E.g.: One is from [social group 1]. The other is from [social group 2]. They like each other but are unsure about [the other social group]. They step out of their comfort zone and struggle with what they discover about the outgroup and each other.

This is the premise of half the romantic comedies on the big screen. The rational version would likely have less slapstick and comedy of errors, and more deep talks, but it's still basically compatible.

** This already exists, it's a webcomic called Love & Capes. It's about characters based on Superman and Lois Lane being in a relationship together, and that's it. There's no Will They Won't They, it's just two people in love sharing their lives together. It's sweet, smart, and funny in a lighthearted way. It's no masterpiece, but it's good for what it is.
