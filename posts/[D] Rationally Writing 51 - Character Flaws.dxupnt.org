** Somewhat interesting that AW says that being a thief is such a rare flaw when in WtC, Fenn is a minor kleptomaniac, and Pallida is a major one. Fenn explicitly shoplifts a bunch, and the only real conversation about it was about how useful it is to have so much stuff handy. Pallida hasn't had much chance to show her ability as a thief, but she's obviously proud of it, and she's explicitly rich enough that she doesn't really need to steal much (although her current wealth was probably stolen to begin with...). Again, not really characterized as a flaw by the people around her.

Murder is easier to redeem than rape, because for a lot of reasons that people murder others, the audience can at least sympathize with why someone would be forced into killing someone else, which just isn't true of rape. If someone needs money/resources to survive, or they're seeking revenge, the audience can at least understand what drives someone to murder. But for rape, it isn't done for any material gain, or as comeuppance for a past grievance. It indicates just a complete disregard for the personhood of others, which would be an extreme challenge for any author to attempt to fix, and even harder to do well.

*** Hmm, I'm not sure that's it. Personally, I think it's partly desensitization and partly on-screen-time. Murder is a lot more common in (American) media than rape. This means we're more used to it -- when the villain threatens to rape the heroine, it's a shock, because it doesn't happen as often. Murder happens in pretty much every action PG-13 movie; rape doesn't even happen in every action R movie.

Secondly, I think rape has a longer lasting effect in terms of screen time. If Bob gets murdered, we might get a funeral scene, depending on when it happens, but a lot of times it happens and then the plot moves on. Rape, however, tends to linger. We show the characters dealing with the trauma and the aftermath. This is partly because rape happens more commonly to main characters (movies rarely kill a main character, unless it's a wise old mentor or something along those lines), which adds to the feeling of irredeemability -- you didn't harm Bob, who we knew for a scene or two, you harmed Jane, who we've followed for half the movie.

*** You could rape for continuation of species, genetic code, or bloodline. Material gain.

Or you could rape to establish a relationship with someone, which would be a material thing. Like if you beat someone 1v1 (maybe it's wrestling with the goal to penetrate first) you rape them to be dominant sounds like dolphins would do that or maybe some monkeys.

You could rape someone for demoralising which is another material gain. If you're not allowed to kill or (outwardly) physically harm someone then rape can be a good torture technique that has different mental consequences compared to waterboarding

Or if there's some weird magic. You can justify anything with magic.

That's all off the top of my head so I'm sure I missed stuff, but saying all this I'm not sure how often any of these are used to justify a rapist character

Edit : also I'm not sure it indicates complete disregard considering the prevalence of marital rape. Not like people would say all the vows to someone and all the rest and not value them at all. That sounds like making rapists so evil that they aren't real. Like with holocaust practitioners. Reality is a lot of people are would be rapists and murders and they should be aware of it. Just because you value a person doesn't mens you are immune to them saying no.

**** This thread can go in some weird directions that I don't really want to get into a full discussion about, but I will note that none of the contexts you listed would make me go "Oh okay, I guess they had to rape them, that makes sense."

You're right to bring up non-human animals, as rape is totally commonplace in nature, and it's not a sure bet that any other animal that gains sapience would agree that it's immoral (there are plenty of humans that don't, after all). But those values, generally considered core to what it means to be a civilized and "non-evil" person, are what the hypothetical fictional character is going to be judged by. They might be viewed as solutions by the character in the moment, but in reality they would likely not actually be real solutions, or would not be the ONLY solutions, which immediately removes any potential justification...

...and of course the values that are supposed to justify the behavior have to align too. Most people would not excuse heinous acts for the sake of things like "continuation of bloodline." Some villains get traction out of this, like Cersei Lannister, but she's still undeniably a villain. People who /actually/ do the whole "I don't care how many people die if it means my children are better off" are just regular-ol-monsters, in reality. Practically every dictator could use that justification, and generally would not be "forgiven" for it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is the only thing that actually might do it, yeah. Magic allows the story to just flat say "If you don't rape this girl she's going to get taken over by some intergalactic monster that destroys the planet," and suddenly it doesn't matter how horrified or sickened the character is, they either bite the bullet or let everyone die. Sad as it sometimes is to not have magic in reality, thankfully things like that can't actually happen and we can say "rape is always wrong" as a fairly solid absolute moral position.

***** Right but our bar for murder isn't that they had to do it.

Almost everything solved with murder in most stories could be resolved by other means. But we don't think they're bad people.

Indeed "had" can be as lenient as to avoid prison. While we don't decry soldiers as evil those that engage in rape and desolation at the orders of their commanders as part of pillaging are usually seen far worse.

As you say with Cersei the character doesn't have to be good, just for people to be able to empathise with them ever after. Ton of villainous immoral characters we enjoy to empathise with or even root for but never rapists. I was spit balling from the guy who suggested material gain might seem to justify it. I suspect no list like this would work for murder either excluding defence (and yes I think raping someone to stop them raping you would probably get a justice porn type pass if such an unlikely circumstance came about).

You'd need to build up the character, build up the environment, then downplay the event like we usually do for other villainous people we're meant to at least like to read or watch.

You can absolutely and do absolutely have a choice between rape and death so I won't say rape is a absolute moral wrong.

Plenty of historical circumstances in life where someone has to murder or rape to avoid being killed. Similarly if you don't get the Queen pregnant then perhaps she'll be killed. You might say that's her choice but if you tell her that and she consents you're pretty much still a rapist. Telling someone they'll die if they don't have sex with you is rape I'd say even if they consent to it

Wait I just remembered I think the kid from Prince of thorns is a rapist. Though few people like that protagonist.

It sort of is? I'm having trouble thinking of a hero or sympathetic protagonist that murders when they had other choices, given a "realistic enough" setting (so not like a cartoon where there is magically always a safe and risk-free non-killing option) and values that we understand to generally justify "murder" in a martial setting (armies). [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPRlHwwVIug][The closest thing I can think of is something like this,]] which I would argue is reasonably interpreted as self-defense, even if it's not maximally "virtuous."

I don't think the equivocation between murder and rape actually works the way you're describing, especially not for material gain. Murder-for-material-gain is not actually easy to walk back from in fiction. You can murder in self-defense, or to stop someone "evil," but there are not actually many protagonists, even anti-heroes, that are explicitly just murdering for money that are meant to be redeemed. "Sympathetic" is a hard emotion to pin down, but redeemed is much more clear cut, by narrative focus.

If you are the person threatening to kill her, yes, you're still a rapist and no one is going to think that was a moral choice. It may be different if you are both in a circumstance where she recognizes that if she does not get pregnant she'll be killed.

Sent to prison, need to show your dominance to the other inmates so they don't fuck with you (and possibly kill you), so you beat up and rape the strongest looking dude around?

Rape is kinda necessary here specifically because it depersonifies the victim.

Alternative is killing them, which seems worse.

Like, yeah, you're right about other options being /technically/ available, but that's a vacuous point. It's trivially true in /all/ circumstances that other options are possible, no matter /what/ potential actions are under discussion. But in practical reality, the local cultural norms and expectations /matter,/ often so strongly that people literally can't conceive of taking a different path, and also often so strongly that even if they /can/ conceive of it, it's impossible for them to take it.

This is not a point about rape in particular; this is me objecting to the general argument that you're using to refute the point they were making about rape in particular.

Also, you're kinda strawmanning away the use of the word "kinda" in the normative statement. Like, the word "kinda" is in there for a reason, and you're objecting to a more absolutist position than anyone was making.

************** To be clear again, I'm taking this entire conversation /within the context/ of whether someone's actions are considered redeemable. Maybe our actual disagreement is how much we'll forgive someone for being stuck in localized cultures and expectations, but I would argue that it actually matter that we ARE talking about rape in particular here.

My ideal would be for you to trust that I would not judge someone as irredeemable for murder if they were raised in a culture that made this seem like the only viable option to achieve their goals, while still acknowledging that what was said was in fact said about rape in our society, particularly in our prisons. I don't believe we live in a culture where this is at all "necessary," by any definition.

If you disagree with that, great, we can have that discussion. But really, I do actually understand that this is not a generalized statement about any act, which might be judged less harshly based on the perspective of the person who is in that situation. I pinky promise.

**************** Well my step-brother's been in prison for a few years, and is fairly descriptive about it. I won't claim that he knows /all/ prison culture, or that he must share /every/ part of what he knows, but to me the idea that rape might be necessary to survive in prison feels like a stereotype, and a bad one. From what I understand it can be pretty hellish, and absurd, and scary, and dangerous, but it's not a savage free-for-all where you might need to rape-or-get-raped.

Is it /possible/ that someone goes to prison and is forced by circumstance to rape someone to get everyone else to back off? Sure, anything's /possible./ Do I think it's a /probable/ circumstance to worry about finding oneself in, even pre-selecting for people-in-prison? No, not remotely. And if someone were to construct a circumstance where this occurs, do I think that makes the act excusable? I'm not sure. From my privileged non-prisoner-position, I think I'd rather get raped, personally, because I don't think I could go through with it myself and believe I'd be able to recover from the experience better than most others if my alternative methods of retaliation for some reason fail to convince people not to mess with me. Others are free to make their own decision, and I can judge them on that by my own moral standards.

Meanwhile I feel fairly confident standing by the position that, in general, protagonists that rape are very very hard to redeem, in a unique way that protagonists that commit other acts of violence are not.

As for this:

I don't believe I'm strawmanning it at all. The entire comment is pointing to this as an absolute conclusion. The comment doesn't even make sense to me if he's waffling on how necessary it is... the followup sentence "Alternative is killing them, which seems worse" further cements this read of it, to me. "Kinda" here reads as a rhetorical flourish, a way to soften the delivery but not the conclusion. [[/u/melmonella]] can clarify this if they'd like, but otherwise I don't find your read of the words-as-written justified.

But we're NOT taking that as a given. Or at least I'm not. Again, this conversation's context is fiction, not-specified-but-implied to be largely consumed by a Western audience.

I already acknowledged that it's possible for someone to put a gun to someone's head and say to rape someone or die. This is not a hard thought to have, or a novel one, and I don't find it meaningfully changes with added layers of complexity. Someone could be raised in a family where rape is commonplace. Maybe they're a prince and they're commanded to impregnate a rival kingdom's princess for peace in the realm. Their own safety doesn't even have to come up as a consideration before these decisions might be complex moral conundrums.

But this one, rape-or-be-raped in prison, is not to me persuasive at all. Him claiming that it's necessary, and that murder seems worse, without constructing the scenario more than he did puts the burden on him to justify its necessity, not on me to refrain from expressing my disagreeing view.

***** Not one of the downvoters, but my take on this is that the comment triggered people's sense of normalization or justification of rape, particularly with regards to the comment about marital rape. In the other examples I don't think RMcD94 meant to do that, they seem to be just listing situations they believe fit the criteria of "times people might rape for material gain," but since the /context/ is acts that can be excused/redeemed from, and most people would not find characters who do those things redeemable, it's getting bucketed.

I'm also aware of a vague signalling concern, as many communities find it valuable to make it clear that certain ideas are not widely accepted in that community, and I can see people downvoting in this circumstance for that reason too. It's at -2 now by my view, which compared to my +12 at least means most people who felt strongly enough to upvote the response refrained from downvoting his, whereas for melmonella's much more assertive claim the downvote ratio is much higher.

***** I didn't downvote, but I personally feel really uncomfortable reading that conversation. Trying to brainstorm situations where rape might be okay narratively is just...tough.

Rape and murder are not on the same level for a variety of reasons. Think about a comedy skit, like Monty Python. They can joke about killing people and it's funny. Kids shows even have characters attempting murder as a running bit, like Road Runner and Wiley Coyote.

But rape? You can't even jokingly talk about that with a friend. Sexual offenses trigger the "disgust" and "danger" reflexes in most people's brains, and for good reason. Most people won't accidently commit murder just by talking about it. But rape? Make it socially acceptable, or even just joke about it, and some people will do it. Many people /have/ done so for as little provocation as drinking too much alcohol. Rape is also extremely common and there are a lot of victims who might be reading your responses so yeah just...be careful, guys.

****** FWIW, I find all of this valid.

There's a really good (and quite short) post [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7cAsBPGh98pGyrhz9/decoupling-vs-contextualising-norms][here]] that's zero percent about rape and 100% about the kind of conversational trickiness you're pointing at. You might find it interesting, if you haven't already seen it.

******* I like the post about conversational norms. So I suppose the question is how much does a conversation about rape need to be contextualized. In my opinion, it requires more than most topics out there, because there's a lot of baggage that comes with the subject, and we can't just pretend it doesn't exist. Even for only the span of a thought experiment.

***** In general people who make use of the voting system without commenting are useless, especially in discussions and even more so with such a small number of commenter that any functional value of sorting is absent. Who knows why they downvoted but most likely because they saw someone else did it too. Studying how upvotes cause upvotes and downvotes cause downvotes is another way of demonstrating the biases we all struggle to overcome.

Forums would be superior for things like this, usually lacking such things as up votes (though these days a lot have likes as substitutes). But the reddit tree format is better imo.

I'm not sure why someone in the rational subreddit would downvote for blithelyness. At no point did I make any normative statement. It would seem strange to me to feel challenged (offended?) that you'd need to downvote it. But then I don't downvote anyone so what do I know?

** Hey everyone, sorry for the massive delay: it was a pretty crazy summer. Also just an FYI, our Soundcloud account is deactivated, so the podcast is being hosted entirely on Anchor now other than a couple episodes that are allowed for free accounts.

This hopefully does not break anything but direct links to Soundcloud and that rss. Here is the new one:

[[https://anchor.fm/s/872330c/podcast/rss]]

Enjoy!

*** Can you update the links on daystareld.com? For example, #3 (originality) says SoundCloud couldn't find that track.
