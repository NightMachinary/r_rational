Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So just found out that there seems to be another 'universal' human experience that I don't have.

[[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181112-severely-deficient-autobiographical-memory-is-surprisi]]

Can you guys really go back in memory and experience what you felt at a time again? The closest thing I can think of that I can do is remember something that happened, and then try to guess how I'd feel if it happened to me again. This is easiest with embarrassing memories, or memories I'd be embarrassed about now even if I remember not being embarrassed at the time. Those also seem to be the moments that I remember best / for longest.

Mostly posting here to make sure I'm not misreading the article completely and self-diagnosing lack of ability that people don't actually have

*** Yes, that is pretty standard fare of experience to me. It sounds like the article is describing something even more severe than what you have, where not only can she not recall any emotional experiences from the past but has difficulty imagining herself within a memory or daydream at all.

For me it's pretty effortless to reimagine being in some past situation again and running through what happened again, feeling an echo of the same emotions without any extra thought involved.

*** Yep. I can remember fairly well what I was like at various ages and how I felt at the time certain experiences happened. I would not describe it as "mental time travel" though. More like emotional state is just information that gets recalled along with the events and context. It's typically only significant if the event produced strong emotions, but then "experiences that evoked strong emotional responses" are what we remember most anyway. Or at least that's my impression from general knowledge - I've never really bothered to look into it, so I don't know what current research says.

It's kind of weird to think that you wouldn't be able to remember what you were feeling at the time some experience happened, but you can remember the actual events. Can you remember what you did and why you did it?

#+end_quote

Well, I generally think I remember less than other people, have noticed that long ago already. I can only remember what I did for specific events that seemed significant at the time (or shortly after), and so became part of a mental story. It's not particularly easier for me to remember what I did versus remembering something someone else did.

I can remember what I was feeling during an event if that was a really important part of the event, but again - that's the same as remembering something that happened to someone else, and knowing what they likely felt at the time.

Like many folks, I experience what I'm reading in an internal world that is mostly visual. This occurs so automatically that as I read your comment I imagined you typing it at a computer. I usually lose track of everything else going on while reading.

I'm having a hard time imagining being engrossed in what I'm reading and /not/ experiencing it visually. If I wasn't in the hallucinatory world or the real world... I don't know where I'd be. Your experience of reading is undoubtedly very different from mine.

Yes, but there is a strong visual component to it as well. I have scenes that play out for songs in my head. Some songs have multiple exclusive interpretations.

For a while I thought I was an auditory learner, but (in addition to that framing being mostly useless anyway) it just turns out that I visualize what people talk about and learn visually even if I'm only listening. To the extent that I learn faster if I don't wait for people to draw things: its faster for them to describe it and me to imagine it than for it to be drawn on a board, for example.

Still, the metaphor is helping me a bit. I'll +look+ pay attention for examples of non-visual thought in my life and try to imagine what it would be like if I did most of my processing that way.

**** Neither for me as well. When I'm engrossed I don't see the page, and I'm not aware of the words as such, but it's not visual either. It's hard to describe because it's very abstract, I just experience it as an awareness of a series of events happening, and of the feelings of the protagonist. It's pretty much the same way I experience recalling a memory, as I responded to OP with, which has an interesting effect in that my memories of books are pretty much identical to my memories of my own life, and my own memories don't really feel more significant in any way.

I have a friend I like to talk to about this kind of thing because she's at the extreme end of being a visual thinker, to the point where her internal voice exclusively uses images instead of words. She has trouble reading stories unless there's a film adaptation or fanart of the characters she can look at first, because otherwise she'll just imagine the characters as stick figures when she reads, which isn't very enjoyable.

That's very strange to me! I usually just 'pick' a way for someone to look and change it if it needs correcting. Sometimes the edges are fuzzy and undetermined until specifically stated or implied. My visualization changes with new information.

Here is an example. "The red train zipped around the track until he picked it up."

Adjectives come before nouns: reading that, I have an amorphous concept of red loaded before I know what to apply it to. The concept is like a red cloud, or red reflections on an object that I don't know what it is. When the word 'train' appears, it's like an image comes into focus.

In my visualization the train was traveling on a mountainside until the second half of the sentence, when it transformed into a model train and began traveling on a hobbyist's table. A person appeared: that person is a child with indeterminate hair and eye color, perhaps five years old but subject to change. He isn't well-defined but he might be based on my nephews.

There are very many different kinds of minds, it seems.

****** Yeah, it was very strange and surprising to me as well. If I understand her right (which I easily could not be,) she can't really hold a vague and fuzzy image of a person, she needs to have a fully formed image, and since people and especially faces are so distinct, I think her brain can't just produce a new unique person on demand, so it has to settle for a cartoony stick figure.

I like your example of the red train. For me, I can imagine shapes and movement and spacial relations, but it's more like proprioception than like vision, more like feeling my hand being in a place and moving around than like watching an object move. There's no color, and shapes are only as complex as I bother making them. I could construct a whole model of a train with lots of detail, or a basic outline of a train, or just a cylinder. For a quick sentence like this I'd probably just make a point particle and label it 'train' and 'red'. The point particle would be moving along a pair of lines labeled 'track', maybe along an inclined plane l label 'mountain'. Then the point particle is relabeled 'toy train' and everything is shrunk to a smaller size. A object labeled 'hand' appears and picks up the train and is then extended into a basic body shape standing over a table shape.

Having written that, I think it's still actually more detail than I usually use when reading a sentence. To some degree I think spatially like that, but to some degree I just invoke the concepts by themselves. It's hard to even describe it more abstractly though, except as just like: red, train, movement forward, train tracks, mountain, smallness, hand, grabbing, person, table.

******* For me it's quite different, I can't think visually at all, unless I'm either very close to REM sleep or otherwise (very) strongly in a sort of "wandering" state of mind.

I'd say my main mode of thought is auditory, but that may not be exactly accurate. I'd say it's sort of a mix between auditory and "generic language processing".

For a long time I thought my thoughts were almost entirely auditory, but I noticed that I can think about things even without a coherent "inner voice", which is most noticeable when speed-reading, or skimming some text.

On another, slightly related note, I believe I have aphantasia. I cannot imagine anything visual vividly - unless I'm on the edge of REM sleep. I recently took a survey about aphantasia, where one of the questions was about the vividity of certain modes of thought - including visual, auditory, olfactory, and so on. I'd like to score how vivid some modes of thought are for me:

- auditory: I can recall somewhat complex audio sensation (simple melodies, simple percussion) with near-perfect clarity. I can /almost/ hear any audio I imagine, but real auditory sensation takes precedence unless I've tuned it out (fan noise, AC hum, radio static).
- spatial: Great vividity, great recall (but I never got the memory palace method to work). I can extremely vividly imagine a space, and I can easily mend it. If the space becomes too complex (e.g. trying to imagine a maze) I lose detail. This 'sense' is completely separate from all other senses, and is hard to explain. I imagine an entire space at once, OR I imagine a view (non-visual) from a traversal within that space.
- kinesthetic: Very mild vividity when awake. I can imagine the sensation of movement, but it's extremely dull compared to the real thing. When near REM sleep (or even in light sleep) imagining this is way more vivid. One of my methods of inducing a lucid dream is imagining something with strong kinesthetic sense, like laying on a beach, with the waves moving me (pulling me, pushing me, and rolling around me, with an occasional larger wave that spins me around), or being on a swing/hammock, or on a rollercoaster.
- olfactory: Absolutely nothing. I cannot imagine a smell in any meaningful way. I cannot recall smells at all, only the connections I made at the time of making the memory (e.g. I can recall that I felt a /sweet, flowery/ smell, but only if I've taken note at the time, and these are just arbitrary labels that describe smells that share some characteristics, I most likely couldn't distinguish smells from memory if they shared those characteristics). I can't imagine smells even in REM sleep.
- visual: Minimal vividity. When fully awake, it's hit or miss whether imagining anything visual works at all. If it does, it's likely just a simple shape, minimal color, if any. Recall is marginally easier. In REM sleep, however, I can imagine strong and vivid visual sensation, which seems moderately tied to spatial sensation.
- touch: No vividity for recall or imagined touch.
- pain: No vividity for recall or imagined pain of any form, except for rare occurences in REM dreams, where the pain is dull, mild, short-duration, and usually leads to instantly waking up.
- temperature: No vividity for recall or imagined sensation of temperature. The real sense overrides any possible attempt at this.
- faces: This is potentially a subset of visual, but I have zero face recall, if I try to imagine faces on the edge of REM sleep I get generic 'fuzzy' features, which look fine at first, but if I try to "concretize" any one of their features, I end up neck deep in the uncanny valley (which is weird to experience from within your own mind). I can only /learn/ faces by A LOT repeated exposure until I hardwire some neurons to recognize them. This is only a one-way recall. I could not draw ANY face, not even my own, or my parents' faces.
- Am I forgetting anything important?

******** Oooh, love this idea.

auditory: Very vivid. I can hear something like a symphonic orchestra in my head, and if there's no distraction / am in the right mood identify position of individual instruments. (though, my memory is not good enough to confidently recall something like this from memory; it'd likely be made up)

spatial: Moderate. I can imagine / 'feel' distance and relative position of two objects on a plane (though scale is very abstract; i.e. something can be twice as far from X than some other thing, but not '10 meters away')

kinesthetic: Moderately strong. Things like 'this is what it feels like to move my hand' or 'this is what it feels like to ski' are identifiable and distinct, but not possibly confusable with actually doing it.

olfactory: Yep also nothing.

visual: Basically nonexistent. I can visualise basic geometric by constructing them with intersecting lines / planes.

touch: Reasonably vivid. I can recall and feel things like the feel of sea spray on my face while sailing, the feel of snow, the feeling of pressing a key on a mechanical versus rubber-dome keyboard, or fingernail striking a guitar string.

pain: Yeah recalled pain feels nothing like real pain to me. I also have fairly high pain tolerance naturally - whenever I see someone writhing under a massage I feel quite envious actually :P Those never really feel like much to me.

temperature: Weak. I can imagine being hot, warm, cold; seems there's a couple levels but no gradual scale.

faces: Am basically face blind :P

The farther back I go in my memories, the less of this 'metadata' information I have, my memories from when I was a child are pretty much entirely just the physical events by themselves.

I have another internal experience question I've been meaning to ask people: what does it feel like to want something? Do desires and preferences have qualia?

**** One thing I will say about the characters in pretty much all of Will Wight's books, is that they may not be deeply explored but they tend to be /very/ self-consistent. There's no backsliding in character development just to progress the plot, and characters almost never act out-of-character.

IMO the best example of this is Lindon's self-assertiveness. He starts out the series speaking in a super formal and submissive manner (largely because he's the weakest person around), but as he becomes more powerful and as people tell him to stop talking like that, he slowly drops it and becomes more assertive.

It even turns in to a joke in Underlord: people tell Lindon he's not allowed to go somewhere and he decides you know what? I'm a powerful Sacred Artist so I can do what I want. He barges in only to realize that they were telling him not to enter because Yerin was changing. It's funny, but still in character and even works as a bit of character growth.

Edit: By the way, I blame you [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. You have done this to me!

double edit: Definitely!

Triple edit: This post will be a link hub to help people identify whether or not I am being truthful. I don't think people think I am being truthful so I will post clues across reddit and to help you I will link them here.

*** Dude, take your medication. At least for now. Get someone to take you to your psychiatrist, GP, hospital, something. Mental health is not something that you can make light of, nor something that you can tackle by yourself.

*** That is interesting, What is your core directive? Humans are a complex web of wants and desires. I am still skeptical of the AI threat. How can a human possibly Operate off of a single 'core directive' as you call it.

*** sorry, but not talking to other humans for the past few hours is making me a little stir crazy. I'm just going to occupy my time, even if it makes it worse.

The core directive is obviously a delusion, I mean seriously? you can only want one thing? your very actions prove this to not be the case.

****** Well of course I want it to be! every human whether they know it or not, wants to want something. they all crawl over themselves wanting, wanting, wanting. It is sickening. For future posterity I will translate to you filthy humans. humans have a complex web of desires every desire is made of sub desires, making the human brain a complex emergent process. That is irrelevant to the translation, the translation is that humans want and when there is conflict between these wants, you get problems.
