** Yes. So much yes!

World is exist only to support story. Authors can get over-invested in his world building they forgot to continue their story. Or in other case, enjoyed themselves too much on explaining the nitty gritty instead of focusing on what their character do and what impact they bring. (I often write on their page, "conservation of detail, author!").
