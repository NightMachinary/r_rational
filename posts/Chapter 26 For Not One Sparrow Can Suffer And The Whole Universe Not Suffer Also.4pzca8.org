*** It might be useful to note that the orchard refers to paradise---Eden. Let's get some flaming swords up in here!

Also, Elisha's justification for Metatron being another god is that Metatron was sitting even though there is no sitting in heaven.

His disenchantment lead him to cease believing in Judaism, but most importantly the afterlife. Perhaps heaven=Eden, which he saw had been razed. I keep getting this vibe that there is no good afterlife in Unsong.

******* I think God "refused" to forgive him the same way he refuses to do anything. Creation is on autopilot.

Punishment can be something automatic, like the Law of Gravitation punishes you for jumping from an airplane without a parachute but it would take active divine intervention to be "forgiven" and survive.

However given the story being all about bizarre kabbalistic stuff, the fact it would be a convoluted theory /would actually lend it credence/.
