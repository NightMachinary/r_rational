So in chapter 94 Amaryllis changes herself through soul magic. I really liked story so far, but this doesn't sit right with me.

So my question is whether this will be seriously addressed later. I don't think I will continue if it doesn't, so I'm fine with being spoiled here.


** It hasn't been yet, though it's bound to come up again sooner or later.

I wonder, though, why her choosing to no longer be a side-interest for the protagonist is that uncomfortable? It's probably not the /healthiest/ manner to address that problem. But who has the right to deny someone agency over their own soul?

If it were a normal crush I'd agree with you, but Amaryllis was suffering from an arbitrary out-of-character affliction engineered by the DM; the healthy response is to excise it like the foreign agent it is.

Amaryllis even said that she wasn't attracted to him at first, she thought she would have to become his wife/lover due to lack of power and decided to start thinking about him that way...which unfortunately worked.

******* I don't see any evidence that Amaryllis has lived a life that would make her specifically attracted to Juniper. She also said "I'm fairly sure that it's confined just to you", so there's nothing it seems to be an extension of, and most worrisomely she said

#+begin_quote
  And if you weren't able to fix me, if my flesh was still unwilling, I'm pretty sure that I can reach into my soul and fix myself that way, until I wanted it as much as you did.
#+end_quote

That all screams much more that her attraction to is an ad-hoc patch, rather than a core part of her being.

I don't think the DM has said anything implying otherwise, and he's done a lot to show how directly he meddles with things. Heck, given how much deception there is in WtC, even if the DM /had/ directly said otherwise I wouldn't consider that particularly irrefutable: he clearly has a biasing motive to convince Juniper to Take Things Seriously.

As to "an axe to grind"... well I'll admit I'm fairly aromantic, so what matters to me is less the signalling and more the constructive dynamic, eg. [[#s][Marked for Death]]. So "I'm dating you because I'm randomly attracted to you" would grate at me, but if Amaryllis de-romanced herself and /then/ decided that a relationship with Juniper would be a good idea before re-romancing herself, I'd be all for it. (Which is not to say that Fenn needs to do this dance, since her situation doesn't seem similarly contrived. To put it another way, if after you turn down your sexual attraction and a relationship looks "like idiocy or lunacy or both", it's probably not a relationship you should be in. This is not a fact particular to fiction.)

******** She was kidnapped by a horrifically rapey unicorn when young and then surrounded by abusive people with manipulative agendas until ~30 minutes prior to meeting the protagonist. It's weird to single out a teenage girl who was exposed to a situation conductive romance for the very first time gradually developing romantic feelings as being a more direct manipulation than Fenn spending a long time in prison prior to meeting Joon for example.

As for deception trusting her own self-report isn't exactly any more reliable than believing the DM. Apart from generally being someone known for tactful omissions when they serve her interests she previously confessed that Joon was the only /man/ she was ever attracted to but then when she was removing that part insisted that there would never have been anybody she would have been naturally attracted to at all. This coming from someone who spends longer gushing about how good Fenn looks than the guy whose dating her.

The DM has mostly done the opposite of showing himself /directly/ meddling in things a weird soul-patch is very different from a delayed archery competition. Plausible deniability is his MO. The way it's possible for her attraction to be unnatural is that someone in the past had a reason to covertly organized a soul mage to mess with her but then the DM would have wanted that to be case for a plot twist. Or else you might believe the DM isn't telling the truth but then there is no reason to believe Amarilys exists at all. Overall does setting it up so that she might fall for Joon on her own seem like something a powerful devil with access to her and everything around her for her entire life couldn't do without it looking suspicious?

The thing that sticks out to me is the word contrived. We know for a fact that everything else is contrived as well. Fenn is character who was meant to look more down to earth but has had every bit as much time spent engineering her for her role. What does core character mean here? Because it looks a whole lot like "the person Amarilys is supposed to be" but then who is that and why doesn't she have confusing feelings during puberty?

Evidently Amarilys agrees with your reasoning about romance and Joon does not but that seems like a separate discussion from the ontology of said romance or the general ethics of voluntary self-castration.

This is the same DM that presumably made Juniper trigger an infohazard which then didn't kill him to warn him off downtime. He's subtle about it, but hardly indirect. As you say, he's primarily about plausible deniability, so as long as there aren't numbers or soul mages involved he has pretty free reign. /Click/, he goes, and Amaryllis has an unexplainable attraction to Juniper. No observable manipulation required.

Ultimately my view is that the goal should be to be the healthy, happy and productive individual you wish yourself to be. The reason I worry about self modification in the general case is because it substitutes heavy-handed and dangerous bandaids for healthy development and skill acquisition, not because I'm against it prima facie.

I don't think Amaryllis is getting that kind of positive return on this; even if she would later end up in a romantic relationship, I don't see it being of the same sort, with the same difficulties and strengths. Maybe I'm suffering the mind-projection fallacy here, but she really does strike me as someone who would like others for different reasons than she does Juniper.

Again Amarilys believes this as well in her notes it's classified as the bullshit theory but it amounts to the same as "Amarylis is an NPC who lacks consciousness" as situations where the DM can escape observation is equal to all situations ever.

I don't think I know Amarilys well enough to say anything about her love life. Perhaps she would be both happiest and closest to her perfect self by playing host to an alien parasite or turning into an amorphous self-replicating ooze. But whether or not what she's doing is fine in principal the concern for people in universe is radical self-experimentation while under the influence of the same juvenile irrationality inducing hormones she's so eager to get rid of. Something that closely pattern matches poor decision making in fiction if nothing else. There is little reason to believe she knows what she's doing or that it will turn out like she's expecting so all those concerns about self-modifcation definitely apply here.

The DM's gentleman's agreement that he isn't doing what you've just described and that things are meant to look as though they could plausibly be true in a universe without the DM in it (aside from the game layer) are the only reasons to think anything is happening or that Juniper actually exists and isn't just a brain in a jar. It could be bullshit and we'd never know but there is no reason to believe both that mind control is happening and that everything isn't just a dream.

If Amarylis who is a major focus hasn't been fleshed out to the extent of being a plausibly organic development of the world she exists within then nobody who Joon interacts with will likely be anything more than superficially human like.

The category of the thing being altered - romantic and sexual attraction is a central personality trait. It's what makes people make decisions about who they are and what their goals are. It means that anything else such as filial piety, aggressiveness, ego etc. could simply have been added and subtracted when the plot demanded. NPCs like this will react to socializing in the way that's expected but if they're being altered by the DM then stuff like Nellan being invented in the moment drama was needed for Fenn and Joons relationship becomes a possibility as well.

I don't think this is what happened; I think the DM is being honest when he said his character meddling was ahead of time. In many ways I view the DM as an author proxy: you set your characters up to do make the decisions you want them to ahead of time, but once they're out in the wild you let them develop naturally. As to the infohazard event, there are ways to guide actions without meddling with core personalities, as today's experts would attest.

Maybe we're veering off topic?

You say Amarylis attraction is the result of direct mind alteration because it's very peculiar to which I respond with the idea that it would be more likely that Amarylis be indirectly condition to have this peculiar trait or that she's simply been prevented from meeting other people than Joon who trigger it by DM conspiracy.

The reason I support this idea is that while the alternative interpretation could also be true this would imply that the DM is constrained by factors other than the rules he sets for himself. The DM would obviously like for his world to have people in it that act like he wants them to naturally so the fact that he needs to intercede directly to get the romance going means that everything else that's happened needs to be suspected of at least that much tampering. We know there is some tampering involved already but the previous baseline was that which a single person with nearly perfect foresight could accomplish with a week worth of preparation. Directly altering peoples personalities sets the benchmark so hight that we no longer have any reason to believe people exist before Joon meets them or after he leaves the room.

I don't think "naturally" is a useful word here. I agree that the DM seems to want the story being told to be largely a product of the characters' agency in response to the situation they are in. I believe this because agentful characters make for a better story.

I don't particularly think he's equally concerned about the naturalness of how those characters became who they are, in the sense that "Amaryllis just happens to have this subset of genes that make her attractive to Juniper" is /less/ Watsonian than "Amaryllis is attractive to Juniper because the DM wanted it". Where a truly Watsonian explanation makes sense, like how Grak's backstory affects his character, I expect the DM values that, but when it comes to aspects that are intrinsically Doyolist (oh look, you're all princesses) it only takes away impact to attribute it to chance. It is better in this sense to give the agency to the DM than to give it to nobody.

Does that make my stance a bit clearer?

**** I understand your issues--it's a serious and problematic thing to do--but don't you think it's in character for Amaryllis? She's ruthlessly pragmatic in every facet of her life. She saw a problem, assessed her options, and took the one that made the mosy sense to her.

And to be fair, Juniper was quite upset when she did it, and they had a big discussion about it that ended (IIRC) with him saying "I still don't like it, but I respect your autonomy and reserve the right to bring this up again if I think of a better argument."

Do you have a problem with Juniper dialing down his level-up addiction? I'd say that's just as natural a part of his soul as Mary's crush was of hers.

Also, I feel I should mention that I disagree with your disapproval of self-alteration in general. If I had soul magic you can bet your ass I'd dial up the importance of fitness and accomplishment.

When she did it I felt off, but as she explained her Decision to Joon I felt like she was at least partially in the right, it is /her/ soul and if anyone has the agency to change it, it's her, and that this is little different from taking emotionally altering drugs from earth like Prozac (a drug I have first hand experience with).

Joon's objection was less than solid, and I do feel like he could have come at it from a better angle, mostly that the emotions she was feeling were natural (despite what some may say, I think that the emotions and actions of the crew aren't under any coercion from the DM) and that the most healthy way to deal with them was naturally, doing it this way she doesn't get to learn how to deal with such emotion in the future, she is handicapping her future ability to deal with rejection and desire.

I am VERY curious how this is going to effect her in the long run, she is a strong individual and I feel like this will come up again whether she wishes to alter her soul in some other way in the future or otherwise.

If I read this correctly, Amaryllis only removed her romantic and sexual attraction to Joon. She still likes him, and it doesn't look like she changed anything regarding Joon in particular, just a general change to asexuality.

Whilst it hasn't necessarily been addressed in the chapters since, I imagine this is one of the things that becomes a slow-burn issue, something that seems immaterial at first but eventually is granted greater importance to the story, before coming to a resolution in some future plotline. Whether the resolution satisfies you or not is another question.

To answer yours, however, it hasn't yet been seriously addressed, but that doesn't mean it won't be. It's only been 10 or so chapters since the issue came up.

If you don't mind me asking, why doesn't alteration of one's own soul sit right with you?

To start with more emotional than rational view. And as I said In another comment, I'm pretty invested into characters at this point.

So here I agree with June, that she is altering core part of herself. She says her feeling does not define here, but while they are obviously not all of here, they are important part. To just switch it off does not makes here another person, it makes her different enough for me to see it as being wrong. And this also opens gates to potential further changes, even if they are never used.

And this is compounded with June being somewhat interested party, so he cant come hard on this issue without looking selfish. This is what probably grates me the most here - not only I don't agree with alterations, but it also can't be properly debated in-world because if conflict of interests.

**** Following your reasoning and using the in story arguments:

How is what Mary is doing to herself any different than what Joon is doing with his level up?

You can argue that Joon's desire for leveling up is a core part of who he is but he views it as a negative utility and so he chooses to lower its value. Mary does not like that she has feelings for Joon and sees it as negative utility. By changing her romantic values towards Joon she is resolving the problem.

In terms of abortion, if Mary was carrying hers and Joon's child, she reserves the right to terminate that pregnancy because its her body. She reserves the right to terminate any feelings she has for Joon because its her soul. She thinks that Joon should do the same but she is letting him make that decision for himself.

Yes, it will make her a different person, but so does anything that anybody does. Carrying baby Solace is altering both her body and soul too but it doesn't seem like you're arguing against that choice.

Yes, one could argue about the negative slippery slope but that's all hypothetical and the same could be said for it in the positive.

***** I think the abortion example is ill chosen, since the soul alteration is changing something that is exclusively and irrevocably her and hers, while a child is the result and property of a joint effort, and a husband would have equal claim to an unborn child or newly born child.

A better example would be her removing a part of her own body, like a toe or finger. You may not like it, but it's not your body.

**** Even if you see her actions as completely wrong on several levels, why would you stop reading over it. Isn't an important deuteragonist having serious flaws while still being likeable otherwise a pretty normal thing to have in a story?

** It's fine that you don't agree with Mary's decision, but I find it a little odd that you can't continue the story because you disagree with one character's decision. Real people make mistakes, so even if you see self-modification as horrible, it shouldn't ruin the story for you.

Personally, I see nothing wrong with it. To my knowledge, most of us here are transhumanists, and more often than not transhumanists believe in the right to self-modify. I don't see what she's doing as any different from using antidepressants for depression or anxiolytics for anxiety, just far more controlled. A better solution. How is altering the mind somehow worse when you can do it in a controlled, specific way? I see the right to modify your own mind, be it through drugs or soul magic, as one of the most fundamental rights there is.

** It's "addressed" in the sense that the narration makes it clear that it really does not sit right with Joon either, and he and Amy fight about it.

Ultimately, Joon has to ask Amy and Fenn to forcibly pin him down and alter the value of "Level Up" in his own soul (and the need for this gets increasingly severe, because his desire to level up to the exclusion of all else gets more intense every time he levels up and the higher his level is) although he justifies this by reasoning that the DM is messing with his mind in the first place. For Amy's part, the DM arguably molded her mind for the purpose of crushing on Joon from the very start.

I wouldn't say it's /resolved/ but it is addressed. It's clear that the fiction isn't taking soul changes lightly, at least. That said, if you're not satisfied a few more chapters in, you probably won't be satisfied for the remainder unless it's revisited.

*** i dont think thats necessarily true. forget about what the author thinks (he hasnt said his thoughts on it and its not super relevant anyways), i think the /story/ sees it as kind of an open question. the protagonist is clearly against it, and i did not feel anything approaching closure on the issue. its not even closed for mary, since she wants joon to reciprocate. this is clearly going to come back up

** I think I've become victim of my own shipping and got /heartbroken/ when reading that chapter too. But really, I recommend at least continuing till the end of book V (Chapter 104). That's a good stopping point, I guess. It soften my broken heart at least.

** The most recent chapter is 112 and so far it's at the point of "agree to disagree" but it's sounding like a setup for a subplot sooner rather than later.

Then again, June is doing the same thing. He's just being a hypocrite about it and since the story is from his perspective, his pov is all we get.

- both are arguably dm meddling but just as likely the person's natural feelings of the subject

- Both characters have been bothered by their affliction since the first few chapters and neither of them has mentioned their concerns to the other

One is presented in a way that makes it make sense while the other is presented in a way that makes the reader uncomfortable, but they are both the same action taken for the same reasons.

Don't worry though, in the chapters that follow the speaker glosses over the issue like he glosses over his powergaming mindset and the way Mary treated him just slightly differently than others, so you don't have to think about the implications until you want to or the story gets back around to the resolution of those behaviors / events.

** If you had the ability to change yourself (whether by magic, technology, medicine, or mundane means like simply getting some accountability, doing some practice, and changing a habit), would you? Excise something purely negative, like procrastination, gluttony, or laziness? Increase something positive, like intelligence, memory, or patience?

Obviously, changing something like Mary does would be more controversial, and if this sort of deeper change were easily available I am sure some people would mess themselves up.

But people mess themselves up and improve themselves all the time, being natural doesn't automatically make it OK and being artificial doesn't make it bad...
