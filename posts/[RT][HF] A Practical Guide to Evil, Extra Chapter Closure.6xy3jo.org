** Bravo üëè

A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.

I was wondering who's Pov we would get but Malicia's was pretty low on my list, and the fact that I absolutely love this one even more that cat's is a pleasant feeling.

** Easily one of the best chapters, if a bonus. I'd love to see more chapters from Malicia's perspective in the future, as well as the rest of the Calamities. It's fun watching Catherine grow into her Name, but there's always something satisfying about watching people with decades of experience in the field use their abilities to the fullest.

** I think Akua has something similar to what the Dead King used to turn his people undead, except on a far smaller scale, confined to one city. A necromantic circle of sorts. It would explain why Akua's soldiers turn undead after being struck down. It also makes me wonder if that was the rune Apprentice saw, not a rune for the flying fortress like it seemed at the start. If so, it could raise some speculation about the Name he would have transited into.

** Fascinating bit of news in there: Malice has 'hooks' into all Legion officers Legate or above.

I'm sure that's going to be an important factor in Book 5 or 6...

*** It's updating frequently enough it's easy to stay on top of the plot. It's also very good and quite long, so it'll take you a while to catch up to it

** If Akua is Malicia's unknowing accomplice and is expected to fail against Catherine (after using whatever WMD she has set up), Malicia clearly has good reason to think Cat wins and is probably trying to ensure it. Its going to more than just faith in Cat's ability.

So do you think that if we keep an eye on whoever plays a pivital role in that victory we might find an overt mole for Malicia among the 15th or maybe an identity of Assassin (who is also possibly Scribe)?

**** Maybe. Assassin is male, but I wouldn't be surprised if one of his aspects is related to disguises.
