*** See [[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%9E-miss-american-pie/][INTERLUDE ×ž: MISS AMERICAN PIE]] for details.

Main point seems to be the chorus:

#+begin_quote
  So bye, bye Miss American Pie\\
  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\\
  Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n' Rye\\
  Singin' this'll be the day that I die\\
  This'll be the day that I die
#+end_quote

From the interlude:

#+begin_quote
  Chevy = tribe\\
  levee = Levi (the priesthood)\\
  good ole boys = the Cometspawn?\\
  whiskey = /uisce beatha/ = water of life
#+end_quote

John says "They drove the comet to the priest, but the priest would come up dry.", which isn't quite Aaron's interpretation. I don't think Chevrolet made a Comet, but Mercury (apparently owned by Ford?) did.

There probably is a justification that Aaron would be able to decipher to fit it to the Comet King thing, but he preferred the Jesus interpretation (which is sort of half-right, if the Comet King is another saviour figure). I, for one, don't really know how to justify it.

**** The words for "tribe", "scepter", and "comet" all sound very similar in Hebrew, so "Chevy" can be used as a stand-in for any of those.

** So, new justifications time!

This justification for who goes to heaven is better but still weak. If a problem is too hard, look for a new solution! Space Elevators! (Watch out for calling it Babel-related, though) Teleportation! Mass spaceship industry! Ask Sohu for something! Put name-factories more everywhere, and hope for the Space-warping, Mass-Enhancing, or Fabricating Names!

I'm sceptical that the capitalist approach could, in the short run at least, match nationalising everything.

**** Wealth has little benefit over nationalization in the short term, as saving souls (including your own) is a pretty strong motivator. Wealth creates no new resources, and no person, no matter how wealthy, could build kaabalistic name factories, spaceships, space elevators, or any other megastructure as well as the full US economy could, given sufficient focus, which Gadriel could apply.

***** I doubt saving others' souls would be much stronger a motivator than saving lives. We don't see people lining up to donate to buy bednets. Saving your own soul is a strong motivator, which is why Celestial Virgin offers to take people to haven. The full US economy would be much weaker if it were communist. I doubt even Gadriel could manage it, but if she can, that's up to her.

****** Companies are inefficient, spending money on boards of directors instead of construction steel. Gadriels's US Nationalised government could in the short term work more efficiently, with more productivity focused toward construction. She is also inspiring, and pulled of the creation of the Untied States, so this may be possible.

** Since Captain Nemo has been speculated in-story to possibly be the Comet King, the Unspoken Plan Guarantee now indicates that Captain Nemo is the only person who can't be the Comet King.

So what about Malia Ngo - could she be the Comet King? Strange magical powers, insists she's one of the good guys, etc etc. Maybe the Other King cursed the Comet King to seem evil, and that's why Ana got a sense of wrongness around her?

[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-2-arise-to-spiritual-strife/][Chapter 2]] has the full poem.

[[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%92-cantors-and-singers/][Cantors and Singers]] has the standard excerpt.

[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-21-thou-also-dwellest-in-eternity/][Chapter 21]] has very similar text to Cantors and Singers.

Ditto [[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%97-war-and-peace/][War and Peace]].

And now this chapter, so 5 times total.

It's definitely a leitmotif at this point.
