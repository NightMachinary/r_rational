** Hahahaha. Cat runs into one of Gods know how many Fairfax kings from so long ago that his successors are near mythical, and his immediate sentiment is that Procer can go eat a whole bag of dicks. Some things never change.

It's been a major sticking point of Cat's character that she doesn't see herself as a legitimate Queen of Callow, just a warlord trying to hold things together until the Kingdom can be rebuilt properly, but goddamn if that conversation didn't make me think of how proud Callowans will be of her in the future. I don't usually get warm fuzzies from this story, but they are appreciated when they come.

** One of the greatest compliments I can give to this series is that whenever I read it, all I can do when I'm done is sit and think. The subject matter is so interesting, the characters so compelling and the plot so gripping that not doing so would feel /wrong/, not considering the implications of what occurred for the story each chapter would feel odd and not giving it the thought it deserves.

** This chapter does a great job of summarizing the underlying tenant of Callowan culture, namely "fuck everyone who's not us".

Seen in that light, the actions of the House of Light make a lot more sense lol.

Fiat justitia, ruat caelum.

A double-edged pigheadedness, that, but very Callowan.

Cat's more pragmatic than that, though. While she won't break, she's willing to bend as far as it takes to secure her core goals, as seen in her negotiations with both the Tower and the Prince.

** A few random theories:

1: I don't think Malicia vs. body double is actually an 'or' question. I think with her powers, either Aspect or magic, she can swap places with her double when she wishes to.

2: I think if/when Cat kills Malicia she is going to reshape Akua into her form, and send her to rule the Wasteland as a biddable puppet. The talk about how the masked guys can be delegated to, and how Malicia doesn't have a huge public presence, is all foreshadowing how this will work.

** It occurs to me that the Dead King /wasn't/ a name until Neshamah pulled it off; there was no pre-existing Role that he stepped into. He forged his own.

I can see Cat doing the same with the Black Queen. It's not an existing name, but I can definitely see it becoming one.

Malicia and Black are close to that, in how solidly they've redefined their Names and Roles, but they still walked into existing stories instead of forging a new one.

It's like their are tiers of names. Instances, Archetypes and Owners. Lone Swordsman (and all the heroes that snuck into Callow only to be seen by the Observatory and offed by Woe) are instances; it's "a" Lone Swordsman.

Ranger is probably the best archetype. It's hard to imagine anyone being more Ranger than this one, but she's not redefining the name like Black and Malicia, who are on the border between archetypical and owner.

Then there's Neshema, and possibly Cat. Names that had not yet existing coming into being solely through impact. He /owns/ Dead King in a way few others own their names, for few others have actually /made/ a Name.

I can totes see Catherine becoming the Black Queen, [carrier of grudges] (among other things).

**** Very much so. And Tyrant is an old name, but the current one /owns/ it.

It still feels like Adjutant and Dead King are in different categories. Maybe it's just scale? Or - Adjutant is an assistive Name, like Black Night. It implies a pairing / team in a way that Dead King and Black Queen just don't.

Grey Pilgrim and Saint of Swords also seem like they might have Made their names, although maybe out of existing ones?

Again, it just feels like there's a categorical difference between Dead King (and where Black Queen could go) and other Names.

***** I think it has to do with the Scale of their powers and the Role that they fit into. Squire is a precursor to Knight, so they will never be as powerful as a Knight as that is their Role. The Dead King came into his Name through an immense consolidation of necromatic power, Adjutant came into his name through tireless and precise work for Cat.

I think that a large part of the power around Names is the Narrative story that is weaved around them. Cat's earlier ability Struggle perfectly exemplifies that. She struggled to gain power, so her power became to struggle. Names get shaped by the story around them, and if the Name is connected to a larger story, a more important role, it will become powerful as well. Additionally if the actions of a Named differ enough from their Name they will eventually transfer into a new name that fits their current Role. There are clear tiers to names. Transitory names that tend to follow a path to the next awakening. e.g. Squire > Black Knight. But I don't think that these are hard-coded tiers of power, but more a natural progression of power in the individual to match the scope of the name. It's not that Squire leads to Black Knight, but that the natural progression of the name of Squire most always leads to Black Knight. We can see this with Masegao turning into the Hierophant, his natural progression differed from the norm, so his progression went a different direction.
