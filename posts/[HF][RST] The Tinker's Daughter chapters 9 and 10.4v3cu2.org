*** Wait for it. :>

There's going to be a complete review of the issues in a bit. For now though, ask yourself this: who's the antagonist?

**** I mean, I know from the author's note that this is going down the Rob = unfriendly AI route, which is an awesome twist. But if I hadn't read that part I would have said that it's probably going to be whoever is behind killing Jess's dad, assuming /that/ wasn't actually Rob. Currently it's largely Protagonist vs. Harsh Environment.

But none of these routes seem like a fundamentally flawed story?

** Be advised that TTD is going in the drawer. Chapter 10 is the first of three 'closure' posts. The first one (this one) will cover the backstory of the world, the second will cover the rest of the story, and the third one will be a postmortem of the writing process and what went wrong.

*** well shit, this was one of maybe three ongoing stories that I actually looked forward to without the slightest drop of "meh, it's /mostly/ okay."

I didn't see the plot twist coming, but god damn you just made a singularity when Rob became able to upgrade his own intelligence just now. I'm not completely floored, looking back, but that's just hindsight bias.

Oh well. I look forward to the lore pieces.

** Inspiration! Hat tip to [[/u/whywhisperwhy][u/whywhisperwhy]].

What if, every week, you published a small piece of oral lore like that which you posted in Chapter 10? You can focus on the main story until it's a completed book, you're still providing content to non-patrons, and patrons can get a look behind the scenes on what troubled you that week, or things you're working on, journal-style. At the end of the process, you have a completed short story or short story anthology perhaps a la /Tales of Beedle the Bard/ set in the world of the book you also just finished! Since you've set your patreon to monthly payments, you don't have to answer to your patrons about the change in the production process. You can apply this to your next work, as well - no reason to limit the idea to the tale of the tinkering one's female child if she's not doing it for you anymore.

What a wonderful idea! I'm smiling. Are you? Because I feel very good about this. You should too. Ready? One... two... three...:

*Yay!*

*** I do wonder whether he should change the Patreon charging from per-month to per-chapter, as that could perhaps provide more incentive to write more and better?

**** That isn't how Patreon works, actually. The options are "per month" and "per creation", but nothing says that the creations have to be part of one larger work. Were I to change from salary to piece work I could quite reasonably post a separate short story every time.

*** The issue isn't that I'm short on ideas, it's that TTTD is a flawed product. I could grind out another 60-100k words to get to the end, then rewrite the entire thing to turn it into something publishable, all while also producing new content too...or I could just shift to producing new content and learn from the mistakes I made here.

I might post short stories from the setting in the future, though. There's a huge amount of worldbuilding that I never got to use, so I have no shortage of possibilities for subject matter.

**** I was rather suggesting a way you might get more enjoyment out of the writing process, share your worldbuilding in a fun way as a change of pace, create a habit of regular reflection and implied solicitation of feedback, and on net receive more feedback from those following your work. I just used Tinker's Daughter as an example.

** I really liked the story but reading the twist explained plainly in chapter 10 was just horrible and disappointing that it had to be revealed like this.

Also I'm double disappointed because rob was awesome, I hope the explanation for his complex motivations is at least satisfying
