A school bus full of people gets thrown into a world that's become corrupted and changed due to the presence of the bioengineered superpowered female creatures that were let loose upon the world hundreds of years prior.

Character development being the main focus, the story follows one of the teachers, Rick (second-person narrative) as he is forced to take his world views and put them up against the new reality.

Overall, the protagonist is confronted by being a de-facto leader of some of the survivors, having to deal with the issues this brings as well as those that come from adjusting to the new society. And though the story is somewhat of a slow burn, Rick slowly but surely has to apply himself more and more to solve those problems that come his way (and the consequences of his actions).

*Warning tags*: Violence, Sex, Harem, Monstergirls.

*Genre tags*: Munchkinism with a growing touch of Transhumanism.

*Genre tag warning*: The story is a slow burn. Rick is no world-renowned genius nor does he have any sort of superpowers, so it takes him a slow but steady increase on the options available before he can start getting the ball rolling. (Munchkinism is secondary to Character Interaction, and Transhumanism is tertiary)

â€‹

Why I'm posting this in [[/r/rational][r/rational]]: Rick is, at the end of the day, presented a seemingly very simple problem he needs to solve. The superpowered monstergirls that could kill him are also the best option available to protect him and those around him.

It is a puzzle within social dynamics that starts simple but slowly ramps up in difficulty. Each character that comes in contact with him has their own desires, goals, preferences, and preconceptions. And the fact that Rick himself also has his own shortcomings makes things all the harder to resolve as he adapts to the new culture/rules.

Added to this conundrum is that he has to not just keep sight of the growing web of interactions but also of each of the abilities that are brought to the table (though this doesn't start coming to light until much later in the story).

The overall character arc Rick goes through begins with him having little say or control, but one inch at a time he gains that control and ability to act.


** Finished chapter one on my third try.

This is kind of a mess. I see what you're trying to do, but it's a mess. The perspectives are not clear. The action feels a bit choppy. I'm not sure how the two girls at the... trial?... are supposed to be characterized, because it's not clear which one is doing what.

It's not /bad/, exactly, it just needs kind of a lot of polish.

*** I had added that first piece into the first chapter because the survival part of the story would leave enough of an impression that when things change gear due to reaching civilizations many readers appeared to not take things all that well.

I'm definitely trying to figure out some alternate thing/way to put it down without bogging everything or doing too heavy a spoiler of what happens further down the line. It certainly looks like making it as a very short piece backfired though.

The second part (the one with the student) is one I've been wanting to keep but that I might have to remove entirely in favour of keeping it all within Rick's perspective.

Thanks a bunch for the comment!

I would not recommend doing that. It can work, but the times I've actually seen it work are very, very rare, compared to how often I see it attempted. Heck, I can probably count the number of /any/ sort of flash forward that I enjoyed at the start of a story on one hand (I will always <3 the /Firefly/ episode "Trash," though, which pulled the flash forward off exquisitely).

If you want to have a radical gear change in the story you're telling without losing people, I can think of two ways to make it work.

The first way is to tell one complete story in one gear, and then tell another in a different gear. For instance, the first Captain America movie is a WWII war story (with superheroes) and the second is a modern spy thriller (with superheroes). Telling them as one story wouldn't work, but by giving each story its own beginning, middle, and end, and then framing one as a sequel to the other, the two can exist as very different stories within a single continuity.

Another option would be to intercut between the two stories. A very good example of this is Game of Thrones, which is a political story intercut with action-adventure and zombie apocalypse. And, for the most part, it works, and that's because Jon and the zombie story, and Dany and the adventure story, are kept in the readers' minds while the politics plays out; the narrative keeps cutting back to them. If you establish the survival genre as an integral part of the story early, there won't be any shock when it becomes more prominent. The caveat here is that whatever genre the first part of the story is, you'll probably want to maintain it somewhat, basically reversing the intercut, so that your don't lose the readers who were interested in that part of the story.

The simplest option, of course, is that if you want to tell a survival story, but you feel that there's too much shock switching to that after the set-up, *cut out most of the set-up*. Leave enough so that we have a good taste of what the protagonist's status quo was before the events of the story disrupted it, and then have the story grab them by the collar and drag them into full survival mode. Then you don't have that radical gear-change (or rather, you do, but it's right at the beginning, so the reader is pulled right along). My omnibus copy of the epic fantasy series /The Belgariad/ is 1,375 pages long, and the protagonist is forced to start his adventure on about page 60. Because it's not a story about a farm.

What all of these have in common is that they don't set a false expectation in the mind of the reader. Trying to fix that by shoehorning a later part of the story into the beginning usually causes exactly the same problem, adding a /second/ gear change, and leaving the reader even /more/ confused about what kind of story they're reading.

***** What you said at the end reminds me of Scrapped Princess. It was a cool concept, and I've even considered doing the same thing if I were to write something, but fact is I felt annoyed that I thought I was watching a fantasy adventure series when it turned out to be sci-fi. If I knew beforehand I would've been ok with it. One of the few occasions I'd be kinda ok with a spoiler. I remember reading similar complaints about that alien invasion series that ends the first book with vampires coming out to save humanity out of nowhere. Cool concept, cool twist, but you don't expect vampires in your realistic alien invasion story so it feels kind of unfair.

**** +1 for me absolutely hating flash-forwards of any kind; either I try forget about it, tell myself its not cannon or it ruins the whole rest of the story because I feel like I'm not progressing because I've already seen what happens after all this.

The flash-forward of Purple Days stopped me being able to get enough interest to read the rest for years, and probably is the main reason why I've dropped it atm (it being absolutely brilliant otherwise IMO).

I'd recommend either 1. Putting it in a skippable prologue (and saying its skippable) which I almost always skip the prologue from Isekai's anyway.

or 2. remove it and just mention in your description that you get to civilization fast and it stops being a survival.^can't see how a flash forward is better than this in any way.

Personally I can't stand it as I said, it turns me off the rest of the story, its worse than spoilers for some reason.

** At the very least, thank you for a good opening post. You've got the summary, tags, genre, and links laid out nicely. You also did a good job explaining why you think it'd be a good fit here too, which is much appreciated. As self-promotions go, this one was done fairly pretty well!

For anyone else wondering, there are currently 69 chapters out right now -- so presumably enough content to keep a person occupied for a while. (I personally don't start series with less than 30-40 chapters at this point since low chapter series are likely to be abandoned. Also it's painful to get into reading a thing and be stopped by low chapter count early on.)

*** Thanks!

I am currently trying to figure out a way to make a living out of writing, the nice people over at royalroad/scribblehub/fiction.live helped me enough to be able to cover for my basic expenses.

So I'm currently keeping a relative posting rhythm of about 4-5 chapters per week over at RoyalRoad. The current total wordcount is at shyly above 200K words.

All this writing has helped me realize there's a LOT of things I need to get better at, so I find that having more perspectives (even if not positive ones) helps me find out where I can put more effort into!

***** I hunted down writers who were building up support through Patreon and taking a good long look at what they were doing (even subbing to several to have a closer check). I also contacted those I could to ask about the whole thing.

[[https://www.patreon.com/ravStories][This is mine currently]], I'm barely scraping by right now, but I have hopes it'll keep rising towards a level where I can actually survive on it and keep going forward. It took me around 7 months to reach the current level.

How much work? A lot (I'm currently outputting something like 3-5K words a day on average and working about 5-6 hours a day).

At the end of the day the more work per day you dedicate to it the faster it will grow. You're going to want to start hard, generate as much content as you can as quickly as you can nearing the start of things. You're going to want to have an explosive beginning because many algorithms will favour your high output and bump you.

If you don't, you're better off keeping the content at a slow steady stream for a long while before you jump in to go explosive.

Either way, you should always make sure to adapt the format/presentation of your content to the websites you're aiming at. A bit of a chore, but it helps to know what gets bumped around where (also try to aim to have your content in as many places as possible at least at first, until you've properly trimmed down which sites react best to your work and which don't).

Regardless of what strategy you use, you need to keep the focus on A) What you're providing for free, and B) What you're providing at a cost.

Free content is always going to be your primary source of advertisement to draw in people. Some people like to put premium content and then trickle it out to the freemium public after a while, others lock certain content and never let it go, others just write everything for free and use Patreon more as an alternate income to whatever projects they're developing that earns them the main cash.

Past all this, patience. Loooots of patience, loooots of "I did everything I could and nothing seems to have happened" day in and day out over and over and over until you eventually start building inertia (and that inertia being slow to boot). So patience, resilience, and if possible a positive attitude and honesty with the people who're opting to support you.

The alternative to this is selling books and boy that's a completely different beast on its own.

PS, watch [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3g-w83Cb5pEAu5UmRrge-A][Brandon Sanderson]]'s lectures over at youtube, they're a god-send. Oh, and if you can, always try to give a professional look to what you do. It can help a lot.

** Just binged. Is this a subgenre that I was happily unaware of? First the Erogamer, and now this? Is there going to be a recurring pattern of "Good world building + smut + unaware / isekai-d protagonist + convoluted justification for getting laid => profit"??? Like, good for you @author, exploration of unexplored narrative tracks is great, and this is good/fun quality writing, but I wonder at whether the entire /rationalizing/ train is so overwrought that, compared to the uninspired norm, diving into sexual dynamics is now legitimately a decent track to follow.

I just sort of feel like we are scraping the bottom of the /X + Rational = Novel Story Idea/ barrel when one of the better and more interesting new stories I've seen in a while on this sub is r!Furries / r!PokemonSmut.

*** I enjoy checking and testing and writing bout interesting personalities, one of my favorite genres is mind control in fact. And the aspect of human attraction/sexuality and behaviour around it is a rather fascinating thing that, to me, is rarely ever put to the test.

I feel that one of the reasons why the story/setting I'm writing on is fascinating to me is because it does that testing. The Monstergirls are, at the end of the day, Human+, and that "+" is what drives that test to its logical conclussion.

What happens when instinct meets rationality? Where is the edge between the two? What behaviors are sought out of desire? What aspects of your attraction to someone else is brought about by your genes? By the environment you grew up in? By your own decisions and rationality? How far can you be pushed outside the conceptual space you grew up in?

The setting as a whole is an incredibly fun playground for these considerations. Ferals are literally creatures that have grown up and only ever been guided by their instincts. What happens when they gain rationality? How far can they change?

To say nothing that the Monstergirls themselves, even when tamed, exist within a bubble of pressures that humans rarely go through. What happens to your sexual tastes and desires when they move from a reward to a need? What happens when you are constantly forced to engage in sex out of a basic urge no different to hunger? What happens when there is a literal psychic bond that nudges you to actually enjoy it with a specific individual you happen to be with right now above anyone else?

It's incredibly fun to chew on the perspectives and run them through the wringer tbh. I'm not sure why [[/r/rational][r/rational]] might feel stagnant to you, but I am sure why I love the shit out of writing r!Furries/r!PokemonSmut when it comes to characterization.

*** This is a complete 2.0 of the original quest, I had originally been aiming at a repost but after a while I went "fuck it, I can do better than this" and went all in.

Though I intend to keep the story beats relatively the same, the bigger differences (in characterization/plot/interactions) with the original start to emerge shortly after reaching civilization.

The biggest first hit to the original story is the Kiara/Tomas aspect, getting a decent re-contextualization I'm much happier with (also lots of new things being dumped into the story that didn't show up in the quest, such as everything in the time skip meeting Kiara and finding Eva).

** I'd like the opinion of the sub + author on this;

A long time ago, I've read some other stories set in this universe and one thing that I never really understood was what seemed to be a punishment fetish that pretty much all these stories had.What I mean by that, is where a character does something bad, and is punished, but crucially; said character is extremely remorseful and regrets their action (not just the consequences but the actual original action) and apologies profusely. (Note, in this story it would be what occurs with Diane? I think that was her name).

What kind of rubs me the wrong way here; is to me, punishment is completely inappropriate in this sort of situation. In a situation where an individual does a bad action, and after being informed of all the facts (including how they made others feel etc) regrets that action, punishing said person does *nothing*. Not only is it not fair (they didn't know better) but I would say it achieves nothing (other than maybe nock-on effects such as it being an example to others, but on all these cases this isn't really so). The individual would not do the action again anyway, and all it does it hurt them emotionally.

I don't know, it may be that I am just really adverse to punishment in general, but I never understood how someone could live with that I guess.

*** Author's opinion on the matter (spoilers ahead).

â€‹

/First, an explanation of the event/circumstances/consequences in question/.

Diane has the power to fleshcraft, she can, effectively, alter how someone's body behaves. The power only allows her to do this in small ways, but ways that can build over time. This power does not come with a safety net, if she doesn't know what she's doing she can seriously fuck someone up (example, causing a hormonal imbalance and suddenly their brain starts pumping serotonin at max capacity).

What she had done had been to use her powers on Rick (protagonist) without his knowledge or consent on the matter (in an attempt to slowly improve him over time).

Rick found out about it and got very pissed. His punishment to her had been, effectively, for her to write down "I will ask first" a bunch of times (a punishment that might as well be a token one in the setting where slavery is a thing).

â€‹

/The complication/: Rick trusted Diane and thought of her in a slowly but surely growing romantic way. Her actions caused a loss of trust that was highly impactful to Rick. It made him mentally recontextualize his interactions with the harem as a whole but Diane specifically, and it opened the doors to the problems that he had been keeping buried (some minor trauma from the events at the start of the story for the most part).

This was, basically, a consequence of Diane's actions and Rick finding out.

That is the core of the problem here, because to Diane, Rick's loss of affection/romance towards her was part of the punishment, but to Rick it was a natural consequence due to the loss of trust.

â€‹

/The change/: Rick (in the following chapters) has to adapt himself because it becomes clear that Diane did not take things the way he had intended, and in his distancing from her he began neglecting his implied duties as the master in the relationship.

And at the same time, Diane has to come to the realization that his distance had not been punishment for her actions but rather a normal response.

â€‹

/The resolution/: A re-development of the previously lost trust and an adaptation of their relationship to having found out more about one another.

------

â€‹

Now, addressing the "punishment" situation. I personally see punishment as something that in a certain regard has a necessity to it. Just because the thief repents for what they did does not mean there should not be a consequence of the action. Should the consequence be lessened due to repentence? I certainly believe so, enough that if it's "light" enough it could even remove the punishment entirely.

And past that, the second issue is that the "punishment" is also an action to put down a weight to the non-desired behaviour that took place. This "Action -> Consequence" is, at the end of the day, the core of how everyone learns. Though there's arguments over how exactly these imposed consequences should pan out, I do think that the fact that there ARE consequences is in of itself an attempt to correct the negative behaviour.

Past that, my personal belief tends to be that Rick's behaviour was not that of a paragon of how this should be carried out but as someone who doesn't know better and is learning the ropes.

** Might try reading this later. But that summary reminds me a bit of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fear-surprise-and-ruthless-efficiency-monster-girl-encyclopedia-si-oc-undergoing-repairs.748180/][this fic]], where you try and take on the actual ramifications of a shitty smut world.

It's a bit hard to navigate these types of worlds. On one hand, copious mind control. On the other hand, transhumanism is morally neutral. On one hand, you don't want to go pure reactionary puritan and say anything of any sexual nature is evil. But it's a bit rough to navigate sexual positivity in a rape world.

So I'll probably give this a shot later. Hopefully it goes in a good direction. That said, still might not be my thing, regardless.
