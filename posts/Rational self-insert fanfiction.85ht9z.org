** Probably best to look on forums like SB and SV. Here's two:

*With This Ring* is probably the closest fit: it has a somewhat rational SI who transmigrates to the DC universe, but he loses his memories of the future for the particular universe he ends up in. He does keep memories of what happens in alternate DC universes and extrapolates from there, but it isn't technically "future knowledge". (Updates DAILY!)

*Cruel to be Kind* is another, but here the SI gains the power to transmigrate to and from different fictional worlds, and so isn't forced to stick around for the conflicts or play by their universe rules. For example, he can grab high tech spaceships from Star Wars and use them to fight Kromagg aliens from Sliders. He ultimately picks a normal universe with an unpopulated Earth and builds an empire there, only going to other story universes for trade and war. (Abandoned, I think. Still, 600+ chapters before that happens.)

*** Thanks! With this ring looks like it up my alley. I'll check it out. I really dont want to invest reading 600 chapters only to be blue balled into wanting more. Is there a chance that the author of cruel to be kind will come back?

The author's profile says "All writing on indefinite hiatus due to serious IRL health concerns and other issues." So probably not.

**** With this ring updates daily at around midnight Pacific time. Usually a bit before that. Been reading for over a year now. Oh shit. I think it's been over two

**** Yes. Fighting against the Kromaggs from Sliders is one of the longest arcs in Cruel to be Kind.

** *Worth the Candle* on AO3 is the first one that comes to mind, where a teenager from Kansas is transported to an amalgamation of narrative fantasy worlds in a tabletop style. It's one I got into recently, and is very highly followed on this site. Updates fairly frequently.

*Marked for Death* is a Naruto quest on SV, where the participating posters create plans of action to guide a custom character and his team through the world. Less of a straight story, since it uses a variety of tabletop mechanics. Was paused for a little while due to a system transition, but I think it's back on now. Updates at least once a week.

*Sleeping with the Girls* is on FFnet, which follows an average Joe through several different anime universes, and almost getting killed several times in the process. Slowed down in recent years, but still gets some sporadic updates.

*** Worth the Candle and marked for death is not really a self insert fanfiction since the former is an original work and the ladder MC is playing a character of the naruto universe. But I will check out sleeping with the girls!

** In addition to "With this Ring" let me recommend [[https://www.google.ee/url?q=https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality][Sleeping with Girls]] about rational anime worlds jumper.

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/one-foot-another-multiverse-si.11946/][One Foot- Another Multiverse SI]] is the story of Poe Acti. The protagonist knows about the characters and events, unfortunately settings are warped, fused together, or otherwise mingling in ways that present terrifying threats. His rationality waxes and wanes so I'll compare this to the anime Re:Zero so you know what to expect. I don't feel the slightest regret from following this story for years. Honestly one of my first fanfics.

Almost one year old is this slow-moving story called [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sleight-advantage-naruto-reincarnation-si.37698/][Sleight Advantage]]. In some ways this character ends up divorcing themselves from their previous self.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132119/1/Reiteration][Reiteration]] is a possibly dead RWBY fanfic. This one doesn't have any knowledge of the setting.
