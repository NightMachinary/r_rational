*** As a point of pedantry:

"Will not be completed" is overstating what the author has said. It's been "permanently discontinued as a webcomic," which does leave open the possibility of it being revived and completed as a print comic, or as something else.

** /Erfworld/ is the story of Parson Gotti, a typical loser protagonist with a dead-end job and a dump of a home who is obsessed with tabletop wargames. One day he gets isekai'd to Erfworld by Wanda Firebaugh, a spellcaster in the city of Gobwin Knob, as a last resort attempt to stave off defeat at the hands of the Royal Crown Coalition. Luckily for Parson, it turns out that the physics of Erfworld run like a tabletop wargame, so his expertise is exactly what is needed. /Unluckily/ for Parson, he has never played this particular system before, and the coalition's armies outnumber Gobwin Knob's 25 to 1. Now he must quickly learn the rules and find as many exploits as he can if he is to have any chance of fulfilling his role as the perfect warlord.

/Erfworld/ was been brough up on LessWrong twice. Eliezer Yudkowsky read it after hearing it compared to /HPMoR/ and declared that, while not exactly rationalist ficiton, /Erfworld/ was Munchkin fiction, which is close enough that I think deserves to be posted. Unfortunately, as discussed in those links, /Erfworld/ jumps the shark /hard/ after the first volume. Hence why the title only refers to part 1; that's the only part I'm recommending. In fact, I'd avise against even reading the epilogue to book 1; [[http://web.archive.org/web/20190720093819/http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf.html][the comic's original run]] on /Giant in the Playground/ ended with Parson throwing the sword into the volcano after declaring his intent to be a player, and I think that's the perfect place to finish things. Just let it end on a high note.

Books two and up have a lot of play and counter-play, but it's never clear that any of it means anything or is actually working towards anything. There are so many moving parts that there aren't 'big moments' anymore so much as just the resolution to whatever the current crisis is.

***** There are lots of small and medium sized problems as the story moves on. But there were two parts that seemed like big problems to me. One problem with is that Parson becomes increasingly aware of the atrocity of war, but his motivation is not explored after that. He embarks on a campaign that destroys entire kingdoms, and brings them back mind-controlled. And his motivations and doubts are never really explored. He destroys the sword, and then acts exactly as he would if the sword were still around. We don't really see the main antagonist's motivations either, and we really need to even if Parson doesn't.

​

The other is that entire arcs seem superfluous. The Olive Branch story, the Transylvito Arc, and the latest stories just don't seem necessary. I really enjoyed the one with the Hippiemancer talking about language, but as an editor I would cut the lot and tell him to publish supplemental materials later.

Fate shenanigans and mechanics that were kept obscure from the readers resulted in a series of deus ex machina plot developments. The story became increasingly frustrating to read, especially as additional characters and settings were introduced without original plotlines being resolved.

******* There's nothing wrong with criticism of a story's flaws, the problem here is in the delivery. "The art is awful" is low value criticism delivered without much apparent thought or insight. It /barely/ informs the reader whether or not they'll think likewise, and it certainly wouldn't be constructive to the person who did the drawing. Similarly, the tone isn't what I want from negative criticism.

Some of /my/ takeaway from that meta thread:

#+begin_quote
  Maybe this post could be described as, "criticism tends to skew negative so try to adopt a moderate positivity bias to counteract that when writing critique"? Good negative criticism is important, especially to newer authors but framing the delivery can make a huge difference.

Would you also ask someone to tone it down if they said "The art is great". Because that is exactly as valuable and contains exactly as much apparent thought or insight.

I'd argue that while remarks like these (positive or negative) would be even more valuable if they went into greater depth, they are still valuable as-is. They still help me form an opinion about a story.

There's strength is numbers too. If everybody had to write at least 10 pages of detailed analysis before being allowed to post an opinion, the numbers of opinions we'd see would be extremely limited.

In other words: While the value of such criticisms may be low, it is still positive. While it is good to encourage more detailed criticisms, simply asking people to stop altogether doesn't increase utility, it decreases it.

It won't be the case for this particular story, but authors definitely do read whatever is posted here about their stories, sometimes because it's mentioned in a comment, sometimes because they track back a spike in traffic, and sometimes because they posted the story themselves. I think a general principle should be that you should speak about /anyone's/ work as though they were a real person on the other end of a keyboard somewhere in the world. You don't need to not say negative things, but if you're going to say negative things, then you should try to be kind about it.

So yes, I hold negative criticism to a slightly higher standard. I probably wouldn't have mentioned anything here given the above comment, but it strikes me as the unpleasant, needless negativity that I would rather not have in the community, especially when set beside similar comments that don't have the same stink.

If a potential author is going to be hurt by a innocuous commentary such as 'The art sucks' or 'The art is awful' I suggest he steps outside of any place which could criticize his work.

People don't deserve to have their feelings 'respected' to this ludricrous extent. How should he have phrased it, pray tell:

'The artist tried really hard, and he is a good person, but the art was shy of my unrealistic expectations.'? 'He accomplished something, and that's better than doing nothing, but alas, the art is awful'?

Besides, the authors need to learn to separate criticism of their work and criticism of themselves.

I'm sure Brandon Sanderson is a swell guy, and has a great work ethic - But his books are just terrible. His worlds are inconsistent, his protagonists, in anime fashion, make other team members redundant, and people who praise him for 'internally consistent magic' ignore the asspull magic powers that save his MC's ass as the plot requires.

Did I hurt his feelings? Or did I gave a unfavorable opinion on his work? Should I have cushioned my criticism in faint praise as in - 'Man, he would make a great D&D dm, for all the morality in his world, despite all it's differences, still maintains a close resemblance to ours so you could play around in it, and not worry about the icky parts of social dynamics he ignores?'

** As OP mentions, there were a lot of changes in direction, tone and focus after Book I. While I still enjoyed Book II, my interest in Erfworld overall faded with time.

I kind of understand why this all happened. I think the intent was always that the main story-line of Parson Gotti was intended to be a comic. With the loss of the original (super talented!) artist and trouble recruiting another, it became hard to continue. So the author instead turned to some of the other characters, filling in their backstory (hinted at in the original storyline) to try to keep the content production going, and giving the fans a reason to stay interested (and keep subscriptions going).
