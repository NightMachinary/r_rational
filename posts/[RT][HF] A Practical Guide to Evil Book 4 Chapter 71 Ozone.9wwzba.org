** More death flags, talking about how wide the world is and how much of it is still left for them to see and experience. RIP Archer...

Part of me is wondering if Cat isn't setting Archer up, narratively, for some heroic sacrifice story in order to help her take down Sve Noc. Revenge for a fallen friend/lover who died to save her life has a lot of weight to it.

Cat might not even be aware that she's doing it, either, and it's just some unconscious instinct of hers kicking in. Now that would truly be a "guide to evil".

*** Archer is the only one who hasn't bled. She's just been more or less successful or and done every task like it's a big joke.

Hakram lost a hand and gambled away the other one. Masego went blind. Viv burnt herself on the actual sun and she's not even combaty. We're being set up for an archer injury that gives her a flair and a serious tone and maybe a reason to hang around.

My prediction is an injury, a line or two about needing Zeze, realising she isn't Ranger and a cool power up from it all (Night related?)

All the drow so far are lords, titling archer above them and putting her in charge of them could be interesting. Archer does have some experience with the whole "power is everything" mindset, so its not even that terrible a decision.

** With the tale of the Two-headed ogre, the three knights, and Elizabeth Alban:

*What will Cat do?*

*Will she attempt to be Strong?* That was shown to be a dead end vs Mighty Urulan.

*Will she attempt to be Quick?* Unlikely, because the Drow and the Night are plentiful in the Everdark.

*Will she attempt to be Clever like the surviving Knight?* How clever? Sve Noc seems to be of two minds; "the rider and the horse"...the domain of night and the priestess herself wielding that power.

If drow culture is any reflection of the "madness" night inflicts upon those who wield its power, then the "rider", i.e. the rider may be quite mad.

Cat has attempted to resist the maddening influence of winter by using her domain carefully...

*Will she attempt to be Badass like Elizabeth Alban?*

While the end result of the conflict and the retelling will inevitably lead to this conclusion, the conflict itself and any plan she forges will not be as simple as "be badass"...

Still sad Indrani is seemingly going to die. I like her.

What is actually happening with Black right now? The suspence is painful!

What is the game cat is playing? Sve seems to believe she can break the oaths of winter, and cat doesnt seem to care. So why bother putting together this army knowing it is going to splinter when it matters?

Also, nice to know cat's Name is still hanging out under there somewhere. Will be interesting seeing how the Blacknight Name reacts with Winter when the succession comes into play. I hope she ends up with a new Name though. It would be really neat to see the genesis of a Name.

**** So Cat has partaken in the truth "I do not Kneel" which is basically Black's Arc Words.

While her own words are different (Justifications matter only to the just), the basic intent of defiance against rules and expectations imposed from outside remains the same.

I'm actually very interested in how this conflict goes - While Cat has habitually fought against enemies stronger than her and won mostly via narrative aptitude rather than mere strength, she doesn't quite "identify" with her domain & mantle - while she /IS/ the Queen of Winter, she doesn't embrace her domain, but shunts off its influence and wields it in a very controlled / simplistic manner. She obviously is planning to abdicate as Queen(of Winter!) and utilize the domain of Winter itself, alongside the title of "Sovereign of Moonless Nights" via the oaths & drow to create a permanent nation of enforcers of the Liesse Accords; POWER, lots of it (both from Night & Winter), chained to PURPOSE(=enforcing the Liesse Accords), and transferred to those who uphold that purpose. Cat views herself as replacable and actively prepares to "pass on the mantle" while pursueing her goals with iron determination...but she considers even her mighty domain and all her successes so far as tools and means, not as something to clutch and fear losing.

With the Dead King introducing Cat to the Game of the Gods, she will likely sooner or later plan to play on THAT stage, rising way beyond the petty hero vs villain squabbles encouraged by the Gods Above & Below.

Her victory over the Fae exemplifies this: She took a third option, sidestepping the enmity of Summer & Winter, ignoring their laws and customs, and defeated/recreated both by marrying the courts and inheriting half of their old power.

The Hierarch showed that it is possible for someone to be "Neutral" in defiance of the Gods above & below and even bench someone as ancient and powerful as the Bard; I suspect Cat will manage to "solve" the Hero/Villain conflict on Calernia via the Liesse Accords, by enforcing standards of decent behaviour to both sides (no demons/angels summoned, no plagues/miracles of mass destruction, limited collateral damage, etc...).

I truly wonder of the scope of conflict and challenge that will arise from Cat challenging the very "Rules of the Game" in open defiance of the Gods.

** So we started off with Sve-as-Black poking holes in Cat's plan. Apparently Cat thinks that the Drow can't get loose because the Heavens wouldn't want to deal with Drow. Which I sort of get - the Drow are bad news - but half the point of Heroes, and Black/Cat's problems with them, is that it doesn't matter how unbeatable your army, how powerful your artifact is, what dread sorcereries you wield, or what terrible demons you've summoned - the heroes are still going to show up and deal with these things. But apparently you can have an army of terrible monsters, magically enslaved against their will, whose thematics are about as dark and Evil as you get, and you can avoid repercussions by... having them be an undefeatable horde of darkness? Because the Heavens apparently shy away from a challenge?

Personally I think it undercuts the unfairness of the Heavens if the way to solve having a big obvious flaw in your dread army.... is simply to make it a bigger and stronger army.

But the really weird thing here to me is the treatment of terrible things happening when you beat villains being a deterrent against beating villains: terrible things happening when a villain loses is built right into the premise of villains losing. Praes has made a habit of unleashing terrible doomsday weapons and demons when they lose. Calernia is still dealing with some of the fallout from Triumphant losing. There was a whole big deal made about how heroes win, and how villains curse them with their dying breath. This is all just part of the game.

Leaning into Classic stories shouldn't be a path to victory here. Hopefully Cat does something clever to justify this working beyond crossing her fingers and hoping the Heavens don't blink. Reinforcing the measures controlling the Drow, maybe, so that everything isn't instantly FUBAR if something happens to the oaths. Or a clever subversion of the story she's currently barrelling straight down.

There were also questions raised here about where the Drow would be put. We know from earlier chapters that Cat has a plan, and I'm quite curious about it. Callow's not in great shape at the moment, having trouble feeding itself let alone an extra army, and there are obvious issues with integrating the Drow literally anywhere. Should be interesting to see.

We also learnt about Sve and why she's called a "two-faced goddess". I wonder if Ivah knew about this / why it didn't mention it - it's not hard to work out if you have any interaction whatsoever with Sve (not that Ivah would ever have been anywhere /near/ Sve, but it was high up in a major inner ring sigil, and the two-faced-Sve-thing doesn't seem very well hidden). But yeah, there are obviously questions being raised about the various motives and schemes of Sve Noc(s).

We saw what happened to Cat during the Kaleidoscope arc, which I'd essentially forgotten was still an open question at this point.

There was a bit more of the new Cat-Archer relationship, which is going to be a continuing thing.There wa also a mention of Killian, who hasn't really been mentioned in this book at all up till now.

Not really any progress was made on the front of the Drow-city that is three times the size of Lotow, filled with two hundred "Night-powered Ranger equivalents" and about to go to Cat with Sve looming in the background. I'm not sure if Cats not thinking about it because she's just that confident or has everything completely compartmentalised or what.

There was also talk about stories that might be in play, which gives a model to compare things to. That is very nice to have. Although if Cat's plan is to murder the proverbial ogre, uh, I'd have to recommend attempting the clever knight's strategy instead. Also, I still really want to know about what Drow stories might be in effect - we just recently had an object lesson in the dangers of wandering into another culture with an unfamiliar literary landscape.

** If you're a magic-wielding drow priestess who can invade dreams and crush minds, it's understandable you'd try to trick Cat into spilling her plans. But obviously said priestess was not prepared for Winter, whose mantle is always around Cat even when Cat herself is deep within the mantle of the Everdark.

But what doesn't make sense (to me, at least) is why you wouldn't work your mind mojo on Archer. Archer's strong, quick, and clever... and entirely unmagical and without any affiliation to Winter. Were I the pinnacle of the drow, a culture known for their cunning and power, I would definitely have worked some kind of craft on Archer. She's Cat's friend (and now lover), the second or third most powerful person in Cat's army, and is seemingly the only one in the upper echelon who could be attacked successfully in this manner. All the Mighty (and Ubua) are part of Winter and Cat's mantle. But Archer? She's been under the mantle of the Everdark ever since she first stepped foot inside, and she has no Winter mantle to protect her.

The question for me isn't "will Archer be killed" it's "why hasn't she been neutralized already?" Really, it would make sense for it to have already happened, no? And if she's become a Manchurian candidate, when did it happen and were there any signs of it until now?

*** I think that Archer is probably untouchable to Sve Noc in this way.

Remember, Cat's first glimpse of Sve Noc was through a blob of Night that Cat was manipulating with Winter. Now, Sve Noc invades Cat's dreams, after significant amounts of Night have been tied up with Winter through the oaths and little bits of Winter Cat has been binding the Drow with.

Basically, I think there is some interaction happening between Winter and the Night that allowed Sve Noc to invade Cat's mind/dreams, and Archer's only tie to Winter is being Cat's ally, so Sve Noc can't pull the same trick with Archer.

VERY good points, and I think you do a good job explaining why Archer wouldn't be touched.

But alternatively... wouldn't the Mighty (both Winter and not) be especially vulnerable to this kind of attack by Sve Noc, then? Cat was able to fight her/them off, but would a Mighty titled with a low nobility have the same ability to do so? They might not have any useful information, but they could still be Manchurian candidates. Even if all that's accomplished is that the Mighty are instantly killed by their oaths... that still wipes out Cat's entire host of Winter Mighty.

Yeah, I think they definitely would be. Frankly, I'd be surprised if Sve Noc /didn't/ pull some Night shenanigans to cripple Cat's army. And I think your idea would be a pretty clever way for Sve Noc to wipe out a significant portion of Cat's Mighty, or, if she's lucky, get some Fae-titled Mighty of her own.

***** Given how Ivah heard only laughter when he tried to ask Sve Noc for advice, it might be that actual presence of Night in the recipient of a vision either allows more control for godess half of her, or at least makes it aware of the contact. Cat might have been the priestess' only chance to pull sonething off behind her divine half's back (figuratively or literally, depending on how you look at it).

My take on it is that the Sve Catherine has just talked to is either an unfortunate vessel or more mortal and concerned for her people version of the two, while the one spreading the Night is a dominant personality. The failure of Everdark as a society and some inconsistent or weird details may be the result of the struggle between the two (for example, the Gloom may have been an early Night containment measure installed by the priestess back when she had more influence, one that the godess managed to only partially circumvent with the feathers).

Um. Archer is Named. She can't throw around Light or shadows or fireballs, but she has power. She can defy enemies that would crush mortals and cut through sorcery.

She isn't flashy like Masego or Catherine, but her power is probably similar to Ranger and Saint of Swords back when they were younger. Like them her Name is does most of its work internally, strengthening her body and mind. We can see the pinnacle of that in the Saint, whose soul is literally a sword.

Now, if something as powerful as the Sve Noc put her all into attacking Archer's mind, she'd win. But in that moment she'd be vulnerable to counterattack by Catherine. Not to mention she probably couldn't just attack Archer's mind out of nowhere. She'd need an attack vector, some point of contact between them.
