** This one took a bit longer - I've been busy with work/life this week, as I had to give a talk, finish submitting a paper and stuff. Hopefully I'll manage to pick up the rhythm a bit for next one, but I am going through a bit of a period in which I have less energy (creative or otherwise), so let's see.

I hope when you get into Goku fighting people, the battles have less talk. Opponents shouldn't inform each other that they're going to shoot a super powerful beam at them. There's lots of room for making the fighting more rational. And suppose Goku has read Sun Tzu's Art of War?

Well, to do that, /I/ would need to read it first. Which I probably should. But anyway I'll avoid citing explicitly real authors since technically the Dragon World just isn't /our/ Earth, and thus they never had any Sun Tzu to begin with.

And thanks for the offer :). Though that means you get a bit spoiled beforehand :D. I'll get in touch when I have time!

I don't have much time to dedicate to this project at the moment, so what I have, I'm trying to focus on the short term objective of actually writing the next chapters than on long-term planning, since I have the upcoming arc ( [[#s][slight spoilers]] ) more or less figured out already. As for that ship, that sounds like a good safety feature for any gravity chamber, but I'm not even sure that ship will /exist/ in this timeline. Major changes will begin after the end of this arc.

** [[#s][new insta kill technique unlocked]]

And I was wrong about Bulma locking out the Pilaf gang from the castle. (At least for now.)

The soul explanation for the second law of capsule seems a little more of guessing, than deduction. Even if souls exist (Which they do in the DB Universe), the problem could still be biological. And scientists should be able to experiment with that. Also, bad way to find out, if something has a soul. I guess plants would survive, animals don't. Would an animal turned into a carrot survive being stored?

[[#s][prediction 1 70%]]

[[#s][prediction 2 50%]]

[[#s][prediction 3 90%]]

Maybe put the three laws into earlier chapters or at the end of this, when you upload the next chapter. It was really confusing, that Bulma explained stuff calmly after freaking out at the end of the last chapter.

*** Also, a small note. The laws are inspired by similar laws that are hinted at in the GBA games "Legacy of Goku 2" and "Buu's Fury". They mention that no living being can be put inside a capsule, and that no capsule can be put inside a capsule. However they have someone who invents a prototype of capsule that /can/ hold a living being, and also hint at some kind of disaster that would happen if you put a capsule inside another (which I removed because any disaster could as well be a weapon, and I didn't want to juggle with that possibility too).

*** Check the time, it says "yesterday". That's a flashback, it happened the evening before, after the rabbit incident. That's why Bulma is so calm.

**** I got that, after it ended. Yesterday doesn't help much, if there could have been a time skip.

Just saying, consider using the power of editing. Personally, I don't know why it is there anyhow. They didn't use the capsule for anything, that would need to be explained with the laws. The sleeping gas could also just be stored in one without stasis effect. So just put the laws on the end or where it should be chronological after everyone read it. [[#s][of course]] And even if the laws were needed, introducing them in the chapter they are needed to explain stuff, would be close to a Deus Ex Machina.

[[#s][worth a try anyway]]

But I'm just complaining, ignore me, if you think it has no merit. ;-)

***** Personally I may edit if I ever do a "final" edition (like Eliezer did for HPMOR on his site), but I won't change an ongoing fic on FF.net, I'd be worried it would get even more confusing. "Oh, go back and read the ending of Chapter 3 again 'cos I added stuff" sounds a recipe for disaster.

I may need to make it more evident, but I don't think it's a deus ex machina because of three reasons:

1) it's not really key to the solution of the chapter, after all Goku could have used the capsule to trap the gas anyway, the laws only say the time freezes which is relatively unimportant (he could subdue Shu in other ways)\\
2) while not stated outright in canon, it's a logical way to expect such a thing to work; as for the laws concerning living beings and other capsules, as I said elsewhere, they /are/ inspired by some things that are said in the games, at the very least, and\\
3) they are groundwork for stuff that will happen later, so this chapter's events weren't the main reason to mention them. Being so early in the story, I think there's still some leeway for worldbuilding in these situations.

I see you are a man of taste.

Re: the Pilaf gang, while I've made my own changes of course, it's interesting to point out how this characterisation for me was partly influenced by how DB Super fleshed them out. In particular, showed them to be far more technically competent than we ever saw (they help Bulma repair the Time Machine), and Mai is specifically shown to be a serious "badass normal" when she wants to. Of course that doesn't count for much in Dragon Ball but that's her bad lot in life I guess.

*** I'd say she was trying to take her alive for questioning. Bulma knew where the other Balls were hidden, which would have saved time, and she supposedly has a better radar, and so on. Exactly because she's a professional, her being furious doesn't impair much her decision-making. Plus she's far more frustrated at Pilaf's idiotic decisions that put them in this situation to begin with, and it's not like she shoots /him/.
