** Ted Chiang is an author noteworthy for his excellent rational science fiction. I consider his work to be some of the most relevant to this subreddit. He pretty much exclusively writes short stories, and they're all amazing. Many of you will have read his writing, but I feel like since it has been some months since the last "Everything by Ted Chiang" post, it's time for a new post to show our new readers some of the very best this genre has to offer.

The first story of his I read was [[http://www.nightshadebooks.com/Downloads/Exhalation%20-%20Ted%20Chiang.html][Exhalation]], the story of a scientist who isn't afraid to face the truth. I cried at the end, because the beauty of the story was too much for me. Read it first, and you will end up reading the rest of his work.

Many of his short stories are in a collection for sale on [[http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1931520720/][Amazon]], or you can read them [[http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/tower.html][online]]. One short story, [[http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang][The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling]] is not in that collection, but is available online and generally considered an excellent rationalist work.

I highly recommend all of Ted Chiang's stories. I bought the book and have no regrets.

[[/u/Prezombie]] recommends [[http://www.sffaudio.com/?p=30099][two]] [[https://archive.org/search.php?query=ted%20chiang][sites]] with podcasted audiobook versions of Ted Chiang's works.

Thanks to [[/u/Tasty_Yogurt]] and [[/u/CalebJohnsn]] for finding links, and [[/u/embrodski]] for inspiring this post, and [[/u/TennisMaster2]] for reminding me how important reposting is.

I want to recommend the Korean novel /[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evolution-theory-of-the-hunter/][Evolution Theory of the Hunter]]/. I'm having a great time reading rational fiction and since I'm so new to the rational scene, I'm not sure if this will be something you'll like. It just reminded me enough of /Mother of Learning/ that I wanted to know what you guys think about it.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe][Steven Universe]] is a show primarily about the interpersonal relationships between a group of sentient alien space rocks with superpowers. There's also a good bit of singing and crying. It's pretty great.

It's very continuity heavy for a western cartoon, so it's best to start at the beginning, but the show doesn't really get going until the second half of season one. I've seen something called the "Flood Order" (a la the Star Wars Machete Order) floating around some SU communities, which condenses the first 26 episodes into 10, and I'd be curious how effective it is at hooking in new viewers.

Flood Order (Episode Title [Episode #]):

- Cheeseburger Backpack [3]

- Laser Light Cannon [2]

- Bubble Buddies [7]

- Steven's Lion [10]

- Giant Woman [12]

- Steven the Sword Fighter [16]

- Lion 2: The Movie [17]

- An Indirect Kiss [24]

- Mirror Gem [25]

- Ocean Gem [26]

You're going to miss out on some callbacks and minor side characters, but I think the hope is that if you get into the show, then you'd go back and watch the cut episodes.

[[http://tumblr.katsuricata.com/post/140052092435/steven-universe-introducing-flood-order][This]] is the spoiler heavy post that first introduced the Flood Order.

** [[https://www.amazon.com/Math-Girls-Hiroshi-Yuki/dp/0983951306][Math Girls]] is a great book to read about advanced math concepts as explained by high schoolers interested in college-level math. It really helps to understand how to actually do math through proofs. I recommend reading the free samples provided by bento Books [[http://bentobooks.com/mathgirls/][here]] since it gives a better sneak peek than Amazon does.

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003K15IO4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1#nav-subnav][Dormia]] is a nice fantasy book about a young boy hero whose powers are about preforming miraculous feats of balance, agility, and perception while walking in his sleep. It's not very rational in the world building (too many improbable things which work via author fiat for the Rule of Cool) and the protagonists are clever, but there are no moments of rationality I can point out. It's mostly a good recommendation for the people who already like this sort of story.

Finally, the fourth book in the Gentlemen Bastards Sequence is coming out on September 22, 2016! The [[https://www.amazon.com/Thorn-Emberlain-Gentleman-Bastard-Sequence-ebook/dp/B00UFWTMW0/ref=bseries_seeMoreDPInfo_0_B00UFWTMW0#nav-subnav][Thorn of Emberlain]] will rise!

FTFY.

I have a love--hate relationship with that book. I finished it ages ago, and you could still hear my howl of frustration echoing through the years.

What [[https://benprice.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dfwcartoon.gif][DFW]]'s writing does best is capture precisely how the mind turns in on itself, which results in its metamorphosis into a one-man mental version of human centipede (Sorry for the imagery there. I could have said ouroboros, but that fails to express all the shit DFW puts his reader through).

Recently [[/u/DaystarEld]] [[http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/276212563-rationally-writing-episode-4-fanfiction.mp3][talked]] (or should I say /ranted/?) and [[http://www.daystareld.com/review-100-years/][wrote]] about how much he hated magical realism. I wonder how many in this sub feel that way. /IJ/ is not magical realism, but pretty much everything Daystar Eld hated about /One Hundred Years of Solitude/ applies to it as well. It starts out Kafkaesque and gets even weirder from there. And the way it ends, I can't even, it's just oh gods, I'd better not spoil it for you, but...

Check back when you're done, __2BR02B__, and tell us how hard you threw that book across the room.

My literal reaction to the ending of 100 Years of Solitude. I didn't want to spoil it in my review, just on the offchance that some reader really cares about it, but by the gods that ending was insultingly bad. By far the laziest and most nonsensical ending to a book I've ever read... and I've read Schrodinger's City, so that's saying something.

***** Here's my long rant, inspired by your magical realism rant:

--------------

You know, I have nothing against magical realism. I read /One Hundred Years of Solitude/ as a kid, it totally blew my mind. Since then I have read Murakami, Allende, and Kafka (he is supposed to be a "surrealist"; same thing really). If you get into the right frame of mind, you can enjoy the kind of dazed underwater feeling these books engender.

/Infinite Jest/ is /much, much worse/ because it is so brilliant.

What /IJ/ has in common with magical realism novels is that the reader has no agency there. You have no idea what happens next. At first you try to anticipate how the characters would act, but so much weird shit keeps happening out of the blue that you have to give it up. You don't engage with the narrative, you just go with the flow and let it carry you. /IJ/'s timeline in particular is so fragmented that you don't even know what is happening when most of the time.

** So... I've been playing METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE yet again! Yes, this wonderful rec is back for ROUND TWO. What is Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance? It's a great video game, that's what!

Steam Link: [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/235460/]]

Yes that is an all caps name, for an ALL CAPS GAME. Is REVENGEANCE a word? No, but sometimes... in a world seeped in REVENGE, can man Rise above VENGEANCE?

First off, watch the trailer:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8mjKZxccM]]

Now that you're done literally figuratively shitting yourself with how awesome this game is, buy it. It's on Steam, and also available for Xbox 360 and PS3. Are you not already buying it? Not convinced by its greatness? Wow, what a mistake. WHAT A MISTAKE. Why do we make mistakes? So we can learn from them! Here's how you learn: Watch mission 1!

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDog3MzydJE]]

"Oh shit, what is this game, blazinghand?" you ask nervously. "How is it so cool??? And why are you so handsome?"

Let me tell you! REVENGEANCE is like 90% boss fights, 90% sweet sicknasty cutscenes, and 90% slashing things with swords (which I suppose are "cut" scenes in a way). All things that /aren't/ these things have been removed. Every design decision in this game was made in pursuit of the goal of "BE AS AWESOME AS POSSIBLE" (and yes, that is in all caps, like the name of this game). For example, let's take literally everything. Yes, that's right, the game is an example of itself. The pacing of the game is turned up to 11/10, 100% of the time, with occasional breaks to let you catch your breath. Every cutscene is sweet. Every fight is amazing. The bossfights are awesome and when the bosses enter their final form the music (which is btw super awesome) gets extra hardcore IN TIME WITH THE MINI CUTSCENES. Every moment of this game is a dopamine rush. It's kinda exhausting in a way, and after playing it, other games seem shallow and meaningless in comparison. Can you really play something as slow-paced as Skyrim after living the AWESOME that is REVENGEANCE?

There's lots of little things too besides just the score. Like, the way you move around is well-designed, and the game designers went out of their way to make things convenient. You have infinite sprinting, no stupid stamina bars. You can slash and hack as much as you want, and instead of mp your mechanic for doing sweet things is either meter (which you can build up and then expend for bullet time swordslashing) or enemy damage. Weak enemies are susceptible to awesome finishing moves. The actual cutting, stabbing, and quicktime actions are super fun. The music and look of the game pump you up. This is a game meant for people who want to, for a time, live life in ALL CAPS.

If you get this game for PC, btw, make sure to play it with your gamepad and not mouse/keyboard. It plays much better that way.

I showed this game to a mixed audience of gamers and non-gamers and everyone came away thinking it was awesome. Everyone took turns playing and had fun. A game that's 90% cutscenes, bossfights, and sweet sword-swinging action with over the top music, sound, and amazing graphics is hard to beat. Of 5 people in the room with me, two went and bought the game the next day.

I have only one negative thing to say about this game (having played through about a third of it): *after you play this game, other games become but a pale shadow of the true gaming experience*. Honestly, this game /ruins/ you for other games. It's THAT GOOD. This game leaves them all behind. Shit, the OST alone blows away so many game OSTs it's unreal.

Here's one song from an early boss fight

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlSgnpLbro]]

Also most bosses have their own unique boss fight music and the lyrics reflect that boss's life or inner life because that's more awesome and this game thrives on awesomeness

If you don't want to buy this game after the trailer, the OST, and watching mission one, I feel sorry for you, to lead such a gray and sad life.

** [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114222-four-roads-cross][New book in the Craft series!]] Loved it, as I did the entire series, in part for great impression of 'larger-than-human' beings:

#+begin_quote
  ---I bear these people because Craftsmen, broadly speaking, do not love what they cannot use, and destroy what they do not love. So I make myself useful in some minimal way, as do others of my kind.\\
  “Because you're afraid of us?”\\
  ---No. Because I enjoy flying far and fast, and I find this work more pleasant.\\
  “Than what?”\\
  ---War.\\
  “I'm glad to hear it,” she said. “But don't you find it sad that you have to live like this? That you can't just hum in a cave somewhere?”\\
  ---No.\\
  She waited.\\
  ---I find it funny.\\
  “What?”\\
  ---We are what we ever were: huge, strong, and ancient beyond your reckoning. We have crossed vast gulfs of time and space. And you think (the subsonic dread returned in sharp pulses rather than the earlier sustained note, and her mind named the dread pattern laughter) you think because looking at us you can say that one draws a salary, this one bears us from place to place, that your limited comprehension gives you any measure of safety or control.

** An entertaining passage from /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7522][King Coal]]/, written by eminent propagandist [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/88][Upton Sinclair]], author of such delicious works as /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140][The Jungle]]/ and /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16470][The Profits of Religion]]/:

#+begin_quote
  To his amusement [the protagonist] found that in the eyes of his Irish friends he was losing caste by going to live with the Minettis. There were most rigid social lines in [the coal-mining town of] North Valley, it appeared. The Americans and English and Scotch looked down upon the Welsh and Irish; the Welsh and Irish looked down upon the Dagoes and Frenchies; the Dagoes and Frenchies looked down upon Polacks and Hunkies, these in turn upon Greeks, Bulgarians and "Montynegroes," and so on through a score of races of Eastern Europe, Lithuanians, Slovaks, and Croatians, Armenians, Roumanians, Rumelians, Ruthenians---ending up with Greasers, niggers, and last and lowest, Japs.

I'd call /most/ of the story /nearly/ as fun as /The Jungle/, which is one of my favorite books. Near the end, though, I got too bored to finish it. Compare:\\
- [[#s][/The Jungle/'s ending (IIRC)]]\\
- [[#s][/King Coal/'s later chapters]]

/[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/208056][Project Horizons]]/, one of the most popular spin-offs of /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190][Fallout: Equestria]]/, has finally been posted in its entirety to FIMFiction.net. Previously, it was hosted on Google Docs, on which reading is rather annoying, and I vaguely remember disliking the EPUB version that was provided there (it was either badly formatted or out of date, I think)--but, now, it can be downloaded with ease (including in HTML format, if you don't trust FIMFiction's EPUB generation). With 1.8 million words, its length is /[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]]/-tier!

I read it up to its in-progress point, some years ago, and I /think/ I enjoyed it--but, nowadays, I can remember nothing about it, so I'm currently re-reading it.

I've recently been playing /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/21130][LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4]]/. I can't help but feel that, in comparison to its predecessor /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/32440][LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]/, it made several missteps...\\
- Extremely long cooldown timers and animations on firing spells (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, you could fire your blaster and swing your lightsaber much more often, and only throwing a thermal detonator took a long time)\\
- An unnecessary overabundance of persistent physics objects that serve only to impede movement and clutter the screen (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, there were no persistent physics objects at all, IIRC)\\
- A somewhat-cumbersome interface for switching between spells/abilities (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, most characters had only one special ability--Force, thermal detonator, small size, etc.--and only a few, IIRC, had even two. This is a mixed pro/con, since switching spells often takes the place of switching characters, so you no longer need to scroll through a zillion characters every time you need to use a different special ability in Free Play.)\\
- Being forced to trudge repeatedly, back and forth, through the same areas of Hogwarts just to get to the next story mission (or even just a cutscene!) (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, there was no such "secondary hub world". This is a mixed pro/con--since, once the story is done, Hogwarts is a very nice [[http://knd.wikia.com/wiki/Professor_XXXL][XXXL]] level in Free Play.)\\
- No characters with double-jump or high-jump capabilities (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, all Force-users had a double jump and a few other characters had a high jump, and the platforming was slightly more fun, IIRC)

Maybe it's just rose-tinted glasses (/LEGO Star Wars 1/, /2/, and /The Complete Saga/ were some of my favorite games, many years ago), some of it is the PC port's fault (I played /LEGO Star Wars 1/ and /2/ on the GameCube and /The Complete Saga/ on the PlayStation 3, while I'm playing /LEGO Harry Potter/ on PC with a keyboard), or I'm just misremembering (I haven't played any of the /LEGO Star Wars/ games--even the lackluster /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/32510][3]]/--in /several/ years). (shrugs) In my opinion, though, even /with/ these flaws, this game is still more fun than the rather infuriating /LEGO Star Wars 3/, so I /would/ recommend it, even at its current price of $20 (I got it and its sequel /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/204120][LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7]]/ for $5 each in the sale of April 2014)--and, of course, /LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga/ provides even /better/ content at the /same/ price!

*** Oh yeah, the Lego HP games were sorta lame, in my opinion (we made it through a third of the first one before giving up). Same for Lego Jurassic World, unfortunately. Our favorite so far has been Lego LOTR, though it was also the first we played, so the novelty might have bumped our perception of it up a bit too (Lego Hobbit and Lego Marvel have been pretty good, too). [[http://www.metacritic.com/search/game/lego/results?sort=score][Metacritic reviews]] don't look to agree with me, though.

** Elon Musk biography is *amazing*. This guy is a superhero, and this book pushes you really hard to be more ambitious and start working on important stuff.

The Inevitable is a pretty cool futuristic book, I think people here will enjoy it.

Creativity Inc is mostly about management, but still very inspiring, I loved it. Written by a brilliant guy who founded most of the field of CG.

*** I like WaitButWhy's treatment of [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html][Elon Musk]], [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html][SpaceX]], and [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html][Tesla]]. Hardly unbiased (the author seems to be a bit of a fanboy), but still an enjoyable read.
