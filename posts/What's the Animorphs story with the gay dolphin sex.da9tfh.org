** I'd like to quote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a0i3d4/comment/eaj1q1q][comment]] from [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] when that chapter was posted:

#+begin_quote
  Aaand The [Reckoning] is now forever known as "that fic where Tobias maybe has gay sex with a dolphin".

** Erm, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][Animorphs: The Reckoning]]?

It's offscreen (and makes sense in context).

**** Chapter 35 (and I'm not going to dig heavily for more context because if I do I will reread this story and holy shit I do not have time for that).

But from what I remember and just skimmed, Tobias has been going through some shit and decides to just hang out and play with some dolphins in morph. One of the dolphins propositions him and after careful consideration Tobias decides to go for it

**** Amazing, but not complete, and currently on a serious hiatus. The author does a lot of rationality-adjacent work and is presumably busy.

**** Ahem. Furries use the term 'Aquatic' or 'Cetacean' for those, the sapient examples of which still qualify as 'Furry'.

The more you know!

******** How about this. If you want to see if there is furry porn of <insert species here>, just go to [[http://www.e621.net][www.e621.net]] and type in whatever species you want. The sfw version of that site is e926.net, if you just want to see if someone has a fursona of that species.
