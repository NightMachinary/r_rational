Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

** This week I recommend [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4597194/][The Genius]], which is a Korean reality TV show, where contestants compete in various games for a cash prize. It's like survivor with far more complicated games and without the sweat. Or like the manga [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/1649/Liar_Game][Liar Game]] in real life. There is always a sure way to win, lots of twists, betrayals and fun. It's also masterfully edited with a familiar soundtrack and a wonderful cast.

This review makes the show more justice than my description: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lng4dn1uAc][The Incredible Storytelling Of South Korean Reality TV]].

You can watch the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKKdWt1N95s9lCdIWIwECvLzYzc_urIq5][first season on youtube]] with amazing subtitles.

** I have just learned about a time loop game based on Hamlet call Elsinore Link: [[https://elsinore-game.com/]] Has anyone here played it, and if so is it good?

The game promises: “Elsinore is a point-and-click adventure game set in a living world where the story plays out around you in real time. Every four days time resets, and you gain another chance to change the fate of Elsinore Castle's inhabitants.

Dynamic Story Engine: Elsinore uses a story simulation engine to determine which events occur based upon your interactions. Lie, forgive, gossip, befriend, or destroy --- the actions you can take at any stage are numerous, and the game immediately responds.

Intelligent Character Behavior: Each character manages their own lives, schedules, needs, desires, and plans over the course of each time loop. Even the smallest interaction has an impact on the world around you as it unfolds.

Learn from Previous Loops: Whenever a time loop resets, Ophelia remembers anything she has learned from the previous world, allowing you to access new ways to play.

Use Your Influence: Understanding each character's motivations isn't just part of the story. It's necessary for Ophelia's survival. Characters are complex and have long histories with each other; all of them are keeping secrets.

Life-or-Death Decisions: In a Shakespearean world, most roads end in tragedy, and characters are quick to meet a grisly fate. Hard decisions and terrible trials force players to think on their feet.”

** Went on a binge read and finished Worm this week, and started on Ward. Worm is good and surprisingly consistent. Even the bad chapters are pretty decent. It's got a lot of fat to cut, but I liked it. The author does a great job of creating a realistic setting where humanity really does seem under siege. I do feel like the best ending for Worm is the final pre-Ward chapter.

Ward is not nearly as good. I like the main character a bit better, but it moves really, really slowly. It also has a hard time explaining why so many people are hanging around the city when there's essentially free land if you go west. The heroes kind of feel like bullies in the first arcs anyways; harassing petty criminals just to harass them. Now if they were trying to stop protection money rackets, that's one thing, but really they show up, pick fights and leave.

*** I have problems with Ward, but the things you mention seem easy to explain.

People don't go live in the west because while there's free land, there's no infrastructure, no internet, no roads, no safety net if you have a bad harvest, etc. Since the refugees are people who grew up in 20th century US, most of them would be reluctant to reinvent Amish life from scratch.

Re: bullying... well, they're explicitly trying to stop the protection racket and break up the pirate haven, but they're planning from a position of numeric inferiority. The harassment is meant to make them spend resources and "soften them up" before mounting a large attack.

** I'm curious to see what people here would use a time travel device for.

Let's say that you have somehow received a device that reads out short messages from the future. So you can't travel through time, just get information from the future sent by a future you.

Obviously people here would start out with the testing and experimentation to see what you can do or throw it away in fear of a "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME."

But you're past all of that initial testing and investigation, and know some of the rules for how it works and that it's safe to use (or at least it /seems/ safe so far).

What would you /use/ it for? Money, women/men, fame, exploration, knowledge, or something else? What would be your long-term goals if you have an actual time travel device?

*** First, I'd use it to amass funds. There are countless ways to do this, enough that I could say it's a given that I have arbitrarily large amounts of money. While living my now comfortable life, I abuse the power of precommitment to solve problems facing humanity. I'd commit to hiring and suporting huge teams of mathematicians to solve various pure maths and comp sci proofs, sending the answers to myself back in time.

I'd accomplish this by fully committing to whatever problem the team is currently working on until future me spits out the answer. I then have the team verify it, and set them on the next one. They'd either hate me for somehow intuiting what all their hard work is leading towards, or revere me as some sort of super genius.

**** FYI, what you're describing is just regular commitment, not precommitment. It's something that stands out to me ever since someone pointed out that I was using the word wrong in the same way.

Precommitment is not only committing to an action, but then removing your ability to choose a different action. Fully automated nuclear MAD is precommitment. Locking the steering wheel in a game of chicken is precommitment. Since you haven't actually forced yourself to hire teams of mathematicians, that is not precommitment. In fact, it would be counterproductive to precommit to that since the whole point is that you want to /cancel/ that commitment once the future you pays its dividends back.

*** Power zero is disaster aversion. You can't do anything else if you're dead. Power one is duplication: How do you expand the capabilities? Have more than one? Etc.

A device like this does not let me have more time, or have more resources (directly), it just lets me use what I have to best effect.

Power two is probably money, aka, "general resources". Ideally something that garners some fame along with it, so that now you have the two easy "resources" that let you get more of them, although it's easier to turn money into anything else than anything else into money.

Now you have a real choice. Try to build the machine into yourself, like an additional sense? Try to turn it into something that produces Coherent Extrapolated Volition, and just follow it forever? Go after worldly missions - nuclear de-escalation, global disaster aversion, Golden Path...?

Depends a lot on the temporal model behind it.

And whilst it's true that you'd need strong evidence to show the existence of time travel, I still think the time travel hypothesis wins out.

Also, you don't /really/ need to precommit all that hard. Literally you could just set up a box that gives the random information, then 5 minutes later you're transmitting back. Do this enough times, see that you're correct literally every time, and you're gonna build up pretty quick evidence that something physics breaking is going on.

I was also assuming that you had access to the transmitter. I guess that isn't explicitly said in the prompt, but the future you that is transmitting the messages at some point will become a present you, and it was from this present that I was thinking.

*** My answer would depend on whether I could prove the loop was self-consistent.

If it's self-consistent, what I would do would depend on whether the future was a crapsack one, or an awesome one. If the former, I'd start squirreling aside resources to rebuild from crapsack Earth, since I can't avert crapsack in the first place. If it's an awesome one, I'd try to bring about the awesome future myself.

On the other hand, if it's not self-consistent (e.g. the movie /Frequency/), then I have a difficult choice to make. Is the possibility of making things worse worth the possibility of making things better? Any choice I make could kill my future self, leaving me unable to fix any problems I introduce into the time stream.

In that case, I'd probably strive to avert anything apocalyptic, but, if the world already seems to be on a good path, I'd probably do exactly what future me says I did the last time. No sense in me taking any risks of screwing up the future.

Yes. Aside from specific people, my general advice would be /Art/ (also memes).

I might have just gotten lucky - I don't have a twitter account, I occasionally browse when other thing link there, so maybe I avoid seeing negativity because I don't see everything a person has posted, only a snapshot of most of what they post. I have a similar experience around youtube - I listen to music, and everyone commenting (when I look at the comments) seems positive, like "This is my favorite song" etc. (Unless youtube leaned harder on censoring criticism, and everyone's comments about it being bad are from before that, I don't know what the issue is.)

I would phrase that really differently.

  Every reason why your protagonist is the person who will triumph over the antagonist (i.e. why they have the motivation and the means to do so) should be all of one piece, and it should be made known to the audience early.
#+end_quote

For instance, in canon Harry Potter, Harry is the chosen one because Voldemort attacked him as an infant and killed his parents, and Harry's a good (if angry) kid. As the discussion with Dumbledore illuminated, there's no way that Harry is /not/ going to try to stop Voldemort, prophecy or no prophecy. And most of the story flows from there.

On the other hand, the events of /Prisoner of Azkaban/ have practically nothing to do with that. The reason why Harry is the protagonist of that book is that Peter Pettigrew decided to go into hiding with the family of the kid destined to be Harry's best mate, and the rat showed up in a picture of Harry's friend in the newspaper. That's an /extraordinarily unlikely/ coincidence (especially when paired with the fact that another Marauder happens to be in the school that year, /and/ this is the year that Hermione gets a cat that can recognize that Scabbers isn't actually a rat), and it detracts from the story.

An example of a story which does this badly is /Iron Man 3/.

The reason why Tony gets involved in the whole Mandarin affair is because: * he shunned a guy at a party in Bern, Switzerland * he solved a biology problem for a girl at that same party * those two met up and decided to try to get Tony help them solve that same problem again for them, and * Tony's chief of security decides to follow the shunned-guy's henchman as he goes to give a potentially-explosive drug to a guy who, it turns out, can't handle that drug without exploding.

Already, we're stretching the boundaries of belief (why did /that/ guy have to be the one to explode, when its a random occurrence?), but, sure.

Now, if this is the introduction to the character, and he uses that as motivation to become a superhero and take the shunned-guy down, that'd be one thing. But: * Your protagonist is also /already/ Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. * And Tony has been building an excessive number of Iron Man suits, for a completely unrelated reason, which he's going to need later to win. * /And/ shunned-guy just so happens to own the company which did the software upgrade to one of the suits Tony built: a suit which is an essential piece of shunned-guy's plan. * And, for sheer Easter-egg convenience, the party in Switzerland is also the same place where Tony first met the guy who helped and inspired him to become Iron Man in the first movie.

There's no reason why /all/ of the above should be true, when Tony wouldn't even be involved in the main plot of the movie if Happy hadn't been caught in an explosion which the Mandarin had claimed credit for.

Bringing this back to "giving characters insights or knowledge they shouldn't reasonably have"...

If there's no reason why the character should know that they only have one life, but they just "know it," and that intuitive knowledge ends up being why they are able to prevail, where the others all die off because they treat this as a game... I'm cool with that. The reason this guy is the main character, is because the guy who wasn't 100% convinced that he was playing in hardcore mode didn't quite try hard enough to get out of the way of a gun, and died, and who wants to read a story about /that/ guy?

However, if there's something /else/ special about the protagonist, which has nothing to do with the intuitive hardcore-mode knowledge, and is necessary to defeat the antagonist... Yeah, I might have a problem with that.

  There's a bit of writing advice that says - get the big, unbelievable thing out of the way at the beginning of the book, when you're setting the rules, so it's not a deus ex machina/diabolus.
#+end_quote

I think I've heard that statement before but if you're writing for me (and probably others on this sub) I think that would be terrible advice. It's at the beginning of a story that I have the least information about the characters and settings so it's the hardest time for me to fanwank/headcannon explanations. Not to mention at the beginning of the story, I'm the least invested (sunk-cost still affects me) and it's where I'm examing everything as closely as I'll ever be to try and glean what I can about this new world I've been thrown into.

It's all about consistency in what requires a suspension of disbelief, I guess. If the only thing actually presented as changed is the setting, I'm assuming the humans have the same information & abilities I do. In my example, to determine how many lives they would have. Or take police dramas on TV -- I can suspend my disbelief about a given case's unusualness but if you're still working inside the framework of the American legal system it's going to throw me out of it when the police search a house without a warrant or the lawyer starts spewing career-ending, disbarment-worthy lies left and right.

****** Yes, that's definitely the issue in this case.

But! --and I haven't thought about it too much so I could be wrong -- I think the case could be made that good world building happens cumulatively and organically. For the case of your isekai or litrpg protagonist, I want to see them act realistically when finding themselves, abruptly, in a new world. Have them explore and more gradually come to the understanding that this is, in fact a totally new world as they discover magic exists and people mofumofu things like it's totally normal behavior.

I much more appreciate the stories that have characters who question and explore things. Who actually act... rationally. Things I see that at least somewhat work: "Is this a prank? Real funny guys," "am I dreaming/in a coma?", "am I in a game or actually transported to a new universe that is exactly like the game?", "Ooh, can I do still do X here?", "Does this mean gods actually exist?"

(Of course, few works take a serious look at the mechanics or ramifications behind such a transition, to my dismay. I'd love to see reincarnation or the like munchkin'd!)

Here, the scene that set me off on this rant:

I hate how the fact that he can't treat it like a game is shoehorned in here. The possibility that he could die and be OK is never brought up again. To me, this the author being lazy and wanting this situation to be the case, without having to go through the effort of showing us why it should actually be that way. Having access to the interface should make the character think the opposite, for heaven's sake!

I found that advice in a book review for a book where the moon gets blown up - into a few different (large) pieces, which will eventually collide, and break into smaller pieces, and the really small debris from those collisions will fall to earth, leading to an escalating series of meteor showers that will destroy civilization. The author of the review appreciated they did that up front, because their knowledge of physics said that was wrong, but that's the premise. They enjoyed the rest.

In a similar vein, one movie was bad with this was Edge of Tomorrow, where they set off this big obvious Chekov's gun of "if you get a blood transfusion, you lose the groundhog day magic". Later, the protagonist inevitably gets a blood transfusion and says something in the vein of "I can feel it. My power's gone."

And I'm like... wow, it sure is convenient that whatever magic is at play is giving you a very specific synesthesia that you can immediately identify as "not having the power anymore", and it's really convenient that both you and your predecessor figured it out /before/ shooting yourselves in the head to try and restart your day.

- Any action that costs little to try is now trivial (e.g. computer security is non-existent because hacking is "an action" in most RPGs).

- Any action where failure is expensive is now a nightmare (e.g. all cars are made illegal to drive above 10 km/h - and are still covered in bumps and scratches).

It feels like constructive activities more frequently fall into the second category than destructive ones (because they usually consume time and raw materials). So I don't think it would be a great world to live in on net, even if it'd have its high points.

*** It's pretty bad honestly. I'm not a fan of Shield Hero by any measure, but I can at least acknowledge that some of the earlier parts of the story can be emotionally and narratively compelling to some people.

Arifureta has none of that. I've only read the web novel version, but it's really just a wish fulfillment fantasy through and through, from the characters to the plot events. The inciting incident is uninspired and the main character is a huge edgelord. He has a romantic relationship with a single partner, but as you might expect, the story inevitably devolves into a harem anyway.

There's also pretty much zero rational elements in the story. From what I remember, I got the impression that every aspect of the protagonist came from a teenage fantasy of what a gunslinging, revenge-seeking badass would look like, and the author wrote it as such.

Even if you're a sucker for that sort of wish fulfillment story, Arifureta will probably still be a let down considering it's terrible pacing and crappy characterization of its already shallow characters. It suffers from a problem that all harem light novels suffer from, that female characters are just trophies to collect and become cardboard cutouts of character tropes once they join the protagonist in his meandering quest.

*** Honestly its one of the very few series that seriously pissed me off.

The central premise that you get in the first volume is simple: 1) The main character is going to be a dark edgy type that is entirely committed to getting revenge against those who wronged him, and 2) No harem.

After volume 1 these are both thrown entirely out the window. He just decides not to get revenge for no reason (like seriously, at the point where he can get revenge trivially he just goes "ehh, no point getting revenge lol"), and then gets a bigass harem.

I don't have a problem with either wishy washy harem main characters or people that don't care about getting revenge, but the way they butchered what little character he had to enable them kind of felt like a betrayal.

Oh, and the series is pretty terrible wish fulfillment stuff with a main character with OP abilities that don't even make sense along with a boatload of other problems, but that's just par for the course and something to be expected.
