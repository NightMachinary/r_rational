A while back I had an idea that I would start writing a rational fiction, with a twist. My plan is to create a general setting and world, and a few individual characters, and find some people who are confident they can get in the mindset of said characters to RP them as the story goes on. If you'd be interested in being involved please leave a comment or PM me.

Edit: Hey interested parties. Just so you know I am now pretty much full up on characters, the only one I have left is age 56 so I'd be looking for someone who is at least in their late thirties to RP him. I will need help with the editing and writing process, and for those of you who were interested in participating but didn't make it in time to get a character I promise to hit each of you up when the time for the first chapter to be published comes around.


** Otherwise generic rationalist with special affinity for mystics or priests of either gender (or none), registering tentative interest. I've always thought this would be a good way to write rat fics.

** I am a long term roleplayer, with experience DMing and playing as a player, plus I've written a few rational bits of story. I'd be happy doing this.

** Have you looked at this thread already?: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2x6pxd/bst_something_quest/]]

And the subreddit: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MSDATB/]]

Sorry if those are not what you are looking for. You seem to be thinking of individuals playing individual characters instead of groups playing characters.

*** Not exactly what I'm doing but definitely very interesting. Thanks for the links I didn't see that Yudowsky was doing something new, should be a fun read.

** Rationalist with predilection for creative(if brutal) munchkinry of limited resources if possible--I'm interested in RPing any character though.

** Another rationalist, strong background in theoretical physics and mathematics. Could offer facility for realistic descriptions of inventions, rules for device operation, and general improvisations. I am still new to role-playing (only been playing for about a year now), but I have a strong imagination and enjoy writing.

Would like more information before I fully commit, but you've certainly piqued my interest.

** This seems interesting, as long as it stays rational instead of rationalist. I'd be stepping out of my depth if I tried to write a rationalist. I will also warn you that I might choose to have my character act irrationally, on purpose, from time to time in order to be unpredictable - it's not entirely rational to be predictable in some scenarios. That would be very situational though, and wouldn't make sense for some characters, so it's not certain that I'd choose to do it.

** I'm definitely interested. Role-playing anything more rational than a mildly smart consequentialist is probably beyond me, though.

** Seems like an excellent way to write a rational fiction with characters that have deep thought behind them. I would volunteer to help but seems like there are enough characters probably... I can perhaps help edit or do some consulting on the world if you want someone to bounce ideas off of or help edit together some of the disparate pieces.

As for bona fides - Biology major, lots of experience creating worlds and rulesets, and work as a clinical therapist so have a lot of experience getting into people's heads.
