I've been enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor][The Two Year Emperor]], and other recommendations from this subreddit.

Does anyone here know enough about how TVTropes works to describe when an ongoing piece of fiction is notable enough to be mentioned in the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][RatFic]] page, or even be given a page of its own?

(Alright, alright, I'll admit it - I'm trying to promote the term 'RatFic' over 'Rational Fiction' at least in part due to my chosen totem animal. :) But other than that, I'm still curious about the actual question.)


** When people other than the author like it enough to write it up on TVTropes themselves.

** I almost downvoted you just for the term "RatFic".

Anyway, start by linking it here, and if the sub judges it explicitly "Rational" instead of merely "Logical" or "Realistic" then it should go there.

** /TVtropes, there is no such thing as notoriety./

If you enjoy the work it is well within your rights to create a fanfic recommendation/page to which you can add the tropes you see. Others see it and review the works and make additions as they see it/refine the tropes already present. I was thinking about starting up a page for these works as well, for I keep popping over to see if they have been made.

In fact, I am going to go right over and do so now. Shut up and just do it, as the saying goes.

Edit: Just to update you guys. I am going to create the pages under the YKTTW tab to help make sure that I get the format down for the site as this will be the first time making a trope page and I want it to not crash the site or have bad formatting with naked links everywhere. This should also allow others to help live with creating the page. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/discussion.php?id=lk93fry4nso8o87lzn705bdj][Link Here!]]

*** Works pages are a free launch, meaning that you don't have to (and shouldn't) put them in YKTTW. The easiest way to make a page is just to copy the formatting of a page that's already up and paste it in, so that you don't need to worry about making things look bad.

** Also, what's the criteria to decide putting a piece of original literature published on the web in 'Literature' or 'Web Original'? Ra is in the former, several text stories are in the latter, on the RatFic page.

*** There is no such thing as notability on TVTropes. The only criteria for if something is worthy of being a page or example is that someone thought it deserved one enough to put the effort into making it.

As for the literature/web original debate, that's a lot less clear. My usual inclination is to use WebOriginal for oneshots and still short serials, but move it to literature if the web serial author stays active and makes the serial nice and long.

***** Nowhere, because Worm isn't rational, nor sane, nor well thought out. It was written with speed and regular update schedule in mind, along with author self professed darker tendencies, which itself isn't bad, but the way it was handled in Worm was. Worm started out okay and promising, but then it got worse by decreasing average intelligence of its characters and overall people in its universe, 4D gods included.

******* I don't dislike so much as have a problem with it being considered a rational or even realistic work of fiction. I think this because in a sense it failed to live up to my expectations and because it takes it self too seriously but it doesn't know how. If you were to read any chapter of it and take time to consider at full or even at glance some of the inverse problems, like why Scion is untraceable or why Simurgh's plot are successful.

I have a whole pastebin worth of text (reddit has limit on character comment count) saved on computer. It was written in emotional state and is filled with snark, sarcasm and spiteful words. It contains lots more logic flaws and loop holes that i could think of. So if anybody wants me to post it again i will. But I would like to avoid senseless downvoting that doesn't explain flaws in my reasoning.

********* I think that's a big part of the disagreement, people read Worm, recognize clever thinking in it, it reminds them of hpmor or similar and then they put Worm in same category. It's okay to enjoy irrational stories and talk about them and even recommend them to other people in your tribe/group without those stories fulfilling the criteria of said tribe/group.

*** Your work is going to be a web original, but noted as influenced by Eliezer Yudkowsky. Should this not be true, or I have omitted some others please feel free to drop in and correct me.
