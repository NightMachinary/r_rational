** I wonder if they actually have to worry about Silverlake. I mean, she's a totally selfish person who would betray anyone and hurt innocents if it ends in her favor, so I can easily see her trying to defeat the real Silverlake first to get all her stuff back. And she would be able to do it quite easily too, since she knows everything about her real self while her real self doesn't even know her loop self exists. Then, since she has to defeat her real self anyway, she could very well erase Silverlake's mind and transfer her own mind over to her body, the same way evil simulacrums try to take over the real mage's body. Then, since she would be back in her own body rather than Paxaneth's puppet body, she wouldn't have to worry about the death pact and have no incentive to release it.

We already know that stuff can be triggered by tampering with the Marked soul, or by the Marked soul leaving the body, so it's just a matter of copying those mechanisms, and having the result be death instead of restarting the loop.

**** The soul is a repository of magical power and experience and a backup copy of the personality for the convenience of gods, but it needn't be the only backup copy. Zorian could probably take over his original body via mind whammy. That way he'd have his new mind, but his original body and soul. That would have the downside of losing him all of his hard-won shaping skill, but he could fall back on the spell formula expertise that he had originally intended to specialize in in the first place.

Alternatively, there might just be a soul magic method to photocopy souls. If you can imprint your personality onto raw unshaped magic to form a simulcrum, then maybe it could be possible to imprint a copy of yourself onto an existing soul instead. That route also has the advantage of being more likely to lead toward lich!Zorian, which is a path I've been advocating for for a very long time now.

*** Have we confirmed that a straight up mind transfer or body hopping is possible? As in Person A(Mind A) => Person B(Mind A), Person A(Mind Null)? I feel like Zorian would have gone body-hopping already if it were that simple.

Otherwise Silverlake runs into her simulacrum problem, with Person A(Mind A) & Person B(Mind A) and an expiration date on Person A as her final outcome. Silverlake A(A) wouldn't allow for the destruction of herself, Silverlake B(A) would know that, and they'd probably end up fighting until one or the other is dead since Panaxeth rampaging is a massive negative for B(A) with no upside and A(A) needs Panaxeth free.

** In Zorian's place, what would you do with Panaxeth's deal? Barely any time before the loop ends and you die, with its assertions that Zach is ultimately your enemy (or at least your successes are mutually exclusive) hanging over your head.

The thing is, obviously there're still a great deal of Knightian unknowns remaining and Zorian is essentially being prodded by a probable superintelligent being. Those random phrases and off-topic discussions Panaxeth was saying to some loopers? I'm fairly certain it was throwing low effort stimuli at them to improve its mental model of them, which implies it probably already has a good one of Zorian (having been through many more unique loops means a larger dataset). Combined with its superior knowledge and processing power, if it wasn't for narrative reasons I would assume this was a guaranteed losing situation.

Personally,

#+begin_quote
  I feel like there's really no point in agreeing to Panaxeth's deal because ultimately you're disabling the Controller for what might be nothing; Panaxeth isn't obligated to follow through on his end of the deal.

  Broader analysis notwithstanding, I feel like at this point I would need to somehow disable Zach and take a look at his mind with an aranean guide to verify Panaxeth's claims. There are risks, but it's worth it.

*** Panaxeth doesn't actually SEEM to be a superintelligence though. It seems to have vast capabilities, but while it can record things with perfect clarity (supposedly) it has an admittedly limited capability to process information. It also fails spectacularly to convince most of the group. What we can say with relative certainty is that Zach's magical capacity is superhuman, that someone or something divine has allowed him the single largest power known to ever be given to a mortal (the Sovereign Gate), and that Panaxeth is more than willing to manipulate and lie (his accounts to multiple different people disagree with each other).

He's willing to use a portion of his remaining power, which he's stated is limited, in order to get rid of Zach. That would imply that if you actually wanted to beat Panaxeth, Zach is useful. Also there's no reason to trust that Panaxeth would ever ACTUALLY release you. He has to use the power he is clearly cautious of using in order to pay you for a service you've already rendered. I doubt he would be troubled by not keeping a deal with a mere human.

No. I wouldn't take the deal. I would consider taking the original deal that let's me out for the death bond, if only to help stop his resurrection, but that would only be a very last resort. Tricking Panaxeth into letting you do that doesn't seem too incredibly difficult. Even after extensively researching Zorian, it thinks it's wise to mention that it views destroying an entire city as an unfortunate side-effect of getting out. It seems to have a bit of trouble actually understanding human motivations and thought processes.

**** I definitely agree that it's performance appeared subpar for a superintelligence, but that's probably what it wants you to think. /s

I was assuming that since it got Silverlake so easily it was just feeling the others out. Especially given its time dilation powers, that seems like an easy strategy to prepare for the next conversation if there is one and leave the best chance of convincing ZZ it's safe to try again without Silverlake.

And overall I still think it displays good intelligence--Zorian is strongly hostile to Panaxeth so he didn't waste much time on him initially, but by his second encounter Panaxeth has a very tempting offer in place and is playing mind games.

But it's possible there's some other reason- maybe it has limited processing power so it didn't waste any on members of the group with limit usefulness (Taiven, Nora). Maybe you're right and it's performance was underwhelming because it's just a weak AI with tremendous resources (e.g. the Chimp in Peter Watt's Sunflower setting).

P. S. : Actually, on a re-reading Xvim asks why it wasn't more effective at tempting them, and the speculation was that the primordial didn't have total awareness of individuals in the loop / sees them as alien.

He probably can by now. That was a matter of personal soul perception, not marker damage. Actually, they've established that Zach's marker is much /more/ intact and functional than Zorian's.

Plus, the Guardian has run a system check now, confirmed Zach as the sole Controller, and recognised Zorian as an anomaly. I wouldn't rely on Zorian having full privileges any more.

What evidence do we have of this? RR certainly would have been capable of it, I suppose, but is there any actual evidence of it happening? The story seemed to lay the memory problems mostly on Zach's soul being damaged. There's a decent case for it based strictly on circumstances being as they are, but is there any actual evidence? Also, if Veyers wanted to stop Zach as a threat he could have done a lot more than just erase Zach's memory of him specifically, right?

*********** The primary evidence we have of this is Zach's own comments during his first "teamed" loop with Zorian: Even that early, he has no idea what's happening. Then, later, when QI uses self-destruct on them, there is no mention of either suffering any memory loss from the soul damage (Zorian's augmented memory provides an excellent control sample here).

Your counterpoints are actually something Zorian brings up in-story when they first notice the memory hole regarding Veyers; Zorian remarks something along the lines of "it's amazing he was skilled enough to pull this off around the failsafes and stupid enough to not lay false tracks (because Veyers is the only one he forgot about)." This is actually a big part of the theory for Veyers NOT being RR.

As for it being caused by soul damage, I think we actually DON'T have any evidence for that having been the cause, and again, I believe Zorian specifically adresses that as unlikely due to the fairly specific and targeted nature of the memory loss (Zach remembers all the other classmates and several people from school who weren't even in their class /but nothing about veyers specifically/.)

This chapter also tenatively confirms Zach as the original looper, which would make permanently removing him from the loop extremely dangerous; even with a modified marker. if the original were 'soulkilled' or in some other way permanently removed from the loop, it's very +probable+ possible the loop would collapse or cease to exist. As for less fatal methods of disablement, we don't know. It's possible (even likely) that Zach suffered severe trauma from his mindfuck sessions, but Zach wouldn't have noticed; we have evidence that he's completely unaware of 'coma' runs (this would also have given RR fairly uncontested and uninterrupted access to Zach for long periods to 'fine tune' his mental surgery, as we've seen that Tessen tends to react to coma'd-Zach by sticking him in a basement somewhere and shrugging his shoulders to the rest of the world.)

************ Fair points. It's also interesting that in the one time we see RR use mind magic on Zach, he roots through his brain without triggering any of the loops protections against mind magic. That would imply that either his mind magic at that time wasn't very intrusive (and Zach's memory had been manipulated before this point), he had performed mind magic on Zach before and was accustomed to the triggers for the loop reset (and Zach's memory had been manipulated before this point), or the protections against mind magic aren't as stringent as I've been led to believe (which is still entirely possible for any number of reasons). I suppose RR might have also been coached on how to do this without triggering the protections, as an alternative, but that seems difficult and unlikely.

This also helps explain RR's reaction to other unknown loopers: Panaxath got him in, so they'd either entered though Zach and his sponser (making them hostile to Panaxath) or they were also working for Panaxath, but at counterpoint to him, meaning their success could lead to RR's death -> best course of action is immediate destruction then immediately leaving the loop.

Panaxath himself may have not known that until Z&Z's questioning; Zorian speculates that this is probably the first time the gate has been opened using Panaxath as the 'source', so he wouldn't have knowledgeof previous loops to draw on for such things and Panaxath certainly doesn't seem to be omnicient outside of the loop (and even then has very limited omniscience inside the loop, if any).

One day, the gods descended from the higher planes of existence and killed all of them save one. This last one they refashioned into the material world that humans now inhabit, turning her body into dirt and stone, her blood into water, her breath into air and her fire into magic. The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World -- the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground. Far from being content with her fate, the Dragon Below still rages against her bounds, giving birth to natural disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes. Unable to strike back against the gods themselves, the dragon takes her anger out on their favored creations -- humans -- by utilizing her heart, the one thing the gods have not seen fit to take away from her. Pieces of it continually flake off from the main mass, giving birth to horrifying monsters whenever they hit the ground, at which point said monsters begin their ascent to the surface to terrorize mankind...

********* +Zach's soul marker is broken in such a way that he cannot restart the loop at will. That feature is exclusively Zorian.+

[[/u/addmoreice][u/addmoreice]] brought up a good point, that simulacrums can self-cancel, as demonstrated by Zorian. But, again, a simulacrum could be created directly inside a trap / ward that prohibits all the counter-measures you've listed. For example, instantly rendering the simulacrum unconscious. Or slowing time.

The only potential counterargument I see is being unable to read the simulacrum's mind, for whatever reason.

Says who? Every in-story indication has been that Zach's marker is perfectly intact. He simply lacked the necessary skill at personal soul perception.

Since he's now capable of creating simulacra /and/ wears the soul sight ring, he's almost certainly advanced enough to use those marker switches.

That said, I have two points:

1) It was never explicitly stated that Zach gained access to his soul marker's switches, and he never ended a restart at-will (even when Quatach-Ichl was soul-bombing them, Zorian ended that restart.)

2) Trapping a simulacrum is theoretically possible.

As for rendering the simulacrum unconscious: the mental state upon creation is necessarily the same of that of the caster (as it's a copy). The sleep effect would have to take effect absolutely instantaneously, or it wouldn't work. We've seen Zorian resist similar effects himself.

In regards to the actual offer and Zorian's suspicion, I think it's a solvable problem. Zorian himself doesn't need to be the one to look into Zach's head, just a decent telepath. Zorian should tell Zach to get some of the Aranea to look into Zach's head, while Zorian stays at a tea shop or something under supervision of one of Zach's simulacrum. Since no one else would know about the offer to Zorian without Zorian communicating with them, Zach could simply ensure Zorian can't communicate and then have himself checked out.

Alternatively, assuming simulacra would inherit any compulsions the original is under, Zach could just make a simulacrum and have Zorian check it out for compulsions. Zorian couldn't do any damage, because the simulacrum could be immediately dismissed after Zorian checks it. Zorian is satisfied, and Zach doesn't need to endanger himself even if Zorian is hostile.

​

For zorian? yes, dying would be a tragedy, and even for zack from zorians point of view (since if this is his last loop, then zack's death means his death as well). But the artifacts inside the loop mean little unless they need them on that particular loop (ie, the loop before this one they had little need for them, but in *this* loop they are absolutely vital!). they actually have high value inside the loop only because they didn't start with them. If instead they start with them, then they are absolutely vital! hence why gathering them outside the loop later is so very important. Get them, stash them away, gain immortality, then wait and use them to gather even more power. Right now that's not that vital for sure, but once they are out and things are settled in whatever way? then it should be *very* important. Literal god like power! Imagine if they had started the loop with the artifacts!

** It's /possible/ that Zach could use the crown to give Zorian another six loops for them to improve their escape plan, but if I was Zorian I wouldn't want to pin my hopes on that.

Doylist assumption 1: the protagonist will survive. Doylist assumption 2 (weaker): it wouldn't fit for Zorian and Zach to turn on each other at this point, not when other antagonists are readily available out of the loop. Doylist conclusion: Zorian will survive but will not take Panaxeth's offer and turn on Zach. The most likely way for that to happen is for their escape attempt to succeed.

If the escape attempt succeeds, then all of our temporary loopers get out too (by now they're no worse off than Zorian), and we get to go full-throttle Red Robes + Silverlake + Ulquaan Ibasa vs. Zorian, Zach, the Cyoria crew and allies, and potentially their IRL duplicates as well. Having two Xvims will certainly be helpful, among others, and something tells me IRL!Silverlake won't have any fondness for the antics of Loop!Silverlake.

The marker has to be placed /before/ the end of the current loop, and the force reboot of Zorian is scheduled for /after/ the current loop ends before the next loop starts, and the reset is specifically intended to override Zorian's permanent marker. Since there is no opportunity to place the temporary marker after the cleanup but before Zorian's soul is discarded and recreated to begin the next loop and the reset is intended to remove aberrant markers including Zorian's permanent marker it probably overrides all the usual checks for markers.

​

If there is a cheat with temporary markers Z&Z have not yet learned enough about the inner workings of the actual reset process (specifically what the gate does to destroy and recreate souls when it resets the loop, and how the planned reset of Zorian differs form the usual reset) to know about it, so they'd have to be throwing a "hail Marry" to even bother trying it.

Consider: towards the end of this chapter, Panaxeth admits that its primary goal once the key was assembled was to prevent Zach from exiting the loop and wrecking its escape attempt. Its chosen method to try to prevent this was to attempt to cause infighting and division among the ranks of Zach, Zorian, and their allies.

Given that we know this now, how confident are we that Silverlake actually betrayed them and made a deal with Panaxeth? Sure, her doing so is somewhat plausible. But that also means that if Panaxeth planned to sow discord and prevent the loopers from exiting, knocking Silverlake out of the loop whether she agreed to any deal or not is an excellent strategy to make them all distrust one another.

**** A way for this to happen:

We know that creating a simulacrum gets you more than halfway to becoming a lich.

A lich's phylactery is a physical object.

You can store physical objects in the Orb until looping ends.

You can also store physical objects in the mind (using Ilsa's technique), and recreate them if you have the materials at hand to do so.

So:

- Zorian uses the rest of this restart to become a lich.
- Zach puts the phylactery into the Orb.
- Zach uses the rest of the (dozen?) remaining restarts to learn how to create a phylactery and how to use Ilsa's technique. Zorian uses this time to learn how to build better bodies.
- Zach takes the mind print of Zorian's phylactery into the real world, Zorian creates a body in the real world (or Zach makes one for him).
- Good to go.

Do I think that's actually going to happen? No. I think the "how small can the writing be and be reproducible" issue with Ilsa's technique prevents a phylactery from being reproduced accurately enough to be transported out of the loop this way. But I thought it was a fun idea.

You'd have to modify Ilsa's spell to contain a soul magic aspect which would be impossible to do in the remaining time (not to mention the orb hasn't shown capability to house any souls).

As for mind wise, I think you are thinking of a form of a memory packet which Zach hasn't the time to master the necessary magic to be messing with memories/minds (even a copy of one) to be trusted with something as delicate and complex as Zorian's mind without it falling it apart during the transfer.

There's other failing too. But these are minor when compared to the first. One, I'm not sure Zach has the space to put Imperial Orb blueprint inside his mind. Two, it took Zorian ~6 restarts to master Simulacrum spell; I'm not sure how much time he would take even if he's currently a better soul mage.

One thing that people either here or on fictionpress review page failed to perceive regarding Silverlake's temperament is that she's perfectionist. She saw everyone as inefficient and that frustated her because she could do much better under the same condition. This is shown frequently. Remember when she scolded Zorian when he didn't pay attention stirring cauldron? Or when she presented both logical and legal idea to speed up Kael's medical research? Imagine working under and with people below your competence level for a whole year, for every single day, no holiday because both her character and hard deadline: that's stressful!

Also, we can't be sure those two pocket dimension maker already mastered more general dimensionalism magic. And both Zach & Zorian are no longer dabblers. Both mastered teleport and pocket dimension crafting, Zach can alter trajectory thanks to enchantment, Zorian can gate at will, as well as haste (ch.63). That's practially all area under dimensionalism magic as we're told by author, except maybe phasing and micro-gating.

And Zach doesn't have any special distrust of Zorian, just a general objection to mind magic. He actually said he trusted Zorian more than he would trust a mage guild professional.

It may be that it would be impossible to out mind-magic Panaxeth outside of the time loop on an even playing field, but Zorian is essentially already inside of Panaxeth, and Panaxeth is restricted from using mind magic so he can't fight back offensively using mind magic.

  I do think it seems like Zorian would stand a chance though. Panaxeth doesn't seem very powerful with the restraints on him, and he isn't much of a super intelligence. My original assumption was that he was a Cthulhu-type godlike creature, but he seems to be quite limited while in the gods prison.
#+end_quote

One can only hope, however it's entirely possible that he's restrained from doing much while still retaining all his protective abilities. If that's the case, they probably don't stand a chance at mentally compelling him. If the gods had trouble killing primordials, they almost certainly don't have any natural weaknesses.

At this point I don't think it will happen either. I thought Zorian patching up his primary deficiency would be one of the major steps to escaping the time loop, but at this point we don't have the time left.

That being said, there's evidence of people in the setting working with divine magic. I think it would be fully possible for Zach and Zorian to create at least some crude divine augments if they'd hadn't needed to focus on dimensional magic.

I believe the author said they they were considering writing another story in the setting. Perhaps I'll get my godly fix then.

** I'm curious about the nature of Zach's potential mental compulsions. Any compulsions from Red Robe would be from before Zorian even started looping, so he couldn't have left anything targeting Zorian specifically. Since RR was also a looper, it wouldn't make sense to leave a general "kill other loopers" compulsion, especially not one that only triggers if Zach leaves the loop. In fact, any compulsion that only triggers once Zach leaves the loop would make little sense for RR to create, as RR was hoping to prevent Zach from leaving the loop entirely.

It is a bit more likely that the angels could have left a "once you're out of the loop, kill any other loopers" compulsion as a safeguard against people like RR and Silverlake, but it would make more sense to compel Zach not to allow these people to become an issue in the first place.

Panaxeth's "in the end, one has to kill the other" statement is also suspicious. If a mental compulsion is the danger here, then why ask Zorian to invade Zach's mind, where he could probably remove whatever compulsion Zach may have?

** All ZZ-guardian interactions should be considered compromized.

Consider: Panaxeth is powerful, the scope of this power should not be based on what he shows/tells ZZ. Since both under selling his power level and over selling his powerlevel can be used to further his goals the safer options is to assume he is underselling his power.

​

If Panaxeth is underselling his power then the statement of cost when controlling the guardian is immediately suspect. If controlling hte guardian has little/no cost then all guardian statements are suspect.

​

Additionally the fact that he ejected ZZ at the end of the dialogue means he could have eject Zach at the beginning of the dialogue and given zorian the new deal without putting Zach on the defensive.

​

​

Therefore:

if Panaxeth is underselling his powerlevel then it is likely that zorian is not in immediate danger of loop reset and ZZ should continue their escape plan as normal.

​

If Panaxeth is overselling his power then the guardian statement is true and Zorian is in immediate danger and ZZ shoould try their escape plan as normal.

​

Regardless Panaxeth behavior does not create trust between Zorian and himself. if Panazeth wanted Zorian to succeed against Zach he would not have allowed Zach to overhear. If Panaxeth wanted to create trust between himself and Zorian as a conspirator he would not have allowed Zach to over hear. Therefore his statement should be discarded.

​

Many people are discussing how intelligent Panaxeth is or isn't. I think he's not trying very hard to appear intelligent beecause he does not need to. He needs to prevent ZZ from exiting the loop, he may not be able to stop Zach from exiting (Guardian statements are suspect) any longer. If Panaxeth came accross as very inteligent or powerful it would confirm ZZ's suspicions of him and increase their likelyhood to cooperate. By portraying himself as less intelligent and powerful he makes it more likely that they will defect and damage each other. This is the only course of action that would prevent Zach from exiting the loop through the gate.

** Great chapter to confirm the stake and to reignite the old conflict. I personally lean toward Zorian, but conflict with Zach should cost him dearly. That's why I dread Zach-Zorian win-lose situation, never wishing it come to be. I was actually glad that there were multiple method for both of them to escape. /Until the last chapter. Sigh.../ Well, at least higher stake means more excitement.

Two criticism which I hope constructive. I know that Panaxeth pronoun generate a discussion last chapter, but I don't feel it worth a paragraph today. Unlike plot hole that is 'dismissed simulacrum upon entering black-room' many chapters ago, this is merely a consistency problem. One or two sentence acknowledging different pronoun usage should suffice. Author could even just chalk it off. The story took Zorian POV (?) after all.

Then there's the posing of problem. I get what happened and what at stake in just one read through, indicating effective writing. But the experience to get there is cumbersome. Discussion on Noveda mansion has too much distraction before getting confirmation on Panaxeth capability and putting a close on Silverlake 'betrayal.' Noise and important piece of information is rather indistinct there. Author did well, but not as well as last chapter. Maybe breaking passage (using -break- stuff) into more parts so that reader can more clearly identify the piece of information story trying to convey?

** Two thoughts on this chapter (apologize in advance if they were already mentioned here before):

1) When the characters discern that since Panaxeth didn't use the form of any relatives and such of the party that they haven't interacted with in the time loop, then he does not read minds but is simply aware of what happens in the loop, they miss an interesting follow up question.

They could have possibly deduced what Panaxeth later explains to Zorian about how his memory works (with that whole anthill metaphor thing). Let's assume that for some of the temporary loopers, there are people they interacted with during the loop, but only before they became loopers and not afterwards. If Panaxeth took the shape of any of those people, then he can probably read everything that happened and is happening in the time loop like some sort of record - gleaning very specific details about certain individuals in retrospect, since he had no way of knowing in advance which individuals will be turned into temporary loopers in the future. If he didn't use these forms, maybe his awareness of the time loop's past is more like a normal human's memory, in the since that if asked for very specific details of something that was not considered important in the past, he/she might not be able to recall them.

Obviously it turned out to be the former.

2) I'm a little disappointed that it is hinted that the Sovereign Gate can work using any primordial, and it just happens to be Panaxeth this time around. I thought the fact that Panaxeth was the ultimate shape shifter had something to do with how the time loop works. Since the time loop is basically a hundred percent accurate simulation of the real world (occurring in an instant), I thought it was made out of Panaxeth himself, somehow super-shapeshifting in some cosmic sense to turn itself into the shape of the world in the exact state it was when the loop has begun. Its a cool idea, philosophically speaking. But maybe it will end up being even cooler mechanism when revealed X:
