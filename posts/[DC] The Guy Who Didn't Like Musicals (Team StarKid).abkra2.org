** StarKid musicals are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA][sometimes]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVuNlu0LCk][popular]] here, so I thought I'd link this one to let everyone know it's out (although it is not especially rational, it does deconstruct two genres). Happy New Year!

**** It's about a tribe that discovers fire, and the consequences. More broadly it is about the perils of attempted rationalism. Two of the main characters take turns as tribal leader, one being evicted after revealing the truth behind the tribe's delusions and rejecting change, another accidentally destroying the environment by embracing technology too enthusiastically. Unlike /Twisted/, which critiques laziness and naivete straightforwardly, /Firebringer/ presents us with the paradoxical upsides of these vices. Overall I'd say it is relatively rationalist, perhaps less explicitly so than /Twisted/. In contrast I would say that /The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals/ is not so rationalist, but merely a (well-executed, hilarious) genre deconstruction.

This makes me think of [[http://neglectedbooks.com/?p=45][The Evolution Man]]. Almost the same scenario and conflict, among the other (hilarious) things.
