Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I run a larp where, against my better judgement, we gave the players a nano assembler. Pour material in top, product comes out the bottom, as long as it has plenty of the proper molecules in the "in" hopper.

It also needs to completely take apart (and destroy) any item to scan it into a blueprint.

How badly will this ruin the game, and how can we stop it?

Note: weapons are DNA coded, so if you copy those, only 1 person can use them.

*** This is probably extremely powerful, since they can mass produce anything provided they can get one copy and enough supply of raw materials, but it depends on how your world is set up.

One solution is to design your world such that all of the powerful equipment contains some quantity of rare material, with more powerful equipment requiring larger quantities (or rare materials). Effectively, you could use it mechanically as an NPC shopkeeper with infinite stock, using the rare material as currency. If, for example, your rare material is gold, then maybe this cool weapon requires 5 oz of gold, and this cool armor requires 20 oz of gold, and this cool helmet requires 20 oz of gold, and they have to ration their supply and choose what to "buy".

This doesn't prevent them from mass producing common items like food by feed a tree into their machine, but if you're in a world where nano assemblers exist and aren't extraordinarily rare then the economy should reflect that and prevent most extreme market exploitation. But you'll need to make sure all of your market prices reflect that.

If nano assemblers are extraordinarily rare and their use isn't capped by rare materials, such that they actually are overpowered, then that means everyone would want one. This means that super powerful and influential people are going to want to come and steal it from them. You could either use this to throw more powerful enemies at them to compensate for their increase in strength from having this, or you could use it to force them to lose it by having an overpowered enemy defeat them and steal it from them. I don't suggest going as extreme as that, but perhaps it would be appropriate to throw some extra tough enemies at them and have them face a higher threat of losing than they usually face. If they win they can keep it, but might have similar battles in the future, if they lose they lose their nano assembler, but also lose the interest of this organization and thus face normal battles in the future (or go on a quest to get it back if they want)

*** Depending how fast this thing works, the person who holds it is more powerful than Miss Militia. They get to make any tool or weapon for any obscure situation as long as they've seen one once. You will never be able to give them a quest which involves collecting a bunch of something, and you will have to make sure that any puzzles you give them can't be unintentionally solved by any tool they have ever used before. Each player should drop their weapons into the machine and then print out new ones so they can never be broken, stolen, or otherwise rendered impotent. They will always have the pinnacle of everything they have ever collected, and anything less useful in most situations which might have a fringe use somewhere else is something they can and will have available at all times. For the rest of the game, they get to turn random garbage loot into the best items they can possibly have.

If you're ok with that, then go ahead.

*** Well for one you expect them to get filthy rich off copying precious gems and other highly valuable substances made of common elements. Plus they can then use the machine to then copy any highly valuable things they buy with their millions of dollars.

You also expect them to copy the best explosive they can get ahold of any amount of, meaning they will have massive amounts of high grade explosives quite rapidly, and the number of problems which can be solved with explosives should not be understated.

***** I mean honestly the best explosive you're likely to get to work here (assuming non-nuclear since trying to go nuclear would be extremely difficult and likely to kill you a million different ways) is octanitrocubane (2.38 times better than TnT) which is 30% better than the HMX used in military application (though much more expensive). Trying to get do all the engineering work required to figure out how to get another explosive set up that will massively beat existing explosives is just too much effort for too little results (given it would be a mission in its own right). Even getting some octanitrocubane would require enough work that it might not be worth it when you can just use existing explosives that are /nearly/ as good.

Still like I said you shouldn't underestimate how OP having access to pretty much unlimited amounts of high end military weaponry and explosives is likely to be. I mean for one it makes it quite feasible for the party to just defeat every enemy using anti-tank rifles, missile launchers and lots of explosives (plus given the tech level needed for a nano assembler prototype to exist the party might well start mass producing weaponized drones and never actually get into combat). Also carrying around all these explosives isn't that much of a hazard either if you wanted to punish them that way, since military grade explosives are generally difficult to set off (shooting it usually won't work).

***** I think you kind of have to assume the assembler is a one of a kind prototype otherwise the assemblers would be absolutely everywhere. After all there's no reason you can't use a assembler to create large numbers of smaller assemblers (or even larger one's in multiple pieces).

My point is that if this sort of nanotech were widespread then pretty much the entire setting is going to totally revolve around it, which it isn't stated to. So either it's a one of a kind prototype, or this tech would be /everywhere/ in which case letting the players have one would be impossible to avoid to to their prevalence.

******* Yeah you're right it kind of /has/ to be alien tech or the like. After all the more I think about it the more I realize it /can't possibly/ have been made by humans through a standard R&D process.

After all if it was then it should be trivial to create an unlimited number of these devices and the world ought to already be post scarcity with people basically having star trek replicators.

And yeah I don't really get the impression that the setting in question is the sort of totally post scarcity one that would be the case with widespread replicators.

*** You are combining A LOT of functions into one device. It not only prints, but also scans and dissassembles.

So why does the nano assembler have a scanner inside? Thats an easy way to restrain the abuse. Have them use expensive DRM-plans or go to use open source/cracked "recipes" with their own disadvantages. See "The Diamond Age" by Neal Stevenson for inspiration.

Cracked weapon recipes wouldnt have to be DNA coded, but might stutter or explode at unopportune times.

Raw-stuff is also another restrictable parameter- you cant feed your paper printer coal to print stuff. Ink needs to be manufactured to specification and is protected by DRM, and is about the most expensive fluid on the planet. Why would that be any different with nanotech? Get rid of the disassembler.

Shadowrun RPG has nanotech. They govern that with "nano-desktop-forges" can make everything you can buy on the free market, but you pay 10%-25% more for the raw-stuff.

Stuff to look out for: have everything applicable made of diamond - its just Carbon deposited in a certain way. Knives/Windshields/Glasses from it.

If, as you answered to my other question, there are no nanites yet - why give them a super mature nano-tech device? You are handing them the equivalent of 2050 PC in 1960. Just give them access to a prototype with all its flaws. Think a 1990-2000 PC in 1960, still awesome tech, but no-one can fix the bugs, there are little programs to run, any technicians/coder that program for it need to be kept silent etc etc.

**** EDIT:

Also energy costs and its size. If it needs to be put on a SUV/Truck, its abuse potential during operations is hampered.

And if they want to make grendades/explosives they need to actually store the energy in the explosve. A rough estimation gives 200g TNT per grenade, thats 200kj, meaning a standard power outlet will take about ... 100 seconds. Mh, thats less than I expected.

One problem there is that while diamond is /hard/, it's not /tough/. So you'd probably end up with cheap-but-fragile products.

If so, you could make a ton of money going into medicine, drugs, wine or industrial components.

Alternately, use it to forge perfect copies or money or art.

To block this, I might say that the machine works by re arranging tiny particles of ceramics, metal and polymer.

This prevents chemistry, most forgery, and anything with true micro circuits. That leaves you with reduced item costs, but nothing world breaking.
