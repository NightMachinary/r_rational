For those who don't know what this is about: Overwatch fanfic with significant transhumanism, anti death, pro rationality and other coolio neatos.


** Ok so this chapter looks like a lore build episode. One small note, the scene could benefit from a bit more explaining of who is who.

** I'm trying to figure out what the technobabble at the start's consequences are and how it relates to what happened afterwards.

[[#s][spoilers]]

I think that covers the major implications if I'm interpreting it correctly. Anyone come to different conclusions?

*** I came to the same conclusion. My guess is that the culprit in the end will be the Iris. Zenyatta says "all are one within the Iris", which you might interpret as either a nondenominational afterlife oooor something along the lines of a matrix style simulation. (Are we supposed to spoiler our WMG?)

** Hmm. Interesting chapter. I'm still rather confused as to how the dragons came to be, though the conclusion seems to be they came into being based on the Shimada ancestor's conviction that there had to be dragons. Sort of a "perception = reality" vibe. But it still isn't clear why that would be, though the beginning blurb about systems implies it's an inherent feature of the world

*** I think it's more the dragons coming to be because Athena (or some other god program) put them there (unless I'm mistaking something.)

**** This is way back in the day though; this is pre-Athena. The Shimada in question is Genji's ancestor.

***** It's beginning to look like this entire thing is a simulation of a god-AI using the brain-states mercy saved. Winston gave it away in chapter 6: "Descartes' genius malignus"
