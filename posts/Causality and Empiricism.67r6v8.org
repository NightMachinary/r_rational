** There doesn't appear, to my knowledge, to be a fully solid proof of the problem of induction; that being said, pretty much everyone accepts it as axiomatic at some level (For a detailed proof of this, place your hand on a hot stove. After treating the burns, do it again. There's no /real/ reason to think it'll hurt again, right?)

Once you have a somewhat hacked-together proof of empiricism, causality comes the same way.

** I've been playing with a pet answer to the problem of induction for a while. It's not really a fully developed idea yet, but, essentially, if you deny that it's meaningful to divide the world into parts or times or whatever, and instead insist that reality is just reality, it becomes more defensible to insist that the rules that work to describe t=1 will also work at t=2. The problem of induction sort of presupposes the idea that it's meaningful to make a distinction between different events or locations or causes. Obviously there are problems with this account, but I think it's a viable path forward. I feel like there are also potential tie-ins to Occam's Razor here.
