Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You can create a cube of iron with a 5 inch side once in 24 hours.

The iron is elementally pure, and the surface of the cube is smooth (but not perfectly smooth). It is otherwise unremarkable and indistinguishable from any other iron cube.

It will be created at will between your hands held in a specific way to "hug" the cube at the opposite corners, no millimetre precision required.

The cube will completely replace whatever fluids existed in its space prior, gas or liquid, including air. Any solids would block the power without "wasting" its use, but particles smaller than a millimetre are ignored.

You must be conscious and intend to do it, you cannot be tricked or made to do it involuntarily (but it's possible to threaten, bribe or blackmail). You won't accidentally use this power while asleep, drunk or drugged.

You can't "save up" and make a bigger cube by waiting longer than 24 hours.

The cube will have zero velocity in your own reference frame.

*Edit:* none of the measurable aspects of this power are consistent enough to be used as a precise measurement sample and have a slight amount of variation (i.e. the size of the cube is not exactly 5.00000.... inches, the waiting period varies by a few nanoseconds and so on).

**** At the very least, if you can live past the singularity and get immortality, you can try to avert the heat death of the universe. A 5x5x5 inch cube of iron should be about 16 kg, which if completely annihilated is equivalent to 1.4 x 10^{18} Joules per day, or 1.7 × 10^{13} watts, which is very close to the total amount of electricity used over the whole earth currently. So at the very least you could power a large colony forever, though whether it ended up housing thousands or trillions of people would depend on whether you have people walking around and needed to use power to grow food since you don't have stars anymore, or if everyone is uploaded into hyper-efficient computers.

*** Erase quantum information (e.g. replace some liquid/gaseous qbit with your cube). Example: prepare qbits in the state 1/sqrt(2)/(|01>-|00>), erase the second qbit: => 1/sqrt(2)/(|0x>-|0x>)=0 => universe destroyed. If you can't prepare your qbits in exactly that state (which should be the case) you merely made your own reality more "improbable" on a multiversal scale. Could still allow for weird trade and blackmail.

Fix 1: Automatically re-scale the amplitude to 1. As the quantum states are imperfect you will end up with a bigger-than-expected probability for the state |1x>. Might be useful for quantum computing.

Fix 2 (which is rather sensible): Make the cube interact with the matter it replaces, absorbing its information. No more quantum-information-sorcery.

Fix 3: Simply assume that quantum multiverse-theory is wrong (replaced by Bohmian mechanics or something else). Quantum mechanics as we know it wouldn't work without fix 2 anyway, as information ought to be preserved.

***** Think of the universe as consisting of exactly two qbits. Then reality is just a state

a|00>+b|01>+c|10>+d|11> with coefficients a,b,c,d whose square means something like "probability to find the universe in that state".

Now by destroying the second qbit in a universe like my post described, you end up with the state

0=0|0x> + 0|1x> where x symbolises destroyed qbits. In reality x stands for "many electrons and quarks arranged in the shape of an iron cube", which actually are many qbits. It's just replacing text and adding more summands with coefficients that are all 0. Similarly the real universe is a collection of many qbits and produces thus many coefficients that are 0 as well.

Important is: the probability to find the universe in /any/ state is now 0. Which practically means non-existence.

******* Removing the parts of any wavefunction in the area of the cube is not the same as replacing the matter. It's more like "measuring the position of all particles and noticing they aren't in that area anyway".

Example: consider an electron in two possible positions (0 if empty) and a qbit that shows L/R if the electron is left/right. Possible state of the experiment: 1/sqrt(2)(|L10>+|R01>)

Removing any basis vector with the electron in the right position yields 1/sqrt(2)(|L10>) Afterwards you add your metal cube, but that won't change the qbit.

So you'll never get the result "I had an electron in the right position put it was replaced with a metal cube". The electron will always have been left.

Not sure if that's what you meant, though, when you said "removing basis vectors".

*** Hmm, this is a good one. Simply having the iron doesn't seem to give you that much of an advantage. Iron's too common and it's too small of an amount to sell for anything useful, the scrap value of saving it up for a year only comes to about $600 through cursory Googling. Honestly whatever you could do with the iron itself seems to be a bit boring because you could probably end up with more iron by working a regular job and buying it.

So what you're left with is the interesting side effect of the power, namely:

#+begin_quote
  The cube will completely replace whatever fluids existed in its space prior, gas or liquid, including air. Any solids would block the power without "wasting" its use, but particles smaller than a millimetre are ignored.
#+end_quote

So as a starting point if something is gas, liquid, or you can shred it up into fine enough particles (I'm assuming this works on all fine powders?) you can completely remove it from existence. Next step is to figure out the most useful thing to remove given those conditions. For that though, I'd probably ask a material physicist or chemist. I personally can't figure out how to take over the world with this power, but what I'd probably do with it is help remove hazardous byproducts of chemical processes or experiments. I'm sure there has to be something small enough that being able to remove 25 cubic inches of it a day would be incredibly useful.

I'm also sure there has to be some kind of physics exploit if you can replace something extremely hot, cold, or maybe under pressure with a room temperature iron cube that's not.

Just wait until they enter a water drinking contest, drink as much water as they can stand and win the first place prize, and have the cube appear in their bladder replacing the urine as you hoist them in the air by their hips out of "joy" for them winning.

Since bladders can inflate up to six inches in size, the cube should just fit in their body killing them.

EDIT: Nevermind. I just reread the requirements. I thought the cube could just appear between your hands no matter how wide the distance between your hands. I missed the part about having the hands in position to "hug" the corners.

It's the best attempt I could do to enforce the "spirit" of the idea, I suppose in a regular sci-fi or fantasy setting it would be simply described as the ability to get a lump of iron out of thin air as if by magic. In such regular fiction there seem to be a few "feel by" rules which such magic obeys that are hard to define - that's why classic Flash does not set anything including himself on fire with air friction, and time machines know exactly "when" and "where" it is, so you don't end up in space by merely travelling a second to the past or future.

*** Well if you live long enough to see anti-aging tech or a singularity developed then you could use this power to push back the heat death of the universe indefinitely. Since [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ][the mass energy in an iron cube of this size could power a digital civilization of truly stupendous size in the degenerate era]].

Plus in all likelihood since the 24 hours is probably based on your own subjective time you could generate vastly more energy output: Simply having your mind running extremely quickly (this is extremely effective but may not work if the power is only concerned with your relativistic reference frame), and by having the rest of your digital civilization orbiting extremely close to small black holes. This would effectively mean as far as they were concerned you are accelerated in time and producing energy much faster (with you being a digital lifeform at this point as well, so you could offset the time dilation with a faster clock speed).

In the short term however you could use this power to become extremely famous on the grounds of being the only documented supernatural phenomenon. This level of fame would automatically afford you enough wealth to live very comfortable without needing to work. Plus since your iron blocks are created magically people will probably be willing to pay a lot of money for them, even if there's nothing actually remarkable about them other than their method of creation.

** You are able to chose any DIN A4 sheet of paper you can see and make it the target of your ability. Only one such target may exist at any given time, so doing so while another sheet is affected will remove your ability from that (previous) sheet. The ability furthermore wears of on its own if the sheet ceases to be in a state in which it would be a valid target of this ability.

As for the effect of the ability, you are able to perceive when someone else looks at one of the surfaces of this sheet of paper. This applies even if the surface is only partially seen.

It also applies if it is seen via proxy (a photo, video, etc.) while the ability is still active on that specific sheet, in this case however at least one of the surfaces must fully be visible and the depicted sheet must still be DIN A4 - photoshopping it to be green would not undo the ability, but altering its dimensions would.

Whenever you notice someone looking at an instance of your sheet, "time freezes" such that (and ONLY such that) your conscious may freely create any physically possible appearance of that sheet. To their perception, the sheet (in all of its instances) will from then on have that appearance, so long as this ability remains active on that sheet, and they will no longer trigger the ability.

You are ONLY informed of the fact that someone perceived the sheet, nothing else (at least not by means of this ability). Not who, not which instance, not where.... just the fact that it happened. You can make the sheet appear transparent or reflective.

Time FREEZES?! As in, you have unlimited time to think of an appearance for the sheet?

Can you use that time to think about things other than the sheet? There's plenty of stuff I need to think about and nowhere enough time for me to do so, so this time freeze would be super awesome. You can spend an eternity working out new mathematical/logical theorems in your head, writing songs and novels and poems, etc etc. The only limit would be how much you can keep in your head at the same time, which is again something you can train using unlimited time, or just brute force memorize through endless repetition.

**** While I would argue that it is only for the purpose of designing the appearance of the sheet, so long as you're thinking of applying information obtained through attempting to figure out mathematical theorems to the sheet (even if only in the sense of "writing down" related data), that could effectively be bypased. So yes, this is an ability that grants you infinite thinking time, repeatedly. Do note however that only your conscious will still function, and the ability does not come with a prevention against the insanity that would likely be caused by being completely shut of from all of your senses for prolonged periods of time. That's only minor though since you can just stop and continue in the next instance, once you've recovered. Still, I believe this would somewhat limit the extend to which this aspect of the ability could be used.

*** It seems like there's two different benefits here, one short term one post-singularity. In the short term you could get quite wealthy from the fame associated with having the only documented supernatural ability, plus you could use the ability to massively assist in art. Since for instance you could make people who see a given sheet through a proxy see it as a perfect 3D screen with them just viewing the page through a display which wraps around their entire field of vision. This means that you can use this ability to create perfect visual VR movies with graphics and special effects all being indistinguishable from reality.\\
So by making people pay to see these VR movies (since you can only have one playing at a time) you could easily become one of the wealthiest people alive. After all as many people can pay to see these movies as currently spend money in the global film industry and people would probably be willing to pay far more for this, so overtaking Jeff Bezos in wealth seems possible for you.

The time stop power could also be used to beat the heat death of the universe if you live until anti-aging tech/a singularity. Since after all free computation is fundamentally equivalent to free energy and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon][can be turned into free energy]]. Notably since you can gain potentially infinite amounts of subjective time during this (so long as it's in /some/ way related to altering an A4 page's appearance) there's no limits on your potential energy outputs. Additionally in the far future when you would be a digital superintelligence, you could basically act as a hypercomputer. Able to run entire universes lasting for arbitrary subjective time.\\
So once heat death started to be a concern, in all likelihood it might just make sense to have the entire rest of digital civilization switched to being run by you. That way you could have everybody switch to existing in a timeless hypercomputer and thus not even worry about the physical/computational constraints of reality. Basically this would mean you could become a benevolent god running an entire multiverse of infinite universes full of utopian worlds for infinite time.

Maxwell's Demon is only really an example, the larger point is that you can get free computation from free energy. The maxwell's demon example itself could work but you'd need a very cold universe (to take advantage of landauer limit) and very high energy particles to make that specific idea practical.

Firstly as said before I'm definitely assuming you're a superintelligence running on a cosmic scale megastructure here. Assuming the power would be linked to some specific physical structure just isn't tenable given your bodies replacement of cells and atoms after all. Your point about non-infinite memory is good though dependant on how the power actually works. After all since you still form memories while "timeless" your memories have to be getting stored temporarily within this abilities power since it can't make any changes to your brain in lieu of time. So there's no real reason to expect the temporary memory bank alloted to you by the power to actually be equal to the capacity of your memory.\\
Should your memory be limited however then while that would require you cut corners in your simulations (not running anything beyond the bare minimum required to be apparently realistic or at least nice seeming for its inhabitants, plus probably not really storing memory of anything beyond people's memories) and do things through methods that minimized memory at the cost of run time and (normal) energy costs. Still with a massive megastructure and a degenerate era digital civilization the amount of processing you could do would still be truly unfathomable.

The power specifies "you", so you're assuming that it applies even if you're entirely uploaded (and probably even if there are multiple copies of you, which opens up another can of worms).

However, stuff like this is almost always from superhero fiction, where abilities are usually a function of the body/brain rather than a function of the being.

Except no this ability can't actually be a function of your body in any way. Since the time stop function requires that it be able to somehow run your mind on something other than your brain while time is frozen. Rather the power must be either recognizing some very vague (so it doesn't stop working for you as you get older and your brain changes somewhat) pattern in your brain, or more likely it is just granting access to the power to the same pattern of mental activity that it initially gave the power to. Either way you could exploit either of those interpretations to keep the powers after having altered yourself to be scarcely human.

Given the lack of any limits on how much energy this power can use (even if you couldn't bring it back to the regular world doing any amount of processing for infinite time still means infinite energy was somehow expended) there's no reason to think there would be any safeguards preventing the entirety of your superhuman mind from "piggybacking" along with whichever specific parts of your mind the power recognizes. Though of course as said before it's not literally bringing physical matter with it, but rather somehow running your mind on some timeless substrate while active. Additionally as suggested earlier while it may recognize only a portion of your mind (since otherwise it would stop working given normal aging) if it instead it recognizes your mind based on continuity of experience or the like then that could easily be extended to cover a mind of arbitrary size.

That doesn't really work as an explanation since saying it's just mediated by a god would basically mean that how the power worked would be purely a matter matter of that god's whims and thus make the entire exercise of trying to figure out what this power could do utterly pointless.\\
Whereas if the power is following some self consistent internal logic then you run into the fact that every function of your brain is being brought into the timestop despite many of them changing dramatically over time (plus it never suggests if you had brain damage or weren't fully neurologically developed you would lose your power later). This means unless you make massive unfounded assumption about the power (such as it either stopping working pretty easily if your brain changes slightly, or those new parts of your mind being excluded from the timestop) it has to use a different standard than just only working if your minds substrate is similar enough to what it was when you got the power. And virtually every self consistent standard it /could/ be using easily allows one to ensure the power keeps working even with drastic changes to your mental substrate.

This isn't a matter of applying real world physics on the power, but on expecting the power to just work in a self consistent way, since otherwise this whole thread is an exercise in futility.

************ I usually interpret the call to munchkinry as "What can are the unintuitive ways that this could be exploited," looking at the applications of whatever is being described. It's usually safe to make secondary assumptions about most-likely ways that a power should also function (see the other threads, mentioning using the sheet as scratch space for arbitrary thinking), but the whole point of supernatural abilities is that they defy the usual paradigms.

As an example of the stretch I think you're making, the munchkin response to gaining super endurance shouldn't be "route deoxygenated, sugar-low blood through my body for free energy" because there are too many ways for the power to work.

I wouldn't be objecting so strenuously if you had said "This is one way the power might work; here's how to test whether it does, and if so, then here's what you can do." But you didn't; you've been assuming that what you see as self-consistent is the only possible way for it to work.

************* The issue here I see mainly is that I've thought about this a fair bit and I can't come up with any possible self consistent way the power could work which would disallow you to change your mind dramatically. Without /also/ disallowing non-transhumans from keeping their powers in many circumstances that one should really expect to have been mentioned.

*** Does this trigger once per person and allow for different people to see different things at the same time? For example, if your sheet would be in a room with 10 people who haven't seen it yet, and they look one by one, do you get 10 separate events? What if they all look at the same time?

**** Once per person per use of the ability, "resets" are inderectly posible by reapplying the ability. You get 10 instances if 10 people look, always. (So yes, different people get to see different things if you so choose.)

*** The time freezing aspect is more interesting than the trap aspect.

You want to do some writing. So you look at a sheet and then have your transcriber look at it. You have infinitely long to come up with a story, then they type it into your word processor so everyone can view it. You'd finish nanowrimo in a day.

But more realistically, you'd earn the big bucks by repeating the same trick as a computer programmer. You wouldn't even need to have someone transcribe it, since once you've thought up the answer, reproducing it is trivial on your side. You would legitimately be a 100x productive programmer, and could single-handedly build startups (well, plus someone to trigger it).
