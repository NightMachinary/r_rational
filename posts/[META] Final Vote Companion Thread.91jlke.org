This is the companion thread to the [[/r/rational]] sidebar rewrite vote thread, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/91jltk/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/][which is currently running now]]. Please see that thread for links to past discussions and further details.

If you have any comments or concerns about the vote to bring up, please do so here. That other thread is locked to comments, but still accepts votes just fine.


** I'd like to note that I downvoted 4 or so posts which I really like --- which go into details and nuances that distinguish the concept from others --- but any average, non-PhD holding redditor directed to the sub (someone who would benefit from reading ratfic most) would fall asleep on the third or so sentence.

In retrospect, brainstorming the content and then the form separately would be a better way to go. Nevertheless there are enough readable sidebar proposals to proceed.

EDIT: I think I explained myself horribly. The one I voted is great, it's not like I "settled" for it. I'm just saying I valued clarity and conciseness over completeness. 10k word complete definitions can go in the wiki just fine, but we're voting for something that will go in the sidebar.

Though I do think that the sidebar isn't the be-all and end-all to introducing readers to the essential concepts of the subreddit, since interested readers will necessarily come upon the tenets of rational fiction during their time here. As I opined in a previous post, a definition (for me) is /good enough/ if it makes the idea of rationality more approachable to the average reader. My personal preference would be something of an irreverent 5th bullet "Just kidding, the actual definition of rational fiction is [link to compilation of definitions and this month's brainstorming]."

** Characteristics of Rational Fiction:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: characteristics-of-rational-fiction
   :END:

- Characters think and act in ways that are consistent with their beliefs/values, motives, and worldview. They are rational agents, in the sense that they have /agency/ as unique individuals who pursue their own goals and don't exist only to facillitate the plot.

- The characters solve problems or achieve their goals through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. More importantly, these thought processes are usually transparent or at least plausibly reproducible to the reader through details in the story. Ideally, they go beyond obvious solutions and exploit their knowledge and resources creatively.

- The fictional setting has logical and/or consistent rules. Even if the world resists our common sense or "it's just magic", the author thinks through the effects and implications and makes an effort to remove or justify seeming incongruities. Worldbuilding should reflect the previous two points, e.g. social structures and the world-system should be the realistic consequences of such characters.

** In Rational/ist/ Fiction:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: in-rationalist-fiction
   :END:

- Rationalist fiction is about [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][/showing/ good thinking]], through the perspective of an intelligent character, so that the reader can reproduce or internalize those cognitive skills. If a story is structured like a puzzle, the reader can conceivably arrive at the same (or even alternate correct) conclusions by applying similar thought processes, reasoning, and techniques from cognitive science, logic, game theory, etc.

******* During discussions, the following ideas for the definition seemed to be popular:

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e26dscc/][It's inclusive, not exclusive]]. It shouldn't be a list of must-have attributes, but a relatively vague definition, with /possibly/ a list of emergent properties.

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e254z4e/][It defines what it /does/, not what it /is/]]. E. g., instead of saying "rational fiction has sensible characters", it says "rational fiction focuses on exploring thoughtful characters".

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e25tfp1/][It has a grab-bag of adjacent tropes]].

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e2f02fa/][It defines "rationality" as a qualifier, not as a genre]].

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e299xvf/][It describes author intent, not emergent properites]].

******** 1. I agree with the principle (most of my previous replies were to the same effect), but a definition is -by definition- creating boundaries and exclusions. Like most of these bullets, it has the problem of edging into convoluted legalese, e.g. "including but not limited to". However it's entirely possible to word a definition to be open to interpretation. If your concern is excluding emergent properties, the best way to crack open my or anyone's definition is to identify what it has wrongly excluded.

2. [[/u/haiku_fornification]] had an interesting idea, but the example was flawed. I like the idea that ratfics should explore the setting, but I'm not sure whether it's /necessary/ in the inclusive/exclusive sense. "Coherent" is funnily enough a synonym for "logical and consistent." It's certainly true that consistency can be an accidental byproduct of ignoring the setting, but we also have to ask whether a story can be a ratfic if the rules aren't consistent (coherent). I feel like that's a binary that's non-negotiable in the spirit of rationality. Nevertheless, I feel like my 2nd/3rd sentences of #3 is an adequate qualifier/substitute for "explore" and being more than just internal consistency; "exploring" can also be implied in the wording (e.g. #1-2).

3. A list of adjacent tropes and themes is useful for this subreddit's fiction-hunting purposes, but not necessary as part of the core definition. It does more closely approximate what [[/r/rational]] values in a rational story, but it's too diverse. I feel like there's an important distinction to be made between a comprehensive definition and a sidebar definition. My issue with most of the redefinitions is that they read like wikipedia articles, attempting to capture everything rather than introducing fundamental or common themes.

4. I like the idea that rationality comes in a spectrum. However, in a definition, it's avoiding responsibility for pinning down the genre. Anyways the response covered the issues with thinking of rationality as only a quality.

5. I disagree as well. A genre shouldn't be defined by the author's intent, as it is the readers who decide what qualifies. Though [[/u/ArisKatsaris]]'s actual definition is more a combination between #2 (defining what RT does) and #4 (list of qualities).

You didn't give an actual analysis, so I'm not sure what you're thinking, but I didn't write the proposal to overhaul the sidebar definition. My intentions were to cover the fundamental issues people had with it (mainly being overly specific and vague in areas) while also incorporating what I saw as the common threads in all of the other definitions.

Voting started eight hours ago, and three people already stated similar opinions. It implies that a statistically non-insignificant part of the community shares this concern, yet it wasn't raised almost at all during actual discussions. It's concerning.

And frankly, I disagree with it. I don't think that trying to tailor the definition for people who don't want to read one sentence unless it's /exciting/ is a good idea. If they're so disinterested, they won't stay around anyway.

******** Sounds like a rather droll mirror of [[http://www.chs.ubc.ca/participatory/docs/Paradox%20of%20Democracy.htm][the paradox of democracy]]. The active sub vets, rationality-educated "citizenry" are the ones are who are most involved in the redefining process, and the more lukewarm, apathetic members (like me) merely engage in the final product of the process: the vote. I'm self-conscious of my complicity in this discontinuity, but I'm not surprised I'm not the only one commenting given the disproportionate emphasis on voting in a democracy. Someone made a joke about appointing a Benevolent Dictator For Life - is it time to execute?

I'm not advocating an /exciting/ definition. The words I emphasized are cogency and approachability. However, I don't think it's beneficial to hold a sour grapes attitude toward potential newcomers on the basis of rationality pedagogy. I'm more for "if they're even remotely interested, give them a reason to stick around longer."

********* But is that /really/ something worth aiming for? Something approachable/accessible which catches the attention of random passers-by?

This is how I see it.

Accurate or accessible, either way the definition will function in part as a filtering mechanism. I think the community and the genre itself would benefit from a more accurate definition so newcomers can get their bearings straight and filter themselves out if they aren't a good match for the community.

It's not a sour grapes attitude, it's just a necessity; demarcating yourself as "a community" or "a genre" and defining who or what is a part of it implicitly means that you're also defining who or what /isn't/ a part of it. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. House and Doc Brown and Rick Sanchez - as great as those characters are - aren't part of it. That doesn't mean we think there's something inherently inferior about Sherlock Holmes and it doesn't mean that we hate him, it just means that he belongs here about as much as he belongs in the MCU or a Victorian romance or a stoner comedy or a Tolkienesque fantasy.

The whole point of rewriting the sidebar is to try to make the definition more specific, because as it stands it's already too accessible. If the definition is too accessible/inclusive and doesn't differentiate rational/ist fiction as its own genre, /any/ work from /any/ genre could be argued as being "rational" as long as it's got characters who behave believably and world-building without any holes in it. Whatever the new definition ends up being, it should make sure that potential future authors and community members write and submit content that belongs here so the genre doesn't end up getting diluted into irrelevance.

No, it wasn't the /whole/ point. The current sidebar was too vague in some ways, and too specific in others.

*********** Your suggested rewrite vis-a-vis rational*ist* fiction:

#+begin_quote
  The author *describes* rationalist and scientific principles and techniques which can be applied by readers in real life.
#+end_quote

I'd argue that that fundamentally misses the point.

Yudkowsky arguably codified the genre. Let's see what what he has to say about it.

#+begin_quote
  I once read - though I don't remember where - a proverb which has stayed with me ever since: Nonfiction conveys knowledge. Fiction conveys /experience./

  When we enter a fictional world, we aren't just learning facts about the characters and the world, we are /living their lives/ and vicariously gaining their experiences.

  If you do the practice and learn the skills of both science writing and fiction writing, you can do something that ordinary textbook authors /cannot/ do, which is to put the reader directly into the shoes of a character as they use a science the way it is meant to be used. You can share the /experience/ (not just the facts) of what it is like to understand and apply simple Mendelian genetics.

  If there's anything I hope that Serious Writers pick up from HPMOR, it's the idea of using fiction to convey the /experience/ of cognitive skills.
#+end_quote

The point of rationalist fiction is that it doesn't just describe principles/techniques, it conveys them through the lived experience of the main character, showing instead of telling. Simply dropping in explanations or descriptions of the scientific method or the prisoner's dilemma or the planning fallacy or whatever might be enough to get a work over the "rational" bar, but it shouldn't be enough to allow a story to be classified as /rationalist./

#+begin_quote
  The readers who /intensely/ loved the intelligence of the characters in HPMOR weren't being impressed by the rocket-broomstick or other feats of Level 2 Intelligence. They were impressed by the detail on how Harry thinks through to the solutions he uses, the heuristics that Harry used to come up with his answer, the alternatives he considered and discarded. They felt themselves learning how to think better by watching Harry think, and from watching Harry himself learn to think better.

  This level of character intelligence cannot be faked at all, by any literary artifice.

  You cannot do it by namedropping cog-sci terminology, trying to signal that you are part of the rationalist ingroup, because reading those phrases will not teach anyone how to think. Even if they look up the phrase ‘planning fallacy' online, you haven't taught them to think from within your own writing, you have not /shown-not-told/ intelligence and thereby /sneezed it onto them/.
#+end_quote

You cannot sneeze intelligence onto the reader by *describing* principles and techniques. An author's description of techniques is not the point. The point is a character's experience of /thinking while using said techniques/, which is something significantly harder to pull off and is not a trivial difference of semantics.

************ Seems a minor wording issue, which you overinterpret as 'fundamentally missing the point'.

I used 'describes' rather than 'shows' because it felt to me that 'describes' actually felt more like 'going into detail, experiencing the process', while 'shows' felt to me actually more removed than "describes", like pointing at a mountain in a distance.

But I'm not a native English speaker, native speakers may feel differently about what each word connotates.

Either way, corrections in wording would have been nice to have during the previous week, when I could still fiddle with said wording, and asked the community at large what they felt each word connotated. If my definition wins, I could still afterwards ask the community / coordinate with moderators, with whether minor such wording changes can still be done.

How do you feel about "depicts", btw?
