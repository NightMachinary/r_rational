Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Waldo_Wiki][Here's the Waldo Wiki]], which I should have known existed. The details are quite thin, as one might expect, but the world as laid out has a number of features that I think are intriguing:

1. Waldo wanders all through time and space with [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Waldo%27s_walking_stick][a magic walking stick]] given to him by Wizard Whitebeard.
2. Waldo isn't just Waldo, he's /a/ Waldo, one of many. He goes to the [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Land_of_Waldos][Land of Waldos]] and meets exact (?) duplicates of himself.
3. Waldo has a villain, [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/Odlaw][Odlaw]], who is after Waldo's magic staff. Canonically, he wants to use this to steal gold from Fort Knox, which is stupid.
4. Odlaw isn't just Odlaw, he's /an/ Odlaw, one of many, from [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Odlaw_Swamp][the Odlaw Swamp]].

I have so many questions that need to be answered here.

Does the land of Waldos imply that there's a land of every other sort of person? Does Waldo not feel any existential dread at meeting people identical to himself? Is there a reason that Waldo and Odlaw exist as opposites to each other? Are Odlaw's plans for the magical staff so simple as he claims? And if Odlaw isn't able to travel through time and space (because he doesn't have the staff) how does he keep ending up where Waldo is? What's Whitebeard's role in all this? Is there some reason behind why Waldo is traveling around beyond just tourism? Is this a Quantum Leap style "he goes where he's needed" thing?

***** Including information from the TV series (I watched recordings of it when I was kid, and feel I have useful if not perfectly accurate memory of it), I would propose that, as is often the case in these sorts of situations, everything started with the Wizard.

Whitebeard is magical, both in the sense that he can craft magical items of great power (such as the walking cane, and his own staff), but also in a way inherent to his nature. Whitebeard is unique across all of the worlds (which may be why he is so powerful, have the entirety of essence concentrated in a single instance of himself).

Being both a somewhat human being, and in a place of significant personal power, Whitebeard sees that there is a great amount of suffering across reality, desires to replace it with joy.

Waldo, the one who possesses the cane, is special in his own way. Ordinarily, a person's image is scattered across the multitude. Some, however, such as Waldo, are (/part of) a collective. He was taken from that collective (by his own future self, through temporal shenanigans) to the conventional world we see in the earlier books. This disturbs the balance that a collective requires to be stable, and so the World of Waldos was split in two, half being perverted into the Odlaw Swamp. Due to this imbalance, an Odlaw (though not necessarily the same one each time) is forcefully pushed into any world which Waldo w/ Cane enters, and forcefully removed when he leaves.

Whitebeard grants the estranged Waldo the cane for two reasons. The first, is simply that, through happenstance, Waldo came to interact with Wenda, another being akin to Whitebeard (although she was initially split unevenly in two, the other part going by the name Wilma, Whitebeard rectified this through the use of a magical artifact), who he was planning on recruiting as an apprentice of sorts. Waldo shows himself (and thus his collective) to be trustworthy and good-hearted to Wenda, and so to Whitebeard as well. The other reason is that, as a member of a collective who has been removed from them by circumstance, Waldo is in fact distinctly prepared to handle the existence of multiple worlds, and the multitudes of people within and across them, as his history has shown him both of these things.

Whitebeard desires help in his endeavor, as, while he is immensely powerful, he is still ultimately unique, singular, a trait which he cannot rectify without losing the power he possesses.

***** The value of marriage for society exists primarily in its status as a precommitment. The apparent benefits of dissolving any given marriage are outweighed by the damage done to the precommitment. Hasty marriages are a much more serious individual-level problem where hasty divorces are a much more serious society-level problem, and both feed each other. A society where divorce is easy (and common) will not take marriage seriously, and people will make the ill-advised decision to rush into marriage. People who rush into marriage are more likely to have a bad marriage that begs for an easy divorce, damaging society's views of marriage.

I'm also more inclined to believe that large rates of divorce are likely to /discourage/ marriage, not encourage it. If they know the commitment is likely to end, and that the end of the commitment is one of the most stressful life events people experience, then people are less willing to commit.

Marriage rates are declining, to the point that it's been called a "problem" by W. Wilcox in The Federalist and a "crisis" by Aja Gabel in UVA. How does this gel with your theory that easy divorce => rushing into marriage?

I guess I don't really see a causal effect at all? Easy marriages and easy divorces could both be symptoms of people not taking marriage seriously, rather than one causing the other. This would also contribute to declining marriage rates.

Edit: Or, there are a few feedback loops involved. People see quick, meaningless marriages and start to take marriage less seriously. They see quick, simple divorces and start to take marriage less seriously. They see people living together without marrying and take marriage less seriously. But all these things that weaken the institution of marriage also contribute to the symptoms of a weak institution, so the effects become the causes, leading to further and further decline of marriage as an institution as time goes on.

******** You have not reconciled declining marriages with your hypothesis of easy divorces acting as a lower barrier of entry. With a lower barrier of entry, you would expect more marriages, not less. If marriage as a precommitment is supposed to act to prevent bad marriages, then how is a declining marriage rate /at all/ indicative of worse marriages? A /much simpler explanation/ is that people /are/ taking marriage more seriously because of the experiences and knowledge they have of the effects and apparent likelihood of divorce. The causal speed of divorce statistics on marriage is fairly immediate, while the causal speed of marriage on divorce statistics is after years of lag. You're contorting your assertions to avoid the evidence and you haven't given any evidence of your own.

[[http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-myth-of-the-high-rate-of-divorce/][You might also want to look at this analysis of the divorce statistic.]]

The more I look at your justification of marriage as an ethical injunction, the more circular it seems to me.

- "Why is marriage valuable as a precommitment? Because the higher cost prevents divorces. Why are divorces undesirable? Because it damages marriage's value as a precommitment."
- "Why is easy divorce undesirable? Because it causes people to marry hastily. Why is the marriage hasty? Because the consequence of a hard divorce hasn't been properly considered. Why is the divorce hard? Because easy divorces are undesirable."

It's fine to admit you hold marriage as a terminal value. That's the simplest explanation I'm seeing for this disagreement.

*** I've been on the "idle fantasizing" stage of making a game like this for quite a while now, and I might start something for the Seven Day Roguelike challenge starting in March. The core ideas I had were (some will probably be cut):

Simultaneous turns, with glorified rock-paper-scissors style combat.

Enemies value different goals: delaying you, surviving, escaping, maximizing damage to you, minimizing damage to themselves, etc.

Separation of the true state of the game and the player's knowledge. If your sword does 5-15 damage and you hit an enemy with 100 HP, it will display (85-95) HP, not the exact value. If you get a critical hit and deal 30 damage, it will /still/ display (85-95) HP, despite it truly being 70 HP.

Illusions. The enemies know about the existence of illusion spells, which can limit their effectiveness. For example, if you cast "all opponents are invisible to each other" then they might each think that you cast "teleport all enemies except one away" instead. Also, vice versa. If you teleport everyone else away, then the one remaining enemy might think they're just unseen, and expect backup when attacking you. Enemies can do this as well.

Mind control. Pretty simple, you swap out their AI for a different, less useful one. Make their tanks cower in fear, and their archers charge you head on. Usable by the player only.

Reputation/memory. If you are wearing glowy robes and carrying a staff, they will expect you to cast spells. If you are wearing armor and holding a mace, they will expect you to fight physically. If you previously chose "rock" 90% of the time in combat, they will expect you to choose "rock".

** CMV: Crowdfunding is stupid.

Why do people crowdfund things? It is the most inefficient use of your money. You're handing over risk-free, costless capital to someone else over nothing more than a flashy video.

Look at the Oculus Rift backers, they essentially purchased shares in the company which would have been quite the amount after the Facebook acquisition. Instead all they got was a 600$ headset. Look at Pebble, they now have a product line and probably turn a good profit too. Only because a few people were dumb enough to give them free money at a return of 0%. The failure that Ouya was would not have been tolerated if again it wasn't disposable capital.

There are successes too like Pillars of Eternity, or Star Citizen. But why crowdfund them, just buy them on release. Invest your money in places that actually give you good return.

Crowdfunding has more in common with building a cathedral or a community work then with investment in a company for a return on investment.

Additionally, it marginally improved the probability of the thing getting made and achieving its stretch goals, and brought me pleasure in the form of anticipation for the finished product (which is more intense given that I've more concretely committed myself towards receiving it). If you trust the makers decently well (given prior knowledge or decent evidence in the form of a prototype, proof of concept, tech demo, etc.), then it's not terribly risky to give them money, and you usually get the product at a discount relative to whatever it would cost on release.

It's not an "efficient" use of money, certainly, in the sense of being a lucrative financial investment that will provide you with some high ROI. Neither is, say, buying a beer, or a flower, or fancy underwear. It's a luxury purchase made for personal pleasure.

*** On crowdfunding, or any question where things in the economy are proceding in a non-intuitive manner, I tend to look for what restrictions are in place that prevent more intuitive behavior.

In the case of crowdfunding, what prevents a person from raising capital through traditional stock offers with returns, rather than the crowdfunding method.

The short answer is government regulations. SEC filings for a public stock offering requires significant capital outlays for lawyers and regulatory compliance paperwork. Crowdfunding requires an idea, an internet connection, and a little bit of marketing savvy.

While SEC regulations on IPO's purportedly exist to prevent fraud, they have the unintended side effect of restricting legitimate, if under-capitalized, entrepreneurs from entering the space.

*** EDIT: Oh wow, this ended up as a wall'o'text. Well, summary: crowdfunding is useful for market research, and people are allowed to do their own risk/reward calculations.

--------------

Obviously, I can't answer for the entire crowdfunding industry, but I can answer for myself. Having actually done crowdfunding, I can tell you how it looks from my perspective, and what I'm guessing was going on in the heads of the people who donated.

I was considering making a change from programming to writing as a career, and I needed to know if it was even remotely feasible for me to do that. I needed a way to do some basic market research -- were there people who actually liked my writing enough that they would spend money on it? If so, it was at least possible that I could actually sell enough stuff to live.

Under the traditional model I would have written something and then flogged it to publishers. That's measuring the wrong thing, though -- that's measuring "can I convince one person [the purchasing agent for a publisher] to give me money for my writing on one occasion." That doesn't tell me if it's feasible for me to keep doing this. There's also an EXTREMELY long delay on getting that feedback -- weeks or months. Not exactly a great method for making decisions.

I could also have epublished and measured the income directly, but that had high startup costs; I'd need to find out how to do that, I'd need to do a lot of research on marketing a book, I'd need to pay someone to make a cover for me, etc. I wasn't willing to do what is, frankly, a lot of work without a little more assurance that it wouldn't be a waste that left me feeling like a failure.

I could have just run a survey "Would you pay money for my writing, Y/N?" That didn't see like a viable strategy for reasons that should be obvious.

A much better metric would be to run a Kickstarter for a modest amount of money and simply list it in the online fora where I'm already known. The startup costs are extremely low and it would let me see:

- How many people funded? [tells me market size]
- What amount they were willing to fund for on average? [tells me about pricing]
- How many of them were /not/ friends and family members?
- How quickly did they go in? [suggestive of how much first-degree marketing I need]
- What sort of rewards were they most interested in? [ideas for ancillary items]

Now, obviously I don't know what was actually going on in the heads of the people who funded, but I suspect it was some combination of the following:

- This guy has given us a lot of free content, I'll throw a buck in the kitty as a thank you
- This story sounds interesting and I'd like to read it. If it already existed I'd throw $3 at it, so I'll throw that in. [There might have been a "...but there's a chance he'll run off to Aruba with my $3 without delivering; I judge there is a <= 33% of that happening, so I'll only throw in $2."]
- I don't care too much about this guy personally, and I don't care too much about the specific story he's describing, but I do usually like his stuff and want to see more people making the kind of content I want to read, so I'll throw a couple bucks in.
- Ooh, shiny! I get to be the protagonist of / have a cameo in / have a hand in shaping the plot of a rational horror story! Shut up and take my money!

Kickstarter has (or had, when I did it) a required section of their template "what are the risks that might cause your project to fail and how will you manage them?" It's possible that people didn't read that, but it's not like it's hidden. There's also a reasonable amount of media attention to the fact that Kickstarter projects could end up failing or being a gyp. I think it's pretty fair to say that everyone who funded me -- or who funds any Kickstarter -- can reasonably be assumed to have known the risks.

The bottom line is that people gave money for something they wanted with the full understanding that it might not happen. Clearly, the perceived risk / return calculation was worth it to them.

Second, my backers DID get rewarded with more than a thank you. They got cameos, plot input, and even to be a protagonist. That was the deal -- they were putting in money so that that they could (a) read a fun story and (b) get some cool benny. There was never any expectation that they would get an ongoing revenue stream. So, no; I have not revenue-shared with my backers.

I'm a little baffled at your take on this, honestly. You're implying that no use of money is worthwhile unless it results in ongoing revenue. Why is it not acceptable, in your mind, to purchase a one-time experience?

Ah, I see. I've never actually thought of Kickstarter as a donation; you're purchasing something, with an understanding that there is some risk in the purchase. Maybe you're purchasing the right to read a story, or the right to own an Occulus Rift, or whatever. (You're also purchasing whatever the reward for your level is -- a cameo in the story, or the right to have plot input, or whatever -- but the primary thing is what the Kickstarter is about.)

Do you get more than your value back when you buy groceries, or when you pay for a cleaning service or a plumber? When you pay for a cleaning service there's always a chance that they won't show up and will just keep your money, so it's pretty equivalent. Likewise, when you pay for dry cleaning there's always the chance that they'll lose your clothes.

Maybe Kickstarter and other crowdfunding sites would feel better for you if you thought about it more in the "groceries, cleaning services, and dry cleaning" bucket than in the "mutual funds" bucket.

*** “Good Morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.

"What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"

"All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain."

...

"Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the conversation was at an end. "What a lot of things you do use Good Morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off.”

However, there are two points I'd like to raise that may prevent your help from being received with an open mind.

First, this

#+begin_quote
  but I cultivate compassion through meditation and living according to the Buddhist Eightfold Path
#+end_quote

says to the reader, "I follow /x/ religion, and this is how my religion handles your probelm." Most readers will keep reading with an open mind if they find your religion agreeable; if they don't, they will close off, and your help will be ignored. You introduce the entire body of your religion's ideology to the discussion, and will turn some readers away from your advice regardless of its merit.

Second, your closing statement, "It's not easy, but no one said living virtuously was easy," assumes common ground of wanting to live virtuously. The above context expands upon what you mean by virtue, e.g. that to live virtuously is to wish for others to become better, more virtuous people, and that becoming a more virtuous person may involve feeling emotional pain over committing wrongful acts.

That advice is wholly founded upon judgemental thinking, the basis of which comes from your belief system and its associated ethics. For someone with a different belief system or a different code of ethics, that advice falls on deaf ears.

To remedy those two issues, and increase the chances of you helping someone with their specific problem*, just give your advice without introducing the topics of religion or ethics. Following that guideline, your advice would look something like this:

#+begin_quote
  The trick is to be aware of what you're saying. When you say "Have a good day," think about their happiness from having a good day. If I'm having a hard time remaining compassionate and wanting them to have a good day, I remind myself that having a good day doesn't mean they get what they want, but what they need.
#+end_quote

I hope this advice was both helpful and respectfully presented.

  I don't expect a random person to care about me. Why should he? I'm just another customer out of the dozens or hundreds who will offer their ID cards to him during his time at the register. He has no reason to care about me.

Well, perhaps they care about all hundreds of those people, then? How are we defining "care" here? They won't take a bullet for you, but they'd probably do good by you if it's at sufficiently low cost to themselves. You could easily spin some evolutionary story as to why social animals will generally care for conspecifics, too, but it wouldn't be terribly robust on its own. Ultimately, I think this is an empirical question -- what proportion of humans care for strangers ("genuinely" or otherwise), and I'm sure someone's tried to collect some data on it before.

*********** On this regard I DO take effort in all my interactions with clerks to make myself a moment of sunshine in a very dreary, drudging and potentially terrible day. I work to make the exchange of a dining experience with wait staff and cooks enjoyable for both me and them.

I don't add extra burden to myself or them and instead strive to improve the exchange.

I genuinely thank them for service performed well even if it is simple and I meet their eyes and smile with sincerity.

I may never see them again and they may never remember that moment distinctly but I don't see why I should not try and lift the over all mood of their day a bit higher and reduce the total cost to them for being in the position to do service for me.

And like I said, it just seems like it actually costs me MORE to try and act things out as a 'fakery' but I also have very strong aversion and an almost pain to dishonesty.

************ Yes. Courtesy is my attempt to improve others' lives in the small way that I can. I just wish I managed to do the same online. Personas...

Reading this comment lifted my spirits after ToaKraka's antisocial cynicism. Keep it up. :)

*** They don't do any harm (quite the opposite), so it seems irrational to consider changing these platitudes/protocols.

I disagree. They enable and facilitate magical thinking.

***** I doubt that this is significant. The main driving forces for belief in magic are poor scientific education and religion, not some platitudes.

****** Not magic, magical thinking. I mean as in thinking that the consequences of systems governed by physics can be influenced by thought. It's a form of confusing the map with the territory -- mistaking your internal model of reality for the real thing. It only takes a fraction of a second to make such a mistake, is obscenely easy to do, can be difficult to catch, and may subtly corrupt your ability to reason effectively.

******* But what makes you believe that this way of thinking diffuses into significant decision making? I think, when people express these idioms they merely express support as a very basic human need. People perform better with a positive outlook.

I'm not sure these are broken, at least not in the way you describe. The literal meaning is basically declaring that you are allied with or sympathetic to seeing goal X happen, not that your declaration will make it so---they are social actions, not magical ones.
