** I notice a Theme: Persistent conflict retards growth/progress.

Praes and Callow, both backwaters, likely because of their nigh-eternal conflict.

The Fae courts, at an absolute stand-still for millennia.

The Drow, who tore /themselves/ apart, tore themselves from greatness.

The Principate, with constant internal political strife.

The Gods themselves are twisted mockeries of liberty and cooperation.

** Man, I'm glad we're finally done with this arc featuring an unstoppable young warlord tearing through a fallen civilization and using her powers to control an increasingly large number of superpowered individuals, so she can bring them back to her homeland and use them to prop up her reign of terror.

No, wait, I'm thinking of /Ward/. My mistake.

*** Shit, is that really the plot of Ward? I didn't get any further in after the first 3 or 4 chapters, so I don't know how it's developing, but I wanted to let it accumulate some before bingeing. Sounds pretty cool if the apparent MC in the beginning of Ward is doing that.

The joke is that Catherine is doing the same things as /Goddess/, one of the antagonists of Ward. The protagonist is more of a "social worker" type of character.

*** Recall that when Akua took over, she summoned Cat back to her body by using Winter powers. So far there is no real distinction between Cat and her mantle so to become a Sovereign of Moonless Nights one would effectively have to become Catherine.

Alternatively, Cat has already made oaths that bind Sovereign of Moonless Nights to protect Callow, etc. That way, even if Akua gained the title she would be forced to act in a way aligned with Callowan interests.

**** The author saying the oath intentionally is made to the title rather than to Catherine doesnt result in it being wrong to worry the title can be changed/stolen. It validates it. Also, I was commenting on Cat making a mistake, where Errata was responding to someone critisizing the writing itself.

It implies that either

1) Cat is aware and plans to step down from Winter somehow

2) Akua created the wording in order to facilitate her move

3) in a world where Cat proved pretty much anything can happen, there is something she believes is impossible

Mostly I think putting the texts of oaths into the story is tough, because after years of running a Vampire LARP (the Invictus are a big one here) and various D&D campaigns, I do not think perfect oaths are even slightly easy to craft. The simpler the better and I have still seen extremely simple oaths violated in the worst ways due to incautious wording (incidently, demon summoning would be the worst idea ever).

**to be clear, I do not think our dear author made a mistake here. I think it is simply a point to ponder due it's ramifications, especially since it was apparently written that way on purpose.

***** You need to step back and rethink your assumptions, the biggest being that the title SOMN is easier to steal than the name Catherine Foundling. You've assuming that SOMN is just a title, when it is Winter itself. A good interpretation is that SOMN is the /real/ thing, and Catherine Foundling is just a role that SOMN puts on. In retrospect there are 3 big hints supporting this interpretation:

- In chapter 71 of the last Book Cat was terrified of turning into some creature wearing the face and identity of Catherine Foundling, and the author loves putting in foreshadowings like this
- Your fae title is an identity not easily separated from yourself: Larat is still Nightfall even after resigning from his post as the Prince of Nightfall, and Cat didn't become the Duchess of Violent Squall after taking his place.
- The biggest evidence is that Akua already usurped Catherine Foundling once before. When she was controlling the construct, she was bound by all the oaths that Cat swore to. Conversely, this means that as far as oaths are concerned, Akua counts as Cat when she is controlling the construct.

****** 1st point) You used evidence of her power and identity being usurped (and voluntarily given back to her) as evidence it cannot happen. So, thanks ;)

2nd point) It is true their title seems much tougher to remove. See your 1st point for a good reason why that doesnt matter.

3rd point) I like Cat. I want to see her succeed and retain her great powers. If she is usurped by Akua, again, then that is a negative to me. Not even a huge one, as I used the word "worried" vs "catastrophic destruction of all her plans and those she holds dear." So you have succeeded in arguing against the catastrophic part (which I didnt say or think was going to happen) and instead you failed to successfully argue against the idea that it makes sense to worry that my favorite character might run into difficulties with her powers (difficulties well documented in-text, thanks for the exact references!).

I am also curious why the pushback. Do the other readers WANT less drama and fewer threats? I love this story, partly due to how open the world is and the variety of threats Cat faces and has faced. If there is zero chance for Akua to ever usurp Cat's mantle (again), then how is she a threat at all? Akua and Cat are both sworn to protect Callow, so why even worry about what Akua will do, except as it pertains to Cat herself? Due to oaths people seem to believe are 100% ironclad (except the story mentions Cat doesnt trust Akua not to find some wiggle room), Akua could move to take cat's power if Akua believes it will help Callow.

I assumed no such thing about it being "just" a title. It is something that was given to her against the will of the old owner (the power itself). It could be a pretty rock or an extra arm and it would be the same for my purposes. Saying "title" is short hand for all it entails.

In this world, nothing appears to be inviolable. Even the Gods themelves had their power taken against their will (by Cat) and used in ways they didnt want it used. Am I to assume, despite massive evidence otherwise (Black Knight, Akua, Empress, Heriophant, Warlock, etc) that Cat is the only one on their planet who can pull off such things?

******* At this point you have totally moved the goalposts. We were arguing about whether swearing the oaths to SOMN instead of Catherine Foundling is a mistake or not. All I'm saying is that it is not a mistake because oaths to SOMN is harder to subvert.

******** People are moving the goalpost, not I. I pointed out the oaths worry me and suddenly people are acting like no one could ever take her title, no one can usurp her position or body and it is nothing to worry about... which seems like the weirdest argument ever to me, and one rather opposite the text so far. Pointing out their arguments are wrong vs my original point is definitely not moving the goalpost.

Even here where you responded, you said "harder to subvert." So you agree it is possible. I am worried, you arent...why are you arguing again?

I remain clear...it worries me that Cat is having the oaths sworn to her title rather than herself. I worry because Akua is part of her mantle and has usurped her before.

If it doesnt worry the people who responded, that is totally fine. I didnt say "omfg people, its a cataclysm of epic proportions and omfg, how do not see it?!?!" I just said it worries me and everything since has been people telling me it isnt a thing while admitting that it is a thing. If anything I am highly amused.

***** Or 4) Cat assumes that Akua or the "Backstabbing is a cultural virtue" drow will inevitably find a way to twist away from ANYTHING she has them swear willingly. The contingency is knowing that and being prepared to trade resources gained now for resources spent later putting down the inevitable rebellion. For bonus points, something nasty with Masego and a sympathetic link with the Fae magic in each of the oath-takers would be hilarious.

"I know this will go wrong, and when it does, I/the Woe will solve it by stabbing it in the face" is a very Cat contingency.

*** This whole arc Cat has kinda been hinting at abdiction following the Liesse Accords. I think she is seperating the drow loyalties from her personally to keep that option on the table. This way she can pass them to a successor, whereas otherwise they'd make it impossible to abdicate.
