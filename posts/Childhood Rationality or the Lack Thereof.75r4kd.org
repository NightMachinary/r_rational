I've read quite a number of so-called rational fics that present precocious children as rational thinkers, without ever explaining why and how a child can think rationally in the first case, as if rationality is something everyone is equally capable of regardless of brain development or other biological functions.

Consider the fact that the brain of a child is not physically or chemically identical to the brain of an adult. Should it not follow that the thought structures of a child cannot be the same as those of an adult? Should this not include the capacity for full rationality? Such would imply that thinking rationally is not merely a matter of training or personality, but also of biology. A bright 8 year old still has an 8 year olds brain and the limitations that implies.

For example, according to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, children from the age of 7 to 11, roughly speaking, will be growing increasingly capable of limited inductive logic and reasoning. This means that children can take their experiences and observations and arrive at some generalized principal that may be driving them, but can't yet easily envision hypothetical possibilities that are implied by that generalization unless they produce a concrete example for themselves to test it. This means that children at this stage aren't yet capable of making good predictions based on logical principals. Thus, problem-solving is more or less random trial-and-error rather. Also, through this period, children are also growing less egocentric and able to acknowledge that others may not think or believe in the same way as themselves, and thus can start to understand that others have different points of view literally and metaphorically, but this is generally replaced by susceptibility to peer pressure rather than any greater sense of right and wrong. Lastly, children in this age group are not yet capable of long-term planning, patience, or organization, largely because of their inability to project hypothetical consequences in the future.

Starting around age 11 and only completing around age 15 to 20, children begin to be capable of more powerful deductive reasoning. This means that adolescents, as opposed to children, can form increasingly good predictions based on those aforementioned generalized principals, and they can begin to form experiments to test expected hypotheticals rather than just solving problems by pure trial-and-error. This means abstract situations, "what-ifs", and even metacognition is increasingly in reach. This has implications regarding the increased feasibility of long-term planning and organization among adolescents. Furthermore, peer pressure begins to lose ground as the adolescent develops an internal sense of right and wrong that goes beyond punishment, beyond one's peer group, towards a principled sense of justice. Maybe.

Of course, just because an adult is capable of this sort of logical thinking doesn't mean the adult will use it; this is the focus of rational fics, after all. My point is that children are NOT capable of such thinking due to biological limitations of the brain's development, not simple lack of trying or training. For a child below a certain age to use true rationality is for the child to quite literally have the brain of an adult, and thus to be a genetic, biological aberration.

There are criticisms of Piaget's theory from evolutionary psychology that suggests that brain development can be adjusted in response to environmental stimuli such as culture and parenting, but even if it is possible this hasn't been experimentally proven to produce the kind of rationality in children as seen in many rational fics. At best, evolutionary psychology criticisms highlight that even infants are sensitive to patterns and build expectations thereupon, but they don't demonstrate rational thought underlying that pattern recognition. Another criticism of Piaget comes from neuroscience that says the development happens more smoothly than in stages, but even so the stages of development already presents a continuum of development and describes useful milestones.

Edit for TL;DR - rational children are mutant freaks of nature, not merely precocious. Thoughts?


** Childrens minds develop as they age and gain experience, certainly, but suggesting they cannot be rational is ignoring omnipresent counter-examples.

Children can play games. they can understand risk/reward, execute strategies based on logical conclusions stemming from observation of their environment and the rules at play.

There are child chess and Go masters. There are child math whizzes, and other prodigies. these all imply they can think and act logically, make long term plans, etc.

There are also children who have adapted to very harsh environments and can be quite adept at navigating real life dangers. Children in warzones, in impoverished and crime ridden areas, or subject to trauma show a larger capacity for social manipulation, and ruthless survival strategies.

On the flip side, children can absolutely show altruism, kindness, and ethical thinking when exposed to models and examples that encourage it. Your suggesting that these only form in later teen years is strange to me.

To say children can't be "rational" puts rationality on some mysterious and ill defined pedestal. You seem to think rationality is some magical state of perfect reasoning. But as you mention in criticisms of Piaget, mental development - and rational behavior - should be seen as a spectrum, in fact a many faceted spectrum. People may be quite rational in some behaviors and not at all in others.

With this model in mind, children can certainly exhibit a range rational behavior across that spectrum.

*** I agree with this, and also say that the Western notion of treating children as incapable is cultural and not biological. Check out The World Until Yesterday by Jared Diamond for some cultural counterexamples. Basically, when children are treated like adults, they act like adults, with some exceptions for, for example, their diminished strength. In cultures like the Piraha, it would be strange for an adult to tell a child what to do or what not to do.

***** My argument (or observation, rather) had nothing to do with maturation or brain structure. Children are cognitively less able, on average, then adults. Up until ages 5-7, there are bright-line differences in things like theory of mind, but after that it's a more generalized lack of development. That doesn't stop them from acting with a level of responsibility that is almost unthinkable to Westerners when placed in situations where they have real autonomy and experience real consequences. This isn't an argument about HOW we should treat children, either...just an observation based on a cultural reality that is somewhat alien to us.

******* Did you know that you can determine the weapons gladiators used based on the density and structural integrity of their bones? Those who used shields experienced repeated blows that the bones of the arm were required to withstand, this causes structural changes in the bone itself. The body physically changes to the experiences it has. There are many adaptions which are like this.

Cognitive adaptions occur as well.

Structural and chemical changes occur in the brain when exposed to outside stimulus on a regular basis. Curiosity, fear, pain, hunger, exercise, forced isolation, forced social interaction, etc etc etc. All of these cause /significant/ alteration in the brain, even /after/ 'full' development.

It's actually possible to detect through brain scans if someone has experienced as little as 24 hours of isolation (reduction in grey matter in the brain).

With such noticeable and even extreme modifications of the brains chemistry and structure even in so called 'fully mature' brains under relatively 'light' stimulus, it's of little wonder that the highly adaptable developing brain under, sometimes severe, stimulus can experience a rather shocking range of expression.

******** That's an excellent way of putting it.

I'd also just say that acting like an adult is not the same as acting rational, and either is not the same is being well-adapted or intelligent. Individual minds are highly variable. Some children may be easily capable of taking on adult responsibility, which honestly in most cases does not even require incredible intelligence or worldliness. Conversely, many adults can never take on what we would call adult responsibility. On average, adults are more likely (probably much more likely) to be able to take on what we call adult responsibility. But that doesn't really say anything about individual minds and individual circumstances, except probabilistically.

So in short I think that treating children as adults, especially in environments that are more closely connected to our ancestral environment, makes sense in context. ANd I stand by my contention that many of our expectations of children are culturally determined. Note, for example, that in the modern US children are generally not allowed to roam freely until approximately 13, and in fact parents that don't agree with this are frequently brought up on child endangerment charges. Only 20 years ago, the age would have been considerably lower, and in the mid-20th century it would not be uncommon for children no older than infants to roam freely in cities and the countryside. Have children changed? No. But our culture has. And there are cultures that treat children as even more independent agents than the America of the mid-20th century.

In general, individuals conform to cultural expectations and cultural limitations. They can become extremely capable or extremely incapable. In Western society, children are considered exteremly incapable, and so they are. Except in those cases when they have to be.

Well, yeah. "Rationality" is a two-place word. It can mean, "reasoning according to a fixed principle that creates correspondences with reality (or at least the local sensory statistics of reality)" (by which standard ANNs and human brain machinery are "rational"), but it can also mean, "reasoning according to prescribed, normative standards that are believed, if not guaranteed, to lead to hitting the ground truth rather than merely to useful models" (by which standard, the entirety of a great many intellectual fields are spent on being /rational/, since we do not at all do it by default).

*** Sure, minds develop with experience and age, but I'm saying that part of that development is biological. It's not all nurture. The aspects of rationality I mentioned specifically include: the ability to develop and execute long-term planning, and the ability to conceive of other people as having different beliefs and thoughts.

As for your examples of long-term planning, you mentioned chess, go, and math. None of these examples are long-term. Unless you consider 1 day to be long-term? I was more operating on the idea of long-term planning such as "if I smoke this crackpipe, it will be fun, and I probably won't see major negative side effects within a couple weeks at the earliest, but in a matter of months or years this could be very bad", and this conceptualization of consequences is lacking in the vast majority of children and most adolescents. This lack of future-oriented thinking is why we care so much about keeping even legal addictive substances out of schools or away from minors. Unless you argue that there's no reason to stop children from smoking and drinking?

Showing altruism and kindness is not the same as feeling altruism or kindness. Children are mostly motivated by reward-seeking and punishment-avoidance or peer pressure: if I do this, I'll get a cookie; if I do that, I'll get yelled at; if I do this, they'll like me; if I do that, they'll shun me. Since we reward acting kind and altruistic, naturally children will act kind and altruistic, but only if the consequences happen in the near-term: if they don't get punished until a couple hours later, they won't intuitively connect the dots or correct the behavior. Why do you think children of religious parents almost always go to the same church and subscribe to the same moral code as their parents, until they start thinking for themselves as adolescents?

Adaptation to harsh environments, playing games and understanding risk/reward (for certain types of simple probabilities) are not being questioned by my post. I don't contest that children seek rewards, avoid harm, and are highly adaptable. Furthermore, I admit that children, with the use or help of various models, can push beyond their natural capabilities. For example, though a child has trouble making deductions in their head, working a problem out on paper or with objects gives them a chance. But it's not natural or intuitive for children. So, certainly, children are rational in a sense. But they aren't as rational as adults because they can't look far beyond the present and they can't see the world through another's eyes.

I have first hand experience with children doing both of these things.

there are developmental limitations to children, they do get smarter and better at planning over time. but it's not a black and white "they cannot plan or conceive of contrary beliefs."

If there are specific examples of children in literature acting in ways you find problematic, maybe you should cite those instead of making general statements. It would help in addressing specific concerns.

*** In my mind, rationality is basically the ability to take solutions learned in a specific context and generalize them into useful principles that accelerate one's learning in other contexts. The more you can do this---and the less /evidence/ you need to do this /successfully/---the more rational you are.

Your examples of things that children do are the same things you'd expect any regular neural network of today to do: to get good at recognizing patterns and making predictions on the specific dataset they're trained on.

But /adult/ human beings can, uniquely, do something we can't yet make AI do: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing]["general game-playing"]] --- the ability to use experiences of playing one "game" to get better at entirely unrelated "games." For example, the ability to practice Go, and not just become a better Go player, but a person who then starts off with an advantage (compared to a person who hadn't played Go) the first time they play chess or Dominion or Starcraft. Or, to further generalize, to deduce elements of actual military strategy from playing Go (or vice-versa.)

Children will do this on one level---a 6-year-old who plays a Mario game will probably be better at playing a Sonic game. But that is because those games actually share some base-level mechanics. If the parallel is purely conceptual---for example, going from /Street Fighter/ to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Puzzle_Fighter_II_Turbo][Puzzle Fighter]] to [[http://sirlingames.com/puzzlestrike/][Puzzle Strike]]---then it's unlikely children will have any transfer learning to apply, since they weren't spending their time playing the former working out any general high-level principles that would apply to the latter. Only adults (are proven to) do that.

***** I didn't mean to imply that adults weren't "just working from a wider set of experience."

My understanding is that the human brain isn't all that special as an ML model; it just has lots and lots of opportunity for online training, training that even includes continuous error-deltas (current sense data, vs. predicted state of the world given previous sense data + motor commands) rather than binary pass-fail distinctions.

Humans (again, AFAIK) pass through the "stages of learning" simply due to the magnitudes of the training they've done.

If you know some Comp Sci, consider a B+-tree: when a node in a tree gets enough children, it will split, turning itself into a parent for two children and distributing its previous children between those. In an abstract tree, those new child nodes made to hold the redistributed grandchildren are usually just determined by something like sorting order. But in a conceptual-hierarchy "tree", such child nodes---even if created simply due to the strain of holding onto so many child examples of something---might distinguish those examples into more refined categories, and thus serve, when axonally excited, as the qualia for new concepts, making that higher-level concept accessible.

In such a model of the brain, the only way to build your conceptual hierarchy "higher"---to move to a later Piaget stage---is by observing enough slightly-different examples of things to build a higher and higher abstraction hierarchy. My belief is just that this requires raw sense data---living day-to-day life for years---rather than "hard thinking." You can't accelerate it, it's all amount of the amount of raw training data fed in. So, as you live and age, it just gradually happens.

The AIs we have, like human children, can build conceptual hierarchies that can be cut off at the leaves and then quickly re-trained to do something else, just like going from a /Mario/ game to a /Sonic/ game (e.g. they will learn how to jump around obstacles, and then they will re-apply that on the new game.)

We /don't/ have models that can go from /Puzzle Fighter/ to /Puzzle Strike/, because they share no low-level operations in common---they're different genres of game (one is turn-based and involves buying chips; the other involves reflex-based movement of blocks) which are only analogous under a general /high-level/ understanding of how the game's rules translate into game-theoretic reward matrices and the like.

Children don't /think/ about things like game-theoretic reward matrices. You could teach them to, sure, but you'd just be teaching them how to apply a single formalism by rote (like New Math attempted when teaching children set theory in the 1970s), rather than giving them a /principle/ they could apply.

Children, according to Piaget, just don't have the hardware to derive a general formal-operational principle (game theory) from a set of examples (games.)

This might, of course, be a simple matter of scale. Our ML models have orders of magnitude less training data applied to them than the average human has had experiential sense-data applied to it over even a ten-year lifetime. Our existing models may be capable of transfer learning on the level of inventing game theory, if given 100x or 1000x more data to chew. Children's brains aren't all /that/ different from adult brains (other than a bit of synaptic pruning, but that occurs long after the formal operational stage), so indeed it can just be that they're lacking the required experience. But my understanding is that, to get that (dense, sense-data-with-error-signals) experience, they'd have to actually live the extra time. There's no shortcut available in the form of thinking harder about the sense data one already had available, or watching someone else's life pass by in VR, or whatever else; unless they're /testing predictions/ and receiving sense data /with correlated error signals/, they're just getting the sort of sparse training that current AI models get, rather than the sort of uniquely-good training data humans get.

** See the easiest counterpoint to this is simply the existence of child prodigies. Pretty much any measure of mental capacity you care to devise is going to have /some/ 10 year olds who can perform better on it than most adults, and assuming the highly rational children in fiction are extraordinary individuals shouldn't exactly be surprising.\\
Plus having multiple children like this in a story isn't exactly statistically impossible either, calling many of these children prodigies would give you the false impression that children at adult levels of mental development in many areas are as rare as one's who can do as well as genius adults at particular tasks.

Overall my point is that at 10 year olds capable of rationality are neither nonexistent nor even vanishingly rare. If you happen to have grown up in the same filter bubbles as me you've probably met a few of them (and my cultural bubble isn't really particularly prestigious or anything, I don't personally know anyone who's gone to an ivy league school).

It seems as though you're deliberately picking areas where you wouldn't expect examples even if 10 year olds were capable of doing as well as an average adult in those areas. For instance children far enough to the right of the bell curve to be good at leadership despite lack of experience ought to be vanishingly rare. So when you consider that those prodigies would need to just happen to be born into a monarchy and thrust into leadership without any regents the sample size isn't really large enough that you should be tremendously surprised to not find any good examples.\\
In terms of fields like psychology or sociology you may be forgetting that those aren't exactly fields where one can make breakthroughs on one's own particularly easily. Simply put the inability to make breakthroughs that can be confirmed easily enough that people can't discount them based on the characteristics of the person who discovered them would seem to be pretty important in terms of which fields have child prodigies.

But again this is sort of irrelevant because whether you expect child prodigies in every single area that are on par with the imminent geniuses in that field isn't actually relevant here. Because as you said this is whether they can be comparable to the average adult.

In regards to long term planning it's sort of trivially easy to come up with examples of children even younger than 10 who save their allowances for years to get something they wanted (the fact /I/ did that despite not really being particularly impressive in any way leads me to believe that's probably not even that uncommon). As for for leadership ability I think you're forgetting that leadership is pretty massively about people's perspective of you.

To put it another way I would wager that few if any people could, if their mind was placed in a child's body (and everyone had every reason to think they /were/ a child) lead people very effectively. So yes that's a point in your favor against rational fics, because adults aren't generally going to let themselves be led by a child.

***** Let me unpack my assertion above.

Given our thousands of years of history that focuses on royalty and nobility with high death rates for most of it, I'd expect that gives a pretty good sample size of potential child rulers. In Europe alone, there were several thousands of various rulers throughout history. Probably more if we include various nobility beneath their kings. Looking out at the rest of the world, there should be tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of various rulers throughout history. If even 1% of them (I'd guess a very low estimate) inherited the throne as children, that would mean hundreds of potential child-kings. If children are as capable of dealing with other human beings as an adult, and if they are as capable as adults at envisioning long-term consequences for their actions, then these child-kings would not have required regencies. But even if regencies were part of some unnecessary bias against kids without a cause, then the top 1% of these kings should still be sufficiently prodigal that they might be able to seize rulership without burning their country to the ground. If my assumedly conservative ratios hold true, then there should still at least be a handful of preteen examples in history that did just that, at least as well as the average king. Who, admittedly, might be "challenged" himself by inbreeding.

[[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/euru/hd_euru.htm]]

Instead of that happening, we end up with child-rulers portrayed as in Game of Thrones. Who, admittedly, is also "challenged" by inbreeding.

You say its hard to break out in psychology or sociology on your own. And yet, child-prodigy law students do it. Law ought to be heavily politicized and high-status, no? The difference is that those prodigies approach law on a logical-mathematical basis, which kids can be good at, but psychology demands getting to know another person, which I posit kids cannot be good at.

Firstly, I'd say cultural biases tend not to arise out of a vacuum. There ought to be some reason that "adults aren't generally going to let themselves be led by a child", and it ought not be tautological. But anyway, something from Ender's Game was their use of what was effectively the internet to write text posts because text hid their physical bodies and let their ideas stand on their own merit. Also, they were teenagers. Anyway, if the idea is solid, then we should see child letter-writers who have some influence on leadership and politics. A child prodigy of political thinking and philosophy, if not a leader. Of course, if it's done well, we wouldn't be able to identify the writer as children, but if the writer was writing a hundred or more years ago and since grew up into a reasonably influential politician, I'm sure they'd reveal and be proud of their childhood writing campaigns. Child scientists did this. So, did even this happen? From my admittedly brief Wikipedia search, I don't see it. You could broaden the search to ethical thinkers and social philosophers, or really any philosophers if you want to demonstrate children have the capacity to think deeply about alternative belief systems and how people, but I still don't see it.

****** Regarding child monarchs it's going to be nearly impossible to assess how much of their leadership is just them leaning on the adults around them even were they to lack a regent, particularly since nearly any good leader listens to their advisors anyway. As for regents being necessary you seem to be implying that I don't think nearly all children are terrible leaders, when what I actually said is that the /absolute most competent/ children can probably compare at the very least to a mediocre adult leader. I never claimed the bias against children wasn't justified.\\
And it's not as though there weren't some child leaders who didn't successfully not f*** anything up. Which would seem to make them very comparable to mediocre adult leaders. But of course there's the question of exactly how hard it is to successfully maintain the status quo.

As for psychology/sociology I would posit that it should be perfectly plausible for someone to come up with models in those areas that don't rely on their own social abilities. For instance not every psychologist would necessarily make a good therapist. My point being that there is certainly ought to be progress that can be made in psychology from a systematizing type approach so any lack of child prodigies in this area shouldn't really be totally explainable from just a lack of social skills. After all many of the models and findings in psychology are very clearly non-intuitive and something nobody would ever have arrived at through using their social intuition. Sociology is I would argue an even more pronounced example of this since it's consideration of individual people is more abstract than nearly any psychology.\\
Comparing law to psychology here i'm not sure works because i'm not sure where you're finding these examples of 10 year old law prodigies. I can't find any examples who aren't already in their late teens and that's just for passing the bar. For your point here to make any sense would seem like it would require children actually being quite successful in law not just demonstrating an ability to understand it.

When it comes to children potentially influencing politics through anonymous means I would sort of dispute exactly how influential anonymous letters have ever really been. I just somewhat doubt the ability of anonymous individuals to really manage much deliberate effect on politics, and I suspect any anonymous writings influence is likely to be very heavily affected by chance (in that very few such writings ever get the opportunity to really get noticed) which would decrease the chance of the already small population of child prodigies getting much accomplished.

Importantly though it's getting clear that what we actually need to settle this issue is for you to come up with a /specific/ anonymous test. Which most adults could do but which you think /no/ children could do, then we would be much closer to settling this.

** OK, so I'm going to take this in a different direction.

Most of the criticisms in the OP and comments I've seen basically argue that children aren't as smart as adults, but this isn't what rationality is really about, and I'm finding the claims made to be thinly supported.

The portion of rationality that I think children are actually very bad at-- and the thing that actually got the whole rationality culture started on Less Wrong -- has to do with /believing things that are true/ and /susceptibility to bias./

As I argued in my first comment, I think children, especially prodigies, are perfectly capable of making logical decisions when presented with clear risk/reward conditions. They are also equally capable of empathy, altruism, and ruthlessness.

I think where children are much more vulnerable than adults to failing to achieve optimal results is in their ability to discern what is true from what is not.

Children are vulnerable in two ways. First, they are impressionable. Early development is about rapidly absorbing information from your environment, and this includes lots of worldviews and information that is false. Children are far more likely to internalize and believe untrue things than adults, because they lack context against which to judge their merit, and by default are trusting of new information.

The second way children are vulnerable to untruth is from internal bias. Learning to recognize and combat bias is a difficult skill to learn, and comes only with practice. Children are more prone to be driven by emotion and impulse, to trust in baseless intuition, to suffer from unrealistic sense of self and ego. They are very unlikely to have received the training necessary to combat innate human biases, and may even be MORE vulnerable to them if they are smart.

These two vulnerabilities are something that writers of rational fiction should be taking into account. I believe HPMOR actually does this to a degree -- harry fools himself quite a bit, is prone to emotional outbursts, ego, and sentimentality. The merit of the narrative actually lies in the conflict between his rational training and worldview and his childish nature.

Keeping these weaknesses and vulnerabilities in mind will help to build more compelling and interesting child characters, even if they are prodigies in other ways.

*** I didn't say children weren't smart, I said that they shouldn't be able to handle deductions, hypotheticals, and interpersonal skills in the way they're portrayed in a number of rationalfics. Elsewhere in the thread, I agreed that child prodigies exist, I only argued that those prodigies are exceedingly rare or nonexistent in areas that require consideration of long-term consequences and/or proficiency in false-belief tasks.

I'm not so sure children are less able than adults at identifying the truth, for certain kinds of truth. When working with real-world things, children ought to be nearly as good as adults. It's where we get into hypotheticals or generalized truths that children can be tripped up. Or, as you noted, children are much more impressionable by peer pressure than adults, particularly tweens and teens, and may very well define truth as group consensus or through appeal to authority rather than objective reality.

Regarding intuition, it's sometimes more valuable than you might think, even in children. Piaget's research into children's conceptualization of geometry, for example, demonstrates that infants have an innate ability to conceive of topology (orientation without respect to shape), despite topology being something not mathematically formalized until the 18th and 19th century. The development of early concepts of space (inside vs. outside vs. on, left vs. right vs. middle) is perhaps one of the underpinnings of all human logic.

**** by intuition I meant belief in conclusions produced by magical thinking -- things that SOUND right, but have no evidential basis.

I think susceptibility to this and other biases are their main vulnerability and what separates them from adults. The "hardening" of worldview that happens in late teens/early twenties is actually a sort of inoculation against gullibility, but comes with the obvious drawback of being harder to adapt to new information. Anyone who interacts with young children can tell you they are hilarious to toy with because they will believe just about anything, with their resistance to deception improving directly proportionally with age and mental development.

This vulnerability (along with internal bias) can make even very intelligent minds essentially useless when trying to solve real world problems, and I would argue is the primary way that children are hampered by "irrationality."

Rational child thinking: I want candy (mental timeframe, unspoken: within the next 10 minutes). Mom, can I have candy? Mom said not unless I can buy it myself. I have no money. I still want candy but I also want to not get into trouble. If Mom does not see me eating the candy I know is in the drawer, I can have candy (candy in a kid's mind usually being seen as randomly generated loot, and not an object of real value to which actual ownership rights apply) and she won't know.

Rational teen/adult thinking: I want a car. Dad said not unless I can pay for it. I can use my limited savings and get a part time job, and in a few months I can have a car to fix up while complying with all the rules and maintaining good relationships and trust.

  For example, according to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, children from the age of 7 to 11, roughly speaking, will be growing increasingly capable of limited inductive logic and reasoning

  My point is that children are NOT capable of such thinking due to biological limitations of the brain's development, not simple lack of trying or training. For a child below a certain age to use true rationality is for the child to quite literally have the brain of an adult, and thus to be a genetic, biological aberration.

It's like, OK, you've got a pet, and the pet pukes on your carpet, and you discover it an hour later. Do you, in anger, break out your belt and beat the animal? Do you try to drag the pet to the puke and shout at it to terrify the animal? Do you reconsider either strategy after recognizing there's no way for the animal's mind to connect the punishment to the problem? Do you wonder if the pet is sick or the food was bad? Do you think forward to some sort of training regime? I'd posit that if you realized the animal's psychology means it very likely won't connect something that happened an hour ago with whatever you do to it now, then you'll realize the futility of punishing it except insofar as it might make you feel better, so you're far more likely to look for an underlying reason or consider options for the future.

********* Here's where I just get /real/ arrogant.

I am unimpressed by the evidence of other educators (even when it's not secondhand). I made /multiple/ large, ambitious bets with veteran educators when it came to the way that I ran my classrooms and the results I predicted I could draw out of my students, and /every/ one of them turned out in my favor, and /every/ one of them was based on me /not/ believing in the hard limits that you're proposing in your post.

I outperformed other teachers /specifically because/ I didn't buy the hard limits you're proposing in your post. I was a significantly-above-average popular teacher /specifically because/ I threw out assumptions and conclusions that emerge from the kind of thinking you propose.

There's a bit in the foreward to Ender's Game where OSC says that he got /dozens/ of letters from educators complaining that gifted kids just aren't /like/ that, kids just don't think and act like that. But he got /thousands/ of letters from /actual kids/ saying "thank you so much for Ender, I finally see myself accurately portrayed in a character."

You're equating "disagrees with Fenris" with "doesn't understand psychology" or "has wrong ideas about training." And that's just flat-out wrong. I'd pit my pedagogy against yours or your wife's, any day of the week. And I know exactly how arrogant that sounds, and I stand by it, openly, in the light. Sometimes, you gotta be willing to stand up and say "Yeah, I know better in this domain," even if people will look at you askance for it, and this is one of those times.

** Define "rational".

My understanding is that "rationality" is simply a mode of thought, it is correlated with intelligence and knowledge yes, but you don't really need much of either to be think rationally.

I mean, to give a silly example: consider the game world of tic-tac-toe. There is a rational way to play the game so that you never ever lose, and it doesn't take very long for even average young children to figure it out and then play rationally. And if they can play rationally, then obviously they can also think rationally.

#+begin_quote
  as if rationality is something everyone is equally capable of regardless of brain development or other biological functions.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say that, since obviously no brain or dead body = no rationality. But you really only need a small amount to think rationally. After that it just becomes a matter of scale. The more you know, the more contexts you can apply your rationality to. The more intelligent you are, the more complex you can make rational plans in your head. The more experienced you are, the more heuristics and shortcuts you can take to make those plans faster.

Now, age is indeed a limiting factor on these, but you can always specialize. For instance, I wouldn't expect any child to be a super lawyer + politician + painter + architect + physicist + chemist + mathematician + pianist + guitarist + ... all at the same time, that's way too much information needed to cram into under a decade. But for just one of them? It seems possible enough if you sacrifice a bunch of other stuff. Read them physics books to bed instead of fairy tales. Give them only a piano for entertainment, no TV. Hell, take away all their other distractions like friends and loved ones and any happiness whatsoever. Drop them out of school to focus solely on one field even if it leaves them completely uneducated in every other area.

You would probably count as a horrible guardian for doing so, but it sounds doable enough.

Because of this, I can't abide the sort of rational child actors we see in lots of rational fiction. A child can be rational in the sense that they seek rewards and avoid harm, duh, but beyond a certain horizon that rationality breaks down.

I suspect that this is more a problem of sociology than of biology. Morally defunct parents wanting their kids to be chess/math/science/<insert career here> prodigies are everywhere, since being a career prodigy rakes in fame and money. But parents wanting their kids to be rationality prodigies? That would be a really really tiny amount.

I mean, can you imagine a parent putting a small kid through anti-conformity training? That's basically forcing your kid to endure public humiliation over and over and over. Or a parent teaching their kids about the Stanford prison experiment and all of humanity's darkest depravities? Ethics aside, there's barely any incentive for the parent to do so. Rational kids are slightly more likely to become rich and famous, but their odds would have been better if they were trained for a particular career instead. Not to mention, abusing a child into becoming rational is highly likely to result in said rational child calling child protection services to lock you away. So if you were a rational parent (which is kinda necessary if you want to teach your kid rationality), you would almost certainly rationally choose not to do this.

***** I'm sure virtually every parent would like their children to be moral people, but that requires conceiving of other beings as people in their own right, a skill that children do not intuitively possess until they start approaching puberty. And yet the child prince has always seemingly be seen very negatively, historically necessitating regencies until at least mid-teen years. Which the theory I'm posting would expect.

Or, heck, now that I think of it, child actors! Parents put their kids into acting all the time, but has any child actor come close to meeting truly adult levels of acting skill? Acting ought to include some ability to model someone you are not, so it should be applicable. The youngest I can find is Tatum O'Neal winning the Oscar at age 10 in 1974, followed by Anna Paquin at age 11 in 1994, but nobody else at a younger age. The Emmys haven't had a child winner for 26 years, and the youngest Emmy winner was 14 year old Roxana Zal in 1984. Since 11 is about the youngest I'd expect to see some ability to model other people, I'm not terribly surprised by this result, but it's still obviously incredibly rare, and those awards were not for leading roles. I'd expect better acting skills even from amateur adults as from reasonably-practiced pre-teen children. You can argue that the lack of awards is cultural, but I'd only ask you why it's cultural in the first place.

I'm not sure acting awards are a good measurement for childhood rationality, or acting careers at all, because of networking issues. Unlike chess, where a genius child can just single-handedly trounce all the competitors to reach the top, acting is not a one-man show (well some is, but those don't get Emmys). To be in a movie that can win an Emmy, you typically need to find co-actors, directors, producers, marketers, scriptwriters, cameramen, etc. etc., which means you need lots of people connections. Being a child is a massive disadvantage here, no matter how rational you are, because people connections take time to form, and children by definition have less than 10 years to form that network.

The hypothesis was: knowing children can be prodigies of various sorts, can children also be prodigies of morality itself? I suggested there's certainly sufficient incentives for it, and apparently child prodigies can be taught rather than purely spontaneous. Given morality provides the incentives for rational decision making, and even if it isn't, parents want it anyway because it means less headaches for them. So, does it happen? My conclusion is, not really. Thoughts?

Firstly, there's no other measure of "good acting" for individual actors out there. You could look at ratings, but how could you separate the influence of a child's acting on the overall rating, and you could argue ratings are also tied to networking. So there ain't nothing better to measure, so far as I can tell. Secondly, if a child is a prodigy at dealing with and envisioning people in the way an actor does, at least to an adult level, wouldn't the child be equivalently good as an adult at networking anyway?

This actually implies that parents would specifically want their kids to be bad rationalists: One of the hallmarks of rationality is to keep questioning everything. If parents don't want headaches, they will teach their kids to be obedient instead of constantly questioning their parental guidance.

To clarify, I'm not saying that they would have inferior networking skills, I'm saying that networking takes time whether you're skilled or not. I mean, if you're a movie maker, you aren't going to suddenly hand your leading roles to some random stranger you met yesterday and risk making the movie a flop. You really want to hire someone you can trust, someone with a *long history* of being trustworthy. See the problem there? *Long history required*. Children, by definition, do not have long histories. Their histories are less than 10 years long no matter how awesome they are.

** I think that your big mistake is over-emphasizing the mean for kids.

Kids are shorter than adults. Yet, by age 12, 5% of girls are taller than the average adult woman. Some of them will stop there, and were just early bloomers. Some of them will end up being freakishly tall. And that's 5% - as you get further to the ends of the bell curve, individuals will vary from the mean even more. People who are different enough from the mean to be substantially different are not rare enough to be freaks on a social scale.

Go to a decent-sized middle school. There will be enough boys that are about as tall as an adult male for them to field several of them in their basketball team. Similarly, there will be a few of them who started shaving at a young age, or who had their voice reach a tone suitable for an adult (whether or not it will be THEIR adult tone). If you're doing a story about middle-school basketball players, several of your characters are not going to resemble the average child in their cohort in a number of physical metrics.

Mental properties are not so uniquely privileged. Even the chart you linked to yourself shows that by age 10, a few percent of the kids have begun the formal stage, and more than double that number have reached a mature level of it by age 13. These are still middle school kids, and we're not even looking at fractions of the top percent. If you're going to be writing a story about smart kids, you aren't going to write about the average kids any more than you're going to use the average kids as the protagonists of your competitive basketball story. The main question then becomes "is the population these kids come from big enough to field this many kids this far from the mean?" If you have a group of 500 6-year-olds and somehow every character is a tiny adult, yeah, that's quite a reach, but if you have a small city of a quarter million and you hand pick the cleverest 13 year olds? They might not be able to perform at a respectable professional level /consistently,/ but it's not unbelievable that they'll be able to analyze and plan and delay gratification better than the average adult.

Mind you, that is not a particularly difficult bar to clear, even. The average adult never got a college degree, has basically no savings, and works jobs that pay $12 an hour or less with no real plans for career advancement. If your baseline is career information workers, your expectations for the level of planning and self-control in adult behavior are skewed.

I don't know about that. I feel like intelligence has more to do with early childhood enrichment, like how much time your parents were able to devote to teaching you. It's like, correlation =/= causation, a confounding factor, right? Like parents who have the ability to devote the sheer time necessary to raising an intelligent child tend to be more financially stable, which would mean on average the ability to always provide consistent food and healthcare, so the healthier kids aren't smarter because they're healthier, but because the health and the intelligence are both a result of easier access to resources. I know /my/ parents weren't quote unquote "financially stable" but I ended up being intelligent because my mother decided she'd devote the necessary time to make me intelligent come hell or high water. She read to me for /hours/ every night for the first few years of my life, and I feel like that's what made me who I am.

Not too crazy to conceive of an 11 year old with a more accelerated "intellectual" development (and maybe worse socialization).

As for the SATs, I think the scale used for grading changes pretty often so whatever the score-percentile correspondence is now it could well have been different at some other time. Though having known a fair few good test-takers back in highschool (not 11 but more in the ~14-16 year old range; also, scoring maybe 1500-1600), some of them were quite smart for their age but plenty failed to particularly impress, so IDK how useful test scores are at suggesting the sorts of qualities being discussed here.

"Consider the fact that the brain of a Zorblaxian (alien) is not physically or chemically identical to the brain of a human. Should it not follow that the thought structures of a Zorblaxian cannot be the same as those of a human? Should this not include the capacity for full rationality?"

One could do a similar male/female (/female/male) word replacement.

My thoughts on this:

Let it be assumed that there is a biological requirement for what can be referred to as rationality. As a basis for this, consider a rock without a brain, a jellyfish, an ant, a digger wasp that moves a spider to its previous position time and time again without adaptation.

Given how adult humans have to jump through hoops such as statistical tests, double-blind studies and other means to try to get past issues such as confirmation bias and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies][oh-so-many-fallacies]] that humans are prone to, it's doubtful that we meet the requirements for an imagined 'full rationality', with or without our largely ad-hoc systems for defending ourselves from commiting irrational behaviour.

If there is to be any hope of achieving a state of 'full rationality', it either depends on modifying our brains to behave according to a specific behaviour pattern, or 'full rationality' being defined in such a way that very different brains, with very different quirks and handicaps, can (with biological capabilities over a certain low threshold) self-analyse and reach the same equivalent position termed 'full rationality'.

Or, to summarise this (spoken by an imagined person): "HAH-HAH-HAH! White male human adults, you think there's a 'peak' and a 'non-peak' for rational behaviour, and coincidentally YOU'RE at the top of the entire universe and I'm not?"

*** Actually, I like your word replacement and it brings up a good point. An alien Zorblaxian should NOT think like an adult human, and we should NOT see the Zorblaxian reason about things in the same way a human would, and the decisions a rational Zorblaxian would make should NOT be exactly the same as a rational human. Maybe the Zorblaxian is also poor at modelling other people's thoughts as different from it's own, but maybe the Zorblaxian can intuitively grasp very large numbers in a way a human cannot. Maybe a natural disaster that kills 100,000 Zorblaxians isn't just a statistic, but as intimate as seeing a Zorblaxian's mate die. A real alien should NOT be represented as a human in a rubber mask.

And maybe male and female humans really do think differently. Who knows?!?

But my point is about children, and my post is complaining about presenting "rational children" as "rational adults in a child's body" that seems quite common in so-called rational fiction. A child should NOT be capable of the kinds of long-term planning that an adult can consider and should NOT be capable of intuitively understanding that other people are actually complete persons with their own modes of thought and beliefs. That's what I'm talking about, and that's what you haven't addressed.

Well, seeing as it's career suicide for a scientist to actually try to study it, I'd say that some of the better people to look at about that would probably be the Pick-Up Artist community, since they at least /try/ to approach things scientifically.

** What do you mean by modeling other people? Can you give examples? It seems like children should know that other people don't believe the same things, just because they're likely to be disagreed with rather often. On the other hand, I had this annoying tendency to come up with complicated activities I wanted to do without telling the people I was trying to draft into participating, or explaining anything at all, then throw a fit when it immediately collapsed. It seems like I /could/ model other people, but never actually bothered to do so unless I was beat over the head with why that was a problem in a specific case. (Like, I /vastly/ underestimated how much getting punched hurts... but is trying to avoid punching people /after/ learning that just mind-projection?)

Egocentrism was /so much/ worse, yes. What changed that was a combination of being put in circumstances that pushed me to reflect on how I'd changed from 2-12, and failing enough to finally drill in some humility. This does /not/ mean I was incapable of altruism beforehand. I don't mean performing altruism to receive some kinda reward--unless you use a very broad definition of reward that includes satisfying altruistic impulses--I mean random acts of kindness, or trying to help strangers who seemed in need of help. ... I'm still kiiinda likely to get upset about that one time my parents yelled at me until I backed away from helping the younger child stuck in a hard-to-climb-out-of space on the grounds that she wasn't my sister (no seriously wtf?).

Heck, I once had a 10-year-old try to realtalk me (21) about whether or not I thought about the feelings of someone else who I might have made a disparaging remark or 3 about. No one else was in earshot and I'm not sure I've heard him sound as serious since (now 18).

I question whether ability is what's lacking, rather than intrensic motivation to use/train it. Ability to accurately model other people and make short/medium-term plans (as in, up to a week) seem /extremely/ important to survival prior to modernity. People can get away with being terrible at these much more often, nowadays. So how do we distinguish "short-sighted jerk because sheltered and inexperienced" from "short-sighted jerk because biology"? Has someone studied these particular attributes among hunter-gatherers? Serious question.

I acknowledge that puberty /does/ screw with one's head in ways which affect one's approach to dealing with others. It makes sense that there would be a change when the biological goal changes. You seem to be claiming that both puberty and a cutoff closer to age 15 are hugely important to these specific skills. What about all the people who complete puberty before 14-15? If it's age more than hormones, then are these two separate aspects, and how are they divided?

*** An example is the False-Belief Task. I'm sure you know how infants lack object permanence. Hide something from view, and to the infant it ceases to exist. Ask a young child to describe how a structure looks from another person's point of view, and they'll describe it from their own point of view. Ask an older child what another person would like to happen, and they'll answer what they themselves would like to happen. Ask a teenager how someone else could believe something that to them is wrong, and they'll have trouble answering seriously. That's the progression underlying the false-belief task. It's not until adulthood that people can honestly apply the "platinum rule" of "do unto others as they would have done to themselves" instead of the "golden rule" of "do unto others as you'd have done to yourself". How easily does a teenager declare someone with contrary beliefs to be bad or stupid instead of simply having a different belief structure that's totally valid for themselves? /That's/ the difficulty of modelling someone else.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind#False-belief_task]]

Anyway, behaviors can be learned based on reward/punishment and carried over outside of reward/punishment situations, and certainly a 10-year-old can parrot a model for critical thinking that s/he was taught in a group setting, for example. In fact, I'm all for giving kids all the methods they can handle in order to maximize their capacity for long-term thought and imagining other points of view, but it's got to be realistic and fit the needs and capabilities of the end-user (children at a certain stage of development).

Kids are super-curious about how the world works. They ought to be highly motivated to learn how other people think and to plan events with far-reaching consequences. In fact, given how weak they are physically, children may be extra-incentivized to protect themselves through careful consideration of consequences and other people. Especially kids in abusive or dangerous environments, because we don't wanna be unethical and run actual lab experiments to mess kids up. Do we see better consequence-management in such environments? Do we see better people-modelling?

I don't recall mentioning puberty, actually, but the expected completion of mental maturation at 15-20 or thereabouts (it's not fixed for everybody) seems to have been shown experimentally by Piaget and others. And as you might recognize in your daily life, not all adults really seem to have that mature a framework for decision-making. Current events and politics ought to show that plenty of voting-age adults are not particularly capable of understanding different points of view or considering long-term consequences. So, I'd say 15 or so at the earliest, probably 20 or so for many or most, and maybe never for the remainder.

If child brains are different to adult brains, and only one of the two is truly capable of rationality, then why should that one be the adult brain?

If there are different biological brain structures, some capable of rationality and some not, then how can you tell which side of that divide /your/ brain is on? Perhaps rationality is only possible at very specific serotonin levels, or among people with some-or-other brain syndrome (like Asperger's, or aphantasia).
