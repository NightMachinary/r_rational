**** Yeah, I just double checked. Chapter 55. The wish specified that the books be sorted in order of importance. Also, the books on the nature of the gods were in the first row. Obviously knowing the nature of the gods is the #1 most important information.

Some math on those books: The text is small enough that it appears black and requires an electron microscope to read. Lets assume that the writing consists of individual ink molecules laid out in a readable fashion. So the letter H might consist of 11 ink molecules, each of which is 100 nm, giving us an average letter size of roughly 500nm including white space. Average word has 5 letters, so 2500nm per word. That gives us 10k words per line, for a total of 100 million words per page. A thousand double sided pages gives us 200 billion words per book. Nine linear feet of such books, comprising the sum total of everything he could possibly know about the gods, gives us 2 trillion words total.

In comparison, the library of congress has 20 million books giving us 1 trillion words. So... totally readable. Just saying.

/grumble, grumble, rational fans, grumble, doing math, grumble, can't just relax and enjoy, grumble, grumble/

Hm. That sounds low to me, let me check.

The dimensions of the book were called out as "one yard wide and high, and at least 6" thick." Let's assume that it's 1m x 1m x 6 inches. (I'm using inches for thickness because that's the measurement I found online for paper thickness.)

If a word is 2500nm, then by my math the page is 400,000 words per line (ignore margins). If a letter with whitespace is 500nm, let's assume that each line (including leading) is 1000nm. That means there's 1,000,000 lines per page (we'll ignore margins again), for a total of 400,0000,000,000 (four hundred billion!) words per page. Now, based on a quick googling, regular printer paper is 500 sheets to the inch. The paper in Loki's books is from a medieval technology and probably thicker; let's keep the math easy and say that it's 100 sheets to the inch. That's 600 pages per book, double sided makes a total of 1200 pages with 4E11 words on each one, meaning a total of 48E13 words per book. Ignoring the thickness of covers, nine linear feet would be 18 books; let's round it down to 10 to account for the covers and some small space between the books (and to keep the math easy). That's a total of 48E14 or, more properly 4.8E15 words. Round it off and call if 5E15.

#+begin_quote
  9 linear feet of such books, comprising the sum total of everything he could possibly know about the gods, gives us 2 trillion words total.
#+end_quote

Ermmm...I think you might be shooting a bit low. :>

Also, note that those nine linear feet weren't "everything I know about gods". They were "the opening paragraph of the discussion about the nature of gods." Yes, Loki spent about /five quadrillion words/ on a single paragraph of text -- of course, all of it was carefully proofread and grammatically correct.

The best part? The sum total of the discussion about the nature of gods can be summed up as "humans create them by believing in them. This will create a god from nothing, or cause a mortal to ascend to godhood."

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Well, let's see...there's 3 bookcases, a total of 6 sets of bookshelves (one of each side of the bookcase), and they recede to "the vanishing point." Let's call that a measly 1000 yards. Now, rounding our earlier estimate of thickness even further, let's say that it's one book per linear foot. That means there's +30,000+ 3000 (oops) books per shelf; I didn't specify the number of shelves, just that they are "tall". Let's go with 30', which is the estimating-from-memory height of other major needs-a-ladder libraries that I've seen. Let's assume that's 10 sets of shelves on each of the 6 bookshelves, for a total of 60 shelves of (at minimum!) 3,000 books each, for a total of +1,800,000 books+ 180,000. And let's round that again to 200,000 books, each of which contains 5E15 words, for a total of 1E21 words.

I think you're going to need a lot of Red Bull to get through that in a timely fashion. ;>

The Enlarge Item spell increases the size of something by a factor of 16 in each dimension. If we assume (as above) that each letter is 500nm on a side, that means that after being Enlarged it would be 8micrometers per side.

D&D Intelligence seems to map, very roughly, to the IQ scale. A standard human has an Int of 10 / IQ of 100. Maximum human Intelligence is 18, and people with an IQ of 180 are considered top-end geniuses. [A random website[([[http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/the-10-highest-iqs-in-histoy/9/]]) tells me that the real-world person with the highest IQ that may have been accurately measured is Terence Tao, coming in at around 230, with Hawking being around 160 and Einstein estimated at around 180. The people of Grofhamr are survivors of a massive war, so let's assume they are smarter than the average, starting at 12 and going up to the normally maximal 18.

The POPEs give a +5, and a maximized Headband of Intellect gives another +6. The majority of people who are being run through the FLEA would have started with a 12 so, after full enhancement they would be at 23 -- meaning they would be as smart as Tao, a real world human.

They are WAY smarter than the average, but not superhuman.

You're right that those are critical facts, but I wouldn't call them part of the "nature" of gods. I would put those in a distinct category. But, that's just semantics. I'm sure that the answers to all the questions you list are in that library somewhere.

When Loki originally created the room, the door was always a couple feet behind Jake -- it would follow him around as he moved. (It would hold still if he wanted to step into it, of course.)

This is great for making sure that it's available, but not so much when you want to leave it next to the altar while you go off and do other things. At Jake's request, Loki temporarily untethered the room from Jake; it'll stay right where it is until Jake comes back and picks it up, at which point it will start following him around again.

** No spells, no killing. I'm betting on yet another Helm of Opposite Alignment. But how to apply it enough times to break through the Will Save of a god?

One way would be to stack millions of helms together. Nothing is stopping them from being a nanometer thick. But what if they have to be touching the head of the person in order to work? (Does Jake know the rule on this?)

I have an amusing mental picture of a stack of graphene nanolayer "helms" that disappear as soon as they touch an Evil person's head. (Every other layer in the stack could be a spell engine that causes itself and the layer immediately below itself to disappear.)

I wonder if such a stack could be wished into existence in one go, or if a bunch of sequential wishes would be needed.

Also, could the hats be delivered magically, say teleported or wished into being directly onto the target's head?

If so, instead of a stack of thin hats, it might be more efficient to use a bunch of small spell engines (a bag of sand with each grain being a spell engine, say) to rapidly apply and remove a single helm.

("Spell sand" could be useful for a lot of things, come to think of it. You could go into battle with every person armed with millions of spells ready to go off instantly. And the particles could be arbitrarily small, perhaps individual molecules...)

You can't. :> Greater Gods (like Neklos) have the ability:

  Always Maximize Roll

  Greater deities (rank 16-20) automatically get the best result possible on any check, saving throw, attack roll, or damage roll. Calculate success, failure, or other effects accordingly. When a greater deity makes a check, attack, or save assume a 20 was rolled and calculate success or failure from there.

So, nope. Nothing that allows a save is ever going to work on him.

The idea of spellsand is slick. I'm pretty sure there will be some reason in RAW why it's not doable, but I don't know what it would be..maybe "because spell traps have to be a certain size" ?

** Do objects have to be carefully dropped in the sacrificial fires, or can they be thrown?

I'd say that the books are Large Improvised Throwing Weapons, giving them a range increment of 15 feet, a -4 penalty to attack, and 1d6 damage.

A 5 foot square has AC 5, so let's say that the fires are AC 15 (because they're small). Being 5 range increments (75') away (the maximum, ) gives a -10 penalty to hit, so a roll of 30 is needed to hit it, which an Ice Assassin could do 19 times out of 20.

If some Monks came out of the FLEA, they could also use the [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#snatchArrows][Snatch Arrows]] feat to speed up the bottleneck at the door, by having people on one end throw them through the doorway, while the monks catch them on the other end. there could be about 300 people on each end of this, practically negating the bottleneck.

They can be thrown. The "throwing it in the fire" part is mostly set dressing -- the actual important element is the choice of sacrifice. The fire is really just the equivalent of an "are you sure?" dialog...you can make the decision to sacrifice something, but you get to change your mind right up until the moment you actually put it in the fire.

Actions come in several types, but the ones we care about here are: free, move, standard, and full-round. In a given round you can perform:

- standard+move,
- move+move,
- full-round

No matter which format you choose, you can perform an arbitrary number of free actions in a round -- basically, as many as the DM will let you get away with.

Picking something up is a move action, and it's a singular thing. The exact text is:

#+begin_quote
  [A move action] includes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a heavy object, and opening a door.
#+end_quote

So, picking up a /bag/ of daggers is one move action, but picking up two daggers is two move actions.

As to multiple attacks: yes, if you're high level, you are allowed to make multiple attacks in a round. In order to do that, though, you need to use a full-round action, which means you can't do anything else except free actions.

5th is basically a return to being more like 3rd in a lot of ways. So far, there hasn't been a change between 3rd and 5th that I find myself disliking. Everything is streamlined, but unlike 4th, you don't feel like you're missing out on anything. They added a lot of the weirdness back into the game - cool spells and unique classes that do things that can't be easily put into one category or another. And the production values on the books are quite high. It's still a /little/ too soon to say, since the DMG isn't out yet, but mostly I think it's an improvement on 3rd (though it's difficult to say that when I'm comparing an edition with hundreds of broken splatbooks and contradictory rules to something that has virtually nothing in the way of supplemental material as yet).
