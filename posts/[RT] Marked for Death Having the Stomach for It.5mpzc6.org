*** This may be a dumb question, but how do quests work? I see a lot of them on SV/SB but I've never read one. Specifically, do I need to read the comments to understand what's going on? I usually just compile all the threadmarked posts into an ebook when I'm reading something on those forums, would that work for a quest?

**** If you want only the canonical parts (and, like, one silly post each by [[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] and [[/u/Velorien][u/Velorien]]), do what [[/u/faflec][u/faflec]] says and go to the Story Only thread. If you want all the fan-works to be included, pull all the threadmarked posts.

E: Also, to answer your first question, quests work by all the thread participants voting on what are essentially writing prompts for the author. In this case, the players all vote on plans for Hazou to try to follow. There are tens of thousands of this point, so I would not recommend trying to read all of them if you value your sanity. My suggestion would be to read through all the threadmarks in Reader Mode, then follow the comments for a couple days to get a better handle on thread memes / culture / norms.

***** Thanks! I'm guessing a common way to read these when binging on the forums would be to read each threadmark and skim the first page or two of comments before jumping to the next chapter?

****** Probably, but in this case you'll mostly get a bunch of panicked screams, no matter the chapter. :P

**** Generally, yes. Most quests are pretty good that way.

Don't do it for this quest, though: we have more omakes than actual story posts. Better to go to the Story-Only thread (see the OP for the quest).

****** If you want to read the omakes. Go ahead.

It will significantly extend your reading time, though.
