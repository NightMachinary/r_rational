** Thank you! I read this probably more than a year ago before I signed up for a Royal Road account, and then forgot the name of it. I really enjoyed this story back then. I'll have to get caught up...I think I was at the end of book 1 probably?

**** I think They had just finished the first dungeon and we saw them searching for another dungeon, but they hadn't really found any yet. I remember there was a...kid? I think, that had some abilities from a dungeon that we saw from his/her POV, but the main cast didn't realize it.

principal.

The anti-depression potions seem like something to sell via the customers of their other stock. Clinically depressed people might not be able to afford it themselves but, like JP, rich clients of the alchemists may have someone that they care about who would benefit.

I'm surprised they'd ask for payment in cash rather than in a reciprocal exchange of delver magic, though. They're wealthy and their wealth was built on a handful of inherited magics; getting more would be better than a few thousand bucks they could get just as easily from a mundane client.
