** You know that his town isn't really called "Bumblefuck", right? He's just calling it by a disparaging name implying that it's not a good place to live.

** FWIW, I don't think that this sort of post is going to lead to productive discussion, and will likely end up being needlessly negative. I think there's plenty of room for criticism, but this is the kind of low-effort criticism that I find to be particularly without value. I won't remove it, since I have conflicts of interest, but I did downvote it.

** I think "get on my case" is a pretty common english expression.

** So I actually think this has value, as being able to file off those minor annoyances can be relatively low effort improvement to otherwise good works.

I found the same thing with worm, specifically wrt 'headspace.' Lots of unconnected people used it, and it's a pretty niche term in my experience.

There was a trend for differently colored text on SB/SV a while back (particularly in power rings / MTG fiction). It got painful fast. Invisitext also annoys me.

Obviously bad grammar and spelling can quickly put me off a work. I tend to ditch a work if it happens too much though, so hard to remember specific examples.

There have been a few translations where the translator inserts snarky comments. I appreciate the cultural notes and stuff, but I wish they would put them in the footnotes instead of in the text.
