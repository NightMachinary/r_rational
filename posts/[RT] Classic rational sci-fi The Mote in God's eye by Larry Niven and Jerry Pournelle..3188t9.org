I've read Blindsight, but only just got the chance to pick up this classic in audiobook form.

The Moties are a really interesting species collective, and I can see the parallels between them and the later codified concepts of AI optimized social combat and evolutionarily optimized specialized subroutines.

Both factions of the story are very intelligent and rational, with individuals within the factions having their own individual philosophies and worldviews that one could write a treatise on the characters alone.

Spoiler for a reveal which someone who has heard of the story but not actually read it follows.

** This is a really great book. Re-reading it recently, it was interesting how dated its depiction of gendered behavior is (I think Asimov has aged best of all in that regard). In competent hands, I think this could really benefit from being made into a movie.

*** There's several examples of physical zeerust in the book, like how there was still physical film in their cameras and their pocket computers were unusually slow searching ship records. Edit: And how did I forget that the messages used telegraph style punctuation?!

But honestly, the gender roles depicted in the book didn't feel that dated alongside how the second human empire was a multi-planet heuristical monarchy with some form of Christian church support. The gender roles were there, but they weren't cripplingly rigid, just look at the heiress who decided to go into anthropology, and then onwards to successfully getting a place on the Mote Expedition.

*** A movie based on this book would be incredible - if done well. It would have to be carefully done though, because if done true to the book, the warrior Moties would be very, very frightening, Close to 'Alien' frightening, and might easily overpower the rest of the movie.

In fact I'm rather surprised I've never seen a Motie warrior vs Alien or Predator fiction. /wanders off to google/

*** Asimov simply has very few female characters. Can you even name any besides Susan Calvin, Arkady Darrell, and Dors Venabili?

**** I agree that there's missing women (Among robots too! Feminine Intuition is fun and gets in some good satire, but doesn't make the leap that maybe some people will just want to buy ordinary robots with contralto voices), but that's par for the course. At the time Asimov was writing interesting stories with Susan Calvin, Ursula LeGuin was still writing entirely-male Earthsea novels (Left Hand of Darkness was 1969, same year as the latter Calvinist story Feminine Intuition). The main thing I appreciate is that the ones there were written as interesting people (or at least at the same rate as the men, they can't all be winners :P), and the relationships they had with other people seem, well, plausibly modern.

And I'd add Selene and Dua (sort of? Maybe Tritt would fit also/instead, but they are gender nonbinary and also boring, while Dua seems to be written as a woman) from The Gods Themselves. (Which was published in 1972, while Mote is from 1974)
