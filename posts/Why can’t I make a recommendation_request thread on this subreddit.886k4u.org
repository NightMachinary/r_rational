There is no rule on the sidebar stating those types of threads are not allowed. However, threads in this nature still get removed without explanation. Some request threads are unique which the rational wiki sticky on the sidebar does not cover. I personally tried to make a thread asking for recommendations for a rational self insert fanfics. An hour later it gets removed and I tried msging the mods on the subreddit and discord asking why and was ignored.

Either make your rules more clear or stop removing threads. If the mods complain saying that these types of thread create clutter in the subreddit, thats what a downvote button is for.

** Quote from the sidebar: "Post links to or discussion of rational fiction only; otherwise use one of the weekly discussion threads."

A recommendation/request thread is clearly neither a discussion of rational fiction nor a link to rational fiction. Of course, the mods should certainly have told you via message and discord why, but the reason seems fairly clear to me.

In addition, request threads are somewhat rude because ideas are a dime a dozen but actually writing a fic is difficult; similarly, recommendation threads really belong as comments on the monthly recommendation post. The recommendation post for March is at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/826k1r/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/]]

*** Recommendations and requests could be considered discussion of rational fiction.

Especially if those giving recommendations or fulfilling requests explain why they think the story is worth reading.

I think it's ambiguous enough that it would be worth explicitly banning recommendation/request threads if that's what the mods want to do.

edit: Also from a practical point of view, we've already seen that some people interpret the rules this way. So even if the interpretation you gave is 100% correct, there's no harm in making them more explicit, if for no other reason than to make the moderator's work easier.

**** I think the idea is that the post /itself/---its original text content submitted along with it---has to be "links to, or discussion of, rational fiction." You can't be relying on the /replies/ to a post to make the post relevant.

***** That's fair I suppose. But it's still not 100% obvious that that's what they're trying to imply.

Why not just add one more line to the rules and clear up any possible confusion? I'm not seeing any logical arguments against stating the rules more clearly.

** Personally I think you have a point. There should be something explicitly in the rules which says "no posting request threads" if that's something the mods want to avoid.

I thought there was a seperate link to additional rules somewhere, but I'm unable to find it. Which means even if there are more detailed rules than what's listed in the side bar, the sub could definitely benefit from making those rules more visible.

Also check out [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] for a long constantly updating SI in the Young Justice/DC universe that seems more or less rational and covers transhumanist themes. (Note: it may seem like it's just retreading cannon at first, but it diverges and explores many subplots after it gets out of the opening stages of the story).
