Remember that with the gates she could in theory take an army traipsing across Procer with The Principate unable to stop her because she just gates to another part of the country (that they can't predict) before an enemy force can close in. But (moral arguments aside) that's the sort of weapon that would demand a unified response from basically the rest of the world that would be completely unwilling to end hostilities until Cat is dead because she showed herself to be so dangerous. She has to temper what she uses so that Procer actually feels like they have the option of ending the crusade and at least temporarily coexisting with Cat and Callow

******** Well, story patterns in and of themselves deter any (rational) villain from using them because it is guaranteed to eventually fail in some way that leads to their downfall. But there are a couple differences that explain why nukes were a deterrent in real life but rough equivalents don't function similarly.

The big one is MAD. Namely that in real life other nations outside of the US got nukes as well relatively quickly. MAD doesn't work without each side being able to hit just as hard and Good generally speaking doesn't havve the power to hit as hard as a doomsday weapon outside of flinging heroes at them hoping one can call down an Angel to enter creation. Related is that good /knows/ they are right. So while they don't have the juice to immediately counter a doomsday weapon, they also have a moral certainty that won't let them surrender in the face of a show of overwhelming force like normal people would. It's why Cat is basing her strategy of getting surrender from the crusade around losses suffered by Princes of the material realm, not suffered by heroes which ultimately only answer to higher loftier concerns

The second is that real life leaders have to give something of a shit about their citizens. Remember, part of the reason the A bomb was used is that a conventional invasion of Japan would have resulted in a very large number of Japanese and American casualities. In terms of deaths caused, fire bombing by the US was far more deadly than the two dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Calernia doesn't fare near as well here. Evil obviously has had villains who literally could not care less (Akua) but even in Procer, which is probably the best life a peasant could have, any nonnamed that wasnt rich in the best case scenario lives the life of a serf. Procer cares about it's people in general, strategically (have enough to fill army, defend the chain of hunger, to farm food, etc.) but would take a succesful First Liesse happening, even if it was to one of their own cities. MAD only works if the potiental loss is too great for you to be willing to bear, and in a fight against a side you know to be Evil and where your citizens are thought of as at least somewhat expendable, that scope of loss is very narrow indeed.

Their world also doesn't really seem to have a single superpower, or unified body that can set rules and norms, in the way the USA or UN did in the 20th century IRL. So the situation is maybe more analogous to WW1 where people invade based on seeing enemies building up forces and power.

If this were somehow to come about it would actually be a major advantage - the onus isn't on her to sally forth and attack their camp, it's on them to come to her or they'll just starve. I'm not sure if they even /could/ get their army out - surviving impossible bullshit is for Named. If they did, it would at least cost them a significant amount of bullshit.

The only way the water can be an undeniable advantage to Cat is when the good guys can't bullshit their way out of it because the crusaders are already in there, and her main means of delivering it is by opening the portal above the target.

If not, she can transport them into Arcadia... a mile above the surface. That usage has way less collateral damage than transferring stuff from Arcadia into Creation.

*** I'm not sure but it seemed to me like the reason this works is that they were targetting a water area, so as soon as there was a new direction it could flow it naturally flowed out. (Like opening a whole in a swimming pool or something). I don't think she could get the enemies to go into arcadia without them willingly walking through.

**** I was thinking just set the gate horizontally a bit beneath the surface of the ground and have everything fall through.

You can't typically scry underground though, so that might not work. You'd have to set the gate on the surface of the ground, but there might be weird limitation about that too, like a gate has to be a plane, so you couldn't open one on the ground unless the ground was perfectly flat or something. We don't have know what would happen if she tried opening up a gate at, say, knee height where a bunch of people/objects already exist either.

**** I figured, but I think the narrative is my least favorite part of this story. I prefer the Game of Thrones approach of "Aegon had dragons and conquered the whole continent by using the same approach over and over again, because no one had an answer for it."

'My enemy used this tactic before' is not, on its own, a satisfying counter. And something as versatile as absolute positioning should be the focus of an entire campaign, or even overarching military strategy as long as it can be used.

It's like a new mechanic in a game. The most satisfaction would derive from exploring it and using it in a multitude of different ways, not observing it from a superficial perspective and then tossing it away.

Using it to move cities around, shape the terrain, teleport specific units to/away from battles, creating large portals to other armies and shuffling around the battlefield. So many fun things to do.

And for that matter, I like the idea of flying fortresses and crazy magic items. The story is great, I just wish it allowed for Cat acting like a real crazy villain, even if it's subverted heavily. (Like, making a series of flying farms to optimize crop production, or manipulating giant nets to catch large amounts of fish. Warlock's reality alterations could be used to establish trade with Arcadia/other realms. Demons, if properly controlled, could be used to improve manufacturing processes, like shutting down harmful oxygenation processes when forging blades, etc.)

Well, that's how Triumphant's conquest worked. That said, any approach with a singular point of failure (a flying fortress with a levitation-controlling array in the center of it, a magical system for opening portals that can only be used by one person under specific conditions, a group of being from another dimension bound to a specific artifact) wil have heroes thown at it until one of them rolls the right combination for exploiting that weakness. Triumphant won not becaus there were no heroes with an advantage against devils or demons, but because there were /too many/ devils and demons for them to fight. When she ran itno something she couldn't throw demons at (Tyrian sea) she lost momentum, while the heroes kept coming until there was enough to contain all she could have mustered (at least I assume so; her defeat isn't exactly described in detail, save for the fact that she let all the demons she had in Praes loose when she brought down the Tower on top of her enemies).

As for the stuff you mentioned, while portals are Catherine's schtick and can be explored in her story, the rest is harder to exploit. Most magic stuff can't simultaneously be mass-produced, controlled or used safely, and if you look at places like the Wasteland, even their disproportional amount of practitioners barely makes a dent in the pile that is supporting a nation.

** so, I tried out this story but I put it down around chapter 16. Can someone convince me to keep reading?

Here was my experience:

- First chapter, introduced to Cat, she seems interesting, good so far
- Black Knight shows up, drives the plot, chooses Cat for completely opaque reasons. I get a little bored.
- Some trippy dream thing happens, whatever.
- some sort of fight between Cat and other squire-wannabes. Not really sure who these guys were or where they came from. Some parts of the fight were cool, I guess.
- Black knight uses his command voice to control Cat. Cat sees the results of her actions. OH SHIT, now shit is getting real.
- Gnomes, red letters?? wow, this sounds intriguing.
- Oh, I also thought the concept of 'Scribe', someone whose superpower appears to be being really good at paperwork, pretty amusing.
- Now we're at... battle school...? Gnome plotline is dropped? Totally not invested in whatever fight is going down right now.

And... that's where I stopped because I couldn't force myself to slog through this battle stuff. So given which parts I liked and didn't like, should I keep on going?

See, I get the feeling that, like with Worm, stuff like this is a casualty of the story being recommended on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. This story isn't entirely (or even mostly) about optimizing the world: the industrial revolution is nowhere in sight (the society seems to be barely nearing Renaissance at best), and the whole concept of Fate is about history being driven into the ground by the constant repetition of established patterns.

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/12/09/chapter-4-return/#comment-549][Creation, broadly speaking, isn't a world that encourages technological progress,]] and the gnomes are only a part of the problem. That said, they aren't a mere plot device, it's just that in a world where a reasonable reaction to a more experienced wizard telling you not to meddle in something dangerous is to burn your research and salt the ashes, where just keeping notes on certain subjects warps reality and where the only warning before everything you know will be wiped off the face of the Earth is a letter in a red leather sheath, everybody in the know has no reason nor an inclination to pursue those avenues of research. The gnomes are still mentioned here and there, but nobody wants to pull a pin on that grenade.

Given what you paid attention to and what you didn't (like Name dreams and Heiress' appearance) I feel the need to clarify that this story is explicitly genre savvy and deals first and foremost with breaking out of story patterns that lead nowhere. The world the characters live in isn't the one which innovation in and of itself can improve, so they look primarily to manipulating what already exists rather than creating something new.

For me it wasn't really what Worm was to superhero fiction, since I read way too much fantasy that is genre-savvy to some extent, so making it a system with rules and memes of its own (like Rule of Three, which isn't nearly as formalized in our stories, of flying fortresses as the foremost example of a magical weapon with glaring inherent weaknesses) is a logical next step.

That said, I like Erraticerrata's take on genre awareness more than almost any other, because it comes to the logical conclusion where other commentaries on the genre conventions sort of leave the thought hanging. Playing a trope straight may be done well, but while it being a trope in the first place means that there are examples of it being done well, that also raises the bar over time. Deconstructing the trope requires bringing a misconception into a reality where it would have no reason to exist in the first place, which needs either a sufficiently naive character to bring it up or a convoluted set-up for what is all too often an unnecessary detour. Demonstrating a cliche ironically is easy to mishandle, since the author risks being either too repetitive and unoriginal, lazy and obvious or, again, shoehorning into the story something that doesn't belong in its world.

Guideverse has an actual /reason/ for stories repeating over and over: the Roles are the repetitive patterns in the Fate /as they are known to people/. That's why stealth Names aren't a thing despite covert tactics being brutally effective against systems relying on singular individual like the Named (a Name is fueled by its tale as it is told, and you need to at least keep people speculating, like the Assassin), but comic reliefs are (stories spread based on their entertainment value, making the amusing characters invulnerable as long as they are funny). Human decisions matter not just because they are far more convoluted than simple physical processes and we need different models to understand them, but because there are beings who make the choices /matter/. Magic and spells seem to take advantage of that, manipulating the Pattern more directly than living a story would, more flexible in terms of control over the results but with less reach in manipulation of the consequences.

*** Starting from the War College, a whole lot of words are used to describe large scale battle tactics and maneuvers. Honestly, I find that kind of tedious myself at points. As of Book 4, gnomes have still not really been explored as a plot point. Scribe hasn't gotten a whole lot of attention either. We are eventually introduced to some other unconventional Names though. Cat continues to escalate and do continually more impressively badass things, but the scale of conflicts she engages in means there's a lot of focus on big battles and politics too rather than just individual action.
