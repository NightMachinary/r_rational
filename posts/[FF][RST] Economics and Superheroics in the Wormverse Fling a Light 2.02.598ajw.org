** I saw all the comments on the previous chapter complaining about the revisions, so I just wanted to pipe up and say that I'm still reading and enjoying! The ending scene of this chapter was very powerful.

** I like this fic, but I'm a bit put out by how powerless Taylor is in this world. Her power is great and she's not getting any appreciation for it :(

*** If she won right off the bat, what would I put at the end? One of the issues with the serial format is that the resolution isn't just 200 pages and a binge-reading session away, so it can get a bit frustrating. Some people go too far in the other direction and have their protagonists win win win the entire time, but that sacrifices the story's structure and longevity for short-term zanyness. I hope to strike a balance in the future, but for now I'm going for structure over everything and damning the consequences.

  I would enjoy crossover-possessions, alternate universes and self-inserts a lot more if the protagonist didn't end up with a brand-new set of skills IN ADDITION TO all the skills of the original.

Did you ever find any good ones like that? I'd love to read one as well.

****** In alt-universe, there have been a scant few Worm fics where the protagonist didn't quickly prove even more OP than canon Taylor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898446/1/Weaver-Nine][Weaver Nine]]: Taylor and Jack Slash swap places at birth. Wonderful, but likely dead ;_;

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/h-mayhem-worm.27201/][H+ Mayhem]]: follows an OC, OP tinker that also has crippling personal flaws which thankfully show up before the wish-fullfillment has a chance to get boring. On hiatus near its ending, maybe not dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11626470/1/Crime-and-Commitment][Crime and Commitment]]: Taylor and the Undersiders keep their independence. Taylor's powers are stronger than canon but she faces OC enemies. Ongoing.

*cough* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11454142/1/Fling-a-Light][Fling a Light]]

...and that's all I can think of (plus a few that are bad for other reasons), Worm or otherwise. Not a long list. And I can't think of ANY crossover-possession or self-insert that didn't fall into a boring snowball of success.

**** I see what you mean. I guess it felt weird that Taylor is basically "a glorified telephone" who no one's taking seriously.

Like, with her power, she shouldn't have to revel in smugness when gauthier overrules mercy, because taylor could have shut her down way before that if she really wanted to.

I have a vague memory of accord saying pretty much the same thing.

** YAY! Another update!

So does this mean we can expect more frequent updates or was this a stroke of good luck?

Anywhat, this last chapters seem neatly written, I haven't felt any obvious grammatical and writing errors, and story progression seems good.

Might be a good idea for Tesseract INC to work on their PR, maybe transport some basic goods or people for free, really show what her power is good for and why getting her company more resources is a good idea.
