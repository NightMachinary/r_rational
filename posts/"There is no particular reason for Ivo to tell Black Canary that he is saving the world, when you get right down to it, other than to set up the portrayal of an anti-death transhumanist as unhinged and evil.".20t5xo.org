** THIS. This is why I always tell people I'm a mad, evil villain. It's not lying, it's just phrasing things in terms they understand. I want to save lives and improve quality of life via organized social cooperation; /ergo/, I must be a Stalin waiting to happen. Everyone knows that anyone who makes a large change to the status quo in the process of helping people was not actually helping and is actually evil.

**** To quote myself:

Or in other words, things like /elections/ and /publicly-accountable institutions/, which are much, much eviller than lone heroes determining what's right for everyone, apparently.

To be entirely serious, I do agree with the blogger that our culture has taken a really /bizarre/ turn towards thinking that lone self-appointed ubermenschen are saviors of the human race rather than reactionary wannabe-dictators. It's especially bizarre when men like, say, Elon Musk come out and /say/ that they actually kinda /like/ this whole "society" thing themselves.

Go ahead and quote MoR!Quirrell at me, but do remember that Quirrell is presenting a view on society that is deliberately biased towards the negative, not only by the speaker's mind but by his intention that the listener should abandon society and draw closer to Quirrell. Quirrell's IRL counterpart, Michael Vassar, has been described as expressing /nearly/ that degree of cynicism but "with a phoenix on his shoulder".

So yeah, the "ultra-Slytherin" view that we need ubermensch heroes to help us because we /cannot/ help ourselves is just kinda... not really well-evidenced.

Lastly, the term "individual rights" is /very/ contested. Not in the card-carryingly evil "No you don't have any rights" way, just in the way that some people believe they've got a right to anti-death serum and some people believe that they've got a right not to be taxed to provide others with anti-death serum. You have to agree on what the individual/human rights /are/ before you can use them as a moral argument.

**** Can I ask what exactly determines a person's 'rights' other than the de-facto laws and organizations in a society enforcing them? I mean, you seem to be using the word in a way that indicates you believe that rights are something we possess without the context of a larger society granting those rights (from the bit about the majority vote you don't care about). I have heard others express this view before, but when pressed on this point I haven't heard very convincing explainations. One hopes that on a subreddit like this one the participants will have examined their own viewpoints in detail, so would you consider explaining this in a few more words?

1) What exactly you consider a 'right' that can be violated that is not granted by a larger social system?

2) Examples of such 'rights'.

3) Why it is a moral absolute that no-one's 'right's be violated, no matter the degree of violation or the potential benefits.

****** I agree that rights in general are good Schelling points when used as codes, as you say. These would seem to be more optimal /to me/ when rights change over time to reflect society's moral compass - so that you can get new rights over time, for example, such as freedom from persecution on the basis of sexual orientation or race, which are rights we've seen developing and growing over time in the recent past in the western world, and you can lose rights which we decide aren't so important after all, like how the right to bear arms has been limited and made less absolute over time as the technology of arms changed. However, the person I was originally replying to (who hasn't replied) was writing about rights that are /independent of human codes/ as far as I could tell which isn't even a really coherent idea by itself IMO - and presumably if these rights are not the result of a society or laws they wouldn't change over time and would have to be eternally inviolate, I guess? Unless wherever the rights were coming from (not a vote or other democratic process, apparantly) could change those rights over time. Though they never came back to clarify their thoughts.

The blogger actually addresses the "but that's how it is in the comics!" objection, noting that /Iron Man 3/ went and changed the Mandarin from his comics portrayal to match the real world more closely.

The blogger also points out that the character apparently (I've only just now heard of the show, but thought the analysis was interesting if possibly wrong) does not act /consistently/ from episode to episode, but instead just seems to be pegged with the Villain Ball.

To be fair, so is Arrow -- almost all superheroes are, /especially/ in the "dark, gritty, realist" genre of superhero story. And this accusation is at least /leveled/ at almost everyone who proposes or carries out any large-scale plan of action, whether good or bad. To continue the article's themes of both contemporary sociopolitics and transhumanism, I've heard both Elizabeth Warren and our very own [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] accused of being psychotic egotists with a messiah complex.

No really. In fact, the general fact that these accusations can get leveled against even the most milquetoast do-gooders actually weakens them when thrown against EY or Ivo.

**** Ivo is obsessed with trying to save his wife to the point where he tortures and kills innocent people. He justifies his horrible actions by insisting he is the Messiah who will save the human race. It's all pretty straight forward. He doesn't actually care about saving humanity. That much is very clear in the show.

I do understand the criticism, but the way Ivo is built just doesn't come off as a criticism of transhumanism. It comes off as a criticism of the uberman, that people who use their will to power to sacrifice others to themselves are ultimately broken, powerless individuals. Ivo is driven by a similar obsession as Oliver, but the difference is his willingness to sacrifice others to his own alter. He is a criticism of Nietzsche.

Ok, but I think that raises another question: was there a valid literary reason to build the character that way, or is his transhumanism just a [[http://stormingtheivorytower.blogspot.co.il/2013/07/the-girls-who-walk-away-from-kyubee.html][pointlessly Satanic bargain]]?

He uses transhumanism as a lofty ideal for which people should aid him when in reality he most likely cares nothing for it.

** Frankly, the writing in the show is so bad that I can't imagine any individual or group could intentionally assert what this article criticizes.

Of course half of the things these characters and villains do, don't make sense. Because the writers themselves are only trying to connect horribly contrived plot points together, not pushing some sexist, centrist, anti-transhumanist agenda. At the most, some biases, traditionalist ideas, and fears might peek through the crappy writing once in a while, but nothing near the level that is claimed.

The article reaches way too far in trying to find hidden political agendas or meaning in simple bad writing.

Not to say that there aren't people who might think that way, and fear/loathe transhumanist ideas. But they certainly aren't writing Arrow that way, or at least not on purpose.

The anti-transhumanist sentiment is still there, and while generalizing from fictional evidence is a bad thing a lot of people do it. Even if it isn't intended, the anti-transhumanist (and sexist, etc.) theme is is still there and people are still watching and internalizing it.

It could be possible that the writers intended to portray something like how the article interprets things. Even if they didn't intend it, it still might be there as you say.

And it also might be possible JK Rowling intended to spread satanism through Harry Potter. And even if she didn't intend it, it still might be there.

But just because someone asserts an interpretation and a few others might see it as well, doesn't mean everyone else sees the same thing. To claim one interpretation is the only one others will see, is quite a stretch.
