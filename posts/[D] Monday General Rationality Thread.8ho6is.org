Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Where is everyone from? I've been wondering about the ethnic and geographic diversity of the people on this subreddit. Age bracket would be nice to know too.

Cheela are not immortal, kind of the opposite, they live about 15 minutes. Unless they do that very risky rejuvenation that requires starvation and excessive muscle tone...

And civil engineering is pretty lady-friendly as engineering goes, not like I'm doing electrical/electronic. And I'm studying to be a dietitian, and I have not seen a single man doing the undergrad feeder degree (I'm sure they exist, but the men in my classes are all studying sports science or something else "manly"). So dietetics is probably even more womanly than engineering is manly, since my undergrad engineering courses were 20-30% women.

I'm willing to bet that if we surveyed the fitness level of [[/r/rational]] and plotted it on a histogram, we'd have two distinct peaks:

1. Average pudgy academic/white-collar-worker
2. Bodybuilders

Group one for obvious reasons (we're jam-packed with white collar workers and academics), but group two's presence would be magnified (compared to the population as a whole) because, [[/r/rational]]'s primary userbase is males in their twenties (disproportionately likely to work out), and because we're more sensitive about health concerns as no doubt many of us hope to live to see immortality and/or the singularity (I certainly do). You can check [[/r/transhuman]] for corroboration; they're similarly concerned about health because they plan to be immortal.

*** That was an interesting read, but it is no longer relevant to me because I have regained the privilege of not feeling constant anxiety over the constant suffering that morals, cultural norms, and biases are causing.

I have decided that I am better off simply not participating in arguments with people, regardless of how important I consider the disagreement to be, and restrict myself to associating with people who share my morals. It makes me feel more secure and self confident.

Having the privilege to not think about all the evil things that hurt people who lack my social support, economic standing, and cultural inertia of being born white has made me much happier at the expense of others who lack my privileges.

I have reduced the amount of news I consume to the bare minimum that I require to stay informed because I have chosen not to be worried about whether fascists and narcissists will kill and abuse people who I don't know personally.

Edit: I may not have made it clear enough that I do not think that I am being morally virtuous by doing this, as I have decided the best thing I can do about evil in myself and the world is “don't think about it”.

***** I'm not sure what the right lesson was. I had thoroughly rationalized that everyone everywhere is suffering, I was allowing others to experience more suffering than I was just by living the way I do, and there was nothing I could do about it even if I wasn't afraid of risking what I do have.

I don't know how I can hate myself less without feeling less empathy towards others, so I've decided to just act like a person who does without constantly thinking about what other people are going through. It's easier on myself if I only think about my moral actions as performative.

That's not something I want other people to do, I feel like I should be ashamed for doing it at all, but I don't see any other way to not be so self righteous that I hate myself for all the sins I've committed besides accepting that I am selfish enough to hold onto my undeserved privileges.

****** I've thought about this problem.

My take on it is that humanity is progressing and things are getting better. This is backed by some evidence, but you have to accept this as a fact before moving to my next thought.

Most of human history has not had the global knowledge that we currently do. Only until very, very, very recently have people been able to be so aware of all of the other things that are happening around the world. It is also true (again backed some evidence, but you can take this as the second assumption I am making) that Good things (up to you to define "good") are reported less than Bad things (again, you make the definition).

My conclusion is that because things have had an upward trend. And because bad things are reported more than good things. My (and maybe your) perception is pretty skewed.

So, what do we do to move forward? Well, we have history to draw upon. It turns out that by being a force of good locally, which is the main thing that humans do, because global presence is a new thing, the world gets better.

Now, there is a hidden assumption in here as well. That is my assumption that history and movements and big revolutions of any kind are not predicated on singular human beings but society reaching critical points, and then eventually there is a single human being that we tend to push, to some extent, the narrative change upon.

So, I think that if I am, generally, on a local level, a Good person, who is helpful and productive and tries, suffering is reduced.

It is even better to do more, of course, but I don't think you are necessarily correct in your perception regarding all of the suffering you are viewing and what that means.

Hopefully, even if you do not agree, this helps in some small way. Feel free to challenge anything I said, as I am still learning my own way of trying to understand what my position actually means in the world and what compulsions I should try to meet because of that.

Also, I am 29, white, live in California, and I work as a freelance contractor in live broadcast.

******* That's how I felt before events like #MeToo revealed how many ways people are suffering today that I had never realized because of my privileged position as a white man (since then I came out as genderfluid). That means that more pain exists now and has always existed throughout history than I had ever imagined, specifically because of abuse and discrimination by people very much like me.

I believe that simply having been raised in that environment has lead to me thinking prejudiced thoughts that I don't know are prejudiced and that simply thinking them is inherently harmful to others, but they have been so deeply engrained by culture that I can't stop thinking them even when I notice them. It doesn't matter how much self loathing that causes me because that pain is nothing compared to what the victims have gone and are going through.

I have not been convinced that view is inaccurate and I am not especially interested in having it dispelled because it motivates me to be vigilant against evil within myself and in others. I do not think I can understand what disadvantaged people have gone through and that means I doubt I can truly feel empathy for them, so that leaves self hatred incurred by moral debt to motivate me.

That was clearly an unhealthy state of being that resulted in crippling depression and was probably related to anxiety from my financial situation. I was afraid of becoming impoverished and losing the privileges I had, but I still had it way better than so many others who live whole lives feeling this way so I should loathe myself for ever being so privileged to not know that. Now I have regained financial security and the anxiety and depression are gone.

I still believe all the same things I did before, but now I've stopped thinking about all the sins I have and am still committing just by living this way. I believe doing this is immoral, but I'm selfish enough to care more about my personal happiness than doing the most good. I was already failing to live up to my moral code, I just don't feel constant shame and self loathing anymore for failing. I think all that self inflicted pain is completely justified, but I stopped doing it and am okay with that.
