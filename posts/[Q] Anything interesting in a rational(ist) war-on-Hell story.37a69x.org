There's a story out on the web called [[http://www.tboverse.us/HPCAFORUM/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=29][The Salvation War]]. It's anti-rational and frankly terrible, but the idea is really interesting and I wondered if anyone might be interested in reading something similar?

The plot of TSW is that the Christian Hell is real and decides to declare war on reality. Reality fights back, and it's a complete curbstomp for the entire span of the story. There are some interesting explorations of "how do you deal with the fact that every time the enemy kills one of your soldiers they get that person's mind and soul for interrogation, and they can torture them for all eternity? (TSW's answer is "the souls fight back, escape, and start a guerilla movement in Hell.")

The version that I'm thinking of is that /all/ of the afterlives are real, and have been at war for millennia. Until now the war has stayed out of reality but it's finally spread to us. Reality will have to scramble to deal with the fact that gods and demons and asuras and etc are all real and are coming here to put the boot on us. Human weapons will be effective in some cases but not all, so humanity will have to scramble to come up with better guns, capture enemy weapons, and make allies...as well as putting aside our intra-human squabbles and banding together for survival.

To be clear: this would be a for-profit venture. Exact details TBD, but options would include:

- Kickstarter
- Per-chapter Patreon
- Monthly Patreon (which is what I have now)
- Something else? I'm open to suggestions

I'd write it in installments, give each one to my Patreon patrons and mailing list, then sell it on Amazon under exclusivity.

If you're interested, great! That will help me decide whether or not I should write it. If you'd also be willing to fund it, please mention that and to what extent.


** I ran a Mutants & Masterminds campaign with this as the central premise a few years back. The short pitch was;

#+begin_quote
  In 1953, a group of cultists opened a portal to Heaven on the top floor of the Empire State Building. The government seized control of the site afterward, and began the first heavenly expeditions. Heaven was empty; there were no angels to be seen. In 1965, while attempting to attain parity with American angelic technology, the Soviets opened a portal to hell and found it full.

I've always found the afterlife as a concept to be really interesting. I will say that I would much prefer an afterlife focused on a single religion, and given my familiarity with it, I would prefer that religion to be Christianity.

** This is interesting, but I'm worried about some of the corollaries here breaking the story world. Making all (or even most) religions have bits that are "real" in some aspects results in some tricky things emerging.

- Do you mean they are all fighting /each other/ as well as Earth?
- Are we fighting the "bad" sides of the world's religions, the bad and neutral, or all aspects? How would we stand a chance at all, if so, and if not how close are potential "allies" working with humanity?
- If not active participants in the war, where are the various heavens and positive/passive afterlives in all this? What about pantheons with neutral gods and other supernatural forces that have no afterlife components?
- What about shamanists?
- What about reincarnation?
- Is Earth simply a battleground or a target? Is attacking a side what determines if they pay attention at all to humanity? Are they actively recruiting living humans?
- Which afterlife would have the objectively worst forces and powers with which to attack Earth? The weakest? What determines which is how numerous and strong compared to the others?
- Which aferlives would automatically get the most souls from dead civilians? Soldiers? Which gets the least?
- Who gets which souls, the forces that make the kill or the victim's personal fath's?

  - If really bad things happen very often (i.e. going to hell) to people based on what they believe, why is anyone religious anymore (or at least that type)?
  - If there is a good chance at a "good" afterlife, why would anyone still be an atheist?
  - If some forces send you to a horrible hell by killing you, does that mean they are more horrible to fight?
  - What happens if a "good" afterlife combatant kills you? Do you go to a heaven...to be tortured for information?

- Other than possible intelligence on Earth resistance, what purpose do souls have?
- Which afterlife would have the strongest human resistance movements (i.e. the strongest souls, the most canon chances to escape, the weakest guards, etc.)?
- Can you tell if someone is going to a hell or a heaven before they die? Does that mean those who are less likely to go to a hell (righteous or "good" religious people) are moved into sensitive or command positions? Or are heavens a threat as well, and atheists are the only people who run no risk of hitting an afterlife because they simply disappear?

Obviously, some of these are going to be plot important spoilers. But it would help to know if there were some sort of plans to deal with them. You said a lot about what the other book was about, but not as much on how your story would handle what are some pretty politically sensitive and functionally challenging ideas.

*** Wow, great post, thank you.

Upfront I'll say that this whole post (the top level one) is basically market research to see if it's worth it for me to spend time planning the story. So, everything I'm about to say should be considered alpha-version and likely to change. As a result, I'm considering it not spoilers.

My initial thoughts would be:

- Do you mean they are all fighting each other as well as Earth?

More or less. Probably not a fully connected graph, but certainly many different fronts among different pantheons.

- Are we fighting the "bad" sides of the world's religions, the bad and neutral, or all aspects? How would we stand a chance at all, if so, and if not how close are potential "allies" working with humanity?

The trite answer would be "everyone we're fighting is the bad guys by definition," but no. We'd be fighting various factions from various religions. For example, there might be factions within Christian Hell that are willing to ally with us in order to gain an advantage over over hell-factions. Valhalla (viking heaven) would certainly be making war on someone.

- If not active participants in the war, where are the various heavens and positive/passive afterlives in all this? What about pantheons with neutral gods and other supernatural forces that have no afterlife components?

There would definitely be factions on our side and it seems likely that the majority of those factions would come from the positive side of things. On the other hand, many gods would just not want to be involved -- the Christian god being a prime example. He's stood back for several thousand years now, I don't see him wanting to break that streak. (Also, from a Doylist perspective, having an omnipotent being show up on either side makes the story pretty short.)

- What about shamanists?

I've had some interesting ideas about animisim; between them and the idea of totem animals I can think of a lot of cool places to go.

- What about reincarnation?

My current understanding of reincarnation is that you don't remember your prior lives, so you can't pass on intelligence or skills gained in a previous +time loop+ incarnation. The only difference from a warfighting perspective is that your soul is not available to the enemy for interrogation.

- Is Earth simply a battleground or a target? Is attacking a side what determines if they pay attention at all to humanity? Are they actively recruiting living humans?

I'm waffling on this one. I've had several backstory concepts including (a) the "gods need prayer" trope that I used in 2YE, and (b) there's an infinite collection of worlds and the ongoing war shifts from one to the next; it just happens to have finally gotten to Earth.

Some factions probably would reach out to humans, yes. Most likely the weaker factions who are desperate for allies.

- Which aferlives would automatically get the most souls from dead civilians? Soldiers? Which gets the least?
- Who gets which souls, the forces that make the kill or the victim's personal fath's?

I see it as personal faith determining where you go. Christian devils are going to want to focus on countries with a high Christian population, Hindu asuras will focus on India, etc. Under this model South America would take a pasting from Lucifer's armies, because there is a high percentage of Christianity and insufficiently large economies to have major militaries.

- If really bad things happen very often (i.e. going to hell) to people based on what they believe, why is anyone religious anymore (or at least that type)?

One of the first things that governments would start doing once they really understood what was going on would be to tell their citizens "okay, everyone needs to switch to [religion] because they are the ones who are supporting us!" Which would go down about as well as you'd expect.

- If there is a good chance at a "good" afterlife, why would anyone still be an atheist?

They wouldn't. I'm already imagining a scene where Richard Dawkins says "okay, fine, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mmskXXetcg][I was wrong]]"...and then goes on to choose a religion based on pragmatic grounds and munchkins his skepticism and rationality in order to extract the most benefit from his new god(s|dess(es)?)?

- Other than possible intelligence on Earth resistance, what purpose do souls have?

My first thought would be that they are either a powersource or can be interrogated and then transformed into soldiers in that faction's army.

- Which afterlife would have the strongest human resistance movements (i.e. the strongest souls, the most canon chances to escape, the weakest guards, etc.)?

I'll get back to you.

- Can you tell if someone is going to a hell or a heaven before they die?

More or less, yes. The process is basically "What religion are you? Okay, we had some experts go through and boil your holy books down into a checklist. Tick all the relevant boxes, we'll tally them up and tell you your current destination...ooh, not good. Okay, here's what you need to do to fix it...."

Of course, the first thing that would happen is that the Pope would start handing out plenary indulgences like candy, and probably speak /ex cathedra/ to say that any Catholic who dies on a day ending in a 'Y' receives an implicit indulgence at the moment of death. And then other religions would start doing the same.

- Does that mean those who are less likely to go to a hell (righteous or "good" religious people) are moved into sensitive or command positions? Or are heavens a threat as well, and atheists are the only people who run no risk of hitting an afterlife because they simply disappear?

Some heavens would definitely be a risk. Valhalla, for one, repurposes the souls of everyone who goes there as soldiers in its army.

A Richard Dawkins analog doing that would be worth the price of admission alone. I'm thinking some Australian aboriginal Dreamtime (which seems to come with almost limitless power and knowledge) would be a good pick.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtime]]

#+begin_quote
  ...in "Dreamtime" an individual's entire ancestry exists as one, culminating in the idea that all worldly knowledge is accumulated through one's ancestors.

Ehh? Yeah? All worldly knowledge?

I thought so.

Get your still living siblings and children to get high as fuck to meditate and broadcast back the skinny once you cross over. And it doesn't say anything about /your ancestors/ having to have been part of your chosen religion, either. You can just get that knowledge, because that's how reality works for you now.

Actually, there's an idea I've sort of been toying with: In Judaism, the story for why "Israel" is called that due to the whole bit with Yaakov fighting the angel. The word literally translates to something like "he who overcame god"

What if we take that story and run with it... the torah was a corruption, hiding the truth that at some point someone managed to figure out a way to fight back, to protect humanity from divine evil. And that the method needs to be reconstructed/rediscovered.

Seems like some story along those lines, or a story that incorporated that would be fun. I mean, I've never heard of any stories that actually ran with that idea, but it seems like the sort of thing that in some form would be an obvious idea to play with.

If you want there to be a story at all, then you need to change YHWH. Give him alien values. Say Lucifer's rebellion suceeded and he's a shadow of his former self and can't solve all problems forever. Say he's not omniscient but in fact retarded and doesn't /know/ how to wipe your plot from existence.

Anything!

But YHWH with canon powers in a universe that makes internal sense breaks the story completely.

I actually kinda can. If we assume that he exists, then ignoring human problems is Yahweh's actual real behavior. Obviously there's a reason for it, but that doesn't mean that humans know what that reason is, or would agree with it if they did. The Watsonian conversation basically goes:

** I've been rereading Dante's Divine Comedy recently, and I found myself wishing there was something like what you are describing using his hell. It's got everything from little humanoid demons who torture people to giants and monsters of every kind. And various... /unlikely/ climates and terrains that should be very munchkinable. The inhabitants include some definitely-not-real people too, like Mordred and Helen of Troy. If you want to use lots of afterlife worlds then there might have to be some changes (Heresy wouldn't be quite so popular, I imagine, nor would the Noble Pagans sit around in Hell-lite when they had their own paradises to go to). So the short answer is yes, I would love it if someone wrote a rational take on Afterlifes-are-real, and I highly recommend giving Dante a go to see if you want to use anything from his Inferno (Purgatory would also make an interesting place to invade...). Or Milton's Paradise Lost if you want Lucifer to be in charge, though Milton's hell isn't really fleshed out beyond "And then the fallen angels made El Dorado but with lots of added brimstone".

It's true. And yes, "all the things!" might be a bad plan here. Just doing Christianity justice would be challenging enough.

I suppose one approach would be "yes, they're all real, but most of them are fighting on other levels and haven't made it to Earth yet.

I've always had a soft spot for the Norse gods; I find them more interesting as characters than the Greek/Roman ones, and much less bogus than Christianity. This could be the whole Ragnarok / Judgement Day / whatever other cataclysmic end-of-the-world thing other religions have mixed together.

One thing that would definitely be interesting would be the distinction between Christianity and Judaism. The Jews seem to see Yahweh as someone who can be bargained with (cf destruction of Sodom) and feel that rules lawyering is okay (cf shabbos goy and the [[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/496883/jewish/Is-it-really-necessary-to-have-leaven-removed-from-ones-property.htm][sale of chametz]] for Passover.

** I recommend reading [[http://www.amazon.com/bang-apocalypse-Mason-Tailsteak-Williams/dp/1453806466][/Bang/]] by Tailsteak, the guy who creates the webcomic [[http://leftoversoup.com/][/Leftover Soup/]] (so you know he's good). It's a very good look at what things would be like if Christianity is right and the implications of everything it entails. It's pretty good at showing how the people in the Christian hell would act even if the story is not totally rationalist. Trevor is definitely a Level 1 character though.

** This pretty much is how it works in Neil gaiman's Sandman.

No one is fighting per say though.

But a lot of munchkining is going on.

Also some interesting psychology.

I recommend reading that graphic novel if your wanting to go into the business of multi-pantheon clash shenanigans.

Neil Gaiman is the present master author of that style of story telling.

**** Sorry not militarily, Also ther spin-off series that follows some of Dream's other siblings gets a bit more into how the whole 'multi-world' works. For hell stuff I'd recommend the Lucifer spin-off because it gets into that a bit. but because of the protagonist of that series the whole thing ends up a bit less "all myths are true" then Gaiman writes and more "christian mythology has the most epic super hero myth man and thus can pwn all other myths" that series is still a fun read though.

For military heaven vs hell stuff I heartily recommend the kaiju angels from this [[http://turbofanatic.deviantart.com/art/Raquiel-188484506][picture]]

** I remember being really disappointed that /The Salvation War/ wasn't, y'know, good. It's a cool premise.

I'd join the call to use Christian myths only, and go with something preexisting and reasonably well-defined - Dante is good, as are Medieval-European ideas of witchcraft/vampirism, modern superstition/conspiracy theories (satanic D&D, all that), classic Bible-period Jewish myths ... there's a lot to choose from, actually, so I'd go with whatever you think you could do something really cool with.

*** If it were a major focus I could crank a short chapter (~5k words) every couple of days. Right now I'm actually finishing up a 5k story that I started late evening yesterday. I've been pretty unproductive today or it would be done already.

Alternatively, it could be a longer chapter once a week -- say, 8-10k words.

Not to be crass, but "major focus" is very closely related to "profitable", so it would need to be funded somehow. Personally, the way I would love to do it is to take feedback from the audience, shape the story around that feedback, get paid for it, and then Creative Commons it. It would surprise me if that were feasible though; if I were cranking chapters that fast it would be pretty much my full time job.

For reference, chapter 10 of Team Anko was 3600 words and chapter 1 was 9200. The average page of a paperback novel has something like 300 words on it. (Very rough estimate, varies a lot.)

Out of curiosity, if someone wanted to straight-out commission you to write, say, a 5k word story on a particular topic, around how much would they have to offer for you to at least consider it?

***** It would depend on a few things, including disposition of rights. If I'm writing it for a one-time payment on condition that it be CC'd afterwards then I'd want a little more than if I could write it, give it to backers, and then sell it on Amazon.

That said, probably something like $500 - $600. Is there something you're interested in? I have no problem putting together little mini-Kickstarters if there's an initial seed of commitment.

I'm afraid that's a tad out of my price range. (And, possibly, I've just been hit by the logical fallacy involving pegging prices to the first ones seen, as most furry authours I'm acquainted with tend to under-charge for their work.)

That's certainly an option worth investigating. As I suspect you already know, one of the hard parts would be to find the sweet spot that draws in enough readers/funders to make it worth your while, and picking a topic narrow enough to be worth your readers' while - something they couldn't get by picking up the latest extruded fantasy product from their local giftshop-that-still-also-sells-books. I'm afraid that my writing chops aren't nearly strong enough to offer any good advice on that score.

This might or might not apply to the stories you're talking about but, if this is furry smut, then they probably /can/ afford to charge less. Smut is ridiculously easy to crank out; it requires very little foreshadowing and much less plot, dialogue, and characterization than non-erotica, so it can be written quickly and therefore needs less . It also pays relatively well. And yes, that's not a guess.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but the average length for an adult fiction novel is between 80,000 and 120,000 words, somewhat depending on genre, with 100,000 words being considered the "cap" for first-time authors (beyond which publishers are really unlikely to look at your work).

** Here's a quick summary of what I've seen, to help gauge what's taboo:

- Fun stories involving multiple pantheons, such as Greek and Norse, occasionally Chinese and Japanese. Many of these /avoid/ including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.

- Hollywood-style, focusing on Christianity-inspired Hell, taking artistic liberties

- Parody, such as South Park

As I see it, you have 3 general takes:

- the Just For Fun take: set the tone of the story from the outset as "this is an adventurous, fun, action thriller, with some humor and fun references to mythology" - this can allow you hollywood-like license to manipulate things to make a fun story. Requires less research, but you can't make moral judgements on any existing religions.

- "I have a moral point to deliver" (as was the case in Two Year Emperor): if it's at all controversial, you better well do your research. If people notice flaws in a criticism, it'll undermine the message, and make it much less fun to read.

- "I'm going to get hate mail anyway": anything goes. Personally, I probably wouldn't read this version, but I'm sure you'd still find a reader base.

There are a couple of stories like that have fun mixing up pantheons, though mostly focused on conflicting pantheons, not specifically the afterlives. For recs: American Gods is well known, the Iron Druid chronicles is basically Harry Dresden if Harry was an ancient druid coming to blows with celtic gods. (It's better than early dresden files books, not as good as the later ones). The graphic novel series "Pantheon High" involves at one point a bunch of demigods trekking through various afterlives, trying to get to Hades - the story's blah, but has quite a lot fun with the mythology: Hades' son's ability is to inflict Poetic Justice upon people.

*** I would definitely go the Just For Fun route -- I have no interest in writing an author tract about why religion (singular or plural) is bad, I just want to write a fun story. As to the research, most likely I would choose to go the "well, the legends are basically right, but some things got lost in translation so not every detail of the religion as we know it is correct." Which is a great handwave for any details I get wrong or choose to change. A bit of a cheat, but a forgivable one.
