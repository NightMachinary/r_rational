** I posted [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/30ygc2/ginny_weasley_and_the_sealed_intelligence_chapter/cpwzrg4?context=3][a comment]] on the HPMOR subreddit regarding how absurd the 'possession contract' is, and posted a far better version. Which I had up there for about 3/4 of an hour before noticing a fatal flaw. [[/r/rational]], give me a hand in making as watertight a contract as possible?

#+begin_quote
  'I hereby state that direct physical contact with the object I am writing on is consent to possession lasting no longer than 5 minutes by the spirit currently inhabiting that object, and then must give written consent once more for the spirit to possess me again.'

*** Magical contract might be hard-coded such that no other contract will work.

But yes, I'm pretty sure this means that V can totally possess G whenever she touches the diary forever after now, and that this was an intentional subterfuge on his part.

Ginny had no reason to believe he wouldn't possess her forever. She wrote in the diary that he could possess her indefinitely so long as she touched the object, with only his English promise that he wouldn't use his control over her body to make her keep touching the diary forever.

*** Since the spirit controls you...

"I now consent to being possessed forever, in writing, as per the contract."

**** Hm. I'd feel that violates the contract, as it's not you consenting, but the spirit.

If the spirit doesn't actually need /you/ to consent, then the whole contract is moot anyway. Therefore, I was working on the assumption that the consent had to be given by yourself, and that the spirit can't give it for you...

***** It is you. You and your hand are consenting. If you meant otherwise you should have specified such in the contract as to who you were, assuming that the contract the spirit agreed to was binding- it may be that any conditions the spirit agrees to aren't binding, once they possess you then you are theirs forever.

The spirit may need you to consent initially, but not after.

** You'll note that Diarymort never explicitly denies being Voldie in parseltongue. He says he is now a Diary, which is true, and that he's not some guy living in America, which is also true. He says Voldie isn't his master now, which is also true, since Voldie threw him away, and is probably also his biggest threat if he wants to take over the world.

He may not plan to harm Ginny, but that doesn't mean he doesn't plan on changing her values or molding her into the shape he deems fit. His plans may also change; Quirrelmort never initially planned to kill Harry, but instead wanted an equal to compete with. That didn't stop him from later wanting to kill Harry.

Perhaps Diarymort, in addition to resurrection, is also looking for an equal, and Ginny, a 3rd seventh son, might be prophesied to be that equal.

E: Really liking Colin's brash, aggressive intelligence and intuition as well. He's the sort of muggleborn who's very dangerous, like Harry Potter but even less cautious, perhaps with less rationality and more intelligence in other ways.

*** Agree. Riddle is /amoral/, not actively malicious. That's what tricked many people into thinking Q wasn't V in hpmor. Riddle will happily be the good guy as long as it's in his interest to do so. It's easy for Riddle to promise nice things and pledge true allegiance to Ginny and mean it.

And yeah, Colin is spilling dangerous ideas left and right.
