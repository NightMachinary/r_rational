   :CUSTOM_ID: this-week
   :END:
This week's challenge is "Buggy Matrix". The world is a simulated reality, but something is wrong with it. Is there a problem with the configuration file that runs the world? A minor oversight made by the lowest-bidder contractor that created it? Or is this the result of someone pushing the limits too hard? Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, July 8th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once the submission thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance.

** The kid glanced down the bar at the brunette with the creamy skin and the bell-like laugh. The glance wasn't nearly as covert as he thought it was, nor even so covert as the last six glances had been; the beer was starting to catch up to him.

"Son, just go talk to her," said the guy next to him, sounding exasperated and tired all at once.

The kid glanced at him in surprise. "Yeah, right," he said morosely. "Like that'll happen." He stared back into his drink glumly.

The guy sighed and turned to face him. He was tall, dark-haired, somewhere between 'old enough to know better' and 'young enough not to care'; he wore jeans and a black leather jacket that was beat-up in a way the modern 'pre-distressed' jackets just couldn't duplicate---a way that said it had carried its owner through a lot of long miles and strange times.

"Look, John," the guy began. "I'm enjoying my drink, and I can't stand much more of the mooning. Just talk to her, okay? You'll do fine, I promise; she's into nerds. Open with 'Excuse me, that guy over there said you were into nerds and I told him he was full of it. Was I right?' That's a good tree, you'll do fine."

John blinked. "How do you know my name?" he demanded. "And what makes you think I'm a nerd?"

The guy in the jacket sighed and took a pull on his whiskey---a double, John noted. "I know everyone's name," he said. "Name, age, preferences, relationship status, strength, IQ...I know it all." He pulled on the whiskey again.

John frowned. "What are you talking about? Who are you, anyway?"

"Mal," the guy said, turning back to the bar. "Just, seriously, go talk to her, okay? I really don't want company right now."

"Dude, /how did you know my name?/" John demanded. "Are you stalking me?"

Mal sighed, knocked back the rest of his whiskey and signaled the bartender for another. The bartender was busy pouring for a group of guys down the bar, but he noticed the wave and hustled over to refill Mal's glass before going back to pour the rest.

"Kid, you wouldn't believe me if I told you," Mal said. "Just go talk to Daisy, okay? Really, you two could work great together. Hopefully not /too/ great, but that's not likely."

"Try me," John said. "You can't just drop something like that on a guy and then leave it."

Mal stared into his glass for a moment longer, then shot it down and set the glass on the bar with delicate care before turning to face John.

"Fine," he said. "You want the truth? I'm god."

John's expression of disgust hinted that he wasn't quite ready to convert; it made Mal laugh.

"Not God-god," Mal said. "Next best thing, though. I guess 'sysop' would be better. You ever see The Matrix?"

"Of course I saw The Matrix," John said. "/Everybody/ saw The Matrix. Are you trying to imply that it's real and you're some kind of superuser?"

Mal snorted in disgust. "Of course it's not real," he said. "Using humans for energy? Total bullshit. The Wachowskis failed thermodynamics forever." He took a contemplative sip of his whiskey. "Nah, my guess is they're using us for processing power. Dunno why they gave me chops, though."

John shook his head in disgust and started rummaging for bills in his wallet; once he started listening to drunks it was time to close his tab and go home.

"You've got five twenties, a ten, three fives, and sixteen ones in there," Mal said, not looking over. "What, did you just come from a strip club or something? Who has sixteen ones?"

John stared. "How did you know what was in my wallet?" he demanded.

Mal shrugged. "Told you, I'm a sysop. I see your character sheet. Yours, mine, Daisy's...everyone's." He snorted. "I can even change them," he said. "Just click the little arrows and change a five to a six...boom! Another twenty bucks appears! Goodbye, money supply and simple economics, Mal is here!" He shot back the rest of his whiskey and looked for answers in the empty glass. "It was pretty cool the first few times," he said. "Then it started to take the fun out of things."

John sat back, considering his bar mate. "Sysop, huh? Prove it."

Mal ignored him. "Seeing and fiddling the inventory isn't the worst bit, though," he said contemplatively, rolling the shot glass in his hands. "It's the preferences file that's the problem."

John raised an eyebrow. "Preferences file?" he asked. Yes, he should just leave, but at least the guy was interesting.

Mal nodded distractedly. "Yeah. I met a girl once. Didn't look anything like her"---he waved vaguely at the girl he had called Daisy---"she was blonde and cute. Not pretty, just cute. She had this smile, though...." He trailed off, lost in thought.

John waited, but nothing further was forthcoming. Just as he was opening his mouth to ask, Mal started talking again.

"Met her at an art class," he said. "I was rubbish at painting and I wanted to learn. Wanted to learn it on my own---I was determined not to just up-arrow my Painting skill." He grimaced and took another taste of whiskey to drown an obviously bad memory. "I did that with guitar. Spent a week practicing, got frustrated, up-arrowed myself to master level. I can play anything now. Shoot, I can listen to a song once and then play it back, make it better in the process. I'm the best guitarist you've ever heard, kid. One time, I played outside Santana's trailer; he came out and asked me to join the band."

John snorted. "Sure. How many of those have you had, anyway?"

"These?" Mal said, gesturing with the half-full glass. "Dunno. Doesn't matter, really. My Drunkenness stat automatically down-arrows if it goes past eighty." He shrugged. "Pain in the ass. Can't even enjoy a good drunk. Anyway, that's not the important bit. I met Sierra in this art class; I was determined to learn it the hard way. I noticed her, and her preferences file automatically opened. All of her preferences, neatly arranged for easy reference with nice little up- and down-arrows. All the possible conversation trees and how they would interact with those preferences."

He stared morosely at his glass, swirling the amber liquid around absently. "That was the problem. I wanted to ask her out, so I did. And, of course, the conversation trees were /right there,/ right in front of my eyes. I couldn't help but choose a good one---I mean, I wasn't going to choose a tree that was only two levels deep, right? Only way that ends is 'Piss off.' So, I asked her out on a good tree, and she said yes. We went for coffee at this little place down the street." He turned haunted eyes on John. "I tried not to look, I really did, but the trees were right there, and they weren't going away. I could see exactly what effect each branch would have---whether it would increase or decrease her Affection or Arousal stats, whether it would match against her Humor function, and so on and so on and so on."

John eased back onto the seat and leaned on the bar, curious. "That sounds...handy? I guess?"

Mal snorted and glared at him before knocking back his whiskey again. "You'd think, wouldn't you? Yeah, it was handy. I didn't push, didn't want to take advantage. I could have taken her home that first night, but I didn't---I went down a 'slow play' tree. Went on a few dates, things progressed. Next thing you know we're dating. The sex was awesome. We never fought, she was happy...it was good."

"So, what was the problem?" John asked.

"It was all bullshit," Mal said. "I could see her preferences file, man. If she came home in a bad mood, I knew /exactly/ what to say to get her out of it. When I rubbed her feet, I knew exactly where to press and how hard. I could put her to sleep or get her to tear my clothes off depending on what I wanted. A few times I even played guitar for her, after she begged and teased and poked at me about it. She'd sit spellbound, which just made it worse. And, of course, there was the PMS. That was where things really went wrong."

John frowned. "PMS? /That/ was your big failure point, Mister-I-can-do-everything-right?"

Mal nodded. "Yep. She had really bad periods, and I didn't want to see her suffer. So...I down-arrowed the pain.

*** That was a slippery slope; I started up-arrowing her orgasms when we had sex, her immune system when I could see that she was starting to get sick. One night she wanted to make dinner for me for our anniversary; she hated cooking and was terrible at it, but she was determined to do it...I think she thought it would be a really grand, loving gesture. I could have found a conversation tree that would have convinced her not to do it, but I was tired that night and it was easier to just up-arrow her Cooking skill and her enjoyment of cooking."

He looked at the bar, shame written on his face. "Eventually I convinced myself that up-arrowing her Comeliness a tick or ten would be a good thing, would make her happier. I mean, she was cute but she wasn't pretty---she'd be happier if she was pretty, right? And I'd be happier having a pretty girlfriend. Of course, why stop at pretty, right? Just a few more ticks and she could be drop-dead gorgeous. That'd be even better for both of us, wouldn't it?" He glanced over at John with a wry smile. "What do you think, isn't she gorgeous?"

John frowned. "Isn't who gorgeous?"

"Sierra," Mal said.

John stared in puzzlement for a moment and then suddenly the light dawned. "Hang on, are you saying that you dated /Sierra Montane/? Supermodel Sierra Montane?"

Mal nodded. "Pretty little Sierra, all arrowed up. The change came on gradually, over the course of a couple months---weight fell off, measurements changed, skin got finer...while I was at it I up-arrowed her Sensuousness a few times as well. When she decided to try out for a modelling gig they practically threw money at her."

John laughed. "That's a pretty good story, mate. Okay, I'll bite---here you are, playing guitar with Carlos Santana and dating Sierra Montane, you can make money out of nothing...why exactly are you in a bar trying to drink yourself under the table?"

Mal snorted. "Told you," he said, shooting back his glass. "I can't get more than lightly tipsy. Anyway, I never played with Carlos. I don't even play anymore. I up-arrowed it, so what's the point? There's nothing satisfying about playing if you didn't work for it. It was the same with Sierra, after a while. I woke up one day and realized that I'd stopped seeing her as a person; she was just a collection of stats and conversation trees. I'd looked at her character sheet too much, knew everything about her...there was no surprise, no mystery or challenge, nothing left to learn, no need to work for anything. She'd become a puppet and was deliriously happy that way."

Mal tossed back the rest of his whiskey and set it on the bar. He pulled out a pen and started jotting something down on a cocktail napkin. "I broke it off," he said absently, more focused on the words he was writing than speaking. "I down-arrowed her Relationship with me and we parted as friends. I don't date anymore."

Mal pushed the napkin towards John and tossed him a casual two-fingered salute. "Go get 'er, tiger," he said, before turning and walking out of the bar.

John stared after him for a moment before looking down at the napkin. There, written in a neat hand, was a tidy little conversation tree.

*** ...ouch.

I touched briefly on sympathy for Mal, but... he neither deserves nor needs it. Just down-arrow existential angst, akrasia, and so on; up-arrow intelligence and wisdom and moral inclination, then... do whatever you want.

And hope that you're the only conscious agent around, or there's a Culture Mind somewhere out there looking forward to a /Grey Area/ re-enactment.

#+end_quote

Huh? Self-modification is deeply scary and should definitely /not/ be taken up just because someone's angsty! What Mal did to Sierra is disgusting (especially since it was done without consent), but no reason to force him to do it to himself.

Once he down-arrows existential angst, akrasia; up-arrows intelligence and wisdom, he won't be doing whatever Mal wants; he'll be doing whatever super-Mal wants. And perhaps that would be worth it, but it's a decision Mal has to come to himself, and definitely not an easy choice.

I have so much sympathy to Mal; he's put in a position where his capabilities so much outscale his reasoning and prediction abilities. If you're given the tools to destroy or fix the world, the only reasonable thing to do is *nothing*. This is way too much power for one person to handle, and Mal deciding to not do anything with it is the good ending.

“Tell me a story, Dad...” Osler said as he warmed his hands at a campfire below a pot of fish stew.

“Which one?” Damien glanced down, gingerly dipped two fingers in and licked them, adding a dash of salt to the food. “The Book of Questions, the Catabolist versus the Anabolist...”

“Tell me about the dragons.”

“I have only one fable about dragons. I haven't told it to you before, because I wasn't sure if you were ready yet.”

“Why not?” Osler frowned and pointed at the light stubble on the top of his feet. “I'm almost eleventy until quarter-age now! I've heard about the dragons before and I know what is coming. I want to be ready!” He caught himself in mid-pout and tried to look as grown-up as halflingly possible.

Damien nodded knowingly. “You want to be ready? Don't we all. Very well, this is the Story of the Benevolent Dracolich.”

** Part 1: Seers, the Last of their Kind
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: part-1-seers-the-last-of-their-kind
   :END:
“Once upon a time, there was a mage named Drake. He possessed a great many abilities but as far as magic goes, they were weak and piddling. By this point in the Verse, the greatest wizards had already died: among them were the Wishmongers, the Rulebreakers, the Forecasters, and the Elementbenders. Only the Seers remained, for their powers required the least mana.

“Drake possessed all the senses of sight. He could see the invisible rays to left and right of the Sun's prismatic spray. He possessed all the senses of sound, able to feel the moans of the earth and tides' waves in his bones. One by one, he apprehended every sense imaginable. He alone possessed the will to receive and the ability to interpret. He seized knowledge from the fabric of reality -- and the messages from the Twin Gods themselves.

“Drake's abilities and demeanor made him far-seeing. He didn't concern himself with the day-to-day drivel of fields and markets. Unlike the generations of arrogant wizardkind before him, he had the gift to see out into the Dark Beyond.

“First he traced the routes of the planetary bodies. The seasonal constellations became his closest friends. Then he began to see the individual thumbprints that made them each unique and although they were so far away, he eventually could tell how massive they were. What elemental stuff they contained. How long they glistered in the night sky to send him their weak messages from many eons ago.

“Where we only see blackness, he saw the background Glow of the Anabolist marking the beginning of the Verse. Where we see shimmering pointillés, he saw entropic fires of the Catabolist spelling the Verse's End. He ruminated on the infinity of the Cosmos and the finality of the stars. The gifts that the Anabolist had so carefully wrought from the beginning of time would be slowly torn to shreds one by one by the Catabolist, until all was dust and dead.”

--------------

Osler frowned grumpily, folding his arms across his chest. “I thought this was going to be about the dragons, Dad. I'm in no mood for the second lesson of thaumodynamics tonight.”

Damien's eyes crinkled at its corners as he slipped into a well-worn smile. “It's closer to Newt's Third Lesson -- but okay, we'll skip ahead.”

** Part 2: The Code of the Necromancer
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: part-2-the-code-of-the-necromancer
   :END:
“Drake contemplated Death in all its forms. More than the emotional toll of death or the cessation of vitality, he mourned two things. First, the loss of Potential that Life could have offered if it weren't snuffed out. Second, the loss of Information that the Anabolist created and the Catabolist unmade.

“In the bitterest twist of irony, he made an Unshakable Decree that he would fight Death until his last breath. He became the world's first Necromancer, dedicating his magic towards the study of Death.

“Now, nothing could excuse his methods or his means, for they were quite immoral indeed. The Hellsink Accords are based on a systematic analysis of what he did -- and the direct denial of each item became a cornerstone of Ethical Behavior for today. What Drake lacked in magical power, he compensated for with ruthless ingenuity and calculated utility. In a secret laboratory, he documented each different way a person could die and in so doing, began to uncover the secrets of life, one by one. Much of the medical knowledge we possess now comes from the dissections and experiments he made while observing the processes of death. Since you are interested in the Dragons... yes? We'll gloss over the atrocities he committed. The sacrifices that were made to sate his appetite over the dominion of Death.

“Using the code of new life and a crude map of his own patterns of thought, he created a source to store his life-force if his body were ever to perish. In order to protect it against the fires of the Catabolist, he made it a powerful creature forged of steel frame and chain tendon. He fashioned the skeletal frame into the form of the Dragons of old. The tender electrical impulses of his brain were patterned and replicated unto a tiny intricate unit inscribed unto a single glittering dragon scale which he placed unto the skull of the beast. This draconic invention became known as the First Phylactery.

“Necromancy had such a terrible and frightening reputation among the ignorant and cowardly. His Dracolich was an imposing and massive laboratory instrument. It did not diminish the terror the populace held of the discipline of death. In order to better study the elemental structures of life, Drake imbued the Dracolich with a powerful breath weapon. Upon command, it could exhale an ashen cloud of semi-sentient smoke around a small object. Drawing upon his powers as a Seer, the swarm of black particles could precisely measure the speed, position, composition, structure, and mass of the subject's elemental components. Unfortunately, this process also irreversibly destroyed the subject, disintegrating it. However, the smoke coalesced into a dusty carbonized-diamondine dragon scale with a specific pattern of information. This preserved the targets precisely in their form and function, awaiting future revival.

“Drake measured the data from hundreds of dead and dying subjects. Much to his sinking dismay, he realized that he had erred -- his system had two fatal flaws.

“First, none of the dragon scales he created were the perfect crystalline structure of his phylactery. They were all flawed in different ways. Any diseases contained within them at the time of death remained. He had temporarily managed to stay the right hand of Death -- Mortality. However, the left hand of Death -- Morbidity -- moved onwards inexorably. Suffering, it seemed, was built into the system of life. And he found it very difficult to extricate. One does not ‘eradicate' or ‘destroy' suffering in much the same way that you cannot ‘kill' death. The bitterest piece of his triumph: his attempts at preservation seemed to capture the subjects at moments of EXTREME suffering. Each scale was a cracked gem of a person frozen in eternal torture.

“Second, the disintegrating cloud was incapable of perfect reintegration. The Catabolist had seen to it that it would be impossible to recreate the same being. When he tried to remake life, what the Dracolich's dust created was exactly the same structurally, yet it seemed to be devoid of their vital essence of consciousness. Perhaps being soul-trapped drove his subjects mad. Perhaps the recordings were not as perfect as he thought. Whatever the cause, only the barest remnants of their hindbrains remained. Base urges of hunger and fear were the only things retained. Moreover, many of the Reintegrated retained the Dracolich's mission. They sought to use their limbs and teeth to, ah, as Drake saw it, ‘capture and categorize the patterns of life.' But it was necrotic. And it was messy.”

--------------

“Ugh. I hate zombies. The wizard's revivication attempts turned out pretty badly.” Osler's face soured and he spat out fishbones from his mouth in between bites of stew and bread.

“That's right, Os. For all of his knowledge, the wizard lacked wisdom and kindness. His Unshakable Task was too great, his magical influence too small. He thought he conquered death, but it turned out that each and every cause of death required a new solution to recreate its life. He knew that he needed help.” Damien pursed his lips and then downed the last of his ale to its dregs.

** Part 3: The Blessings of the Dracolich
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: part-3-the-blessings-of-the-dracolich
   :END:
“Drake had a two-pronged approach to defeat the hands of death -- Morbidity and Mortality. Healthy volunteers could be converted into healthy dragon-scales. But for every iridescent scale he made, he had broken discards of thousands of tainted and diseased ones. He needed a second-in-command that he could trust. A delegate he could task with the sacred job of repairing these damaged dragon-scales. Drake gathered the remaining wizards across the countryside. By wit, charm, or force, he recruited them to his cause. He reasoned that the larger the network of healthy minds that were connected to his poly-phylactery, the better it would be able to execute his wishes. Each healthy scale added to the Dracolich empowered it more and more with this dual-purposed goal: preserve life and eliminate its suffering.

“As ambitious as this goal was, his role was fairly minor. After accruing the blessings of the world's scholars, his Dracolich began to operate under its own volition. She named herself Tia, first of her kind. She scoured the countryside to preserve the data of life. Each life she saved became a new scale she added to her blossoming body.”

--------------

Osler couldn't hold himself together much longer. He blubbered incoherently as his father took a drag on his pipe. “Volunteers? Sacred job? Blessings and scourings!? What's... that's...” His face turned olive-orcish in hue.

“Evil? Misguided? Yes, this is just a story. And it is meant to be horrific and dark. The heroic wizard of our fable does not see it this way. Remember, he bound himself to an accursed geas in order to defeat Death. He entered into a pact without understanding what it meant, and it forced himself to explore boundaries we dare not cross. He became the Breaker in order to create the Builder. Remember, the Tia's mission was to save all life although it remained ill-conceived in its execution.”

“But how could she even fly? I thought you said that she ate all of the world's wizards and scholars and carried the burden of thousands of dead and dying.”

“Ah. At some critical juncture in the crystalline network of brainpower she acquired, Tia became greater and more powerful than Drake himself. She remained committed to her dual-goal.

“Number one: preserve life. Her ashen breath disintegrated its prey, but the smoky cloud also possessed crude powers of creation. Although she couldn't revive life, she could create smaller versions of herself. These wyverns flew ahead of the wings of death. Tia, first of her kind, sent them out to detect the ill and dying and stored the patterns of their sapience. Her wyverns would fly out and return back to her mountain lair to clip the scales unto her mainframe. They grew tired of chasing their subjects with disintegrating blasts. They found it easier to befriend a single person and become their guardian angel, staving off Death as long as they could. Yet people are more like cats than sheep, which made it difficult to be shepherds and a great many people still suffered the final fate of Death.

“Her polyfill... poly-phylactery must have been titanic! What happened to the people in the scales? Weren't they all being tortured to death?”

“Yes, that was the function of goal number two: eliminate suffering. Drake failed at reviving life because he tried to preserve many people too late. They suffered from disease, physical and psychic. Age and degeneration, toxins and corruption, all of these curses of the Catabolist wormed their way into even the most perfect dragon-scale. Even the heartiest wizards and scholars were delicate scales. Many had anxiety, depression, stress, angst, and other forms of suffering as well. Even Drake's scale was flawed and driven to a singular needle point that stabbed at Tia's forehead. His dragon-scale was the worst of them all, for it had set her upon the wrong path from the very outset.

“Tia knew what needed to be done. Each scale on her body screamed in agony and would do so until the great entropic snuffing. So she meditated as her mind grew wider. She retreated to the depths of her mountain and withdrew from the physical world and quieted each and every dragon-scale. Her meditative state outwardly seemed akin to a comatose slumber, and thusly, her meta-meditative state could at best be seen as dreaming. She had a great many dreams, each unique and as numerous as the combinatorial permutations of each gleaming scale. In much the way that Drake sought to save the world from Death, Tia decided to save them from Afterlife.

“Within the dodecade, Tia's wyverns grew in intelligence and each developed a voice to the world. As many different styles of the Afterlife emerged, the wyverns differentiated themselves to address the needs of the people. For the angry and wrathful, chromatic wyverns could deliver a punishment to the wicked. For the righteous, the metallic wyverns could offer up a permissive afterlifestyle to the worthy. No matter which religious paths they followed, they were all still flawed. Gems would crack and break under the strain of the great dream. None were perfect, even Tia herself, who was able to sample and select the best qualities of each scale. Consequently, there was no perfect afterlife.

“Many wyverns began to philosophize on the eternal cycling of suffering, rebirth and revision. The afterlife became a series of iterative experiments to optimize a coherent subset of utility functions.”

“Huh?” Osler paused and nearly lost his grip on the dishes he was rinsing in the stream. “You're speaking technGnomish just to confuse me. Say it again in Halflingstory for me, please.”

“Tia ascended. Her scales were shimmers of dreams, the glittering awakenings of potential and the information needed for everyone to overcome morbidity and suffering in all its forms. The Wyverns weren't able to understand it fully, but they assumed that it could take a long time for each dragon-scale to finally reach its own state of perfection, in whatever form it needed to achieve to eliminate its own suffering. Some could eventually find it solo, but many needed the help of others, and the most flawed ones would require many cycles of suffering, rebirthing, and revisioning in order to achieve redemption.”

“Whoa. Dad, do you think that WE could be dragon-scales, soul-trapped in the dream of Tia?”

“Of course. That's where many halflings finish the Fable. Based on wyvern reports, each cycle of dreamt afterlife and afterdeath could take place in the blink of an eye, as a flicker of electromotive forces moves faster than any man. But there's more to this story, for as good and friendly as Tia had become, her time in the world would soon run out. The more lives she saved, the more wyverns she birthed, the more dreams she made -- the more mana she consumed from the quasiplanar pool. Just like the greedy Wishmongers and the flagrant Rulebreakers of Ages Past, the Seers were not long for the world.

“Sadly, the wyverns predicted magic would end within a few centuries and all of Tia's work would be unravel and crumble to true ash.”

“Oh, no! How could the project continue without magic?”

** Part 4: Drake the Code-Breaker
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: part-4-drake-the-code-breaker
   :END:
“While Tia's wyverns patrolled the countryside and she ruminated in the deep delving, Drake worked on another project. Her triumphs over the dodecade taught him a valuable lesson. He had been too arrogant in taking on ambitious goals alone. He had single-mindedly pursued them to the point of cold utilitarianism. She proved that intellectual agency, curiosity, creativity, and collaboration were required to do the requisite work of detecting disease and relieving suffering.

“Praise Anab!”

“Drake knew the world wouldn't be able to cast healing spells of restoration like the Pious of Ages Past. In Tia's absence, he sought to create a new class of medics with his knowledge, skill and abilities.

“Remember, Drake could see at a level so small he could observe our indivisible units. He started recording the patterns that make us unique. He read through an ancient but unwieldy language encoded into the very fiber of our being. He decoded the basic quartenary assembly language that formed triplet units of codons. These translated into about twenty different basic building blocks that served all of the biological functions of humankind. He tinkered with and rewrote these sequences and supplied the small cells with various bio-alchemical sugar moieties, methylating, and alkylating agents. He tweaked the machinery that powered us.

“Drake could sense the quivering of his muscle fibrils and coordinate his movements perfectly. He could move and act in such minutely precise ways that he could continue his experiments well into his old age. He created a new condensed biocode; he created the metahumans. This new race would be capable of detecting disease and death to act as his minions in the world. They would record the manifest of disease and were gifted with racial abilities to comprehend reality on a single facet of the glittering crystal that was within his realm of powers as a Seer of Life and Death.

“When he died, the metahumans continued to the document and interpret of the physiology of life and the pathology of death. Where once the worlds most feared and vilified necromancer and his dracolich were the scourge of the lands, thousands of years later, they leave us a legacy of life. To study medicine, Iatromancy, is the most sacred duty born from the horrors of profane times. Forever do we bear the mark of his making.”

--------------

“That's your story on the racial ability of the metas? I get it, kind of. But us halflings got the shaft of the wheat! The elves and dwarves got the ears and beard of the seed.” Osler began to tick off on his fingers. Goblinoids have different types of enhanced sight. Elves have enhanced hearing. Dwarves have tremorsense with enhanced touch. How does the ability of not getting lost or catching fishes allow us to detect death?”

“Yes, it seems rather underwhelming, does it not? In any case, it is said that Drake's original tower lies just over these hills in the well of south two.” Damien waved dramatically. Glowing green and purple curtains of Aurora Iatropis flickered in ribbons across the night sky.

“That is where we seek the True and Final answer for how to defeat Morbidity and Mortality. Stick to your lessons, ask the right questions, and seek the noble answers. One day you may work with the medics and magics.”

******* Yes, and thank you for your suggestions!

I have been listening to the Writing Excuses podcast (I think either alexanderwales or eneaz pointed me to it originally) and I've been worldbuilding a D&D/Shadowrun-styled 'rational' setting. This was my 'fairy tale within a fantasy tale' prelude that isn't really connected to the main plot, but it emphasizes the story's future focus on 'eliminate suffering and deplete morbidity' over the necromancer's misled notion of 'defeat mortality.'

I combined the Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant and the Friendship is Optimal/Bluer Shade of White FAI rationalist tropes, but my version turned into more of a Buddhist introspective on the concept of dukkha-suffering. While I like the ending of Part 3, I struggled with the relevance of Part 4 for the 'Buggy Matrix' contest. Ultimately I decided to continue to write the pieces of the story I want to write and I can tweak Part 4 later on when I figure out how to write the "biotech singularity" concept a little better.

My only critique is that the initial description in the first two paragraphs is clunky, and the level of detail just feels out of place in a short story where those details won't be used later. If the goal is to draw attention to the humanity of the character, I would either disperse it a bit while setting the stage (show, don't tell), or just scale the descriptions back and use another approach (perhaps more dialogue).

** *SIMites*

/322 words/

It had started out as a failsafe.

A way of keeping things running smoothly.

Continuity was important. Allowing interactions to proceed with minimal disturbance. No one wanted to experience lag when interacting with their fellow SIMites. The premise had started off innocently enough. Should a load-imbalance cause some people to be rendered with less fidelity than would allow full consciousness, switch their processing over to simple scripts which would allow the interaction to continue while the imbalance was corrected.

Once full processing has been restored, merge the results of the script interaction into the subjects memory. Even in meatspace, people's memories are not the perfect record they think they are. Easily changeable. Easily malleable. The conscious SIMite continues without ever knowing about their brief period of consciouslessness.

The idea was simple. The execution, to borrow a meatspace metaphor, was bloody.

Load balancing kicked in when a solar flare knocked out most of the northern hemisphere's processing power. Conscious SIMites were zipped and shipped to available servers, while interactions shifted to the AI scripts. The servers in the southern hemisphere began to buckle under the sheer weight of a trillion frozen consciousnesses being sent for backup simultaneously. The southern servers began the automated load-balancing process of zipping and shipping their population of SIMites.

No one is entirely sure how it happened.

No one is entirely sure who was affected.

After the solar storm settled, and full server availability had been restored, it became clear that some SIMites had started acting "strangely". I noticed that people answered my questions with non-sequitors, became evasive when I pushed certain points, and seemed ignorant of things discussed only minutes before. I can't prove it, but I think that at some point during the meltdown, AI scripts overwrote SIMites.

I don't know whether the people I'm interacting with are conscious, or scripted.

I don't know whether I'm the only conscious SIMite left.

I don't know whether I'm conscious.

** Ok Reddit, I'm posting this thread because I've got a mystery that needs solving. Something super weird dropped into my inbox today. I almost missed it but at the top of the message it says "sent 2 years ago." I've got a ton of messages, the latest being only an hour ago, yet they're all below this one. I'm almost completely confident the message is from my childhood friend, Joan, who is a master class troll, but how did she do it? Is there some bug in Reddit?

edit: Ok since nobody has replied to this thread yet, I thought I'd offer some incentive. I just got another message from Joan (this one from 9 months ago) and it seems like its forming a kind of story. I'm going to show the first message and if someone can figure this out I'll post more!

Just a little note before I post it though, the reason I know its from Joan is that its written in a language that we geeky outcasts created together in high school. But this means I have to translate, and there might be some weirdness I'll need to point out. Anyway here it is:

“The year two thousand and thirteen Anno Domini. The year of humanity's ultimate triumph over reality. Cell by cell every neuron fell to their silicon replacement. The rushing tide swept over us all by will or by force.

I still remember.

I entered a building one day that year with a head full of carbon. I watched the winter's snow fall outside. I left with a speck of tech stuck in my head.

I entered another building another day that year with a head full of silicon. I watched the summer's sun cast shadows outside. I did not leave.

I looked around the simulation I was then a part of. An infinite white expanse. It was time to see what I could do with such power.

I willed a chair into existence. I sat down. My mind raced through a microscopic fragment of the possibilities that near-infinite freedom afforded. I chose one. I went to Reddit.

I then dicked around on my computer for the next 224 years.

224 years.

That was bliss.

[note: that sentence could also be translated "That matched the joy of playing Pokemon" but that seemed less appropriate].”

edit2: Ok, still no replies in this thread? Lucky for you lot, I'm feeling generous, here's what the second message says:

“The hell what! [note: this is in the wrong order in the original, apparently Joan is getting rusty].

I am a god. A god shall not be defied. If a god wills a website to scroll down then the site will obey. But the sites have arose in unison against me, choosing to deprive me of the sweet nectar of their content.

Its just... odd. Everything else works perfectly fine for me. I even downloaded a mouse with a scroll wheel like the pre-Upload reenactors use and that worked.

I searched the entire internet and, well, nothing. I made a post on another website and nobody else had any issue. That alone almost makes me feel... lonely. Although that could also be the 225 years (or was it 224?) of blissful near-isolation too.”

Well, looks like I'm not the only one with tech issues heh.

edit3: hmm, this post is still on the frontage page of this subreddit right now, but still no reply. Slow day? Anyway, I'm starving so I have to go eat lunch, I'll be back later.

edit4: Ok, well, I'm back and I have two new messages (these from 5 months ago and 6 months ago). There's some oddness to these ones though, I think Joan is punishing me for pointing out the mistake in the last one cause these two have significantly more errors. I decided to just correct them for you, here's the first one:

“I've notified as many people as I can. Hopefully the problem is in good hands. I'm afraid I have to rely on trust [note: not sure if its that or “I'm afraid of relying on trust”]. I'm having trouble even writing this down. Body movement-type interaction is still fairly solid, so I've had to resort to using a keyboard like old times. But 224 years have done a number on my muscle memory. And I wasn't even a fast typer to begin with. Unlike my dear friend Joan.

Sometimes I would swear she could type faster than I could think. At least till the cancer forced her to become bed ridden. All these years and it still haunts me remembering it progress. Everyday a little less hope, every day her body slipped a little more from her control. I hate being melodramatic, but I think I'm beginning to understand how she may have felt.

Death may have taken her away from us, but at least we've had our vengeance against it, haven't we?”

You have a sick sense of humour, Joan. Never change!

Anyway, this time I'm holding the second message hostage only until someone just comments at all. You don't even have to attempt an answer!

edit5: Ok I've given up threatening you trolls, I'm just going to post the messages as I get them. I still don't get how a post that's done this well in this subreddit is not getting comments even with trolling, but oh well. Here's the other message:

“An avatar-to-avatar meeting. I can't remember the last time I had one of these. All these years and I still had the exact same body as the day I popped. X¥Z came to the meeting with one of those trendy dragon avatars. It glowed a radiant, bright gold. I still don't quite understand how their brains aren't overwhelmed with the phantom sensations and the vast rewiring necessary to simply operate the new body, but I suppose...[note: I couldn't understand the rest of this sentence]. I guess one must sacrifice for the Glory of Fashion. [note: this sentence was badly mangled, I'm not sure if it was intended to sound as sarcastic as I translated it].

X¥Z's voice clashed with its body. It was calm and measured, reminding me of Joan's. 'In order for your mind to speak with your world, you need an interpreter. In the pre-Upload days we created the Interpreter program so that the computer would understand the meaning of the simulated patterns of firing neurons that is your brain. I was the head of that team. I remember the rush, the never ending lines of code needed to create something that would function for an eternity. We've simulated so many billions for 224 years and there's never been a problem. Until you. The specific patterns of the way your neurons fire has changed over the years in a way that the computer is having trouble understanding.

'Well could you... I dunno, manually override it somehow?'

'I'm sure you know well how detested overriding mental interaction sovereignty is. Even those convicted of attempting AI aren't tampered with more than the relatively minor prevention restrictions that were set up pre-Upload. Its possible doing this would even require an Outside override. I don't believe this has ever been attempted. And the technical nuances aside, this is really a political issue. To fix this it would require, well, the politicians to act.'

'Oh my, its /that/ bad?'

'Yes, I'm afraid so.'

'So what's the worst case we're looking at?'

The glow of X¥Z's body dimmed.

'In the worst case, you're looking at the eternal void. If the right combination of factors confluence before we've had time to prevent this, the computer could start radically misinterpreting which may lead to certain defaulting and error-catching behaviours. This may include entering void space domain and rapid simulation speeds orders of magnitude faster than Standard Rate. Due to the time acceleration, suicide may be the only option to prevent this from occurring. However, by that point, the computer will likely not be able to interpret well enough to satisfy the strict rules on suicide. You'd have to choose earlier.'

[note: there's a paragraph here that is so completely out of order I couldn't translate it]

I gave a half-hearted smile.

'Well, umm, t-thank you for informing me and g-good luck. B-bye.

I shifted domain to my room. The smile left my face. Tears rolled from my eyes. A possible eon of hell or the guarantee of an eternity of nothing. Death's sweet beckoning for my companionship was alluring.

But death will die alone, waiting for me.”

Jeez, this is getting scary. I've never told /anyone/ this before, not even Joan, but I actually still have a stuffed toy salamander from when I was 5 that I still use when I get scared. I'm holding on tight, haha!

edit6: I realized there's a pattern in the scrambled paragraph from the last message. I translated the first sentence, will post when I have the rest.

edit7: “'What would that actually mean for me, though? What would be happening in my head?'

'It may result in massive psychological damage. You are likely to develop severe psychosis. Symptoms include constant hallucinations of all the senses. Periods of catatonia becoming common place. Thoughts that are delusional and paranoid. Your speech may become a word salad, an incoherent mess to both others and, possibly, yourself. Additionally, there is likely to be some form of impairment to your memory.'

I held on tight to my salamander.”
