** I'll probably drop to posting this in this sub maybe once a month soon, but right now I'm still in the early desperately-fishing-for-feedback phase, so it's probably okay to be a little shameless.

I'm still finding my feet and not on a proper schedule yet, and looking for ways to maybe tweak the story to improve reader retention. I'm particularly thinking of maybe cutting the first half of the prologue and dispersing the information elsewhere, but I'm not sure it's a good idea or if there are actually even any problems with it. I'm also not sure if the general slow story pace is good for the format, or how I could improve on that if it is. Vagueness vs over-explanation is another thing I've been considering.

If anyone is following, let me know your thoughts! Writing traditional mystery is tough.

** Plenty to chew on here. I'll hold off on speculation but I think I'm putting a few things together.

Sidney and Sasha work together pretty well, both in the literal sense and that I enjoy reading about their interaction.

Sasha is 2/2 for disappointing food or drink. Get her something tasty, she's working hard!

For what to cut from the prologue, I don't know if the description of Edward is needed in that much detail right off the bat. It might work better as something we get in-between one of the main arcs. I was interested as I originally read the passage, but I think I would have cared more about it if I'd already spent some time with Sasha. Also, I think the bit at the end of Mimic's Prayer (1) works better if you are wondering why Sasha is feeling that way instead of having a decent idea based on Edward's description.

Thank you for the Glossary. It's hard to keep track of what I don't know about the setting because they haven't been revealed yet and what I just missed, so the extra context is very helpful.

Few typos:

#+begin_quote
  alongside a statue of a man holding up *a spears*

  contact with her *my* virtue of my position

  April 22nd, 873.
#+end_quote

(That's from Mimic's Prayer (1). Glossary says Summer Revolution ended in 878, and Michelle was murdered five years after the armistice. I think that's supposed to be 883).

And I'm not sure if this last one is a mistake or not but

#+begin_quote
  where the young swore the First Oath and became full citizens.
#+end_quote

Are they not swearing the full Five Oaths to become full citizens?

*** I'm glad you liked the chapter! This one was very dialogue heavy, so I was concerned it might be a bit weak.

Thanks for your feedback! I'll take that into consideration if I end up reworking it. A lot of people have told me they were confused and put off by the basic narrative setup originally, so I probably overcompensated for trying to establish very firmly 1) the main mystery, and 2) the protagonists relationship with it. I'd agree it's a bit clunky and sacrifices some mystique at this point.

By far the biggest challenge for me in writing this story so far has just been the management of exposition, which is worsened in some respects by the unconventional setting. I feel like I'm a poor judge at times at what's a good pace to reveal foundational information to the reader, and am constantly juggling the concern of making sure things make sense with keeping people intrigued.

Oh, welp, those are screwups on both counts. The first is just a standard typo, and the second is a result of me incorporating some elements from an earlier draft into this version of the text without double-checking that all the terminology is up to date.

Thanks for catching them! If I get enough readers of this story that I feel like it matters - so far it feels like it might be a bit too out there to gain much momentum - I'm planning to set up a page where I document all my "logic errors" like this and how I've corrected them, since this stuff is so important in a hard mystery and I'd want it to feel fair.
