** By the same author, I would instead recommend /The Arithmancer/, which (along with the ongoing sequel) is the most satisfying Hermione-centric story I've read. Being a mathematical prodigy is certainly useful, but doesn't solve all problems; the setting and characters hang together beautifully.

**** Agreed on all counts!

For a slightly faster pace, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][starfox5]] is notable for very well-written depictions of a wizarding civil war:

- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][/The Dark Lord Never Died/]] (complete), Malfoy faked Voldemort's survival and used /1984/ as a checklist. Hermione is a squad leader of the Special Police, and lead investigator into corruption in the 'mudblood rescue squad'...
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][/Divided and Entwined/]] (ongoing), Hermione is not the only muggle-born to have read history - and the writing on the wall. A three-sided civil war ensues, with people making hard decisions... or easy but bad ones. If you only read one, read this - there's a clear technical improvement in the writing, and arguably in characterisation.

Hmm, maybe I'm just a sucker for reluctant-but-resolved Dumbledore, and competent Hermione...

***** Thanks for the recommendations. I found The Dark Lord Never Died's resolution to be a bit unsatisfying [[#s][Ending spoilers]]

But I've found Divided and Entwined to be a dramatic improvement, and thoroughly engaging so far, with excellent use of viewpoint characters.

** I stopped partway through the first chapter. If Hogwards had the kind of drastic security measures Dumbledore jumps on, the plot would have never progressed to the point that Harry could get into the Chamber of Secrets, so the fic's premise is incoherent.

*** Just pretend that the fic's premise is that, after Harry kills the Basilisk, every authority figure is replaced with a reasonable doppelganger and they manage to solve almost every problem in the HP-verse within a few weeks.

** An interesting read, though I find it a bit contrived when a fanfic tries to solve every problem from the 7 books in just a few chapters.

I also second the recommendation on The Arithmancer from the same author, though, as others have pointed out, it is somewhat slow paced.

** It's a fun idea, but what's killing it for me so far is that I've read two chapters, and there still doesn't seem to be a central conflict. Problems arise and get solved in a few paragraphs. There's no tension.
