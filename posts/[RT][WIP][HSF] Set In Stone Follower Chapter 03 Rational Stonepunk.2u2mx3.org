****** Ok, after the back story I thought albert was going to be some kind of deity for this planet. Super Powerful being in the sky and all that. I was surprised he actually has an active influence on politics / law enforcement.

Are you planning to keep a schedule of releasing chapters or will the just be released whenever you finish them?

******* I am... not so good at schedules when writing. It's a safe bet that there will be at least one update per week, but I cannot say what day those updates will fall on.

******** Did you have the first few chapters already written as a proof of concept that you are now posting every two days, or is it because the introduction is easy to write quickly?

********* No. I have a story outline written, and write and post chapters as I go. I have no prewritten content. I write it, read over it, use the find function to detect a few errors that I KNOW I make, and then post it. If you follow the story and get the email version, it's a first draft. After a few responses, and a couple further read-throughs by me at intervals over time, it becomes a second draft.
