Pondering a game's magic system based on old-school golden bough laws: contagion, association, similarity, polarity, True Names. Has anyone seen/read any rational media that features these?


** [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] is by the same author as Worm, and is in a similar 'rational-adjacent' place. At the very least it has excellent worldbuilding, and plays a lot with its magic system.

*** The ending fell a bit flat for me. I did love the magic system though.

** [[https://www.amazon.com/Master-Five-Magics-Lyndon-Hardy/dp/0345334256]] has reasonably well thought out magic systems that include some traditional staples, and which also include rational-ish societal integrations. I'm not sure the plot or most characters would qualify as rational.

** If I don't remember badly that was how Ursula K. Le Guin's "A Wizard of Earthsea" magic tended to work. Especially the True Names part. That said, it wasn't exactly rational maybe but I don't remember any major plot problems or contrivances in it either - the first novel of the cycle, at least. I think it sort of got lost after that, but it's good that it also works well as a stand-alone story.

** Charles Stross' The Laundry Files series has smart characters and heavily features all those.

*** I don't know that they've done true names, unless you count the brute force portal work in the first book. They have had names/descriptors as an un-initalized pointer at one point, but that because of its computation ~= magic ~= computable theme. That said all the rest is there and applied in ways to amuse anyone of a technical bent.

**** I'd argue that the whole Teapot/Eater of Souls ritual is a true name invocation, but otherwise I'll concede the point.
